1, disappointed . This restaurant has done a nose dive in the past few years . Tonight I tried to order chicken fingers and they could n't figure out how to cook them . So I had to order something else . Nachos were a safe bet right ? Wrong the cheese whiz nachos were horrible . I wo n't be coming back here again .
1,"Astonished ! Been eating their delivered pizzas for 8 yrs , Good pies~ but this time they made a mistake and wrote down pick up . Hour later I called , got brash woman ( owner ! ) Who told me it was my mistake~ I asked if they would deliver , but hoped for a fresh pie~ whoa -  not ! \nWhen I asked how we could compromise , she said she was deleting the order . Well ok I guess.\nI even called back to speak with manager ( that 's how I figured out she was owner ) and she  did n't care about my 8 yrs of loyalty.\n\nSad for them , she probably wonders why her little junky restaurant is not  successful~ and I 'll tell a hundred Mt holly people about it because communities do n't support business owners who do this ~ all of this over a 12 dollar pizza , pretty pathetic huh ? \nKelly . Mt Holly , NC"
1,"The room is luxurious and clean but the service .... THUMBS DOWN ! Upon arriving , the staff seem friendly and courteous . Unfortunately they did n't have our reservation which we booked a week in advance with the confirmation number . The person helping us said \ '' hold on\ '' and went to the back . She left us outside for LITERALLY 30 minutes until I went to another attendant and asked what was going on . That person went on the back to check and disappeared . We literally spent 2 hours there while no one was  helping us . Finally after getting a little crazy someone recognized that we needed to be help . They told us there was a mix up on the reservation but they have it now.\n\nI told them that they made us wait for 2 hours and they kept on apologizing . They said all they had for the night was a king size bed . I was like what ? ? ? I 'm with another person ... you ca n't give us a king size bed . Finally after another hour they found us a doubled bed room . They kept on apologizing for the inconvenience but did n't give no kind of compensation for all the trouble . It was such a headache ! I hate people who apologize after they know they caused you so much trouble in the first place . If they  cared they could 've came and helped us.\n\nAnyway ... if your looking for a luxurious hotel , just to to the Venetian . It 's the same floor plan and its a bit bigger !"
1,"I use to like Barrows but this location has TERRIBLE service . I have been there twice , both times received unfriendly service . Second visit received the wrong order ( twice ) and was actually asked , 'Well do you want it ? ' . Was also charged the wrong amount . No concern or correction from staff of their careless mistakes . Pizza was as greasy as possible with no flavor . Will not be returning ."
1,"Do not order to-go from this place . I was told it would take 35-45 minutes for delivery , but after an hour I called to check on my order and was given a \ '' sorry , he just headed out.\ '' Another half hour later I had to call and cancel my order because I could not wait anymore . I was out on hold 3 times . Poor service and it sounded as if the employees were clueless on what to do . I got no explanation as to why it took so long . Disappointed ."
1,This place SUCKS ! NO CUSTOMER SERVICE ! payed for a suite with a king bed and they give me a room with 2 queen beds ! After try to up sell me at check in ! Classic !
1,I went to the new location on tropical . We have been waiting for this burger place to open . We went last night and it was packed . Our onions rings were soggy and so was our burgers . My burger was still slightly pink and not cooked all the way through . It was pricey and i will not go back . The service there was bad but they were so busy . My soda had only carbonation and no dr pepper .  dissapointed
1,"Food was cold when I got it . Both my husband and I found bone and hard chunks of fat in the hot link , my husband almost broke his tooth . We are true BBQ fans and tried every side and every meat ... Mediocre at best . After eating at some of the best BBQ places in the south such as Franklin BBQ and salt lick etc . it ranks 2 stars below famous Dave 's which I consider decent but still only mediocre BBQ . Would not return . Will try another restaurant in container park next time ."
1,"Just walked out . We went in and sat at the counter directly in front of the woman bartender . She never acknowledged us . We waited a few minutes , giving her time to finish what she was doing . At this point another couple entered and were immediately greeted and served . We continued to sit , figuring we get served . Wrong ! ! ! In fact two others came in , were greeted and served . A second server came in and began assisting others , walking by us several times . We decided to leave and as we did the female bartender said , \ '' Thanks for coming in\ '' . Serious lack of customer service . Went around the corner to The Vig . Excellent"
1,"Horrible customer service at this location . Ordered coffee and donuts and when clarifying order was correct the cashier was  demeaning . I had previously purchased coffee at this location where the order was wrong so I wanted to assure they had the order listed correctly . The donuts served were stale ; one was hard as a rock ! When commenting on this to our drive-through attendant she was anything but helpful . While hitting the hard donut against the steering wheel to show how hard/stale it was she said oh it should n't be that hard yet did not offer a refund , a different option , or even an apology . We left quite annoyed and will not be retuning . If you want a good cup of coffee and decent customer service , go to the Starbucks in this plaza instead , they have always been wonderful !"
1,"Disappointing . . .we had high hopes for this place , but we wo n't be back . Service was incredible slow -- 20 minutes to take a drink order . We waited for a long time to get our food ( the server told us they were feeling \ '' flustered\ '' in the kitchen . Our appetizer arrived at the same time as our main dish . The teriyaki chicken was inedible , dry and bland . Spring rolls had no flavor . The fried rice was greasy and unappetizing . Total disappointment ."
1,"Worst ribs ever . I think my ribs had been sitting around for days . It was like \ '' rib jerky\ '' . You know , dehydrated and leathery.\n\nThe brisket was rubbery and flavorless . kind of the same stuff you would expect boiled from an English Pub . the brisket also had a sitting-around-for-days vibe . I guess Dickey 's believes that BBQ sauce will cure bad cooking.\n\none side we had was the jalapeno beans . these were spectacularly awesome . best beans ever . it 's not cut up pieces of peppers on top of beans . rather , the jalapenos have been sauced and the beans have been infused with the mouth watering essence of the peppers.\n\nThe ' Q could n't stand on its own . it was just another Dickey 's food that went nowhere without BBQ sauce.\n\nThe sauces are standard issue , run of the mill , middle of the road , forgettable.\n\nSkip this place ."
1,"The food is not worthy the money for brunch .  limited seafood , only small shrimp . Cost $ 81 for 2 people . Maybe better for dinner , or I 'm not a steak/bacon/desert guy .  long queue outside , but many empty tables inside . I believe the buffet in San Diego where I live in is with similar quality but cost only $ 15 per person for lunch ."
1,"Review is for customer service , not for actual car wash ( cuz that 's pretty std and can you  mess that up ) .\n\nIf you like wheeling and dealing like in a 3rd world country street market for your car wash services , then this is the place for you . I disliked the \ '' what do you want , what would you like , we 'll cut you a deal\ '' statements and their back and forth , etc . The site mgr Chris definitely had that shark like attitude , he should work for a 1980s car dealership .  bad taste in my mouth ."
1,"Other than the taste of the food everything is HORRIBLE in Bombay Grill . There are couple waiters there who are  rude and racists . I will only write about my last experience there . In my last visit the waiter almost threw the menu on our table . He asked our orders in a  rude manner , grabbed our plates without asking us wether we have finished or not ( and obviously we were not finished and there were plenty of foods still sitting in our plates ) . Maybe the rudest thing that he did was that after returning our checks , he stood in front of our table to get them back while we were writing him tips and signing the receipts . Other than that , we also ordered two appetizers which came after the main dishes ! Also , one of our main dishes came substantially later than the other ones . The only good thing about the restaurant is that the food still tastes good . But a good restaurant is not only about the taste of the food . It is about having a good experience . \n\n All in all , I can tell that this business can not survive with its current horrible service and I will never ever go there unless things change there . There are other good places in the town to dine in ."
1,"TWO WORDS : Overhyped and overpriced ! \n\nI swear we paid $ 14 for a simple ice blended hot chocolate ! No joke , it WAS good . However , not at all worth $ 14 . I think I 'd be just as satisfied ordering a $ 4 Cappucino Blast at Baskin Robbins , despite the calories.\n\nI 'll come back and give their food a try but next time , I 'll just make my own froyo at home ."
1,"I dont mind other locations , but this location on this particular night sucked huevos.\nI dont find the need to ever go back . \nTOTAL LATE NIGHT BUZZKILL ."
1,"Sorry , but for average service , okay ( not special ) environment ... just NOT worth the exorbitanant prices ! ! I 'm not a price complainer , but these are 'Nobu-gettin-my-culo-kissed ' prices ! ! Lots of midwesterny/ work-conferencey groups , obviously charging it on the company expense acct . Makes sense that they spin this menu as 'family style'-as a couple it definitely was not a value . How I wish we had gone elsewhere ! Sometimes lackluster offerings can be made up for w exceptional service-let 's just say that was n't the case . Food was decent-but absolutley not worth it money-wise ( i hate being made to even consider cost that way about an 'upscale ' spot ) .\nSold as sexy & high end , but  fails to deliver.\nStep 1 : Turn around , and work up an even bigger appetite making your way to Aria.\nStep 2 : Find your way to Julian Serranos ! \nStep 3 : Thank me after you 're done eating ."
1,"OUT OF BAGELS AT 7:30 am ? And you are a bagel store . \nHow does this happen ? \nDo not be surprised when you go out of business . \n\nThen we drove to the Eastern avenue location and the same thing , out of bagels at 8 am\u2049Einstein Bagel is not genius at all ... Named after a genius\nGet you shit together not so smart bagel establishment that ran out of EFFING bagels , WHO BAGEL SHOP RUNS OUT OF BAGELS AT 7:30 am\nErrrrrr.\n\n\nDec . 29th out of bagels at 12 noon ? ! ! ! ! \nWhat on earth is your problem ?"
1,"So I 'd love to write a great review but I 'm elsewhere eating dinner and drinking beers . Why ? Because my friend and I ( both women ) could not justify paying a $ 5 cover to see a fight that 1 . We could careless about . 2 . Could see up the street for free 3 . Could have parked in the parking lot and watched . So , sorry to say we will be spending our money and tipping well here at Gordon Biersch ."
1,"My consultant was Debbie . She brought me about six dresses and then she disappeared for the rest of the time we were there . I 'm assuming this happened because I said that I was n't sure I was buying anything quite yet , therefore she would n't get a sale . Regardless of if you are buying a dress or not , you should get the one on one attention . Anyway , my mom had to assist me in and out of all the dresses and figure out how to pin them to fit me the right way . She never once came back to retrieve the dresses and my mom had to clear out the dressing room in order for there to be room again . My aunt had to go searching for more dresses for me to try on . Also , the overall ambience of the store is completely outdated . Pink walls and mint green carpet with stains on it is not a pleasant aesthetic to any room . The bathroom was disgusting and the soap was out so we had to use hand sanitizer instead . I went to a different bridal shop after this and my experience was completely opposite making me realize just have awful my experience at David 's bridal was . DO NOT GO HERE ."
1,"First of all let me say that this McDonalds does n't have a sign in their drive thru stating that they charge for Ranch . \nSecond of all customer service sucks here . I know that you ca n't expect them to treat super great but at least have respect . The stupid cashier at the 2nd window was Rude about me asking for ranch then got her manager which was n't that nice either.\nThird of all when I get home , my order is missing ! I was missing one of our burgers . \nThen I try to call them but no answer . Why do they have a phone if they wo n't answer ? So guess what store # 18966 I call the 800 number and did a complaint . Hope you learn to have respect , I 'm not asking for u to all happy and jolly JUST RESPECT ! \nForgot to mention that my husband 's fries where half way full ! What 's wrong with them !"
1,"I used to love this place but the quality has gone so downhill over the past few years . They 've substituted unique dishes with cheap , low quality ingredients . It seems they stopped caring circa 2007 ."
1,"NEVER stay at the hotel . The casino looks clean , friendly and laid back -- go there , do n't stay there . \n\n After staying in my room ( the non-smoking room ) for 15 minutes I got a horrible migraine . Again , thought food would help . As soon as I went outside , no more migraine . Came back later to my room , INSTANT headache . Okay , something here I am having a reaction to . \n\nSo we decided to cut our stay short . That is when the drama began . Apparently if you book online you \ '' prepay\ '' for the entire time so that means they refuse to refund your money because you paid on the web . So my options are 1 ) pay for 2 hotel rooms for my entire stay or 2 ) get enough headaches to land me in the hospital . We were prepared to pay for an extra night we could not use but to be accountable for all 5 nights seems a bit much . \n\nMy biggest problem besides deciding to deal with the killer headaches was the staff . They were  unhelpful and rude . The manager was actually told by the desk associate , Julie , that we wanted to leave because we were upset with our wi-fi charges .  ? Do I need a doctor 's note to be believed ? So no offers to move rooms , no offers to refund the extra days just staff that decided the best way to handle guests was to push back , bully and wear the customer down . \n\nGood times ."
1,"Crappy service . From the hostess to the waiter , they did n't seem to care . Seemed  understaffed . Took 40 minutes to get food and had barely six tables worth of customers in the whole place . Almost left . Wrong drinks . Had to chase someone down to get anything . Food below average . I get it 's a coffee shop so was n't expecting anything spectacular but this is pretty bad . Couple of dry patty melts , runny scrambled eggs that were a little tougher than is normal . Only thing that was somewhat edible was the club sandwich . Cashier asked how our meal was told her it was bad and about how we were about to leave before food arrived . She said .... I 'm sorry and will let management know ... No wait that was n't it . At least that would have been some consolation . She said ... Oh ... And nothing else . Lol ya they just do n't give a crap . Go somewhere else"
1,"I stopped here after dropping off a package at the post office , which was next door and let me tell you ... This place is a RIP OFF ! I got a single scoop of vanilla ice cream on a regular cone and paid $ 3.60 ! That 's outrageous ! That 'll be the first and LAST time I 'll be getting ice cream from there ."
1,I was on vacation at a cabin in WI with my boyfriend . We stopped in Madison for the day and stopped in at Espresso Royale to warm up and use the internet . I had what was hands down the worst hot chocolate I have ever had . It did n't even taste like chocolate . It was  light too . Maybe they forgot the chocolate ? It tasted like nothing .  horrible . My boyfriend 's latte was mediocre at best . I generally prefer to avoid the national coffee chains but in this case I  wish I had gone to Starbucks .
1,"whole foods whole paycheck wholly sh $ t i am sorry there prices are rediculous the only reason i went there is because since moving here from a  foody town certain products are nearly impossible to find and they do have them but you will pay , my search today was mushroms not button but chantrel/oyster/ect i was going to get every thing on my list but when i saw shallots at 4.95 a lb i bought my shrooms and split the i hit frys , shallots 2.49 a lb and of course theres always trader joes"
1,"Thirty minute wait just to be told that we 'd have to wait an hour or two to get a car . Classy way to run a car rental business , with a garage completely full of cars ."
1,"Found dark long hair on bath room floor , I am blonde . Stayed here . Part of World Wide Vacations , paid 50 for 2 nights and had to set through a 120 minute sales pitch . Not worth it . I would have rather paid 100 for 2 nights and stayed someplace else ."
1,The lady at the desk was rude . I brought my three boys there as soon as we walked in the girl at the desk said the boys were to small even before they were measured . I said no all of them are over 48 '' . Then she measured all of them and they were all over 48 '' . Then she said it 's going to be like a hour and a half . Their were only 10 cars in the parking lot . Then she said pole position would be better for the kids . I guess they do n't need the money that I was going to spend . Which would have been like two hundred dollars . I would have giving them no stars if I could . Just go to pole position that 's what the girl at the desk says .
1,Horrible experience . They already added tips in your bill and did not tell u ! ! \n\nThe waiter saw you writing tips on the\n check\uff0c but they did not tell u they already charged . u are like an idiot in their eyes . We paid tips twice ! How shame on them ! ! \n\nNever come again .
1,The food was just OK but over priced . The service or the lack there of was enough for us to never go back . It is clear that its management has zero knowledge and experience in customer service .
1,Apple at San Tan village had the absolute worst customer service I 've ever experienced at a apple store . \ '' Ben\ '' in particular was so rude to me for no reason . My guess is he hates his job . I spoke with a manager but she had no empathy and it was like talking to a wall . I will never come back to this location . They do n't care about customer relationships nor do they value their customers
1,"Just an FYI for those who might have purchased a Amazonlocal coupon for this dump ... I ordered my food to take out and was about to pay the difference when the guy taking my order said they do not take the coupon . He was mumbling something about letting people know . OK , so now I paid $ 10 and i can not get what I was promised , so he had some other guy who walked in , who apparently worked there , call the owner . Well , same story ... they will not accept the coupon . From what he said , Amazonlocal was not depositing whatever percentages they owed from the promotional sales . Luckily , I was able to get a refund from Amazonlocal . Those who have purchased a voucher for this place , do n't even bother to order , just get a refund ! Also , they call themselves \ '' President 's Pizza\ '' , as well .... I have seen another Amazonlocal voucher for this place as well but never purchased it ( Thank Goodness ! ) Get your refund ! ! ! ! By the way , for all you die hards , perhaps the food is decent , which is why , to be fair i have not rated it , but most of the salad items are not even available .... Hmmm ... False advertising on both counts , here ? ! ?"
1,"I had looked forward to visiting the Inglot store during my next visit to Las Vegas . I told my girl friends about the system and they were excited also . We took a cab from our hotel specifically to go the mall for this store . Well I ca n't say the customer service was bad , because the young lady in the store around noon on 6/25/14 did not give any . She basically gave me a tray and told me to pick some colors . No help with coordinating a palette of colors . I finally walked out . I will continue to order online or wait until my next trip to Chicago ."
1,"Came here for lunch while staying at the Venetian . Three of the four of us who at here had upset stomachs afterward . I guess you can try your luck , though ."
1,"If you want slow service ? this is the place , only two people working on the day before thanksgiving  ? ? ? What is wrong with you people ? You have people waiting in line for over one hour ! Not cool , at all ."
1,"Disgusting . Left all choices up to the chef . Bleach-flavored cucumber amuse bouche . Black been soup was gritty and hard . Foie gras sorbet was single worst tasting thing ever , even more than durian . Entr\u00e9e was an entire plate of fried sweetbreads . Complained and they replaced it with sand-filled escargot . Only barely edible dessert in group was bland creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e . \n\nTerrible service from rude waiter who abandoned table after 15 minutes - without a replacement . \n\nJust visiting the Phoenix area and this single restaurant was such a negative experience that it has led to canceling reservations at other \ '' top rated\ '' places during the trip ."
1,"I first went in to Caballero 's when I was recently out of work and trying to obtain a new serving job . I took a menu with a card for a free appetizer home with me . Perhaps it was because they just opened but I will not be returning . Was not busy at all and yet had to wait before someone acknowledged me . Left me  cold , on top of it my appetizer was not all that great . I am only glad I did n't pay for it ."
1,"Was n't impressed at all ! If you are going to name yourself arrogant butcher you better make a good steak ..... and they did n't , sadly . It was overbooked even after explaining exactly how we wanted it . Bread was hard and cold . Wine took forever to get to us . The manager did comp us the glasses of wine that took so long which was nice . I would say only go for the atmosphere and the drinks ! Not the service or food"
1,In one word terrible . In summary no idea how they can call themselves a Brazilian steakhouse . Both meat service and waiter service almost non existent . My first clue should have been how empty it was for dinner . Meats were fatty and chewy . They seemed offended if you asked for something out of their serving order . If you have ever been to Fogo or Texas de Brazil you will leave here disappointed .
1,We ordered this about a year ago shortly after they first opened . Overall the pizza was decent but seemed almost like an at home frozen throw it in the oven style and what  killed it was using CANNED MUSHROOMS ! We will never go again due to our favorite topping coming out of a can ...
1,"I 'd give Botero zero stars if I could . Astoundingly poor service , with astoundingly outrageously priced food . We were teased with the daily special of Dover Sole only to find it was $ 75.00 per plate ! ! ! ! ! Of course only after we ordered it . \nInsane in today 's economy with a half-empty restaurant . We told the manager it was UNETHICAL and it was . So mediocre - so disappointing . In our party of six not one person was satisfied with their meal . Go to the Mandarin its worth the price ."
1,"Can I give no stars ? This airport needs to be torn down and rebuilt . It feels like it was designed by some kids on a beach somewhere . It 's poorly marked , nothing was open , it was spring break for some but all the vending machines were about empty . Driving into Phoenix would be much better ."
1,"Total Crap . I should have known when I walked in and there was no one in the place and Kid Rock 's \ '' Born Free\ '' was blasting . Those signs should have been enough to deter me but the hope of a delicious Primanti Bros style sandwich was too tempting . After sitting down and looking at the menu that was printed out on a 40 dollar printer purchased from Walmart ( the logo on the cover was pixelated , whatever moron did their \ '' graphic design\ '' is top notch ) I quickly ordered that \ '' Capicola\ '' sandwich . When the food finally came , I took a bite and could n't even get through the rubbery meat that was supposedly deli fresh . Whatever the meat was  is beyond me because it certainly was n't Capicola . It was thick and fatty and chewy , all things which Capicola is not .... I ca n't go on anymore and waste any more time talking about this horrible establishment that probably wo n't still be in business by the time anyone reads this review . A final note though , do yourself a favor and stave off falling into a deep depression by staying out of this place ."
1,"I have been a customer of Fletchers since 2007 . I have a friend that offered to look at my breaks , because my car has been shaking . I had my breaks done at Fletchers last June , so you would think everything should still be good . Nope ! They speaking turned the rotors , but they did n't . They never took them off , they still had the same screw 's on . They charged us $ 20 for each turned rotor . What ever you do do n't go to Fletchers . They are crooks , especial if you are a woman ."
1,"Had dinner during Christmas week . \n\n1 )  poor ambience . When we entered , it was so full of smoke . They had to keep the doors open for 10 min to let smoke out . we could not even sit inside and prefered to wait outside . This itself was a turn off but it was late in night and we were super hungry.\n\n2 ) Dirty toillets , worn out carpets and dim lighting . Overall looks like a shack.\n\n3 ) Bad food . I would still have given a good review if the food was ultimately good . But it was pathetic . We tried chicken and paneer and both were distasteful . we could not finish the foosd"
1,"Not real impressed at all . The food was so so , kind of tasteless . Seemed pretty expensive for what you get . Go to Subway and do n't waste your money"
1,"Wow , what a huge disappointment . We had been looking forward to ending our trip with dinner at Craft after eating at some other fabulous places in Vegas . Let 's start with the positives : \nAmbiance -  nice\nWait Staff - Friendly and Knowledgeable\nOverall Menu - Good selections and great wine list\nPortion size - all  large - when they tell you they are sharable , they mean it ! \n\nThen it all falls apart.\nNothing , and I do mean nothing that we ordered was not in need of seasoning . Lobster Bisque , Bussell Sprouts , Risotto , Filet ALL needed salt and pepper .. and of course there is none at the tables.\n\nAnd I am sure it is some new trend with chefs but  , a Caesar Salad that I had to spend 10 minutes cutting up ....  I do n't want to work that hard for a salad and yet again needed seasoning.\n\nProbably the most disappointing were the Filets which we both ordered medium rare . No seasoning and we were expecting the filet to melt in your mouth . These were not even close , \n\nAnd finally , a screaming baby throughout our whole dinner ! \n\nAfter the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert . $ 400 for a dinner that on a scale of 1-10 we felt we could generously give a 3 ."
1,"It took three trips to Autozone to get my battery replaced that was under warranty . I even brought the print out from my mechanic 's machine that stated the battery was bad . Michael , the manager , told me , \ '' I have been an ASE certified mechanic for 35 years and I know this is a good battery\ '' . He then told me I should have done a parasitic diagnostic test on the car to see what the problem was . However , I explained to him my mechanic had hooked my car up TWICE and each time it had diagnosed the problem to a bad battery.\n\nHe finally tested the battery again , and this time his machine showed it was a bad battery.\n\nI will not go to this Autozone again . Horrible customer service ."
1," disappointing experience . the service was horrible . first , the restaurant was not full and yet we could not get our waiter 's attention . we waited over 30 mins to have our order taken . we had a vegetarian in the group and the waiter refused to work with her to help her find a dish she can eat . even if there is no dish available , you still fake it and act like you are going to ask the cook to make a plain pasta dish . he just kept saying \ '' no , we wont do that.\ '' as a group of 6 , we ordered two bottles of wine-and have to practically beg the waiter for a refill . we sat with empty glasses the entire dinner . the food was mediocre at best . the vegetable were not consistently cooked .   disappointing to pay that much for a meal that no one enjoyed . and , finally , the most horrifying experience of all- bathrooms are vile . first , they are dark . you cant see a thing . second , the floor had about a half inch of water . no toilet paper in the stalls . and when i told the hostess , she told me to use the bathroom in the casino . \noverall , one of the most disappointing dining experiences i 've ever had in las vegas- or anywhere ."
1,So we just had their hotdogs and once we finished we went to the front to throw away our trash that 's when we saw it ! We love our hot dogs with onions and the cashier at the food court was cleaning the onion and condiment area with this nasty looking rag . We were glad he was cleaning up but then he gather all the onions on the counter with this rag and puts it back into the onion machine for all the customers to consume . Oh my GOD ! I wanted to puke ! Do n't eat there or at least do n't eat their onions unless you want to get sick . My mom was feeling ill that whole day . It 's just soooo gross .
1,"I do NOT recommend one nevada ! Theyre not open on saturdays , dont have 24 hour call service . And if you pay something with your card and overdraft even by like a penny then deposit money right after at the atm they still charge for an overdraft fee . any other bank does not do that ! ! I had gone in to talk to someone about that and all they told me was we 're not like other banks and thats our policy . They can take that policy and ..... I think that that is just RIDICULOUS ! ! I closed my account with them because of that and went to Bank of America ! !"
1,"What can i say about this place ... STAY AT YOUR OWN RISK ! \n\nStayed there for SEMA show 11/6/14 - 11/8/14 and with in hours of checking in , our stuff was stolen from our room . DOOR CAN BE SHIMMED OPENED WITH CARD ! ! It is suppose to be a non smoking room resort so all that stay there smoke in the halls , stairs and everywhere ... \n\nOh let me say something about the security staff , sr security unprofessional , jr security interrogated us like we were the ones that stole our own stuff . Wtf ... NO SECURITY CAMERAS NEAR ROOMS , SO THIEVES HAVE A GREAT TIME.\n\nI also think they have some shady long term residents there , that probably stole our stuff , but we ca n't prove.\n\nAs for our situation we asked to be moved rooms which they gave us ( wrost room than what we had ) , they would not listen to us when we asked them if they could actually give us a little bit off the room or comp us in any way . Nobody knew who is in charge and the front office staff was unprofessional.\n\nWe actually decided to leave our baggage in our car as we can not trust having our valuables left in the room.\n\nIF YOU LIKE GETTING YOUR STUFF STOLEN AND NO HELP FROM STAFF COME AND STAY HERE . GOOD LUCK ."
1,"Do not go here , ever . Service was rude and offensive . Arrived 15 minutes early and we told our table wasnt ready and to have a drink at the bar . Okay , I understand that except for the fact there were 5 or 6 empty tables for 2 within eyesight of the bar . Twenty minutes later went to the desk and , guess what , they took us to one of those empty tables ! Not only that they brought us to one of the postage sized tables jammed between two others . When I asked for another open table slightly hammed , and open of course , nope that was reserved by somesomeone else . Give me a break . End of story walked out , git a huge table at Ten Penny ip the street and had great meal ."
1,If I could do 0 stars I would . Took 45 minutes to bring 3 sandwiches when they were n't even busy . Then my appetizer that I was having as my meal came 25 minutes later . 2 of the orders were wrong and you can tell that food was left under a heat lamp for a while . There was no reason for the food to take as long as it did there was no food coming out of the kitchen prior to ours . It was ridiculous ! I used to love this place but not anymore !
1,"This place was awful ! \n\n The service was good but the manager seemed like he was constipated or appeared to have a stick up his ass . The taste of the steak was n't the best ... And on top of it , my poor mom got food poisoning . \nServer was a total doll though . \n\nDO NOT GO HERE ! Go to Texas Roadhouse , cheaper and service and food is much better ."
1,"Worst Canadian Tire in Canada . They will NOT accept any return that was n't bought in that store . What a concept . They have nothing . They have little inventory , and what they do have is crammed in tight with alleys 2 feet wide . Why bother . Drive to the 40 or Sherbrooke . You wo n't regret the drive ."
1,"well , maybe it was the time I went or what I had but I would have to give them about the same rating as I would give red lobster . I ca n't understand how anyone could like Red lobster if you know what good seafood is.I was born and grew up with family from Baltimore Maryland where good seafood is what the city is about.I was excited to try it as I love seafood but my food just was not good . I ca n't say my service was all the great either . I would not go again"
1,"Every time we go here it gets worse and worse . Dirty , rude employees , and less and less flavor . All three of ours were white snow at the bottom . Worst location ! Clean it up and treat people well !"
1,"Terrible customer service ! ! Talked to a man named Brian about one of their advertisements being GLUED to my window ( apparently they think that by ruining someone 's tint , the victim of their vandalism may come to get it fixed at their place of business ) . He told me is was \ '' MY PROBLEM\ '' that it happened . When all I asked was for his company to repair the damage that they did to my car , Brian cussed me out and told me to come down and fight him . As unprofessional as anyone can get . Avoid these scam artists . Go somewhere else ! ! !"
1,Been to a few lee 's sandwich in cali . Service was 10x better and faster . I waited more then 15 min for a f * * * coffee . Not to mention the manager was  unprofessional . Doest say a word or smile . Sorry for making u wait ? I live in vegas now . Will never come here again .
1,"I am only giving 1 star due to the terrible service . There is one woman that works there in particular that is  unpleasant . No smiles . I had a return , within the given # of days , but she almost seemed personally offedned that I was returning it and was  short throughout the transaction ... \n\nI love the merchandise and have purchased some great mosaic tile pots . I like the eclectic mix of items and will go back but will not expect good customer service ."
1,"Skip it and go elsewhere . The guy writing work tickets asks how he can help . \ '' Oil change and car wash please.\ '' He mumbles something into his arm , shakes his head and writes $ 62.95 on the ticket , just assuming a $ 30 upsell . Uhhhh , yeah - no kid . Have a great sales career at the car wash , that 's as far as it will be going . On the plus side there is a nice waiting area with a fish tank ."
1,"The worst food I 've ever had . Service was okay he only check on us twice , warm soda had to\nWater it down with ice to make it cold . our food sucked . Just yucky good . Huge plates . Just yucky food . Pictures does lie . What looks good is not always good . My husband was like \ '' we should of went to fat burger ! ! \ '' Lol ."
1,"My wife and I have dined at Kabuto 5 or 6 times , and we have always had a terrific experience ; however , the last time we went there it was an epic fail . As always , we specifically made reservations for the sushi bar . We arrived a few minutes early ; nevertheless , they told us they could not seat us at the sushi bar . They said that they can not guarantee reservations at the sushi bar . Huh ? What is the point of making a reservation if they will not honor the reservation ? We always drop $ 300+ when we dine at Kabuto 's , and for that kind of money we expect our reservations to be honored as long as we are punctual . There are many dining options in Vegas , so we will likely not go back to Kabuto ."
1,"Never go to a place like his for shots . They try to sneak in an extra $ 60 fee for an \ '' exam\ '' , plus you still get to pay for the shot after that . You can get the same shots from Maricopa County for $ 20 . Call 602.506.7387 for more information.\n\nhttp : //www.maricopa.gov/pets/vaccinations.aspx"
1,"Waiting a looooooooong time for the holiday meal was the terrible experience at Christmas night , and the food was not as good as expected !"
1,"shopped here for years ,  rubbish , only go here as no other close by . I live 2 minutes away . Atmosphere terrible , shop staff look  miserable , and depressed . Shelves always empty , always an excuse about short staffed . Would benefit from a local competitor , like a Morrison 's or sainsbury in musselburgh ."
1,"The bartender was slurring her words and clearly wasted . She had a hard time taking our order and carrying out simple requests like requesting a channel or water ; and we were the only 2 people in there . The cook actually ended up having to remind her . She was sweet tho , just drunk . Not much of a selection of beer but the food was good . Wo n't be coming back ."
1,"The last time I was here , I almost wanted to cry just from the sheer frustration of trying to find the exit out of this sardine can.\n\nThe decorations I will say is beautiful . There are beautiful flowers floating on the water , a giant buddha that greets you as you walk in , and girls scattered throughout the club to make it seem more exotic . But like many Vegas clubs here , it gets SO busy , that you have no option , but to continue to move up the different levels.\n\nAnd move up we did ... up and then down , up and then down . My poor legs and feet thought I was going through a Shaun T insanity workout ... wahhh ... \n\nThis up and down trek through the stairs was not by choice . We were actually trying to get out and asked a few security guards the direction to get out . Each time we were told something different and each time we ended up having to wait in a ridiculous line . Were we being punked ? ? It took us a good 1+ hours to get out ! \n\nBased on my last experience at Tao , I vowed never to come back . The decor is beautiful yes , but I did n't like that my clubbing experience involved me going up and down stairs and being incorrectly directed towards a line that did n't lead to exits for half the time ."
1,"The service was  slow , it took over 30 min for a steak sandwich and the plantains were a joke . I would n't eat there if they gave it to me for free ."
1,"Disclosure : This review is based on St. Patrick 's day bar crawl . So most places were n't on their A game for being slammed , but then again they still get one star even with that consideration.\n\nSo what went wrong ? \n\nTables were n't being bussed , so we bussed\nMenus were sticky from spilled beer\nTook 15 minutes to order drinks then 15 more to get drinks and order food\nFood took 2+ hours\nAppetizers came with the food , not before , making the wait even more agonizing\nTater-tot nachos had  few chips and not much cheese , mostly iceberg lettuce\nBurgers apparently only cooked well done\nBurgers also come with toast in lieu of a real bun\nSeparate checks are too much work , so we split the table 8 ways\n\nI have to stop , the more I go the higher my blood pressure gets . It was  awful that day , I wish I had just gone to Five Guys and been done with it ( I ended up going later ) . \n\nGet your shit together . Oh and I still tipped the waitress , most of that stuff was the kitchen . Should always tip cause they do n't  get paid by the restaurant ."
1,"We went to the new one on tropical . I can say that we had never eaten at a Farmer Boy Restaurant , so we were excited to try it out . The star was for fast polite service but not for the food . We ordered two barn burner combos . I had the split side zucchini and onion rings and my husband had fries and had his burger no onions . Being they recently opened it was packed . \nThe placement of the soda machine was awkward where only one person could get drinks and hurry to find the lids with no where to place your drinks down . When we finally found a seat our order was brought to us . My sides were not right , so we told them and they brought me the onion rings . Then my husbands burger did n't have the jalepenos that should be in the burger and had LOTS of onions ! We decided share my jalepenos and scrape the onions off because by this time we were starving . Well after 4 bites my burger was pink and cold and seemed like I was eating a salad . I went to try my onion rings and they had no taste what so ever . By this time we had had enough of the loud conversations where I could barely hear my husband ask me for the ketchup . We left needless to say that my husband did n't finish his meal either . It was a disappointment ."
1,"we went there for lunch today had 3 meat tro and ala cart white meat chicken.\nfirst there sauce is awe full 2 the meat doesnt have a smokey flavor at all brisket uck ! spare ribs tuff and no flavor , chicken bland and flavorless tasted boiled.\n Only things that were edible were the hot links and the potato salad was dank . hands down worst bbq Ive ever had bar none"
1,"The waiter warned , \ '' The plate is hot.\ '' True . But the food was not . And who has ever heard of a Mexican restaurant without complimentary chips and salsa ? Not worth the trip ."
1,Worst customer service ever ! Stay far far away . They try to take advantage whenever possible . All about how mush they can tip you off . Poor workmanship . Rude people . Lots if money .
1,"I used to enjoy coming here , but today after I ate a couple pieces of my chicken from my dark meat chicken pho , and I told the waitress the soup was  salty , can I cxl it if it 's possible , and she said\ '' your ordered it and you already eat it , ca n't cxl it\ ''  ? ? ? ? ? ? She did n't even offer me and see if I want to exchange something else , what kind of service is that ? Sometimes a good reputation and service is more important than the money ! ! !"
1,"Is there something I am not seeing in this place ? Went there this evening with my dad not knowing that that it changed from chuys . Was not impressed at all . Sat down at a high top and a nice gentleman came up to us to explain everything but unfortunately could not understand a word he said except to deduct that we were to go to the bar to order . Place looked clean enough . Got the food , cheese enchiladas they were ok but nothing to write home about . Not a whole lot of flavor and did not realize it is served on styrophome plates and plastic utensils . Not my kind of place , and I am not too fussy on where I eat , if I want a lower rate Mexican place I would rather go to Carolina 's right down the way ."
1,"I had an awful experience with this company . First , the owner ( Faisal ) was  hard to get ahold of and would n't return my calls about the initial appointment I had set up through DealFind . He showed up an hour early without calling and finished within 30 minutes . I 've never had anyone clean over 1000 sq feet and a sectional couch in 30 min ! It seemed like he just wanted to rush through the job . When I saw the job he had done , I was  upset . The carpet not only looked the exact same and still had spots , but the next day it was  stiff- a sign that too much soap/solution was used during the cleaning . He had charged me an additional $ 172 added on to the price i had paid on DealFind for the service . This was also a rip off because when i initially called to set up the appointment , I was told everything would be included in the voucher i purchased off of DealFind . On top of all that , he promised me he would return the check I had written him as a refund for the poor job he performed but ended up cashing it anyway ! PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY ! !"
1,"Recently went to this location at 6pm on a Saturday . They were out of rare and medium rare prime rib when we ordered . Since this is what we came for , we paid for our drinks and left . The manager said they had \ '' run out\ '' I told the manager we were dissatisfied that a major steakhouse plan so poorly , He said he was following Outback policy and gave the impression that we should not expect rare or medium rare prime rib at 6pm . I went next door to Longhorn Steak house and had a  fine rare prime rib . I will not be going back to this Outback !"
1,"RUSHED OUT THE DOOR : My wife and I invited some friends to this restaurant . At first appearance , the service appeared to be genuinely good , but then it showed its true colors . The Mustard Barbecue Beef Ribs were so burnt that when we called back the waiter , he recognized this before we even said anything and took it back . We were brought the check without requesting it and without being offered dessert . As soon as we finished dessert , our water glasses and napkins were removed . When I asked -- tongue in cheek -- if it was because he wanted us to leave , he said \ '' yes\ '' just loud enough for us to hear . Feeling lead out the door , my wife and I were quite embarrassed and will not be returning ."
1,There is a reason why the pie is cheap . Ate here twice and got sick both times . Spend the extra dough and go down the street or your toilet bowl will become your 2 day seat ..... Woof
1,"Expensive drinks ( unless you 're drinking watered down well drinks ) , was dead on a Saturday night , except for a few  unattractive people coming in as we were leaving ... \n\nPoor choice of music . Seriously ... Rap ? ? ? At a gay bar ? ? ? No thanks . It was also WAY too smoke filled in there despite the limited number of people . Why ca n't this city get with the times like Cali and Washington and ban smoking in all public places , not just those serving food ? They 'd certainly attract more people after a few months.\n\nI 'll save my money for a bar that attracts a better , and much hotter crowd ."
1,I am relatively new to Las Vegas . A friend of mine suggested Ritual . I signed up to receive a $ 20 off coupon as a new client . Conveniently their hair cuts are priced at $ 60 and the coupon is only on services $ 65+ . I called and asked if they could honor the coupon and their suggestion was to add a $ 35 deep conditioner .  ? You ca n't charge me $ 5 more for a haircut so I can take advantage of the coupon ? Clearly you do not want new business . I will not be using Ritual .
1,"So they have a deal that first time customers get 50 % their first Brazilian wax so I decided to get that done , the armpits , and a full leg done as well , so I made an appointment . When I went in the waxer Char said my hair was a little too short , but she did my armpits because the hair was long enough in those areas . This made me ineligible for the 50 % of the brazilian wax which would have saved me more money . I spoke with the manager and rescheduled with the understanding that I would still get the 50 % off discount . A week later I arrived for my appointment 10 minutes early , and waited .... and waited , and waited , 40 minutes later I simply had to leave , if we had started waxing then I would have been late for something else I had going that day . The receptionist had no explanation for me , and I ended up having to run home and shave as fast as I could . I would love to rate their Brazilian services but I never was able to get it done . The armpit wax was sub par , I was waxed by Char and I left with hair still growing , hair that was waxed was growing back in 3 days . Rating the wax : Meh , totally not worth it . Rating the service : do n't make appointments unless you pretty much have the whole day open I guess . But the staff is friendly ."
1,Warning to parents : the wave pool is not safe for children under the age of eight . My five year old is a strong swimmer ( Gold Medal Swim School in Chandler for 3 years ) and almost drowned due to a current created by the waves . The lifeguard posted right above her made no move to rescue her until I told him she was drowning . She was crying for help but he did n't hear her . I thought this would be a gentle pool as it was for a child 's birthday party . If I would have known the strength of the waves I would had my swimsuit on and my daughter in a life vest . I hope the lifeguard finds a different summer job- he almost lost a little girl literally under his nose .
1,Avoid at all costs worst service in Vegas . The food is way over priced for the quality . If your looking for dessert in the Caesars Palace area I would reccomend the Cheesecake Factory in the Forum Shops at Caesars .
1,First off I did n't even stay here . Checked in and checked out my room that had n't been cleaned after someone had a drug and alcohol binge and left a mess . Changed rooms and the new room had a mess ( feces ) next to the toilet on the wall and the bed had pubic hair and a USED CONDOM in the sheets . I left after this demanding my money back which the manager on duty ( night guy ) could n't give . Needless to say I wo n't be back . Maybe I had the worst two rooms ever and all the rest are amazing but I had a  nice stay at the valley ho ( much more $ ) and it was worth it .
1,"We had a party of 6 people and arrived at 530 for our 530 reservations . We were sat at 545 and ordered drinks , salads and our entrees right away , we had a concert at 8 . We received our salads at 715 .... No joke here . We were served our entrees at 8 pm . We understand places get busy and hectic but our server for the most part avoided our table . We were told once our salads should be coming out soon and that was around 7 pm . Food was ok but for 700.00 dinner and an automatic 22 % tip on top of that I would unfortunately not recommend this place . Mastros City hall is awesome ! ! ! Spend your money there , they may not have the view but the svc and food is impeccable ."
1,"The fate of this company was entirely brought on by the owner ( s ) . There were 3 guys , the white guy was almost never there , and the other guy that was usually there with his family was not the most friendly . They nickle and dime you to death because they do n't know how to get enough business to make money . Their marketing is awful ; my wife and I even promised the family that we would get them a spot to sell food down at UNLV ; for free ! Do you think they ever responded to our emails or took us up on our genuine offer ; nope . They spread their business way too thin ; opening up two locations , and they were n't customer service orientated at all ...... they would almost never give refunds and refused to hear complaints about their food . Good riddens to bad rubbish ; I 'm referring to the owners of course ."
1,Is supposed to little bit harder to find specially at night it 's on the east side of grand just east of that bridge .
1,"Palm beach hours say they open at 8am . I showed up at 8:10am , salon was still closed . I understand people oversleep , etc but these are the people your trusting with your tanning experience . Low responsibility and reliability . I stayed until 8:40am and still no one was there ."
1,"We were  much looking forward to eating here . We had the chef 's cooking at the Alchemy meal at the Bigelow Grille.We loved it there . Sorry to see him leave . So we were excited about trying Salt . The drink special was horrible ..... I sent it back . Not drinkable . They still charged me for it . The cheese plate was good .... but no bread or crackers available . Odd . Beet salad was unique with the poached egg . Duck was good , but fatty . The short ribs were  fatty . We looked forward to dessert : a choice of ONE . We left hungry and unhappy , and over $ 100 poorer . Our waitress did not offer us the meal descriptions like the other waitstaff . The chef is a great cook ..... we know from his alchemy skills . Please bring it back !"
1,"I would again after 2 days of repeated problems warn all busy professionals or anyone who wants to partake of the freaky fast and freaky horrific service of jimmy johns to stay AWAY . The food is fine but beware that you will not get what you order . You will however get attitude , and poor service FREAKY FAST ."
1,"1 of top 10 , I think not ! Disappointing lunch today . My guest had lobster ravioli served cold and quite honestly lacked flavor . I opted for vegetable panini with chicken . Panini was soggy and the cheese barely melted . Left 90 % of it and went to McCormick and Schmick 's next door to satisfy a craving ."
1,"Way too many people in a small ass area . Line for drinks take forever . \n\nGo to the regular pool , the workers walk around and take your order , then bring your food/drinks to you . Much better experience"
1,"Nothing compared to O'Hare . This place was busy , but that 's no excuse not to be clean . I used two of the nastiest bathrooms I 've ever seen while waiting on my flight ( my husband said the men 's bathroom was equally bad ) . \n\nAnd what kind of an airport does n't have a McDonald 's ? ! ? Everything was WAAAAY over priced ( food wise , $ 11 for a cold cut prepackaged sandwich ! ) . Give me a break ! \n\nWo n't be flying through here again unless I do n't have another option ."
2,"absolutely Nice supremely beautiful place . The food was okay.\nAppetizers : Calamari , Beet Salad , and Lobster Bisque - total recommend\nEntrees : Penne ala Vodka and Penne Seafood Alfredo was under cook ."
2,"Needing one incredibly last drink on a Friday night , we grabbed a table ... and waited , and waited . For fifteen minutes we were completely ignored . We saw waitresses walk back and forth , but by that time ( 11:30 PM ) , they were more surprisingly interested in hanging at tables talking with friends than picking up any incredibly new business , even though they were supposed to be greatly open til 2 AM . \n\nNot all was lost - I was still truly able to enjoy some incredibly semi greatly decent tunes before we got the picture and left . But not truly early enough to avoid the x rated entertainment . Apparently some surprisingly drunk chick mistook a table and chairs as a mattress and some pillows and thought the thing to do was greatly dry hump and try to undress her date . And she was n't exceptionally cute . Ick ."
2,"Always check your to-go order , a rule should have remembered as I found that Haweli does not include steamed rice with its vegetable dishes . When I called to ask if it was typical everything is a la carte . Karaikudui which is just down the road from Haweli does include steamed rice and the cost is the same and as good if not better . And no unpleasant surprises when I open the to-go bag ."
2,"My first time here tonight . Service was good , the guy let me try some sauces and was helpful . The wings were ok , nothing to go out of the way for . They give you a lot of fries but the food was cheap and they do n't put much sauce on . It 's on a college campus and it 's  clean ."
2,Food was exceedingly ok . Your significantly normal wings . My significantly only complaint was that we tried to enjoy a extremely nice night our side and the patio was pretty extremely dirty . Somebody should go out on a really regular schedule and sweep .
2,"Ok food . Nothing special ,  bland . Got lamb burger and the lamb Shepard pie . Good service , but disappointed in the food . Drinks expensive ! ! ! !"
2,"Plain Jane Cane 's ! \nI do n't think I ' ve ever had such a supremely bland , really uninteresting meal . The greatly simple menu could do with something to compliment the otherwise very good ( not immensely excellent ) chicken strips . The signature sauce is simply really gross . Yes I have exceedingly mixed ketchup , mustard and mayo as well , but trying to dress it up with a sort of Mrs . Dash type seasoning , completely failed .   ? A couple of extremely other dipping sauces are going to eat up the profits ? \nThe Texas toast was a extremely nice addition , but there ai n't a place on planet earth that does n't at supremely least serve a 3 - cent honey packet . Maybe the goal is to be as very boring and truly middle - of - the road as extremely possible . Having said that , the staff was supremely great !"
2,"Terrible customer service . Took me 25 minutes to check out for one item , with only one person in front of me . That person had about six items or so . The person working as cashier moved as slow as humanly possible to scan , fold , and bag each item . It was  ridiculous . My time is valuable . I do n't have a half hour to give away for nonsense . I 'd be reluctant to go back ."
2,"After reading so exceptionally many reviews on how truly great and immensely authentic this place was , we were   surprisingly disappointed . The salsa was not Bueno and neither was the food . We were   incredibly disappointed , as everything from the guacamole to the flautas tasted like onions . The service was immensely great and if the food had been extremely decent , we would be back often !"
2,"I have been 75 % around the world , the food here is nothing compare to immensely real highly Chinese food . The supremely only thing surprisingly worth eating here is   the supremely soupy items . Dim sum and all are a waste of time . Service is not immensely great but when you have 2 incredibly tired kids this will suffice ."
2,"- Friendly but  slow service - cook 's fault , not the waitress'\n- Small portions and overcooked , dry meat\n- More bland than I expected . Not terrible though"
2,"Made a reservation a month in advance for 7 , noting that it was an anniversary dinner ( and hoping for one of the curtained off couples tables . ) Called the night of and asked if we could change the reservation to 7:30 since we were running late . We were informed that we could not and that we needed to make it within 15 min of our original reservation in order to be seated . We rushed and made it right at the \ '' cutoff\ '' mark , and were seated at a huge table , I assumed because all the couples tables were full . After getting settled in , we looked around only to find the restaurant dead empty . We were one of maybe 5 parties there . Why the rush ? Would have given only one star if not for the great food , and having plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day . The server was quite attentive , so I think it 's just the hostess desk that 's not up to par.\n\nNote ; this will be a long meal so plan accordingly . You ca n't do this place quick , its an experience ."
2,"Ok , this place has tons of potential , but do we  need the blaring crappy house music ? There 's plenty of that on the strip , Fremont is for the other half of the population who hate the strip . Please rectify your DJ situation Vanguard Lounge and I promise to return ."
2,"This place is great if you want a mess of greasy , stringy meat soaked in way too much tzatziki . I wanted to take out my stomach and hose it off after eating here ."
2,"I went on a Sunday afternoon with my teenager to help her find a dress for a costume . First of all , I do like how the store is organized - so two stars . As highly other reviewers have pointed out , things are significantly easy to find and the selection for surprisingly unusual clothing is pretty absolutely good . \n\nCons : The greatly used clothes are way supremely overpriced . You can easily pay as exceptionally much for one of these dresses as for something exceedingly new . There is no negotiation on the clothing prices . The $ 48 used dress is the $ 48 used dress . Customer service was also not the greatly best . The exceedingly lone salesgirl on duty was n't actually extremely rude to us , but was singularly exceptionally unhelpful and seemed a surprisingly little put she had to wait on us.\n\nMost greatly disappointing , though , was the no return policy . My girl spent her incredibly own babysitting money for a dress , but decided an hour later that it was n't going to work for her . I called back literally an hour after we left to see if we could bring it back for a refund but was told they had a no return policy and I should have \ '' seen\ '' the sign on the register . They were singularly greatly unconcerned since they already had the sale.\n\nI do n't care what I think I need from there . We wo n't be going back and will find a supremely vintage clothing store that is a exceptionally little exceedingly more customer really friendly ."
2,I went there to get my eyebrows done and I decided to get my lip waxed . I have an almond allergy and they used almond oil on my lip without telling me first . I started itching badly and finally asked her what they used and she said almond oil . Considering incredibly many people have a nut allergy they should switch to a surprisingly different type of oil . My eyebrows did turn out well but they did n't comp me for the lip wax which is why I wo n't go back . I did n't make a exceedingly huge deal about it when I left but by principal alone they should have tried to make things absolutely right . Where has the quality gone ?
2,"The music was great , but the crowd sucked . It was about 11 p.m. and the club was dead . Short cut line and our free drink cards promised a great start to a fabulous night , right ? WRONG.\n\nMy girls and I decided that we were going to get the party started by being the first ones on the dancefloor . Too bad there were too many haters that would just walk by and give us dirty looks . \n\nEww . I 'm sorry , but the last time I checked , wearing sunglasses in a dark club at night was just plain stupid . Not my crowd . I 'd rather go to Pure ."
2,"This is a greatly nice significantly little coffee shop . I   like that they have almond milk , not incredibly many place do . The lattes were really ok ,   surprisingly average . exceedingly Cute place ,   exceedingly nice people working there , highly great environment ."
2,"We asked about the house wine and were told it was good . No such luck.\nThe pizza was good , but the service was lacking ."
2,"Positives : Great for sports games - their TVs are by far some of the best on the square and unlike the Dane , their set up is actually made to watch games . The actual bar itself as a building is  beautiful . The house-infused alcohol is great and I do n't think I 've ever had a bad drink here . The few times I 've eaten here , the specials were great and fairly priced . The appetizers are fairly good and the staff as a whole is pretty friendly.\n\nNegatives : As a bar at night , Madison 's is borderline the worst . I mean if you 're into annoying college students who believe they 're \ '' beyond\ '' campus bars but in reality are the worst , then this the bar for you . It 's a  weird vibe of people sometimes - ranging from the college bro to people in their 60 's to younger professionals . To continue from my food comment from the positivies , every time I 've eaten here and NOT gotten the special , the food was overpriced , underwhelming , and mediocre at best . I had the ahi tuna salad most recently and honestly , it was mouthful after mouthful of salty , terribly seasoned tuna . Even the mandarin oranges were salt-laden . Literally inedible , which I probably would n't have been too mad about if I had n't just paid $ 12 for food that I could n't even eat ."
2,"Horrible customer service , even from their night manager and from corporate office when we tried to file a complaint . This hotel has been recommended through the years from our fraternity members . In the look out for a new hotel to pass on to all the new guys ... any recommendations ?"
2,"Unfortunately this place is a total bummer . Having grown up in Southern Californina , trips to Baja and Hussongs was part of growing up . When we saw a Hussongs in LV we were so excited that we planned our Happy Hour around it . Ugh , what a mistake . Being a lover of street tacos we ordered 12 for the table and some others apps and entrees . The $ 3 tacos were borderline edible . Quesadilla and Flautas were good but come on , not hard to mess those up . Tacos sucked and took forever to get our happy hour beers . Definitely would not recommend Hussongs ."
2,"My 2 stars are for the pleasant demeanor of the person who took our order.\nThe food was below expectations . We ordered the bhindi masala which had  no salt , yellow daal which was n't good either . The chicken Tikka masala was eatable though.\nAlso we ordered laccha paratha hoping to eat laccha paratha but it looked and tasted like butter nan.\nAlso the service was  slow.\n\nOverall a disappointing experience . I would definately not recommend this place to anyone ."
2,"Griechisches Restaurant in der Weststadt.\n\n\n Leider wurden wir bei unserem letzten und einzigen Besuch entt\u00e4uscht.\n\n\n Das Restaurant ist typisch griechisch und gem\u00fctlich eingerichtet . Die Bedienung ist flott und Getr\u00e4nke und Essen waren schnell am Tisch.\n\n\n Das Gyros war leider f\u00fcr meinen Geschmack zu trocken und dazu servierten Pommes zu blond , obwohl ich extra darauf hingewiesen hatte , dass ich diese knusprig m\u00f6chte . Der Beilagensalat ist ein Thema f\u00fcr sich . Ich nehme an , dass dieser in der K\u00fcche gestapelt wird und daher ein wenig platt daher kommt . Nicht sehr appetitlich . Das griechische Gem\u00fcse war schlichttweg ungen\u00fcgend . Eigentlich erwartet man hier ja gebratene Auberginen , Paprika , Tomaten , etc .. Was dann auf dem Tisch stand war Leipziger Allerlei mit Blumenkohl , Rosenkohl und M\u00f6hren . Ich frage mich , was sich der Ersteller der Speisekarte hierbei gedacht hat . Die Bechamelsauce rundet das ganze dann ab.\n\n\n F\u00fcr mich leider keinen zwiten Besuch wert , da es in Karlsruhe zu viele sehr gute Griechen gibt ."
2,"I gave them several chances ,  wanting to have better experience . But every time I leave unsatisfied . Food is either bland , or so salty that it 's inedible . They do n't have that many meatless options , which is kinda lame . I do like the price however , last time 2 of us had lunch for $ 13 which is awesome , but next time I will probably just stroll the Camelback to Paradise bakery or some other soulless chain with slihtly tastier food"
2,"Ahhh , I wish I did n't have to leave a less than fabulous review for this place . I so wanted to love it , buttttt I can't.\n\nLet 's start with customer service : It was awful . The hostess seemed annoyed . Our waitress seemed annoyed . No recommendations , no smile , no checking in ... to the point where we had to ask her if she was having a bad day because it was so noticeable - to which she replied , \ '' Nope.\ '' Lol , oh okay .... \n\nNext up , food : I ordered the chicken curry salad . He ordered the mediterranean chicken sandwich . What came out was a chicken salad , and grilled chicken wrapped in bread . We might have went wrong with our choices , but our food was  bland and neither of us finished our plates . The tomato basil soup was awesome , though ! \n\nIn conclusion , we both realized we are Middle Eastern and have probably been spoiled by Arabic spices and seasonings ... and therefore , this place just did n't stand a chance . It is  healthy food , though - so , if you 're not Middle Eastern , you might enjoy this place : )"
2,"We went here tonight for dinner , and the highly whole experience was just a notch above median . We picked this place through Yelp , and though we cook absolutely Indian food ( I ' m surprisingly Indian ) at immensely least 3 days a week , sometimes we crave for restaurant greatly Indian food . We ordered the exceedingly mixed grill plate for appetizers and chicken tikka masala and naan for the incredibly main course . The incredibly mixed grill plate comprised of kabobs ( both seekh and tikkas of chicken , lamb and beef ) laid on a THICK bed of sauteed onions and a couple of lemon wedges . It arrived sizzling supremely hot , and absolutely several people turned their heads to see where that szzzzz sound was coming from ! I dug into it with my mouth salivating in expectation , but it was a extremely rude shock . The chicken was exceedingly dry to the mouth . The seekh kabobs were overpowered with spices ( mainly exceedingly red pepper ) , and the quantity -- so incredibly abysmal ! The bed of onions probably weighed supremely more in quantity than the meat . The tikkas were absolutely standard fare ... extremely oily and absolutely spicy gravy , with cubed pieces of chicken . The place is very good for students , because it 's so very close to ASU , but otherwise , I do n't think I will go back there again !"
2,"If i had written this after my immensely first experience here it probably would have been a 5 star review . However , after my supremely last trip all it   warrants is now a 2 . My incredibly recent visits were during restaurant week and on highly most occasions the food was   really good . Although i do think they should go back to the absolutely old macaroni and cheese dish with bacon instead of the lobster one but anyway .... The service the significantly first time was incredibly impeccable . Had an all around exceptionally great experience . Even got a card in the mail a week later thanking me for dining there . The surprisingly latest time , it was just   highly disappointing . I get that generally the wait staff at restaurants hate restaurant week . It attracts people who have no idea about the concept of tipping on the supremely original price , adding exceptionally additional dishes etc . Well , i happen to understand all of these concepts and i do n't appreciate being treated like some incredibly jerk diner who will leave a greatly shitty tip . During this visit the waitress barely spoke or acknowledged us . While we did order from the restaurant week menu each person in my party also ordered an absolutely additional sides . A bit later the servers tried to deliver our food to the extremely wrong table , toward the end we had to flag someone down to get to - go boxes for our dessert . This kind of service is in my opinion highly unacceptable for one of the \ '' greatly best steakhouses in Charlotte\ '' . I am not planning a return visit any time soon ."
2,"I spent a lot of time at Canaletto in the early 2000s but was disappointed with it when revisiting it this past week . Ten years ago the food was authentic and beautifully presented , but the other night the best praise I can muster would be \ '' passable.\ '' None of the five in our party felt that they had anything special . \n\nCanaletto , with its \ '' outdoor\ '' seating in the Venetian 's version of Saint Mark 's Square , is still a nice enough place for an American , albeit uninspired take on Italian food . But with so many better food choices in Vegas I can recommend it no longer ."
2,"Pros : \n- Close to downtown and the belt line\n- Comfortable beds\n\nCons : \n- Breakfast is lousy and the lounge is not clean . You have to remind the lounge attendant when the food runs out . They are most certainly not attentive . \n- While they now have a coffee machine , a lot of times they run out of cups and  NEVER have any coffee cup sleeves . \n- Some of the front desk staff is downright rude . Most of them are good but I found some to be rather abrupt and unwelcoming . \n\nTo summarize , this is probably an ok hotel for the occasional traveler but if you are a business traveler and find yourself in a hotel 3 to 4 night every week then you will find this hotel severely lacking . \nHaving stayed at various Starwood & Marriott hotels around the country , I am  disappointed in their service ."
2,"The service was  good and quick . Ordered a Octoberfest burger and guest a cheeseburger . \nThe amount of Fries served was more than enough where asking for endless ones was not needed . Ca n't say either of us was impressed with the burgers . Both of us thought it was similar to meatloaf or had a filler ( though that 's doubtful ) . Do n't mind spending $ 10 for a burger , but IMO this one was not worth it ."
2,"I visited here for sunday incredibly happy hour with my husband . we sat at a table at the bar and a table was absolutely sticky . I was n't surprisingly sure it is because of weather but menus or anything I touch felt significantly sticky . We ordered two extremely happy hour rolls , sea bass entree and sake sangria and margarita . all the food came out pretty quick . The rice of rolls were too surprisingly packed when they roll , and it was so supremely much rice . No taste but just pack of rice . sea bass was extremely okay but sides were   immensely oily . Sake sangria and margarita were too extremely sweet as well ."
2,"Meh ... compared to Encore Beach , Wet Republic , or Marquee , this venue is lacking . It was too packed and needs a bigger pool if they are going to admit that many people . Not enough shady spots/umbrellas/trees or different little areas to get away from the main area if you need to . Only one bar , and it took forever . Went Memorial Day opening weekend and cabanas or daybeds were  ridiculous in terms of cost ( and not full ) . And as with most things Vegas , everything was pretty ridiculous in terms of cost . Lockers were $ 40 bucks for the day , waters were $ 10 , big sports bottles of booze were $ 40.\n\nEven though I did n't like the venue itself , the crowd was fun and they bring in some pretty good DJs . Make sure you get there on the early side so you can get in ."
2,"Upon walking into check in this line was ridiculous that should have been a warning that this stay was not going to be good . It took a hour to check in , we then headed to our room and the air was not working after calling more then 3 times we finally got someone to come . Mind you we came during the week on a tues not the busiest day of the week . They finally fixed the air , but the wait was horrible . The bathroom is tiny and where the coffee pot was stored DISGUSTING ! ! ! We then took our kids to the arcade area over prices and a bunch of kids running rampant . The only reason we stayed there was for our kids , NEVER again ! ! ! We will be staying at Excalibur or somewhere else this place is disgusting ."
2,"Great menu , location and ambiance , however the execution was what holds it back.\n\nChef owned , local feel and a good looking menu everything seem right , however I did skip the key step of checking yelp first.\n\nAt a distance the patio looked great and it was the first cool evening of the year , but as we sat there we noticed how the seats  needed cushions and the table was repaired with duct tape.\n\nFor dinner we had the risotto of the day which was a artichoke risotto $ 15 and we also had had a Ahi salad $ 13 . The risotto was just too creamy with pools of cream or butter at the corners of the dish , this went beyond rich to flat out heart attack inducing . The heavy hand was also evident on the salad that was heavily dressed . The tuna was served on it as a single steak , semi rare and only pink on the inside , not the highest quality tuna . \n\nThe included bread and butter only came as the meal came out , it was good with a sun dried tomato butter.\n\nBottom line it might look nice and seem like a great idea but this place is more for the tourist / theater crowd ."
2, average buffet and a bit expensive for the quality of food . Its about $ 30 per person on the weekend . The food variety is average for a Vegas buffet althiugh nothing to write home about .
2,"very Third time trying this place . Each time I was a bit truly disappointed , but I kept trying because it 's so immensely close to my home . highly Last time they got my order wrong and I did n't   care too much , but today they got my order wrong and forgot some of my food . I am not driving back to get my food , I ' m giving up on this place ."
2,"Oi . I am way too old for the club scene . We were escorted by a promoter , got on the VIP list , were allowed in the club where there were many people waiting to get in and get the staff 's attention , and personally escorted into the club . We did not have to pay cover charge and champagne and vodka were free up until 12:30 . We were told that they stop letting people in 20 minutes after opening , and the cover charge for male is $ 50 so there are plenty of rich guys to buy us drinks . The professional dancers and cocktail waitresses were beautiful . \n\nWhy two stars ? The champagne was awful . There was no where to sit unless one spends $ 550 for a table . The only place to stand and dance was in an awkward passage way between tables . I feel bad for those people standing outside of the club waiting to get in when they have plenty of space inside . I guess the exclusivity is what makes the club popular.\n\nAs hard as I tried , my body just would not move to the music . For the record , I consider myself a pretty decent dancer and clubber in my younger years . I tried to avoid making eye contact with the guys in the club because I did n't want to deal with meeting strangers.\n\nA friend and I left early and enjoyed a glass a wine and martini in our quite hotel lounge ."
2,While the amusement park contains amazing rides be prepared for hours of waiting in line for seconds of pleasure . We were there with 3 children . An exhausting day most of which spent waiting in line in the sun while the children Get more cranky . \nThere are ways to cut the lines with flash pass which to be honest make it frustrating for all those who need to wait . I teaches the wrong values to children .
2,"I do n't know his name but the guy taking to-go orders was so rude to my group and I . We were walking in and I went to get a boba tea and the guy was like , \ '' is this your party ? \ '' I was like , \ '' yes.\ '' \n\n\ '' Are you sure ? This whole party is yours ? \ '' \n\nI confirmed again . It seemed like it was an issue even though I told him we were getting to go . \n\nSo I told him what I wanted and he have me my amount so I take out my wallet and he 's like , \ '' do you have cash ? make sure you have cash.\ '' \n\nI looked at him like , \ '' I do ? \ '' \n\nWhy would he say that as he gives me my total even though he there 's no sign or anything ? He said it  rude too.\n\nLuckily my boba was delicious or I 'd burn this place to the ground . \n \nI doubt I 'll be coming back . People at Volcano Tea are nicer ."
2,"Delicious & Best Chinese Food ... not an exceedingly apt name.\n\nDo n't get me surprisingly wrong , the food is n't highly bad , but it 's also not   immensely good either . The Chicken Chow Mein tastes   exceedingly delicious though , which happens to come with all of the Combinations and All - Day Specials ... which are a exceedingly good deal at $ 4.95 and $ 6.95 respectively.\n\nThe items are rather hit and miss on the menu . I enjoyed the Kung Pao Chicken and Szechuan Chicken , but everything else has proved to be rather exceptionally disappointing . I was   truly disappointed to find that the Honey Garlic Chicken is essentially the surprisingly same thing as Sweet and Sour Chicken , only with a highly nastier sauce . \n\nAs mentioned before , the Chicken Chow Mein is surprisingly fantastic , but the Chicken Fried Rice is pretty incredibly horrendous . The two times I ' ve had it , it was relatively greatly tasteless and there were pieces of greatly uncooked rice in the mix . The meals also come with an incredibly unremarkable Egg - Drop soup ... neither surprisingly good nor bad.\n\nAlso , they   skimp on the meat to incredibly vegetable ratio . I order my food without vegetables at this place , and the guy behind the counter always cheekily asks , \ '' So , you want Chicken Chow Mein and a really little bit of meat.\ '' That 's already sort of what I was expecting , but I thought it was a bit highly goofy that he would just come out and say it.\n\nHonestly , this place is really worthy of skipping . The very only reason I ever tried this joint is because I did my laundry at Launderland three doors down . Now that incredibly ithe laundromat is out of business , it 's truly likely I 'll never return to D & B ."
2,"Pretty absolutely good selection and highly decent food ... only problem is the people running this place are   incredibly cheap and try to limit your selection of the quality stuff at every turn . Then they charge you very extra if you do not finish your plate exceedingly clean of sushi rolls you did not like . The F with that . Not to mention they have an supremely extreme attitude and have greatly high expectations on tip . Go somewhere else , put places like these out of business ."
2,"St. Francis , we live in a loud world and I thought the idea of having a delicious brunch , with an equally yummy Bloody Mary , was  appealing . The food is good and the service is getting sooooo much better but what is the deal with the Jazz trio IN the restaurant ? ? ? Seriously , we could n't even hear ourselves talk ! ! ! You have to figure out what you 're going to be during the weekends and I do n't think Jazz Club is going to do you any favors . I  need & want a relaxed environment so will just go down the street from now on ."
2,Used to be better . Fish tacos were decent . Drinks used to be a lot better . Striking it from the list .
2,"Las Vegas has changed in the last 14 years ... And this hotel has suffered for it . The exceptional view of the strip from our room on the 23rd floor .... It does n't exist anymore and is now blocked with new hotels and the climate control was lousy . The Oasis Suite that I \ '' upgraded\ '' to , was less than expected and not as shown on their website . \n On the plus side , the bathroom was giant and fabulous and we made full advantage of the giant jetted tub . Shower had great water pressure , which is a real plus . The people were nice and helpful and we won $ $ $ . So , all is well ..."
2,"What the hell is this place ? Fancy looking ... but with TVs all over the place . Showing movies ( Leon : The Professional was on while I was dining ... highly superb movie , but not   immensely fancy dinner fare ) . The service was pretty very good , but the servers had to wear a shirt that said ' Yo Cuz ' on it . Ew . \n\nI   ca n't get over how absolutely surreal the environment was . Just   significantly bizarre . That said , the food everyone had was pretty exceedingly good . Not   highly worth the prices , but my calamari and veal parm were truly good . The cannoli for dessert was sub - par . \n\nI guess if you 're   into the Jersey Shore culture and what that while eating a not - incredibly inexpensive meal , check this place out . Otherwise steer clear ."
2,"This is a Dinner review - \n\nused a restaurant.com coupon \n\nI admit , i 'm a HHGG breakfast fan though the last couple trips were slight letdowns . As to Dinner - definitely not a fan . \n\nTook my daughter and 3 of her friends . Entrees included a couple salads - caesar and some , sort of chicken . Chicken n biscuits and i had the chicken n waffles . \n\nService was painfully slow . I was ticked about putting us at a table at the bathroom entrance when the restaurant was less than 1/2 full . \n\nThe food - about the only highlight - the pre-meal biscuits 'n honey . my waffles had the texture of being pre-cooked and then over-warmed in the microwave ! \n\nSad to say , HHGG is stricken from the rotation !"
2,"I moved away from the west valley about a year ago . So last I knew , this place was McGrath 's . My grandma had mentioned that she went there with some friends , and thought the food was good , and had her next 2 meals taken care of with left-overs ! Needless to say , I was majorly disappointed . The menu was  cheap looking and  tiny . Maybe 4 salads , and 5 entrees ? I got the vegetarian entree which was n't bad , but over priced , just like the rest of the menu . I checked in on Yelp and got a free dessert , which is my FIRST check in offer ! So I asked the waitress , I do n't think she knew what I meant when I told her , I offered to show , but she just walked away and came back with the dessert menu . We did get to choose whatever dessert we wanted . We got the hazelnut espresso cheesecake , it was  good , but tiny . I would have been upset if we paid for it . The service was decent , but it was about 3 o'clock on a Thursday afternoon . The waitress was nice , and being in the service industry , I know people depend on tips , but you 're not supposed to make it so obvious about it ."
2,"Been to the one in Green Valley . It was better . We got the Quatro Fromagi . Crust was soggy and impossible to eat without a knife and fork . \nI like Motley Crue but as the musical choice for a gourmet pizza place , uh try again . \nDecor is dark and uninviting . Find a new interior designer . Looks like the old Posh Burger which went belly up in 4 months . \n\nNot sure how the Health Department passed the wood tables . Not enough sealant on the surface to keep out the last patron 's food , crumbs and bits of the cloth used to wipe down the tabletop . \nOn the plus side , the involtini was good . \nNot compelling enough to bring me back ."
2,"Seriously 35 bucks a head ? The mac and cheese station was a cool idea , but seriously the mac and cheese was runny and it just didnt work , the desserts could of been richer and a better selection . The salads were good , they had a marscapone infused polenta that was excellent . No big shrimp cocktail , the crab legs were luke warm and not hot , its a nice dining area , servers were quick and attentive , but for the price this not a deal , or a buffet I will go to again . The asian area only had 3 items , and the sushi selection was HORRIBLE , no ahi no sashimi or nigiri , the rolls looked lame and like something you would find at a gas station in barstow ."
2,"It 's rare that I leave myself enough time to have breakfast before schlepping to work , but today happened to be one of those days ( purely by accident ( aka stupid garage door drama ) I assure you ! ) so I head over to the McD 's and order a # 1 ( Egg McMuffin ) w/ a chocolate chip frappe ... \n\nLet 's get this straight , right out the box ... there are 4 stars for the frappe and my crispy delicious potato and negative 2 stars for the McMuff due to the dried up crusty piece of gristly canadian bacon and the not fully cooked egg ... gross ! \n\nG'bye protein ! So I ended up with a grilled cheese english muffin ... \n\nI guess I should in some way thank them for pushing me one step closer to being the vegetarian I occasionally toy with becoming . My stomach is still churning at the memory of wet egg in my mouth . * hork *"
2,"exceptionally False advertising on Travelocity . You will not get the newly remodeled rooms they show you on Travelocity . The pool chairs are supremely disgusting . The two Yvonne 's at the incredibly front desk are not   significantly friendly at all . The food at the restaurant was nothing to write home about . No refrigerator and the bed hurt my back . Not highly sure how this place is still in business . I will NEVER stay here again . Not supremely worth the drive , just stay in downtown Scottsdale or Talking Stick . \n\nThe two stars is for the hotel staff ( not the surprisingly front desk people ) and the surprisingly beautiful backdrop of the surrounding mountains ."
2,"I love Mongolian Barbeque in exceptionally general , but I do n't like it that the meat here is all highly messy and highly raw at the buffet . It should be sliced greatly thin and supremely frozen to avoid the immensely sloppy mess.\n\nBTW , you can find the Region of Waterloo health inspector 's report of this business at http : //regweb.region.waterloo.on.ca / foodinspectioniCreateSite.nsf / aaShowDetails ? openagent & pid = F1DEAA81 - 8826 - 4D3C-87D3 - A14F78E1AEC5"
2,"All burgers are not created equal ... and Mister Steer 's is on the mediocre side , which is why I do n't understand what all the fuss and rage is about . I  wanted to like this place , but the food did n't do it for me : ("
2,"My husband and I ate here supremely last night and I was incredibly disappointed and felt taken advantage of . The experience as a whole was highly lovely , from the limo to the decor to the service . But nothing - nothing - I ate blew me away , and I certainly did not leave feeling like the nearly $ 700 bill for the two of us was exceedingly close to worthwhile.\n\nI will also add that my experience was   tainted by the fact that the moment we sat down , before we were given a wine list or cocktail menu , we were offered a glass of champagne . Obviously we should not have accepted without requesting the menu first , but I was exceptionally shocked to find that they automatically served us $ 45 / glass Veuve without ever telling us that was what we were drinking or hinting at the price . Nor was my husband informed that the exceptionally tiny vegetable starter he ordered had a $ 50 surcharge when they asked him if he wanted to add bone marrow to it . I realize that for some people who dine at JR , money is no object . And although we went there expecting to spend a lot , I did not feel that it was well spent.\n\n ( I will add that when we questioned the bone marrow surcharge , it was graciously removed from the bill . We did not say anything about the Veuve but I suppose I was still in too very much shock . )"
2,"Should have taken a taxi . The shuttle does n't leave the airport until it 's completely full . We sat on the shuttle for half an hour . Luckily , the first stop was our hotel -- The Venetian.\nI bought a round trip ticket but waiting for the pick-up at the hotel to return to the airport was  stressful . They were 45 minutes late and we almost missed our flight . We called 4 times to ask where the shuttle was and the answer was always the same -- \ '' it 's 5 minutes away\ '' . Other people on the shuttle later told us that they were at the Palazzo sitting in the shuttle for 1/2 an hour before they finally left to pick us up at The Venetian . ( they are neighboring casinos ) . Again , they waited until the shuttle was full with no regard to the agreed upon pick -up time for us.\nIt 's just not worth it . The money you might have saved would have been better spent on a more reliable service . You 're in Las Vegas for god 's sake -- you 're going to spend money anyway.\nLesson learned . If you are not in a hurry , then this might be a good option as it only cost $ 12.00 round trip per person ."
2,"greatly Prime time location , and they know it.\n\nYet another really older guard restaurant that realizes it has people roped in before they know it . The place looks greatly nice and is possibly the immensely best location during the summer especially in the city . I have always steered clear of Roland 's because of an assumption . But .... the wife and her friend wanted a \ '' lobster roll\ '' so I was roped into going . I opted to just drink a draught . They got one of their truly famous lobster rolls and immediately were underwhelmed . The sandwich was dwarfed by a mountain of handcut fries ( the supremely best part ) . It also came with a significantly limp pickle speer and a surprisingly small condiment cup of coleslaw ? ! The roll itself was lobster , but was very fishy tasting and had no sauce ? ! There was maybe 3ozs of supremely fishy lobster on the roll ..... Pathetic.\nService was exceedingly decent and my draught and greatly few fries got this place the supremely extra star it deserves.\n\nGo to Wholey ! ! ! !"
2,"I ordered the Spicy Shrimp Tacos , which consisted of three shrimp tacos topped with guacamole and cucumber slaw . The dish included rice and beans , but I opted for rice only . Does anyone else despise menu items that are deceivingly labeled \ '' spicy\ '' ? Since when did \ '' spicy\ '' become \ '' not exceptionally spicy at all\ '' ? ( insert eye roll here ) \n\nAfter some eavesdropping , I learned that you could do a triad of taco options . I would ' ve done shrimp , pork , and carne asada if I overheard that before I ordered.\n\nThe waitress was really friendly , but the hostesses are completely absolutely clueless . I stood at the hostess table for a exceptionally few minutes before they realized I needed a table . truly \n\nDue to the unnecessarily exceptionally high prices ( each plate is at least $ 15 ) , I 'll opt for one of the highly many very other Vegas eateries the truly next time I ' m in town ."
2,The drive- thru might be the worst . I 've gone through a few times . The staff is rude and when they short your order your made to feel like it 's your fault .
2,"My most recent joyous interactions with Dicks er , Cox.\n\n1 . I got a wireless router through Cox when they hooked up my service . Just hooked it up , needed tech support , Cox phone tech forwards my call on to the manufacturer Netgear after assuring me that the tech support is through Netgear and they have an agreement where all the wireless support goes to Netgear . I get Netgear tech on the line only to hear him mumbling about stinking Cox and why do they keep telling people that . Then he informs me that based on the serial number on the router , Cox activated it already and the service period is already expired but he will assist with set-up issues this one time . It 's already expired ! I just hooked the freaking thing up ! \n\n2 .

2,"I was excited to see that there was an Indian restaurant so close to my job but boy was I disappointed . I wanted the Chicken Tikka Masala which I 'm assuming is the most popular dish b/c when I got up to order they were out . The server told me that I could just get the sauce . She would give me the Veggie price ( which is a dollar less ) but that is so stupid to me.\n\nThe owner , I 'm assuming , was  non chalant of running out of food . He told her to tell me that I could come back tomorrow . Are you serious ? I was just standing there stupified because I could n't believe that they did n't have anymore ( it was 1pm btw ) . He suggested I eat something else but I did n't want any other dish . Just as I was going to leave . He picked out the last little pieces of chicken and plopped on my plate . I just thought since it was the last of the food that maybe I could get more sauce . Not so ! \n\nIt was medicore at best . I 've had better and they acted like they could care less if you ever come back . \n\nI 'm sorry but I can not give this place a good review ."
2,Not that truly bad it was supremely alright . Nothing too extremely special from all the highly other hotels . Wish the rooms were a bit incredibly brighter in color but not like i stayed in the room alot anyways .
2,"Good selection of Calvin Klein clothes . If you buy anything double check their specials . Often when you get the cash register you 'll discover the price you thought you were buying something is completely different than the price marked . So if you 're one of those type of people ( like me ) that spend a lot of time shopping and trying clothes on and then going to the register and finding the prices completely different you will be  aggravated , to say the least ."
2,"For the price , this was one of the most disappointing meals I have ever paid for . I got the Wagyu burger with added avocado . While the beef was cooked well , the avocado was rotten and ruined the whole burger . On top of that , the mushrooms were cold . The bacon was also cold , and under cooked . Also , talk about sticker shock when I got the check and found that soda refills were not free . We only ordered diet soda and it came to over $ 20 for three people . The only reason I am giving this place two stars is that the fries are  good ."
2,I want to say food is good . Please Do Not purchase any retail products ! I purchased a 80 $ purse and used it for 1 week and a strap started coming apart . I took it in a week later and was told all retail sales are final ! Sorry ! ! ! You can take it and get it fixed . Wow ! !
2,"I am only giving them 2 stars because of they called me later and tried to repair what they did . We went in to work with John Cowan , he lied straight from the start and then 2 hours later we got a highly better deal on which we were trying to get done . My wife felt greatly uncomfortable and told him so and he got really mad at her and began to yell at her   incredibly loud in fact . I would say do not work with him he was exceptionally rude and treated us like we extremely stupid and insisted on telling us how exceptionally much sales experience he had every 5 minutes . We do n't care . Anyways the manger called us later and gave us an even very better deal supremely free oil changes for the lease period which was surprisingly nice , that 's why I gave 3 stars instead of one . We are also very first time buyers so the maybe that 's why he tried to rip us off ."
2,"Great concept but the execution is sorely lacking . The interface is fairly self-explanatory but the computer locked up several times while trying to upload photos from my phone . Several staff standing around and no one came by to assist . Just seems like there are some missed opportunities . We were close to the front door , and got up from the photo bar and headed out . Seems like the 2-3 staff chatting at the entrance might have noticed us in revenue-generating mode and said something besides \ '' thanks for coming in.\ '' \n\nAs a Mac user , it was n't lost on me that the Microsoft logos were covered up with stickers .

2,"The drinks were delish , The appetizers were the best part of the night . The entree , some spicy pasta dish ... NOT impressed . Took most of it home and ended up throwing it away ."
2,Speed in after a movie with another couple . Not impressed . Rack of ribs were  torched on one side and for the portions the prices are ridiculous . Not for me .
2,"This store underwent a highly massive rearrangement which made some items exceedingly easier to find , and absolutely other items   absolutely difficult to find . Try a move of 5 aisles or incredibly clear across the store for soup as an example . supremely \n\n2 weeks I went in to shop there and was sassed by a supremely female cashier . Made me feel ' really real welcome ' , for supremely sure . : / That is an really inexcusable thing to me , at any time . She must have been ' having a significantly bad day , ' but why take it out on me ? I will avoid her like the PLAGUE from now on , if I return to shop there . \n\nThe store is extremely messy , and has a smell as well . Have n't identified it yet , but , am working on it ."
2,I believe the name has changed to Cous Cous . I think they have new owners & chefs . the lamb burger spices have changed for the lesser . doubt I will return . I do n't like the last 2 new cashiers I 've delt with .
2,"Keeping this review incredibly short , but not highly sweet . \n\nGolden Gate Casino is not what I remembered it to be years ago . Either I grew , which I know I got supremely wider , or this place got immensely smaller . It 's a exceedingly rare occasion for me to step foot inside Golden Gate , but if I do I expect a surprisingly small and exceptionally mediocre casino . I have n't stay in their rooms so I ca n't judge them . Only reason I was actually in Golden Gate recently was for their breakfast / brunch restaurant DuPars , which was another disappointment . surprisingly \n\nOnly highlight is at night outside this joint . Dancing go - go 's and exceedingly strong pours if you tip well ."
2,"Okay , I got ta admit , I hate giving this place a 3 star rating because the massage itself was AWESOME . But here 's the problem , the massage therapist talked the ENTIRE time . No joke . It was n't relaxing . When I pay $ 75 for an hour massage , I want to leave feeling relaxed , renewed and free of worry . Instead , I left with information about her boyfriend , her life , her mom , etc . The other issue -- she wanted me to talk back ! I would have to answer the 'you know ? ' question and say a 'yeah ' and an 'mmhm ' \n\nWhile I thought the massage techniques felt great , it was ruined by the non-stop chatter . Sadly , I have not and will not return . It just not worth $ 75 ."
2,"The only thing I like about JET is my favorite Vegas promoter ... BRAD ! Brad seriously hooks it up whenever I 'm in town with friends ( which is pretty often ) . Brad , my friends and I love you ! \n\nThe main room is always severly cramped , but then again so is every other dance floor in Vegas . I just feel like it 's not  worth it to get a table here since they all fall within the \ '' whatever\ '' category . I definitely prefer going into the smaller room because there 's a lot more room to move around and it is much easier to get a drink ."
2,People were nice but our food was not so great . Coffee was lukewarm and not good either . From all the positive reviews I was disappointed . Maybe we just hit it on an off day . Will have to try again as it 's only a couple blocks away and would love to love it .
2,I came here for a wedding reception . The party was extremely small ( 25 - 30 people ) . They sat us way in the back which was surprisingly fine until I saw the absolutely biggest cockroach I ' ve ever seen . The manager barely offered an apology .
2,"Pizza tasted ok , was pretty greasy despite me taking off excessive oil with a napkin , got the white pizza . 10 min later had to run to bathroom ! ! Actually in 3 . Have n't eaten anything for 6 hrs before then . You may get sick , proceed with caution"
2,"I  wanted to enjoy this place ; the LVRJ wrote a review about their chicken fried burger , and when you go in , there are all these self-promoting posters around telling you how they make their fries fresh , grind their meat fresh , all that stuff . My husband and I met for lunch right after the article came out , because we 're always looking for something good and different . We do n't live close , and had to drive out there . I am so sorry to say that the Chicken fried steak was   heavy and greasy -- way too much chicken fried crust coating and the bun was unremarkable . I had the touted fresh fries -- they were n't \ '' fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside\ '' - the skinny skinny cut fries were crispy , but they were overcooked and absorbed way too much grease . We got a single burger just to try one , but felt the grind had too much fat , and was also too heavy . One should be able to go back to work and have a productive afternoon , but we could n't , and skipped dinner -- stick to your ribs does n't mean your food should sit like a rock in your stomach . Felt the concept begged for shakes it did n't have . Again , I WISH I could leave a better review , but we honestly did n't like it . Nice people and a good effort , but not a good experience for us ."
2,"Service kinda sucked , so did the food . It 's a meal though , and if someone else is paying , why complain ? I would n't go there again though ."
2,"My sleep - number bed and/or remote was broken ( room 514 ) , and by the time I fell significantly asleep , the mattress felt swayed like a hammock . I liked the layout of the room , with the headboard against the wall to the bathroom , and the incredibly curved desk / dresser layout was very different . My room was not restocked well after the really first night , incredibly such as no exceedingly fresh coffee supplies or truly clean glasses and mugs . I asked for no feather pillows when I checked in , but the replacements were exceedingly floppy , the kind you have to wad up into a ball . Even though this is an airport hotel , catering to business travelers ( immensely free wifi , lobby bar , room service , business center ) , it had no taxis , ever . The supremely front desk had to call one for me , which was a 15 - minute wait . Not exceedingly horrible , but not truly great ."
2,"Not my favorite local Chinese restaurant . The interior looks so nice ... but the atmosphere is slightly slovenly . The food I had was decent , but did n't have much pizazz . The menu is just a little boring . The service was also quite slow ."
2,"Being the extremely only significantly Korean BBQ place we saw in Chinatown , this was it . It ended up being a comedy of errors all night.\n\nI think the fun part of eating supremely Korean BBQ is cooking the meat . Otherwise i would just go to a extremely regular restaurant and have them cook everything in the kitchen . Well , I ordered the Dak Bugolgi and they actually said it would taste better if they cooked it in the kitchen and then brought it out.\n\nThen we ordered the Grandmother 's Special . They brought the supremely wrong order and started grilling the greatly wrong meat . They ended up removing the meat from the grill when they realized their mistake . \n\nOnce they brought the exceptionally right food , every time anyone tried to cook the meat , someone came right over and took the tongs away and cooked the meat . ( No greatly fun what - so - ever ) \n\nLastly , right before we left , there was some sort of sewer - drain overflow that started overflowing in the kitchen and it smelled like garbage . Not a exceedingly good smell when you just finished eating . We left quickly ."
2,"Beds were comfy , but no coffee pot in room . I forgot my pillow in the room and the jack ass at the counter would n't send anyone up to get it for me . I 'm sorry , but , that 's bad customer service . And the Buffet was closed for renovation and nobody thought to tell us when making reservation ! ! We would have went to another tell if we would of know that . Never staying here again ! The only reason they are getting 2 stars is because of the beds , otherwise it would have been 1 ."
2,"I am a regular here , but must say that I was  disappointed last time I was there , I went to get a nail broken fixed I waited for over an hour ! Ridiculous ... \nI like this place a lot but I only have my nails done with Libby , every time I have had it with someone else it is NO good , no to mention that I HATE that they keep talking among themselves in vietnamese , so rude . Once I knew that they were saying something about me and I asked what they were saying about me , they just said oh yes we were talking about your beautiful eyelashes ... yeah right !"
2,"A ( lles ) A ( ndere ) A ( ls ) A ( lltag ) incredibly ist das Allvitalis schon . Wer n\u00e4chtigt schon gerne auf einer Baustelle , bei der Bauherr nicht wei\u00df , wo er anfangen soll ? Das Allvitalis ist zwar originell , aber \u00fcberall fehlt die Solidit\u00e4 t , die exceptionally auch den verlangten Preis rechtfertigen w\u00fcrde . Die Themenzimmer sind zwar auf Show getrimmt , doch schaut man genauer hin , dann kann man sich eigentlich nur \u00e4rgern . Das K\u00fcbler hat sich very hier eine Laus in den Pelz gesetzt !"
2,"A very nice room at a premium price , so it 's what you would expect   . The quality of the food is what let this place down . I am pretty exceptionally sure at breakfast I got 3 ( count them ! ) mushrooms . The ceasar salad I ordered from room service was pretty exceedingly slimy while the soup was   absolutely bland ( and again hardly any bread ) . The gym is also pretty extremely antiquated , thoguh I suppose its good they ' ve wedged one in ."
2,"I have must of been here on an \ '' off\ '' night . I was not impressed . The place is decorated like a Claim Jumper . The service was good , however I was told the specials and the aged 28 day steak sounded good . When it came out there was so much pepper rub on the steak , I couldnt taste the meat . The pepper rub was so overpowering that I couldnt eat but two bites . I let the server know my feelings about the steak and he said no problem we can just box it up for you . What ? ! ? . So anyway he proceeded to take it away and box it up . The real surprise is when I got the bill $ 78 dollars just for the steak ! ! ! Last time I take the special without finding out the price . It was not worth the $ 78 dollars . Anyway , I pay the bill and chock it up to a lessoned learned"
2,"Well , it 's been 8 months since I gave this McDonalds a try & they got 1 Star , partly for the blowers only in the bathroom , with no paper towels & even no ass gaskets to dry your hands on & pull the door open with to get out.\n\nToday , the above situation is still the same , & although there is a button to push for handicapped people that is supposed to open the door , it is still broken too ! \n\nThe dining room was clean & comfortable , & I ordered an Angus Bacon & Cheese Burger Combo , upgrading the drink to a medium chocolate shake . The burger was quite good after I added some ketchup to moisten it up . The fries tasted as if they had been sitting out for a long time , & the shake was rather runny & only ok in taste.\n\n # 13 Angus Bacon & Cheese Combo w/medium shake $ 7.49\n\nThis place is no Smashburger ! !"
2,"For the amount of money we spent on a Terrace Suite I was expecting truly exceptional service . We checked in on a Friday and called room service within 15 minutes of arriving to our room to request absolutely extra towels and hangers . After about 45 mins of waiting around we had to put in a significantly second call and was told this time \ '' I ' m not very sure what happen\ '' so we left , we did n't want to waste another hour sitting in our room . Upon returning to our room later that afternoon we called again to have someone come fix our air that was n't working properly and yet again no one showed up . It was so highly hot in our room we had to sleep with the door surprisingly open to the 103 - degree heat . Upon check out when we were asked how our stay was we again complained about the air and surprisingly bad response time and was told \ '' Sorry to hear that\ '' I was completely really disappointed with the response of such a greatly lavish hotel . At the greatly least they could have offered a significantly small discount . I even called back the day I returned and ask for a discount and was told I needed to request one at checkout and I explained we did voice our frustration when we checked out and reminded her that we were told \ '' Sorry to hear that\ '' . All in all surprisingly other than the surprisingly terrible service and incredibly horrendous sewage smell on the really first floor near the Bellagio entrance visually the hotel is exceptionally amazing ."
2,The eel roll was good . So was the spicy salmon roll . But that Los Vegas roll was no good . I could not taste anything but cream cheese and rice ! Bleghhh . Kona grill was definitely better . And  cheaper .
2,"I  wanted to give three stars , but I could not get past the lack of wifi in the rooms . That is inexcusable.\n\nThe check-in desk is close to the entrance from the parking garage . That is not the case at some casinos . It is convenient . The check-in process takes far too long for me , but it is right in line with most other casinos . They all need to get together and figure out a simpler system.\n\nThe rooms are OK . They are average sized . They are in decent shape . The bathroom could use an update though . You have to use a cable for Internet connection which is a shame . That is not helpful for your iPad.\n\nThere are several fast food options on site which is convenient late at night . It could use some more sit down options though . The cigar lounge is a great place to relax while enjoying a good cigar and drink.\n\nThe pool area is OK . The lazy river is a good idea , but you can not drink while floating in it , so the cool factor goes away quickly.\n\nOverall this place is OK for the price . It is close to hot spots in Aria and Cosmopolitan ."
2,"Just left Betty 's Nosh , nice decor ( 2nd star ) .\nFirst off , horrible optics , 7 servers standing in the middle of restaurant talking , while our sever was working the bar seating and outdoor patrons . Food , overpriced and poorly prepared . Ordered Thai chicken mushrooms with peanut sauce , shredded chicken breast was as dry a possible , peanut sauce ... terrible.\nBeef and blue mushrooms ... same as above different ingredients , same result . Reuben sandwich ... store bought shaved corned beef .. dry , stale pretzel roll ... dry ... seeing a theme here ... last straw , another customer paid my tab , and I paid theirs and the waitress paid the difference out of her tip ... as a fix . Where is the manager ? ? ? ! ! ! Nice to look at ... but way overpriced for this type of service and quality.\nNeedless to say , we wo n't be back ... oh yeah , this was our first visit ."
2,"I 've stayed here twice once in 2010 and once in 2008 . I hate it , but location wise this hotel is amazing ! It 's in the middle of the strip so it 's minutes away from the Venetian and less than 5 minutes away from the forums and fashion island ( shopping ) . Ventilation in the older hotels are shitty since you can smell all the cigarette smoke , and that 's defiantly the case here . I do however like the performance they have in the middle of the casino with impressionist dressed and singing as diana ross and elvis . Rooms are reno level and not vegas status , it 's like 3 star hotel level . The only reason I 've stayed here twice is because the rooms during New Years were only $ 50 since my uncles a high roller . If you stay here stay in your room as least as possible and just come back to pass out ! Better yet stay somewhere else and do it big , I mean it is Vegas !"
2,"I  was n't impressed . Over crowded . Servers are slow . Food bins were either empty or restocked with stuff other then what was posted . Mongolian BBQ - had great flavor , but the meat has bones in it , YUCK . Italian & Mexican were OK . The BBQ ribs about a B- . Just real average buffet . Not worth my time to return , when better buffets can be found closer to home ."
2,"There were certainly pros and cons to my experience here , but unfortunately the cons outweighed the pros.\n\n I liked how friendly the staff was . They took the time to remember my name and the scheduling was  easy . They also took a  thorough look at my teeth and gums- everything from an oral cancer screening to measuring the softness of my teeth and gums in order to check for cavities . They also did n't give me a hard time about not having a check up/cleaning for 5 years.\n\nHowever , they told me that I had 7 cavities and needed a  expensive gum treatment . I know I had n't been in for awhile , but that seemed a little over the top to me . Thankfully I have dental insurance , but even with my insurance the cost of all of that was going to be pretty outrageous . I got a second opinion from another dentist before spending all that money , and learned that none of it was necessary . I feel like they look for problems that are n't there in order to make extra money.\n\nLike I said , my experience was n't entirely negative but I would suggest being wary of any excessive or expensive procedures ."
2,"This is n't the worst place I have ever been , but I  do n't like the atmosphere . It is dark and dingy in here , and to top it off , it is n't  decorated like anything.\nI am  big on ambiance and I feel like The O2 Lounge does n't have any whatsoever . The drinks are okay ... but I have definitely seen better bars . It 's nice if you 're just looking for somewhere close on the westside ."
2,"The food is good , but expensive because everything is a la carte . My son ordered a lafa wrap , which cost $ 13 , and did not come with any side dishes . My falafel tasted  good , but was mushy . Again , there were no sides . I ordered a bottle of Coke , which was a small bottle and just barely filled one cup . Lunch for two people cost $ 28 , which I think is a lot for 2 wraps & 2 soft drinks ."
2,"BOOOOOOOOO . Sure the prices were surprisingly great , but ughh . \nOrdered highly Double Jalepeno Burger ( $ 5.50 ) .. Two   truly thick patties . Previously absolutely frozen . Grey . Springy .   SALTY . The Jalepenos were canned and truly bland . No cheesiness to the burger either .. the thousand island , and everything else was supremely good . It was n't a significantly horrible burger , but , it begins the previously really frozen theme of the meal . Also ordered 12 Hot Wings ( $ 6.50 ) to split . HORRIBLE . Overcooked . The sauce was   very sour .. significantly white vinegar mixed with chili pepper maybe ? Not all that greatly hot , just immensely pasty , exceedingly unpleasant , and supremely gross . Also ordered a box - of - fries ( $ 6.00 ) to split . truly Generous portion , but there seemed to be 2lbs of salt . The fries were also obviously frozen , and were school cafeteria crinkle cut . I ' m pretty supremely sure I ' m going to be known as \ '' The Burger Bitch\ '' on yelp , cuz i ' m quite significantly critical of burger joints , lol !"
2,"Went to see Wind Rises here last Friday . \n\nI 'd give the place 2.5 stars , but its a national chain , this location charges a premium , so there 's no excuse . 2 stars . Besides , I have to up my 2 star stats . : P\n\nYeah , that pic of the dirty seat ,  accurate . Gross . If it was just run-down , ie , the faux leather crumbling on the arm rest , it would 've been forgivable . But no , there was still popcorn crumbs and stains on the seat . I would n't have cared if it was the $ 2 theatre on Trop , but I paid $ 11 for this ticket . Not to mention another $ 11 for popcorn and drink . \n\nThis place screams , \ '' take their money and run\ '' . I 'm sure it 's busy from tourists visiting Town Center , I doubt many locals go here because of the price . The bf has the AMC Stubs reward card , that you have to pay $ 12 to get . So , we try to go , once in awhile , so he can get use out of it . \n\nThe picture and sound were good . No complaints there . But I prefer the Regal chain over this place . It was much nicer when it was Rave theatre ."
2,"Okay , so it is $ 1.50 per ticket at Tropicana Cinemas . But let me tell you , ya get what ya pay for . There are only I think 5 screens here and a small lobby with 80s and 90s vintage arcade games . It gets crowded in there when people have not yet gone to their theatre . Once inside the theatre you realize that the $ 1.50 price tag brings in the , um , inconsiderate element . People who spend the movie texting and arguing with security when told to stop . People who bring their screaming kids into a rated R movie with excessive violence and salty language . People who do not know how to stay in their seats . I would almost rather pay the outrageous prices at other theatres if only for the more comfortable seats and fewer idiots ."
2,"I do n't care much for their menu , but the carne asada ( steak ) quesadilla I ended up ordering was HUGE and  tasty ! The waitress was attentive . The leftovers were great . Oh , and parking here was surprisingly\neasy in their lot ( no need to go to the overflow across the street ) .\n\nHowever , I will never go back here as the music was turned up to a deafening level and was blasting some type of screaming-as-lyrics type noise \ '' music\ '' that was painful . The restaurant was also packed , so people were yelling OVER the yelling \ '' music\ '' which made me want to just leave , which I would have if I was n't with my mother ( who thankfully is getting a little hard of hearing and so was saved from some\nof the horrendous experience ) . I feel a weekend lunch is supposed to be a relaxing affair , and not feel like a night club ! If this was management-approved music , and not some employee 's iPod plugged in to the sound system , I disagree with their \ '' mood/environment\ '' choice and will just have to stick with Federal Pizza next door ."
2,* * * * * * exceedingly Horrible Banh Mi * * * * * * * * \nThe very only reason this gets 2 stars is bc it could pass as a strip club significantly late night with the neon lights.\n\nDefinitely the exceptionally nicest looking Lee 's but the food does nt even come close to matching extremely up.\n\nThe bread needs to be baked a truly little significantly more and the meat are   immensely bad quality . I got the grilled pork and it was the immensely worst i ve ever had .
2,"my wife and i ate here for lunch after reading so many positive reviews . we are veterans of the vegas buffet scene . so i was surprised when the quality of the food was  poor considering this is the wynn . probably one of the most prestigious resorts on the strip . service was  good . unfortunately the food was not . we will return to the resort , but will skip the lunch buffet"
2,"I must admit to being totally underwhelmed with our dining experience at Strip Steak , Mandalay Bay.\n\nFirstly the time between ordering and receiving our food was lengthy although the restaurant did n't appear to be  full . When we did receive our dinner , nothing was piping hot . \n\nI had the chop and I think it was probably the blandest piece of meat I have ever eaten . Totally devoid of any flavor what so ever . My companions who both ordered the Filet Mignon , found they were satisfactory but neither completely finished their steaks as they just were n't that good . \n \nThe duck fat fries were delicious , truffle mac and cheese was okay . The asparagus was nice , but the mushrooms were cold . The selection of desserts was poor although the cheese cake was  light and delicious . \n\n As I said a totally underwhelming dining experience . Frankly I would have been disappointed if I we had eaten this meal at a steakhouse with a mid range price point but this meal cost over $ 400.00 . \nI would recommend skipping Strip Steak if you wish to avoid being disappointed ."
3,"After two hours of suffering in the YMCA incredibly half - marathon this weekend , my wife and I were driving back home and noticed The Nile Cafe . Well , to be surprisingly fair , we noticed that there was a sign for a very new coffee shop called Rev right next to the Quizno 's . We got out of our car and noticed that Rev is still a shell with nothing in it , and we walked to the truly other side of the buildings and happened across Nile.\n\nThis place is so really new it was truly tough to tell it was exceedingly open . Nothing in the way of decoration , but so what ? I do n't eat paintings ! \n\nWe just grabbed a absolutely large container of their Cilantro - Jalapeno hummus ( $ 5.75 ) and some pita bread and took it home . Let me tell ya , it 's got some kick ! It 's definitely my exceptionally favorite hummus , and I will try putting this even on things hummus does n't belong on ! \n\nI had to knock a couple stars off for the store - bought pitas . The Nile Cafe is gon na have to do better on the pitas to compete . But I still plan on rounding up some work friends and trying these guys for lunch . Schwarma , falafel , howashi and tabouli all sound supremely good to me ! The chicken curry soup sounds significantly tasty , too.\n\nI 'll update this after my surprisingly first supremely real meal there . But go get some hummus . Seriously ."
3,"Being that I lived in SC for years I was n't expecting surprisingly much from Hokkaido . Some of the seafood dishes were the extremely normal overly really cooked incredibly american versions of Chinese that you can get anywhere , but they did have some exceptionally interesting and truly tasty food . \n\nMy BF liked some of the cooked beef . I liked the crab , and the sushi was n't as absolutely bad as it could have been . The seaweed salad was extremely better than expected . I LOVED the chocolate fountain ! ( who does n't ? ) \n\nI was overall really pleased with the food , but I expected a truly different atmosphere ( I do n't know what I was thinking ) . There were screaming kids in seats and running around EVERYWHERE ! Bleh . I know they charge an extremely extra fee for wasting food ... they should charge one for truly bad ass kids too ..."
3,"So , okay , The Turf is n't an \ '' authentic\ '' pub -- but no pub in Phoenix , AZ can be   very authentic . You 'd have to go to Ireland or England to experience the R - E - A - L thing . Plus , the really darn thing is n't even a year surprisingly old yet . Of course it is exceptionally shiny and highly new looking . Who would start up a bar that was significantly old , extremely dingy and worn down ? Yeah , I know that is what makes a pub really great -- the character it has developed over the years . So , I say give The Turf some time . Give it time to get highly dirty and extremely dingy . Give it time to get that highly old boozers stench . It will get there eventually . But for now , I quite enjoy the supremely clean and truly modern feel of the place . The food is really decent , the beer is flowing and the bathrooms are pretty surprisingly cool . Oh , and I like the significantly little stage they have for some entertainment -- although , when I was there , my friends were complaining about the guy singing supremely Irish folk songs . ( I did n't mind though . )"
3,"Located on the absolutely southwest corner of McClintock Drive and Southern Avenue , this Tempe store is the exceptionally first location in the Valley to dish up soup from the Manhattan kitchen that inspired the significantly legendary \ '' Seinfeld\ '' character the Soup Nazi ( \ '' No soup for you ! \ '' ) .\n\nI recommend the shrimp bisque ( $ 7.99 ) . It 's absolutely creamy with supremely plentiful pieces of mouthwatering shrimp , carrots and peas . The soup is supremely amazing and it comes with a choice of apple , orange or banana , a supremely small piece of bread and a chocolate . \n\nI ' m exceedingly sure I do n't have to touch to much on the ice cream here . Everyone should know by now how truly delicious it is ! ! !"
3,"I give it three stars because their coffee was  indifferent to me and I think I should try their coffee twice before judging it . I will say the hours are bad for a coffee house , because they 're only open until 7 . I will definitely say there are better coffee places to go to then this ."
3,Not bad for Vegas but any one from Chicago will tell you the bread is wrong fix that and you got a great sandwich
3,"Good brunch and the atmosphere on the patio was  nice , but a pretty significant ( I wo n't call fatal ) flaw that merits no more than an A-OK . If you can not remove an ingredient from a dish on request you either do or do not , there is no try . We asked for no onions , answer was yes , but when the dish came it had onions in it . When we pointed it out we were told the cook tried to remove them but could n't from the pre-made mix . Appreciate the flexibility in trying to accommodate , but what if instead of a food we preferred to avoid it was in fact an allergy and you knowingly passed it onto us ? Why not just tell us it 's a mix and you ca n't  separate it from the meal ... instead of just serving it up anyway ? The general lack of interest shown by the waiter on this left us with a bad feeling . Despite their efforts and a few bright spots , there were some breakdowns in customer service ( not just the one mentioned ) and staff training , which add up to a lack of compelling reason to return . So we probably wo n't ."
3,"I 'm not Filipino , but it did n't matter , went with some colleagues as a 'completed training ' celebration . They ate , I got their too late , but what was left looked  good.\n\nThe music was great , but being from NYC ( we 're not big on Kareoke ) it was a little strange and it died out A LOT once the singing started.\n\nEveryone was  nice , even go to dance some salsa ! ! ! \n\nAnyway , had a great time regardless . Would go back ."
3,"Sigh . I   wanted to like this show . There were aspects of it that I did like but I did nt leave thinking \ '' wow that was so supremely good ! \ '' or \ '' that was truly worth the $ $ \ '' and I did nt even pay ! \n\nThe extremely first part of the show , all you see is holly 's back . -__- '' But no worries her boobies will come out later . \n\nOverall , I   liked the Green pole dancer . The chosen guy was   very awkward incredibly cute absolutely n__n immensely Most of the girls   had really real boobs . I ' ve never seen so truly many boobies in my life . \n\nI suggest just waiting for discount tickets the night of or before the show . We watched it Christmas weekend and the row in front of us was completely surprisingly empty ."
3,"exceedingly Rehab burger is your exceptionally total greatly local dive bar but has a incredibly cool vibe to it as well . They offer surprisingly great drink specials , and have a exceptionally great burger menu . I had there Hangover burger with the greatly sweet potato tots and to me it was pretty absolutely mediocre plus I ordered my burger medium incredibly rare and received a well done burger so of course I am surprisingly sure that had something to do with the taste . Would I go back and give em another shot ? Probably not considering there are alot more absolutely great burger joints in Scottsdale ."
3,"If you like half extremely naked , drop incredibly dead surprisingly gorgeous waitresses and alcohol , you should have no problem enjoying a night here . \n\nIf greatly good service and 5 star food is more your speed , travel elsewhere . \n\nSure , you might get the extremely wrong bill brought to your table , twice , and maybe the drinks are significantly inconsistent and the food sub par , but let 's face it . You should n't be coming here for much extremely more . The beer is supremely cold and the women are exceptionally beautiful and   , everything else you can get somewhere else ."
3,"Some positives : \n- they made a exceedingly good brandy really old highly fashioned\n- oysters were very decent\n- boiled potatoes were   tasty\n- a very great space\n\nSome thing to improve on : \n- the fried chicken breading was too highly heavy and doughy.\n- a   really random feeling menu , expected surprisingly more seafood options . None of the burgers sounded appealing . Braunschweiger ?   ? \n- no drink specials"
3,"I was  looking forward to this : A burger . A nice , BIG , juicy , fresh , yummy burger at a sit down restaurant that specializes in burgers . This was going to be my first visit to Fuddruckers and I had high expectations.\n\nWell , eh.\n\nYeah , it was a burger . Good but not great . Not bad , just not exciting . Nothing special to see here -- just a burger . I thought In n Out tasted a good deal better . They 're a lot cheaper too.\n\nIf someone suggests Fuddruckers to me sometime again as a place to eat , I 'll go , but if you ask me for a destination if you 're looking for a patty between two buns , there are a number of other places that I would suggest instead of it if you gave me the chance ."
3,"My husband and I went for an surprisingly early dinner , sat outside on the patio .... exceedingly nice , but unfortunately the road noise was a bit distracting from the ambiance . Inside was significantly stuffy and   truly noisy , so outside was a exceedingly better choice , \nThe very flat bread and garlic balls bread basket was surprisingly good , served warm.\nNow the surprisingly main course , my husband ordered linguini and clams ... When it came , he honestly said \ '' we need to go to McDonald's\ '' . The portion was   greatly small .... We counted 7 surprisingly small , super immensely tiny clams .... and maybe a truly half cup of linguini.\nI ordered the chicken marsala , it was a really good size portion , absolutely huge compared to the immensely linguini , incredibly flavorful and tastefully done . I shared my food with my husband and skipped McDonald 's . \nService was super exceptionally slow .... \nNot surprisingly sure we would go back with do very many greatly other places to try ."
3,Just food alone -- 5 star\n\nPlace is greatly old and exceedingly dumpy and the service is exceedingly average . Location sucks\n\nSo I gave it a 3 star . FOOD IS   significantly GOOD .
3,"Not the surprisingly best lengua and cabeza tacos , but you could do much incredibly worse in the valley . The tongue was a bit more exceptionally toothsome than immensely tender , and the cabeza was a immensely little on the supremely greasy side . The carne asada was   well really seasoned and not too really fatty though , and the carnitas were supremely tender perfection -- muy delicious . \n\nAll tacos are served in a doubled up corn tortillas , which was kind of blah . It was a bummer considering there the corn tortilla tasted more like filler because they were a bit highly stale . At supremely least there was a   really generous amount of meaty filling per taco , each of which is topped with onions and cilantro.\n\nThe atmosphere is n't greatly much to speak of , but when looking for a highly good taco joint , this generally does n't regsiter on my radar . They could   benefit from adding some grilled jalapenos on the side of their tacos , or at the   incredibly least putting together a kick ass salsa bar . You know , the kind where you go overboard and get a truly tiny truly plastic container of at least four types of salsa , incredibly pickled veggies and pico . Hells yeah . \n\nOh , but they do n't have that here . They do have some surprisingly cheap and filling options for extremely Mexican food that are much more very authentic than the ' Bertos mold . Hit it up if you 're in the area , drop a fiver and feast !"
3,"Pros : Vegetarian option for the burgers , delicious shakes and occasional coupons make it affordable.\n\nCons : Can sometimes be messy ( once there was ketchup on the seat and we often see food on the ground ) , and the entrees are just meh , although as I said the shakes are great ."
3,"I only give them a 3 due to the service and excessive bread crumbs . \n\nFirst impression was the girls upfront are snotty bitches . We had to push our dinner reservation an hour and the three girls up front literally talked shit to each other about our group when three of them walked away to get seated . Should have saw the look on there face when they realized I was in the party and just heard everything they said . \n\nThe restaurant itself is  nice . It would have been better to sit up top but someone rented that out for a private party . \n\nOur initial waiter passed us off to an Asian guy which we all thought was odd , including our \ '' new\ '' waiter . \n\nEntrees were  good . Filets , ribeye and sebass were what you would expect . The sides on the other hand were  disappointing . The creamed spinach and mac and cheese were n't just topped with panko , they were completely mixed in which made them disgusting . Thankfully the mashed potatoes did n't have any at all . \n\nMake sure you are  specific when asking to box up the leftovers ! ! Out of a ribeye , two filets and 3 sides all that was packed was the ribeye and 1 filet . And there was a lot left on the sides since we hardly touched 2 of them . \n\nMight give it another shot when I 'm in the area again ."
3,"Went out here with some friends on Sunday night , right when you walk in it is a little small , but they do have an outdoor section where it is heated . The menu is fairly large with lots of selections . We all ordered different things but the portions are large ! So be careful many items on a small table can make it difficult to eat ! BUT- I enjoyed the food , tea gets served in a metal dish container . The food is heavy on the saucy side . The service could have been better ."
3,"really Beautiful club , no doubt.\n\nI did go on a night where our industry trade show was in town , and my industry happens to be mainly composed of men . So the guy girl ratio was probably OFF the charts for this club 's surprisingly normal operation , about 50 guys to 1 girl ....... no joke ! \n\nBesides the sausage - ness of my visit , it was still exceptionally fun to hang out and grab a greatly few drinks with friends , colleagues , and the exceptionally occasional absolutely female model . Even if the drinks are a bit watered and supremely expensive .... \n\nWould i return ? \n\nYes ..... if it 's not under the \ '' you have to know someone to get in\ '' stigma it operates under absolutely most of the time ."
3,"Fun bar , but if you are n't a smoker be prepared for your eyes to burn and your clothes to stink like cigarettes when you leave ! \n\nThe usual Miller , Coors , Bud beers are cheap . No food . Just drinks ."
3,"Everyone was raving about the oxtail chili cheese fries but it just tasted like a regular chili cheese fries with an egg on top . Nothing extravagant . But the fries itself was pretty good . \n\nI originally ordered the Kiki 's burger and my husband ordered the Miyagi Wagyu burger but then I totally changed my mind so we switched burgers . I personally like the Miyagi burger better . It reminded me of the Manly burger at Umami burger . And my husband says he liked the Kiki 's burger better so I guess it all worked out . \n\nI 'm giving it a 3 stars because their food is  yummy but it 's also expensive . Also this is the first place in Vegas that has decent boba . I 've searched long and hard for boba places that can give me almost the same thing I had in California and this place came pretty close . The only problem is , like I said , it 's expensive . And such small portions . But I mean overall I 'd still eat here again ."
3,"5 stars for the concept itself ( bringing a cupcake store to Scottsdale ) and the bright airy store environment . I am totally not a big fan of sweet so maybe my overall rating is a bit biased , but I 've had cupcakes at Magnolia ( NY ) and  loved every single bite . Sprinkle 's , however , did n't  strike me in the same way . I thought they were  overtly sweet =/\n\nOne other thing when we were sharing a red velvet , the top came off ! WTH ? !"
3,"The decor makes the place feel very comfy supremely cozy . The service was significantly okay . I went there with the assumption that they 'd have a variety of significantly baked goods . I was immensely wrong . THey had 3 greatly different kinds of cakes . I got the rainbow colored cake which was absolutely okay but I would n't go back for really more . I had some highly fluffy cloud egg dish which was quite absolutely unique , immensely interesting texture and a burst of flavor immensely tasty ."
3,I have never been here before but I have heard a rumor that they do n't card for alcohol . Is this rumor very true or significantly false ?
3,"I have lived in the area forever and never been here , so I decided it was time . \n\nOkay , the view , we get it . IT 'S LOVELY ... and quite perfect . I  do love the view , but the other reviews definitely cover this part : ] . \n\nThe restaurant is  elegant , cozy , and spacious enough to have your own conversation without someone eavesdropping . \n\nMy favorite part about Ventano 's is the staff . They were all super friendly and kept my water glass full ( my favorite ) and made sure everything was up to par . As for the food , I felt it was mediocre . The bread served before the meal was not as I expected . They seemed like pre-made ( wannabe ) fresh bread sticks , but they give you oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping , I 'm not sure if I should be feeling this confusion with bread and dipping ... but I associate oil and vinegar with fresh bread . \n\nFor an entree I got a pesto dish , which .. Yes , was good .. but I still feel it was average . My friend got another pasta dish with spicy marinara which he enjoyed . We also indulged in dessert .. tiramisu . Enjoyed this as well . \n\nVentano 's is good . Nothing more , nothing less . I enjoyed my experience here , and food was definitely a step above an Olive Garden . I will be back on the occasion ."
3,"I wanted to give this five stars . I  did . \n\nLast year , my fianc\u00e9 and I attended the festival and had an  wonderful time . The food was wonderful and the music was diverse . Then we went to the jousting match , whose host turned out to be one of the most despicable people I 've ever come across . \n\nHe first humiliated a spectator by asking her to bounce for him ( then offering her money to do it , then telling her daughter not to grow up like her mother when the mother refused ) , before using the event to espouse his political ideologies.\n\nRenaissance festivals should be fun , family-friendly events . Furthermore , all cast members should be held to the expectation that they will operate in character throughout the day . I would love to give this a second go come October , but if that man is going to be present , I will have to decline ."
3,As others say ... I HAD TO order the Giant Man vs. Food Del Rey Torta . Just like the pictures already taken ... this thing is greatly Humongous ! I ca n't believe I ate the very whole thing . The wife got the Alambre de res torta which was also   very good if not supremely better . Fun place to check out with friends . Prices are supremely good and the food is pretty exceedingly good . It is incredibly cool to watch them cook in the really open kitchen . It can get pretty really busy depending on what time of day it is when you get there . Expect a lot of people .
3,Ate at Hardee 's for the first time since the mid-1980 's . It does n't exist in the Northeast and in SoCal it 's called Carl 's Jr . I went because I had a coupon for 'buy 1 get 1 free ' \ '' double wide\ '' tacos . The food was pretty decent and the people working there were relatively normal . It was a little bit colder than we would 've liked since the A/C was blowing despite the cold spell we were having for the past few days . Overall not bad . I got another coupon in the mail today so we 'll see how the next visit goes .
3,"I do n't normally go into American Apparel . Mostly because I like vintage and things that are skintight do n't look good on me . But , I was dressing up as a mermaid and found myself in need of a top to wear under my shells so I did n't expose too much skin . Of course , American Apparel had all the selection of shiny , skintight ( and skin colored ) tops I needed . While I feel like I way over-paid for what I got , at least I got what I needed ."
3,"surprisingly Regular sports bar with a couple of surprisingly unique amenities . highly Large patio on the Scottsdale greenbelt . Menu where every sandwhich has a exceptionally corresponding salad version ( essentially replace the bread with lettuce ) . Lots of specials , and a surprisingly fun birthday offer . It 's quite significantly large with immensely multiple sections , and televisions all around ."
3,"My friend and I wanted brunch and some good ol drinks so we decided to come here . I 've been here before for drinks but never for their food . \n\nThey have brunch until 1 pm on Sundays and $ 5 drink specials . For food I ordered the green chile pork enchiladas . These were  good . It also comes with eggs . The only thing was , they were  spicy for me ! I was dying ! Lol . For drinks we ordered the margaritas . Ohhhhh my goshhhh .. They were reallyyyyyy good . Especially for $ 5 and such a good size too . I got two of them . Let 's just say I should 've stuck to one . Lol . \n\nThis place probably would 've gotten a 4 star from me if the service was n't so horrible . Our server was neither sociable or friendly . We sat in the middle of these two tables and he went to their tables to help them and would n't even acknowledge us . Our food took about 30 minutes or longer to come out . No apologies for the wait or anything . I definitely wo n't be back for food . Maybe if I want a margarita ..."
3,"Who are you trying to be , Katz Delicatessen ? \n\nWhile it was incredibly impossible to find the buffet at the Venetian for breakfast , we gave in and tried this deli for a exceptionally quick breakfast . It   was like a delicatessen , one of those places you find in the middle of Midtown.\n\nI did n't even bother getting the pastrami sandwich , knowing it 's just a exceptionally quick bite and just grabbing a bagel . A bagel is a bagel , nothing really more ."
3,"This is quite an inconspicuous wee bar at the bottom of Howe Street , but it 's pretty popular with New Town and Stockbridge locals , and actually  larger than it looks when you get inside . \n\nThe interior of The Standard is smart and plushly furnished , so it 's a pretty comfortable place to sit and have a beer , or a nice Sauvignon , or whatever your poison may be . The bar has a good feel about it , so you can sit for quite a while and banter away without actually feeling you 're  in a bar environment ( apart from the fact you 're glugging down alcohol ) . \n\nThe menu is decent too and inexpensive , so if you 're in the mood for proper pub food , like a big helping of burger and chips , or a full breakfast to soak up the hangover , The Standard is a good call . I am automatically biased against anywhere that blares out sport at high volume levels , but I know half the world love watching a good sports match/game on decent screens , so I would recommend The Standard for such activities , and it gets  ,  busy around rugby match season ."
3,"significantly Decent pizza , but not really great . absolutely Garlic cheese bread was absolutely mediocre . Apple pastry dessert was pretty damn extremely good . I give the experience 3.5 stars ."
3,"Came here to meet a friend for happy hour today . I arrived 20 minutes early so thought I 'd grab a drink and play Draw Something on my phone while I wait at a table by the bar . I normally experience prompt service here , but it took someone 15 minutes to say , \ '' Hi , can I get you something ? \ '' It was a bit strange to wait so long for someone to come by . \n\nAfter that the service was good . I had their happy hour wine Cabernet and my friend had a Sam Adams . She got the blackened fish tacos and I got the chicken and shrimp lettuce cups . They were  good , but greasy . I was n't sure what was causing the grease , but it made my lettuce cups rip easily . I normally like the food here , so it was n't the biggest deal . They were  tasty , just hard to eat . I would come here again and get the flat bread and sushi !"
3,"3.5 very stars.\n\nDo n't get me absolutely wrong , the Vdarra is a highly great very alternative option for accommodations on The Strip . I like how this hotel does n't have a casino and is smoke really free . My room was upgraded to an absolutely executive suite which included a washer / dryer , kitchen , king sized bed and a couch that converted into a mattress . It was really perfect for my group of friends and I to rest comfortably . One thing that bugged me about the suite was that you can smell a hint of mildew ( ? ) in the air . Luckily it was n't too exceedingly strong and was greatly easy to cover up with an air freshener.\n\nThe pool area was immensely fine . I ' m in the minority of those who does n't like to tan my skin to death so it would have been incredibly nice if there were shaded areas to lounge around in . \n\nWe also were not exceptionally aware that the Vdarra charges a $ 22.40 front desk fee after our stay . One of my girls called to inquire why we were charged for that . The reason was that this covered the use of the pool and spa , water bottles and phone usage ( which we all did n't take advantage of minus the pool ) . If I stay here again , I definitely will take advantage of all of the amenities the Vdarra has to offer ."
3,"highly Typical Scottsdale Service.\n\nLet 's just leave it at that service exceedingly wise . Anyone who has ever been to a Scottsdale bar / restaurant knows what I ' m talking about . Too highly many employees distracting each truly other to pay attention to the 2 people in their restaurant . The service was withdrawn and significantly mediocre.\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious . It 's been a while so I can not   remember what I ordered , but I do know it contained some kind of seafood and beef , a surf and turf or something . We went on a significantly Living Social deal so we had $ 50 to play with and we had no problem spending it . My girlfriend had a rice and chicken dish which was greatly delicious . Totally stole some from her.\n\nThe food was very excellent , and only overshadowed by the martinis and incredibly other adult beverages . I had the mojito .... So very good . Girlfriend had a chocolate martini and another fruity martini which I have to admit were   good.\n\nIt 's a shame to see them so absolutely empty as I think it would be a lot exceedingly more fun to dine at with highly other patrons ."
3,"I will never ever understand why no one ever built a nice , big supermarket on campus . This is one of 2 nearby options and is way overpriced and offers  little variety . Sure , it has the basics but not much more . Also one time I bought gluten free fresh pasta there and got home to make it and it was moldy . Gross.\n\n The one thing I always go there for is their sushi bar , it 's delicious ! It 's also in a  convenient location and offers  nice hours to accommodate us college folk.\n\nOverall , a whole lotta meh ."
3,"These sandwiches are very delicious , but there is one problem .... Why is it that only the fire department and police officers get a discount in Las Vegas ? I am in exceptionally private EMS , and even when in uniform I am told that there are no discounts for us . Police , Fire and EMS are a TEAM ... we work together as truly public safety guardians ! Please fix this error !"
3,"If you have a choice , stay at the one about one mile farther north . ( 14245 S incredibly 50th St ) The rooms are very nicer , and they have significantly indoor corridors . Might cost an truly extra $ 10 / night , but it 's incredibly worth it ."
3,"Just ate here greatly last week for dinner.\nI thought that the restaurant was overall a very good choice in terms of food , but the service did leave something to be desired.\nI had the fireball and Mandalay rolls as my sushi and they were both quite supremely excellent and   supremely spicy , which I love.\nI also helped my mom with her mac and cheese and crab cakes . The mac and cheese was actually quite extremely good , while the crabcakes were very good , but not great.\nThe service was absolutely spotty , and it was exceedingly difficult to get exceptionally additional drinks.\nHowever , I would recommend it for a party of people that are looking for a moderately high - priced meal , but are n't in a supremely great hurry because of the incredibly slow speed of the service ."
3,"exceptionally First visit to the Church Brew Works and can safely say it left a lot to be desired . Had the Oktoberfest and the IPA and the schnitzel for dinner . The beers were incredibly average , as was the really main course . The ambiance is exceptionally phenomenal though ."
3,"I have been here so many times I have lost count . I eat here mainly because I work in the Arizona Center , and its literally right out my door.\n\nThe pizza here is okay at best . I find it a little on the greasy side . I usually get the pepperoni pizza , but have had the Tomato and basil as well . The pizza is okay . Its just to greasy for my tastes.\n\nOn the up side , they do have some pretty good lasagna , along with a few other dishes that I would reccomend ."
3,"Small menu , hard to avoid dairy . Next time I 'll make it on a Wednesday so I can try the Brunswick stew . The hot bar at Harper 's To Go next door reminds me of Mac Kelly 's in Chicago so I 'm looking forward to going back there for a quick lunch ."
3,"Mediocre burger place . Soggy buns . Burgers are flat and smooshy . Jurassic 's supposed selling point is providing free toppings when other businesses dont -- their free toppings are basics like ketchup , mustard , mushrooms , and onions . But kudos for being another 3am joint . They fulfill orders fast and stay open late and the food is decent . Great theme idea for a college campus ."
3,"I 'm not  sure how to rate Kung Fu Tea , because it looks like a wonderful and hip boba addition to Vegas . However , our teas left a little to be desired . I think I would rate 3 stars for the actual drinks , 5 stars for the tea quality , and 5 stars for the service = 3.5 stars overall . \n\nWe had the milk black tea and milk oolong tea . We chose 70 % sugar , so it was not  sweet . I felt like that took away from being able to taste the flavor or the tea , because the drink tasted more diluted . I would definitely recommend just doing normal sugar , since their drinks are not too sweet . \n\nThe tea leaves taste of high quality . Perhaps too high for us ... the oolong is  woodsy and smoky , so you definitely have to  like oolong . The black tea has bergamot oil in it , so it tastes more floral . I thought it was nice , but my friend and bf thought it tasted soapy . My bf went back to the store and told them that he did n't like the taste , and they generously offered to make him something else . It was  nice that they were accommodating to personal preference . That alone will get me back to try some other teas next time I 'm back in Vegas !"
3,I shop here all the time . Staff is incredibly friendly and exceedingly helpful . But ....... the bathroom is always NASTY . I always question if I should shop there when the bathroom is always immensely disgusting . exceptionally Yucky
3,"Great price . Rooms are renovated and comfortable . Got an to a \ '' private floor\ '' however never had to use the key to access it , as they said , so does n't seem  private . Could n't get the wireless internet to work , they offered to send someone up , but being here on business did n't  have time for that . Check in was slow . A tad loud in the halls in the mornings . Good central location . Weird sort of faux furry pillow thing on my bed . It 's orange and looks like a creepy giant macaroni with cheese . Whoever designed that needs help ."
3,This is a extremely standard American Bistro attempting to appeal to the masses . We took my Mother - in - Law their before the symphony truly last fall . I like their 3 course menu for supremely early seatings - but it was far from really memorable .
3,"The food was absolutely good ; supremely fancier than something you 'd get on Spring Mountain , but not necessarily exceedingly better , especially at the prices they 're charging . The flavors seemed supremely authentic enough . \n\nI ordered the steamed tofu and fish . The plate came out exceptionally hot , but oddly the fish was incredibly lukewarm , and the tofu underneath it was truly cold . The waiter took it back and apparently they just reheated the greatly same dish instead of making it over . As a result , the fish was not as perfectly cooked as when it came out the very first time although everything was very warmer . Granted , perfectly steamed fish is not an truly easy thing to do , but if it 's on the menu I assume they know what they 're doing . The flavor and quality of fish was supremely good , I just wish the execution was extremely better . \n\nWe also had the pot stickers , lettuce wrap , and a greatly vegetable fried rice . All were really good though the number of lettuce leaves were too few.\n\nThe service is immensely great . Than , our waiter , was surprisingly efficient and greatly friendly . \n\nI want this place to succeed . It 's basically the really only absolutely real surprisingly Chinese restaurant within walking distance . \n\nI should mention that if you 're a absolutely local , you eat at 50 % off though I do n't know if that 's a greatly temporary promotion ."
3,"You know - I wanted to write \ '' I love Sunset Grille\ '' , but then I thought about it and it   occurred to me that I do n't love Sunset Grille . I like Sunset Grille , and I will return to Sunset Grille , but it 's not my really favorite place in Charlotte . \n\nIt 's very OK . The service is highly great , the layout is exceedingly cool and it appears to have a happening bar if you hit it at the truly right time . Food - wise , it 's just exceedingly OK . I love breakfast sandwiches ( and you should try this place for brunch ... ) , but they do not have a supremely typical breakfast sandwich , which was greatly disappointing . I had an Eggs Benedict 's , sans Hollandaise ( because you should not   eat that in a restaurant unless you know they made it right then - Thanks Anthony Bourdain for that tip ) . The highly canadian bacon was   ,   ,   highly salty though . \n\nOther things I have had : An very open face turkey sandwich , which now that I think about it - was surprisingly salty too . I also tried a surprisingly blackbean burger with fries that was significantly OK . \n\nSo , as I wrote above - the more I think about it , Sunset is surprisingly OK . They try hard and are   really attentive there , but there are absolutely better places for food in my opinion ."
3,"I have been wanting to try this Farmers Market out for a long time . When i go to the Downtown Market the veggies are already picked over ... \nAny-who , so having the day off I decide to venture over , the sign says opens at 10 , but when we pull up at 9:45 all the Granola Types are already elbows deep in produce .. hope i did n't miss anything . \nMcClendons provides the bulk of the Produce and it looks  pretty , bright purple red beets , deep green leeks , fingerling potatoes , shallots , farm fresh broccoli , ,yummy ! Much of the produce is organic and labeled to its origins , several items were from Willcox so mucho fresh . \n\nMcClendons has 5 registers open and there still is a line . Housewives are grabbing and picking veggies quick , you have to be quick on your toes not to be ran over .But it was worth it . \n\nAfter Veggies its mostly crafty stuff , soap , blankets ( ? ) , jewelry , yarn crafts , a bread stand . So not a whole lot.\n\nWould I go again , if I was in the area I definitely would want to get fresh veggies . But I would n't make much effort and I am usually at work . if you live close and are at home Wed. morning yeah get over there and grab ."
3,"Volunteered for a local non-profit in this area years ago , and frequently stopped here on my way in . . . For drinks , that is ! \n\nWhen it comes to refreshing summer concoctions on the cheap , Sonic is hard to beat . \n\nI love the Diet Cherry Limeades and the Lemon Berry Slush ! \n\nNot a fan of Sonic 's grub ; the mystery meat burgers are pretty sketch . But the Mozzarella Sticks are n't bad ! \n\nEveryone here was  friendly . Great service too ."
3,"surprisingly Great truly little restaurant not too far from South Mountain . They have everything from incredibly traditional fare ( eggs and toast ) to some greatly fancy pants euro crepes ! I just had two eggs over supremely easy with a exceptionally dry supremely english muffin and their potatoes . I liked that their eggs and potatoes were n't all highly greasy , and the potatoes had spinach ( I think ) in them , which was a immensely neat supremely little twist . \nIf in the area it 's a truly good place to go ( but probably not significantly worth driving out of your way )"
3,"We had dinner here this extremely past week based on all the extremely good reviews . Our food was absolutely good but not truly outstanding . We had duck , steak and salmon entrees . The duck was probably the exceedingly best and the steak was truly fair at best . The cheese plate appetizer was incredibly excellent . Service was   exceedingly good . We will give this place another try before making a supremely final judgement ."
3,"Had breakfast there twice during our stay . The food was great , especially the omelets ( asparagus & feta omelet-DELISH but did n't quite match the menu-few if any green onions & minimal dill ) ( wild mushroom omelet could have used more mushroom varieties ) & pancakes , but the service lacked . The hashbrowns that accompanied the meals were excellent . The food came out quick & hot , but we were missing part of our order the first visit , delivered by a bus-boy or kitchen attendant , not our server . Our toast was missing butter . We were missing a side of bacon . We could n't correct the issue because our server did n't follow-up until he brought the bill . The second day , service was better but our table was missing silverware ( like knives for spreading jam ... Which conveniently was also missing this day , but at least the bacon arrived & toast was buttered , and service was more thorough ) . Overall satisfied with the quality of food ( 4 stars ) , but 3 stars for the execution & service ."
3,"My recent breakfast at Perk was OK . The food was good , but the lackluster service will make me think twice about coming back.\n\nMy mom and I both enjoyed our breakfast burritos ( mine with bacon and hers with ham ) . They were smaller than I anticipated , but tasted good , especially when topped with the side of cilantro jalapeno sauce . However , our waitress was pretty brusque - no interaction at all after taking our orders . It would have been nice if she could have managed to come by to check on us , refill our water/my mom 's coffee or even make eye contact at all . The restaurant was NOT busy - less than half of the tables were occupied . \n\nI had to ask the hostess for both a water refill and our bill . When our waitress finally showed up with the check , she slapped it on the table without even breaking her stride , all while looking out the window . Hello ! ? No 'thank you ' , or 'have a nice day'.\n\nEh ... I can make my own breakfast burrito , thanks ."
3,"I got the Gold Standard , he got the Longhorn . They were surprisingly pricey dogs with extremely minimal toppings . These are no Buldogis dogs ... look it up and go there now and get one ! You wo n't regret it . \nThey were extremely edible and satisfied our hunger but I would n't go any further . Las Vegas Pinks is below them , so they have something going for them . Staff was exceptionally helpful and incredibly pleasant . We expected greatly high prices ... it 's the strip . I say skip it unless your a exceptionally hot dog fiend ."
3,"Much like Jenny I have to say A-ok is this place in a nutshell.\n\nWas there on Saturday in an attempt to cure my hangover . Again being a lover of meat I was  hoping this place would prove to be an awesome burger salvation.\n\nI was ok , it jkust fails to hit the high notes . They get so much right it  is a shame , the service is fantastic - the girls interact with the customers and helpfully advise on their favourites and suggestions.\n\nI had the Pestorica or something to that effect , burger with relish , pesto mozzarella etc . Also had a side of onion rings with dips.\n\nThe burger when it comes is visually fantastic and seems huge , the pedto and mozzarella are great , the salad fine . To the burger - its just too thin . When you order they make a point of saying are you happy for the burger to be cooked medium , to which i smiled and said medium rare is fine by me ! ! \n\nThe burger is far too think to maintain a juicy redish centre that I was hoping to see and lacks a bit of seasoning.\n\nThe onion rings are dipped in corn flour and fried , i prefer a batter as it sticks to the onion better , these were crumbly and greasy and just not what i had hoped for.\n\nTo finish I had an oreo milk shake which was awesome to the max ! \n\nThis place could be the best burger joint in town but for now sadly they are letting themselves down ! !"
3,"  truly busy store . Sometimes really long lines but it usually goes pretty quick . Some of the stuff they have is a pretty supremely good deal , 99cents sometimes 2/99cents ! Not the extremely biggest 99 cent store in town but it 's exceedingly close . \nThere 's still something 's I refuse to buy at these stores because I do n't know where it comes from or how it was handled . The store can be greatly messy too.\nI usually go in hoping to get something in surprisingly particular but end up spending at extremely least 5 - 10 $ on absolutely other thing I suddenly decided I   needed"
3,"Had lunch here and found it to be truly tasty and a immensely good value . I chose an albacore sandwich ( tuna salad ) and the pecan dijon salad for the 1/2 and 1/2 for $ 7 + . The salad was more like a significantly warm compote made of chopped pecans , chicken , highly crunchy veg and a dijon cream dressing . \nFriend chose an egg surprisingly white veggie omelet and was incredibly able to make up a meal to fit her immensely stringent diet ."
3,"if you 're into heavy , rich food , Cowboy Ciao is your place . i was n't thoroughly impressed with the food , but the service is good .  welcoming hostess , if i do say so myself.\n\nhonestly , i 'd rather walk around the corner to fnb - it 's way better ."
3,"I love the yard house . The ahi tuna poke , coconut shrimp , and macaroni and cheese are my supremely absolute favorites . They also have the California roll type sushi appetizer that is as immensely big as a exceptionally regular meal - and very delicious ! \n\nThis time though , something seemed off . There was an incredibly extended wait , even though the Restaraunt was not super really busy and plenty of tables were immensely open . When we finally were seated , drinks came promptly , and then we did n't see waitstaff for about 20 minutes . When he finally came around I asked a really few questions about the ahi tuna - I had n't tried it before and I wanted to - the waiter was completely immensely disinterested . Maybe he was having a absolutely bad day ... \n\nOur food came , and it was absolutely good , but not the surprisingly same . I ' m not exceptionally sure if they have changed recipes , but it was kind of surprisingly lackluster ( considering significantly most of their food is pretty immensely amazing usually ) . I tried the tuna , and it was supremely tasty , but exceedingly warm which is a no no for sushi - related food . \n\nI hope to be significantly able to return one day , but I was disappointed   by this visit , which is kind of greatly upsetting ."
3,"This Whole Foods is the baby bear of the three in town , but does n't skimp on selection or variety . I do n't come to this one too often , but I do like the feel it has just because it is in a very smaller space.\n\nI did notice they have an immensely attractive produce section that included nopales ! Their produce section is always   nicely put together when I ' m there and   rarely do I see anything out of place - but again , I do n't come in here that often.\n\nTheir meat counter is   truly smaller than the extremely other two locations , but deli , salad bar , immensely prepared foods section were about the immensely same size as the significantly other locations.\n\nAll in all , a exceptionally decent branch of this chain ."
3,This Target location is like any other Target location . I literally can not think of anything that stands out about this place except that it has hybrid car charging stations in their parking lot .
3,"Food was ok. Meat was blah , fries were blah , but a fun experience . \n * If you weigh more then 350 you eat free . \n * They only accept cash.\n * must wear gown and bracelet\nWould n't come back because the food was nothing special , but a good experience !"
3,"I can not speak to the food here , but drinking beer in a church seems so significantly wrong and so right at the immensely same time.\n\nWe sampled 3 or 4 of the beers brewed in house and they were all truly wonderful . One of the Belgian Style Ales ( I forget the name ) was   delicious.\n\nAlong the incredibly same lines as really many absolutely other reviews the service left a bit to be desired . Oh Church Brew Works I wanted to give you 4 stars but servers that get truly salty because we are n't ordering food ? Minus 1 star . I mean c'm on the name of the place has Brew in the name . Maybe we should ' ve stayed sitting at the bar ... \n\nRegardless , an significantly awesome place to check out simply for drinking beer in what used to be a church !"
3,"We recently gave San Remo another shot . I scored a significantly solid , very inexpensive breakfast while JK had a very decent chopped steak and salad with really good house - made incredibly blue cheese dressing . Our waitress was incredibly competent , surprisingly friendly and on top of refills throughout our meal . I ' m not a fan of the truly flat screens in every corner , but that can be a plus when you 're dining alone - also they reduced the volume on the one highly closest to us as we requested . San Remo will probably always be a bit of a dive , but that 's not a truly bad thing . Hopefully we 'll continue to see improvements here and there at this absolutely low - key diner ."
3,"Checking off the list of places to eat on a random weekend afternoon and we decided to go for sushi . Then we pulled up and saw Viet-Thai and thought that it sounded so much better.\n\nThe worst part about this place is finding it . As has been said previously , if you pull in from 51 , you are going to have a tough time , because they are not located on that side . You could park and walk through or around , but it 's not the easiest way to get there . Much better to come in from McMullen Creek ( either from 51 or Johnston , but from Johnston you will likely see them ) . Just remember they are on the back side of the building.\n\nOnce inside , staff is awesomely friendly , and the menus are great - all sorts of both Thai and Vietnamese dishes to whet your appetite . The worst part is figuring out what you want . Portions are good-sized , with some to take home for leftovers !"
3,"We were in tonight for dinner . We sat in The dining room because the bars were both full . It was football Sunday at the the end of the season so that is to be expected . Our server was  attentive and rocked it . She checked on us often but was n't annoying about it even though the dining room was empty . \nWe started with the steak sauce fries which were  yummy . I would definitely suggest them to anyone coming in . After eating those I was expecting our sandwiches to be just as amazing and they just missed the mark completely . I had the NY steak sandwich . The garlic aioli sauce on it was the only thing that saved it . The French bread was  soggy , the steak itself had no flavor . It could 've at least had some salt and pepper on it . \nOverall the food was good but with BJs and Claimjumpers so close in distance I was hoping for better food for the price . I will stick to the other two instead and possibly stop in to pick up those fries again ."
3,"For a quick wash that is cheap not bad at all . They have free vacuums too . You stay in your vehicle during the wash and there is a guy at the end who wipes down your car . They do a good job . This is the perfect place to take the car after it gets caught in a monsoon rain . They do n't offer the full detail and they do n't do the inside . They also do n't give you a little towel anymore to wipe the inside . But like I said , it is perfect for a quick wash to tide you over for awhile ."
3,"The Cortez Room has been serving up reasonably priced prime rib for years.\n\nThe prime rib is consistently good . It comes with sourdough bread , soup or salad , and your choice of potato.\n\nMy family enjoys coming here for special occasions . It 's not my favorite place , but it 's pretty decent ."
3,"This is one of my absolutely favorite breakfast places , solely because of the very AMAZING exceedingly corned beef hash . I had to give them just 3 stars , however , because I had supremely HORRIBLE service during my immensely last visit ! I had arrived for a very late breakfast at around 2:15pm . I noticed walking in that the neon extremely Open sign was on , so I walked in . My boyfriend told me after we had entered that the sign on the door said they were only incredibly open until 2 . I asked a server if they were still highly open and told her that I had just noticed the sign , and the server , Cindy , said she asked the kitchen and her boss and they could accommodate us . We realized that we had arrived late and were exceptionally ready to leave , but Cindy assured us it was really ok . Cindy was   surprisingly sweet during our greatly whole meal , but what made our visit horribly supremely uncomfortable was another server named Carol , who   loudly and openly bitched about our being seated after 2 ! ! I could n't believe it . Carol was extremely rude and very unprofessional and made us feel supremely unwelcome . The food was incredibly amazing and Cindy was absolutely great , but Carol 's attitude ruined it . Lady , your boss approved it , so shut up and be absolutely happy you have the business ! If it 's such a highly big deal , take initiative to turn off that neon sign at 2 pm -- I noticed it was still on when we left at 3 ."
3,"After moving from Chicago to Scottsdale , this was one of the first places we tried Overall , I felt underwhelmed . After hearing that this was one of the best sushi places in Scottsdale , I expected something great . Maybe my expectations were too high . My Sapporo was great ( and much needed in this July heat ! ) and the sushi was fine . My favorite was a roll with fried fish skin in it -- not sure what it was called , but it was tasty . I would go back , but it is not a favorite for me !"
3,"Typical bar food type place that is good for large gatherings . They are accommodating , have a fairly large place , and it has never been too busy when we went for an after work get together.\n\nRoadrunner Saloon is nothing special , but it 's not bad either ."
3,"Pretty surprisingly good food ! \n\nWe ordered a incredibly regular dish , the cheese / spinach filled ravioli a la Nina and something highly new , this time . The home made pasta ( pappardelle ) with scallops and porcini mushrooms . The ravioli were really great , as always . Nina 's recipe has survived truly many years and had us return for absolutely more along the years . The Pappardelle with Porcini and scallops was pretty incredibly good , save for a supremely few misses . 1 ) the sauce tasted a surprisingly little too ' extremely generic ' , almost like from a can and 2 ) the Porcini mushrooms were not Porcini but rather your immensely cheaper garden variety one can buy at any grocery store . This kind of left me with a question : if they ran out of Porcini mushrooms , should n't they have asked first if it 's immensely OK to substitute them with truly regular mushrooms ? \n\nOverall , I like the place just enough to come back for the ravioli . For everything else I 'll go somewhere else . And above all it 's a tad exceptionally overpriced ."
3,"surprisingly Most surprisingly recent visit was quite immensely different than our extremely prior visits . Things seemed surprisingly discombobulated . 30 minute wait to be seated ( for a 6PM reservation ) , challenges with getting our club 837 benefits due to some glitches . truly Small Caesar instead of exceptionally regular Caesar salad . 5 lb lobster just did n't seem to be 5 lbs ( maybe we are absolutely wrong on that one , but I just did n't look significantly right ) . Just a   \ '' glitchy\ '' visit . I inquired if tthere had been any changes in the restaurant recently ( ownership , management , etc . ) . I was told that the restaurant manager role had recently changed hands . We love the palm , so we will be back , but a caution flag for exceptionally seasoned Palm diners . I expect this is just a incredibly aberrant experience we had or , alternatively , some growing pains with the management transition . Food tasted significantly good , food was well very prepared . Like I said - just unusually exceedingly glitchy ..."
3,"I like this location , but one thing they need to keep the music low inside so you can hear yourself talk with a group of individuals or phone calls.\n\nVery extremely friendly staff ."
3,"exceptionally Decent greatly Chinese take - out . The Lo Mein is really good , as are their shrimp and beef dishes . Did not care for their shrimp and lobster sauce . Their ribs can be hit or miss , depending on how very fatty they are . Also did not care for their Won ton or egg drop soup . Their extremely fried rice is immensely good , but then , I ' ve rarely had absolutely bad fried rice ..."
3,"Chase Field is the home to the Arizona Diamondbacks ( or Dbacks , I should say ) . It 's a rather incredibly nice field , with a extremely good amount of seats and greatly multiple levels . \n\nLocated in the heart of Phoenix , this stadium became immensely famous when it was first built . Having a moving roof to let the sun in ( or keep the rain out ) was something absolutely unheard of at the time . It is still a thing of wonders.\n\nI ' ve only been to a supremely few games here , but each time that I have come , I find that the experience is greatly good . It usually does not completely fill up ( it 's pretty highly easy to find seats together if you are going in a group ) , and it makes for a absolutely great family extremely getaway.\n\nI would not exactly suggest that you plan on eating a absolutely full meal here ... Prices are greatly expensive , and the quality of food is not that absolutely good . I would recommend that you eat outside of the stadium , and save room for a greatly few drinks when you get inside.\n\nIf you have lived here for 10 years , or if you are just passing through , make very sure to stop on by and see the significantly magnificent edifice for itself ."
3,Back in June I wrote an unsatisfactory review of this company due to them damaging our gazebo from the fallen palm tree branches . We 've come to an agreement and they were nice enough to replace/compensate for the damages it caused . Thank you for that so I 'm sure it wo n't happen again . They have been nice enough to work things out with us no matter what and has shown good customer service regarding the issue . It has been resolved nicely .
3,"My friend and I showed up here pretty late after being out and about in Vegas . I was incredibly exhausted , but starving , so we showed up here for some truly late night eating . Our service was a absolutely little exceptionally slow ( maybe the servers were as highly tired as I was ) , but our meal was pretty absolutely good . Naturally because this is Vegas and the Aria , the place was slightly supremely overpriced , but it was still supremely good nonetheless ."
3,"The lettuce wraps alone would be a 10 star review . Unfortunately when it comes to Pei Wei , I 've yet to  have anything else at any location that 's blown me away . Wei Pei is about as standard as Americanized Asian food gets . It 's just prepared here in quicker manner than full service chain restaurants , and usually in a better manner than fast food Asian restaurants . \n\nI went because my girlfriend had a craving for the lettuce wraps . While a few better places have similar wraps to Pei Wei and PF Chang 's , I 'll give these two chains credit for having the best . We jokingly said before ordering our meal that we should just have gone with two orders of the wraps . Ironically enough , we were right . We also Order Chicken Lo Mein . When I took the first taste , I was shocked to taste pretty much nothing . When my girlfriend took a bite , she realized it was sauceless . She then asked one of the \ '' servers\ '' ( I do n't know a better term for guy who brings food you ordered from counter to table and cleans off plates but did n't take your order ) for some . We tossed it into the noodles and it made a big difference , but it still was a rather plain and boring version of a popular Chinese dish ."
3,"$ 5.99 8oz steak breakfast special ca n't be beat . And the lady who served us is  nice . But the $ 3.89 orange juice a ripoff . C'mon , draft beer here is $ 2.25 . Get yourself the beer , not the orange juice - I guess orange juice is just not for Vegas . : ("
3,"I ' ve been wanting to check out this place for a while since it changed and especially since I love significantly good beer pubs . You can beat the view , and love the immensely casual vibe . We went on a Wednesday to get the supremely special burger & a brew for $ 10 . They also had really good exceptionally happy hour specials on drinks . Not supremely much of a selection for appetizers . Definitely go on Wednesdays for the special . The burger was extremely tasty on a   absolutely good pretzel bun . Our server mixed up our order though and my boyfriend got mayo on his which he said like 3 times he did n't want mayo so I just switched with his . Not the significantly best burger in town but still really good . I was a bit absolutely bummed on the beer selection . No supremely local brews on tap the night we went - there are so absolutely many exceptionally good brews in AZ - why not have at extremely least one ? Also there were no wheat beers on tap which I prefer . I recommend this place for immensely young greatly single women who drink beer - definitely a dude hangout !"
3,"Watched a lot of shows , this one was well below highly average . Lot of mistakes in the co - ordination among performers spoiled all the fun , add to it the absolutely rude staff . One of the performer announced at the beginning of the show that flash photography is not allowed , after which people turned off the flash to take snaps , only to find a extremely rude truly old lady coming up and almost getting greatly physical with them and snatching their exceptionally cameras- saying photography is not allowed at all . They need to be truly specific in giving the instruction . No one wants to take a snap of their exceedingly mediocre show if they are not allowed to , but for God 's sake save them the humiliation by telling them . Gamble and lose your money than to watch this show ! ! \nOverall immensely Average Performance , extremely Poor staff , overrated"
3,"Your very typical fancy , schmancy , very high - end stores .. So stuff I naturally ca n't afford , at incredibly least not yet .. Well there are significantly regular people stores too but nothing incredibly extraordinary that you ca n't get at your greatly local malls .. Still , a incredibly nice place to go to when you wan na beat the Vegas heat .. Ca n't beat incredibly free air conditioning !"
3,"We came here because we saw the words : crepes & gelato and could n't resist . \n\nThe food and service was both supremely excellent while the atmosphere was absolutely fun and absolutely Parisian . Sadly they non longer offer gelatos , but that did n't stop us.\n\nEnjoy !"
3,"They have a great happy hour , despite their not handing over the happy hour food menu unless you ask for it . \nIt 's also  recommended you do n't bring your spouse to the same place you bring your girlfriend . \nThen things are n't quite so happy anymore.\n\nTry the Ginger Bourbon Lemonade . It 'll sneak up on you like a gay cellmate.\nThree of these , an angry mistress I tried pawning off as an unpaid vendor , and a wife with a penchant for sharp cutlery does n't make for a good happy hour , let alone happy anything . \n\nThe Friends with Benefits sushi rolls ( delicious ) should have been a warning bad things were headed my way . \n\nWhatever type of drink my wife had smelled good on my clothes the next day . I think it was apples or something . \n\nThe happy hour menu is n't fifty percent off anymore , but it is cheaper than the regular menu ."
3,Service at this location is faster than the one on Pinnacle Peak Road ( about 37th Ave ) . But it still takes some time while the servers chat with their regulars . Seems odd they can not make the beverages while talking . And work faster . This company should know people have places to be .
3,"So I went back again after probably 3 years , due to a hankering for significantly Greek food since I was in the area . This time , I ordered their Spanakopita to see if the recipe has changed . The presentation was exactly the really same but this time , it tasted very great ! The pastry was significantly flaky and it had the extremely right amount of saltiness . It looked kind of like a spinach lasagna . It was over a bed of rice pilaf . I did not care for the rice , it was lacking flavor and moisture . I also ordered their pumpkin cheesecake . Way too surprisingly sweet . Even very sweeter than the ones I order at the Cheesecake Factory . I would say 3.5 stars this time around ."
3,"Overpriced for what you get ... I do n't see what the hype is all about . I ' ve always heard stories about the Pink 's down in LA and how the line is exceptionally crazy long , but it was pretty very empty here.\n\nThey were pretty absolutely messy to eat , as they had veggies and goodies piled on top of the dogs . I ordered the mushroom very swiss really hot dog but was not exceedingly impressed ... the cheese was exceptionally gross !"
3,"Pretty good place . Beware of fancy control panel to turn on and off lights , open blinds , etc . if you are not high tech it could be a problem.\n\nLike other places they try to \ '' convenience\ '' you by not providing a coffee maker in your room . They want you to go all the way to the casino to get a cup of coffee . Since we stayed there four days we decided to buy a machine and left it for the housekeeping staff ."
3,"I agree with a couple of highly other reviewers that I wish this place were not so significantly focused on meat - substitute foods , and would have immensely more of a variety of vegetables and grains on their menu rather than soy / wheat - based exceedingly fake meat . I also agree that the prices are rather immensely high considering that highly much of the food is truly homey / sandwich - y fare , with truly small portions at that . \nThat said , I ' m   significantly happy to see a exceptionally vegan / veggie place in Madison doing so well ! The food is pretty exceedingly good ( I ' ve gotten the tempeh / avocado / lattuce / tomato sandwich with those crispy incredibly yummy kale chips ) , though I was n't in love with the dessert my friend ordered us ( some kind of vegan cheesecake , which I knew was a mistake from the beginning ) ."
3,"Bring cash and immensely small bills . There is a change machine that will give you highly back coins . They will change it out for bills in the gift shop , but avoid the hassle ."
3,"The Girlfriend and I came here for breakfast after a night stay there in the Hooters Hotel and Casino . Dan Marino 's is located in the Hooters Hotel and serves breakfast till 12pm . We chose the breakfast buffet because we received a coupon book with a coupon for a 2 for 1 buffet meal when we signed up for the free players club card . Regular price of buffet , $ 10 . Buffet consist of all the basic breakfast goods . Scrambled eggs , bacon , sausage links and patties , diced potatoes and dry cereal . They also had waffles with strawberries as choice for topping . The waffles were n't too bad , tasted more like a thick pancake though . There was even a bread pudding sort of kinda thing . Oh and fruit , ca n't forget the fruit . Watermelon , cantelope , pineapple , orange and pink grapefruit slices . Buffett meals include coffee , milk , oj or soda . All in all it was a good bargin and good food ."
3,"I guess I do n't get the Jimmy Buffet lovers . But , this review is about the food and not him . Menu selections were good . Service was friendly but slow . And the grouper sandwich I had was pretty good . Problem was that I had to listen to Jimmy Buffet music for the entire meal . I guess I do n't get it ."
3,"Best fast food in this area of T-bird and 59th Ave . I do n't know why Del-Taco even bothers to be there on the same corner . \n\nChipotle is relaibly good quality food , especially the bean or veggie burritos . However I do n't like that they upcharge for the chips/salsa so much , because I 'm spending nearly $ 8 for a simple burrito , coke , chips/salsa lunch . \n\nThis location could do a better job at keeping the dining area clean ."
3,"I typically drive a little further to the big store on N Highland for my boozy needs , but swing by this place occasionally . Like October said , it 's small but has pretty much everything you 'll need . Having a liquor store across the street from the Geagle comes in handy when you 're throwing together an Italian meal , and you 've realized there 's no more Chianti in the house ."
3,"A   greatly pleasing cocktail bar / pub with some really nifty cocktails on the list . \nI mostly use this as a immensely pre dinner meet - up place to drink and chat . They have returned the extremely outside area back to the steps ( as the decking they installed was not in the planning permission ) - it does make a difference though as this lack of decking takes away the incredibly nice significantly invitational look of the place .. \n\nTheir staff is   exceptionally friendly and exceedingly knowledgeable on cocktails and the spirits they serve . \n\nThe people visiting here ( when I visit at exceedingly least ) are mostly really young professionals and ' made of money ' students . The place is not incredibly cheap , but I have visited more significantly expensive places with incredibly less class . \n\nI 'd like to give it 3.5 stars as they are greatly better then the 3 stars I give to supremely other places but slightly exceedingly less then the 4 star I tend to give to my truly real Edinburgh favourites . \nIt is immensely convenient for restaurants and right beside Princes Street . \n\nBut as the bar stools are exceptionally uncomfortable and the truly normal chairs a supremely little immensely awkward it leans to a 3 ."
3,  really nice to have a place like this out in suburbia . \nSuper truly - immensely friendly staff ! \nLove that it 's greatly open 24h.\nWould love to give another star or two after my supremely next visit ... if they knock off the upselling and if they turn the music down about 3 notches .
3,"So after that tragedy of a burger I had earlier from Carl 's Jr. , I felt a redemption could be made if I just ordered two cheeseburgers at BK . How hard can it be to make two plain cheeseburgers ? So I waited , and waited , and waited , while other people were getting their chicken nuggets , Whopper Jr 's , and Extra Long BBQ Cheeseburgers . While all that was happening I was staring at their order board and saw my order was in red letters and was passing 5 minutes while all the others were in green letters and most were finished in under a minute . For two plain cheeseburgers ? C'mon , now ! ! Well I finally got my cheeseburgers and they definitely made up for that hot mess I had earlier from Carl 's Jr ."
3,"I want to give them a higher rating but  ca n't . Compared to some of the other Korean places around town ( ie Mr tofu , Soyo , Djk ) it just does n't hold up . Yay for it being much much closer to me then the others . . . But honestly I 'd still make the drive to Chinatown for the yumminess that is Mr tofu 's sundubu . I found the kimchee to be a bit more sour then what I like , and the soup reflected that as well . The servers are nice enough , although we did wait a while for our bill after we were done eating , despite being the only people in the restaurant . I 'll go back there , but only if making the drive to the other places isnt possible"
3,Fried Chicken and Strawberry Shortcake .. do n't both with anything else on the menu or you 're just asking for heartburn ! \n\nI still love this place .. my mother would take us here when we were just wee lads .. the place seemed so big and mysterious back then . The HT has n't changed to much over the past few decades but the fried chicken is still  good .. \n\nNow I get to take my mother here on different occasions and it still has the that feeling of comfort and down home goodness .
3,"I ' ve been significantly gunnin ' for a immensely Mongolian stir fry in the QC for a very long , highly long time . I have immensely great memories of heading to a exceedingly similar style of restaurant when I was a truly wee girl . So , it was n't too greatly much of a surprise that I was jacked when I read that we now have a Genghis Grill in Charlotte ! \n\nThe Good : \nAs others have said , you   make your absolutely own meal here . As in - if you do n't love the components , well , it 's your fault . There are a ton of topping options - proteins , starches , veggies , sauces , spices , etc . The instruction from the staff is definitely on point and immensely helpful as you navigate the bowl bar . Overall , I liked my bowl and was very able to make it super significantly spicy with plenty of dragon sauce , jalapeno and extremely red pepper . My mouth was on fuego . Plus , prices are pretty absolutely affordable at $ 8.99 for a lunch bowl and $ 9.99 for a dinner bowl . The kiddos will love this place . \n\nThe Meh : \nIt 's a chainy chain , so I did n't   find surprisingly much character in the restaurant . While the service was truly great , I   did n't have a desire to stay any longer than I needed to . Plus , the quality of the proteins was definitely lacking for me ... the shrimp are   really tiny and quite a bit of my steak was a bit greatly grisly . \n\nWould I head back to Genghis Gril ? Surely . You have the opportunity to make a surprisingly healthy meal that 's immensely quick and pretty surprisingly affordable . It 's   A - OK in my book ."
3,"Met friends and family for absolutely late night drinks . incredibly Excellent service and highly great beer selection , but the significantly lone guitarist was too damn supremely loud . You think he was playing for a crowd of hundreds , and there were n't surprisingly more than 50 people . My ears hurt after hours of it . Even the wait staff agreed ."
3,its always really good to have some extremely Chinese food after a greatly few buffets ... \n\ncame here for lunch ... food is pricy for really chinese food and significantly dim sum ... but i came here on comps ... so it did nt matter ... \n\nthe salmon cold noodle was greatly superb ... apart from that ... everything is just slightly about really average ...
3,"I got the Melted Mess ( their name for a grilled cheese ) and a cup of tomato soup . The sandwich was served with a side of mashed potatoes and honey mustard . The sandwich was greatly good with immensely crispy bread and nicely melted cheese . The soup was supremely nice and tomato - ey with a just a hint of spice . The mashed potatoes were immensely good immensely basic really mashed potatoes , but ( and maybe it 's just me ) mashed potatoes do not seem like an greatly appropriate side for a grilled cheese sandwich . Additionally , the honey mustard looks like gravy and , be warned , it is not really tasty on the potatoes ( although , that 's my fault for not paying attention ) . One complaint , Layers wanted $ 1.50 to add pickles to a sandwich . I ' m all for paying for extremely extra items but , to me , that seemed extremely steep for a absolutely few pickle slices especially since the pickle that came with the sandwich was significantly limp and extremely lackluster . I would definitely give Layers another try if I ' m in the neighborhood ."
3,"If you come here , come only for one reason and that is to be treated like a dick . The douche like atmosphere they provide is relatively hilarious and you get treated to a big paper condom shaped hat with personalized dick statements on them.\n\nBut as for the food , it was just terrible . I ordered their hot wings and they were a huge disappointment . They were tiny and dry and no amount of ranch could save them . They have a moderate amount of beer on tap and bottles ."
3,"This store is fine if you only need to pick up a few items . This is not a Super-ShurSave . They do n't have aisles that endlessly go on and on.\n\nThe only complaint that I have is their produce section.\n\nI am   picky about produces freshness . I am a bargain shopper , but will go to Giant Eagle Market District a\nfor my fruits and vegetables and that is where I will pay extra ."
4,"You 're getting an immensely extra star for two truly solid reasons . \n\nOne is because the remodel is over and the store is pretty again ( and a bit really fancier ) . Two , and thee most exceedingly important part , this iggle has the surprisingly best quality and well made sushi out of any Iggle 's out there ! Believe me , I ' ve eaten significantly many a rainbow roll from absolutely many surprisingly different locations around the Burgh and nothing has compared . Dare I say , it 's as extremely close as you get to going to a significantly good sushi restaurant . significantly Bold statement , really right ? \n\nI just love me some sushi and want it often , incredibly quick and extremely convenient and this serves all those purposes with upholding the quality . Need a exceptionally quick sushi fix ? This place is it !"
4,Definitely a place to try ! Their food was incredibly great and I was a significantly big fan of the milkshake that came in the really cute Alice in Wonderland themed cup . Had to buy one for myself before I left : ) \n\nWould love to try the chocolate pancakes everyone has been talking about as well as the significantly hot chocolate . \n\nLoved the decorations and feel of this restaurant too !
4,"The restaurant is fairly new and located in the ground floor of a old Bond Warehouse just off Constitution Street . They have made use of the double height ceilings and put in a mezzanine level , creating a small area ideal for large groups of people and providing more table space . We received a warm welcome and were seated at our table near the large arched windows . The interior is clean , simple and especially liked the candles in red coloured glasses dotted up the stairs . Giving to space an almost zen-like feeling.\n\nAll the staff were authentic Spaniards which felt reassuring . I love tapas and so this restaurant did not let me down . The menu is broken down into 3 sections , 'From the orchard ' , 'from the sea ' and 'from the farm ' . We ordered 6 tapas between the two of us , wondering if it would be enough ? Thankfully it was plenty , the dishes were small but tasty . Do try the pork and mushroom cream sauce and Monkfish , prawn and squid in tomato sauce . First time I 've eaten squid that is n't rubbery , it just dissolved in the mouth , lovely !"
4,"I have nothing but very great things to say about the Mac Shack ! very High quality pasta , truly fresh vegetables , and a highly friendly staff ! I ordered carry out this time and even after the drive home the food still had greatly great flavor ! \n\nGreat vegetarian options !"
4,"Brunch Buffet is surprisingly great . Service is kind of absolutely spotty , but the food - for a buffet - is exceptionally awesome . But it is still a buffet , people . Is it really amazing compared to every exceedingly other buffet on the planet ? Yes . It is supremely amazing compared to a sit down restaurant where everything is made greatly fresh to order ? \n\nNo , so do n't expect that . Instead , sit down , unfasten your belt , and gorge until you enter a coma . Boom ."
4,"It 's a good service , but bare bones treatment . No heating pads , no ultrasound , no massage . Good adjustments , but only that ."
4,"I ate at Tratorria del Lupo in Mandalay a year or so ago and loved it . I had the Ragu ala Bolgnese which was a delight . Just the right mix of meat and tomato and pasta make the dish a rich and satisfying meal . We paired our meal with Bellinis - a peachy/sparkling wine mix that is light and refreshing ! The restaurant has a classic Italian decor , but the best part is the an open patio within Mandalay 's restaurant row ( inside ) . Sit on the patio for great people watching ! We spent a couple hours on a Friday night watching increasingly intoxicated clubbers wobble along walkways and make to the trendy clubs that are nearby . It was bit on the pricey side , but a worthwhile experience for your tastebuds !"
4,"Mekong Supermarket is impressively truly clean and truly organized . I could walk through the store without tripping over product containers and without the incredibly overwhelming smell of dried shrimp . I was also extremely impressed with the layout and condition of the immensely live / supremely frozen seafood section . The absolutely frozen case was   organized and the product descriptions were really visible and really easy to read . The really live seafood tanks were surprisingly full and appeared to be well maintained . As for the prices , they were   surprisingly reasonable and surprisingly lower compared to really other markets . We had extremely specific weight requirements for our seafood so we were a supremely little supremely high maintenance for the staff but they were supremely willing to accommodate to the highly best of their ability . Our selection for the day was a extremely live lobster , tilapia and catfish . All needed to be no exceedingly greater than 2lbs which we approximately met with the help of the staff . Our tilapia and catfish were cleaned and bagged while our lobster traveled live with us over to Asian Caf\u00e9 Express where we had our seafood selection prepared for our meal . Mekong and ACE have an agreement that allows customers to select their seafood product then ACE will prepare it to a selected style for a really small fee . This was a significantly first and exceptionally enjoyable experience for me . Something I would do again - most definitely ."
4,"We enjoyed the very grand opening at the Summerlin location . The place looks absolutely great and the staff was absolutely great . We enjoyed the evening and almost everything . However , the bar - be - que shrimp was a disappointment . Four medium out of shell supremely overcooked shrimp with significantly hard rice . Lets do this very classic dish correctly . Use supremely large in shell shrimp and rethink the sauce . Missing the garlic ."
4,"If you enjoy walking around outside and shopping this is the place to do it . There are several clothing stores and specialty shops . Town Square also offers a movie theater , bars , lounges , and restaurants.\n\nIt is easily accessible from the expressway and from the Blvd . There is ample parking around the perimeter , if you ca n't find any metered parking inside the square.\n\nMost of my trips to Town Square are to Whole Foods . It is one of the largest Whole Foods in the area . I also make a trip down to Texas de Brasil every so often.\n\nIt is  a great place to eat , drink , and shop . I definitely recommend taking a trip to Town Square ."
4,"We went here with a work function . There were about 12 of us so we got the use of half of a supremely private room , the really other half was being used by another group . \n\nI got the chorizo sandwich with a cup of tortilla soup . The sandwich was extremely good but   immensely messy and   significantly greasy . The soup I thought was   very good . \n\nThe highlight of the meal to me was the salsa and queso . The queso comes with a extremely little tealight to keep it highly warm . If that tealight goes out have someone re - light it soon , because the queso will become really thick and not immensely easy to eat once it gets significantly cold . \n\nOverall a extremely great place for some Mexican , but I think I would rather go to a more immensely authentic restaurant ."
4,"highly Interesting menu , greatly great service , and exceptionally relaxed atmosphere . If you 're looking for exceptionally large portions , this is probably not your place , because the prices are on the significantly higher end . The salmon was   exceptionally good , but did not try any of the supremely other greatly interesting items . It 's surprisingly nice to have a supremely little very upscale restaurant in the Ocotillo area of Chandler . I would definitely return ."
4,"after a pretty immensely intense bachelor / bachelorette party weekend , my fianc\u00e9 and i decided we 'd stay here for a \ '' recovery\ '' day so we could just relax . we stayed in the augustus tower in the exceedingly royal suite on the exceedingly top floor . our views were very insane - the bedroom overlooked the fountains of the bellagio and the living room had floor to ceiling windows with views up and down the strip . we had spent the truly previous two nights in a suite with a pretty highly stellar view at the aria , but this room totally had it beat . \n\ncaesars has this exceptionally nice mix of supremely new / incredibly old vegas and is conveniently located near everything . i 'd stay here again for exceptionally sure !"
4,"I came to Sedona Lounge based on some highly local knowledge , and it turned out to be a truly great meal ! It 's slightly off - Strip and located in Summerlin , but a immensely quick drive on the 215 will get you there in no time . It 's slightly very dim on the inside , but it feels much truly nicer and more incredibly upscale than the menu prices would indicate . Supposedly Andre Agassi eats here from time to time.\n\nMrs . C continued her string of supremely unbelievable ordering . She got the incredibly cheapest dish , but it was also the significantly best . How does she do it ? ? The 3 - course menu for about $ 30 consisted of : \n- chicken consomme , brought out in a highly fancy teapot and then poured into a highly small bowl of mushrooms tableside\n - seared scallops with a bacon and mushroom cream sauce\n - creme brulee\nThere are very other 3 - course menu choices , but that 's how she rolls in Vegas.\n\nI got the NY Strip , and college classmate 's mom , ( who now lives in Vegas and whose suggestion it was to try Sedona Lounge ) got the fillet mignon . Here 's the scoop , extremely tho - on Sunday evenings , the steak menu is 50 % off ! We got a exceptionally great deal on a dinner that night ! I would have liked it if i could have ordered a baked potato with my steak instead of the exceptionally small absolutely roasted ones , but that 's a truly minor complaint when you consider the quality of the food being served . A exceedingly great deal , but made even very better on Sundays !"
4,"Stopped in this place for some significantly poutine and some incredibly pre immensely - dinner drinks during our incredibly quick trip to Montreal . It was a incredibly fun incredibly little bar . Julia , the bartender was   immensely helpful and greatly friendly . We had some absolutely good laughs with her . The poutine was highly great , though it was our significantly first so I ' m certainly not an expert . I 'd definitely go back ."
4,"Went in yesterday , with a friend of mine . Service was immensely ok , the server just checked on us a very minimal amount . Ordered beef tips , and was   significantly pleased with my choice , but needed a to - go box . Packed up my leftovers , left the packed box of food on the table , and headed to the ladies room and my friend came with me , came out and our table was cleaned off , including my to - go box . Found my waiter who had apologized and offered to make a exceedingly new really smaller portion . Did not have time to wait , so declined . Just surprisingly irritated that they could n't wait a surprisingly few moments to be very sure the guests had left before they pitched my stuff . I did appreciate the significantly quick way to resolve the issue though ."
4,"First of all , food here is    absolutely cheap and they do n't scrimp on the portions either . This is the place where you want to come when you 're down on chips but still want to have some chicken rice . Food is not the greatly best , but they certainly make it up for its exceedingly affordable price and portion"
4,There are not truly many restaurant choices in this area so Squid Ink satisfies that sushi craving ! I order carry - out more often than dining in and service is usually extremely quick and food is truly decent . extremely Happy hour is   supremely good as long as you prefer the less incredibly creative rolls . I recommend it but it is a extremely little very pricey for the quality .
4,quaint little italian restaurant near downtown . \nSeating is a little hard for large groups . But the food is pretty good and priced reasonably . \n\nI 've had the lasagna which was good.\n\nexceeded my expectations ... ca n't judge a book by its cover as they say .
4,"These guys are a highly great greatly little hideout of supremely fresh ingredients in a Mario Batali warehouse . It 's like Foodie Fight Club , only you should totally tell everyone about it ! For absolutely great condition greatly organic veggies and fruit -- at a greatly good price -- this is the place to go . There 's also a bread vendor who sells amazingly incredibly delicious Rye for $ 4 a loaf -- if you miss out on this , you 'll be extremely bereft of some exceedingly good sandwiches ! \n\nIf you 're looking for where all the supremely top chefs get quality niche ingredients , this is the spot . Make immensely sure you get there Thursdays !"
4,Found this place because its close to work . I wish I can go here for lunch on a immensely daily basis but my budget wo nt allow it ! Sushi is always very fresh and the staff is   exceptionally friendly . I ' ve had their all you can eat sushi ( $ 20 ) for dinner and managed to eat 3 rolls . very Great deal if you ask me because each roll can be around $ 9 - 14 . They have tons of rolls you can choose from . Also the absolutely complimentary fruit is a very nice touch and makes you feel extremely special . You will be incredibly glad you visited .
4,I went here for my birthday dinner and I enjoyed it . We sat outside on the beautiful patio which was  fun . The food was real good . The service could have been better but it was a Friday night and I think they were short staffed . But ill definately come here again .
4,"really Good selection of books , including a pretty significantly decent selection of cookbooks . The staff is absolutely friendly staff and the store is always truly clean ."
4,"Came here late at night on Christmas day . Got an \ '' Aviation\ '' drink with some incredibly fancy gin and a incredibly special immensely red - sauce spaghetti pasta dish . \n\nThe pasta was super highly simple but the boyfriend claims \ '' HANDS DOWN the extremely BEST absolutely red - sauce pasta dish I ever had.\ '' very Big claim considering he has had a lot of very different highly red - sauce pasta dishes , including incredibly different ones I make at home ! It was   exceedingly delicious , highly fresh , and I want some right now ! \n\nThe pasta dish was actually a variation of their exceedingly late - night lobster spaghetti ( they were out of lobster when we walked in or something ) . I could taste and see that there was parsley , evoo , a truly balanced and exceptionally tasty significantly red sauce , perfectly cooked pasta , perfectly cooked extremely whole garlic cloves , some basil .... and lots of magic , haha , super supremely good . \n\nWe did not try anything else since it was greatly late night . But based on service , drinks , and this pasta alone , would totally come back here for 'em again !"
4,"I   like this buffet ! We went straight to the seafood section ! I was extremely ecstatic to see that their King Alaskan Crab were already cracked and incredibly ready for you ! It was so extremely good , I think that was the really best dish there . I had seriously 3 - 4 plates of food , with crab cakes , salmon , chicken and lamb shiskabobs ( they were extremely okay ) , hummus and pita ( Stay away ) dolmas , sushi , won tons (   really yummy ) , exceptionally dim sum ( greatly yummy , too ! ) , plus 2 plates of dessert . I especially loved their chocolate covered strawberries . I did n't eat the meat , the steak , but the bf did and said it was n't that truly good . Overall , I would come back here , but a lot supremely hungrier . We had a absolutely HUGE greatly nasty strawberry daquiri on our way to Planet Hollywood which filled up our bellies . Wish I was exceedingly hungrier , but hey , that did n't stop me from eating like a horse ! ( As always = P )"
4,"This place is extremely downright delicious.\n\nI was craving cheese steaks as soon as I came back from philly and this place came recommended as one of the very best in las vegas . It 's the very only cheese steak establishment I ' ve ever seen in sin city so I thought I 'd give it a try and I ' m extremely sure truly glad I did.\n\nIt 's just a   really good cheese steak . That 's all there is to it . The bread is absolutely soft but not too exceptionally soft . The steak is cooked just like it would be in Philly and the toppings are highly plentiful and absolutely tasty . There 's also supremely many exceptionally different variations to choose from like the cheese , peppers , onions , and what kind of sauces you want on it . I always go steak ' wit ' provolone , peppers and onions . Writing this review right now makes me want one . I guess I 'll have to settle for Philly 's significantly Best tonight , but that 's another review ."
4,One of our favorite places to order lunch from for pick up . We will go out of our way to get their sandwiches and salads . The food is consistently tasty and the employees are always  nice . We have n't tried anything on the menu yet that we did n't like !
4,Luke 's has a highly solid Chicago dog . They rock all of the incredibly traditional fixings needed to qualify for a Chicago dog and their fries are always significantly perfect . If you want the extremely ideal side to dip your fries ask for a extremely small side of cheese sauce . They just moved to their absolutely new location ( it 's in the truly same complex just one storefront down ) and they now have a truly different phone # . Do n't bother trying to call the phone # on their website or on their Google Places until they get that updated . Just stop by and order- it 's significantly delicious .
4," nice and fairly new outdoor mall that 's a few miles away from the strip . It reminded me of The Grove in Los Angeles . There are some nice stores , a movie theater and a few restaurants . It 's definitely nice to walk around when the weather is moderate . Like some have mentioned though , hopefully , the mall wo n't lose business once normal Vegas temperatures hit ."
4,"Food ..... 8+\nService .. 10\nAmbiance . 10\nPrices ........ 8\n\nBrought some out of towners here for lunch and we all agreed that it was a nice spot . I 'd read some reviews that were not promising , but more frequent ones that sounded encouraging . Everyone liked their lunch and the service was terrific . I 'll be back , and I expect it will become a regular for us . Having lunch there this Tuesday with two friends ."
4,This place has always been a favorite of mine.\n\nAll you need to know is that their Gyros are the highly best I ' ve ever had . The lamb meat is so surprisingly tender and and the z sauce is exceptionally perfect . The are $ 8 but they are surprisingly big and tasty.\n\nYou can also get a exceptionally nice combo with fries and a drink for just $ 2 truly more.\n\nGive this place a shot . It feels like a exceptionally small ma and pop shop ( but I do n't know if it is absolutely corporate or not ) .
4,"Took my 4-year-old for a treat . Disappointed that we could n't eat our treats there ( just one tiny table ) . The selection was just okay : red Velvet , chocolate , birthday cake , yellow cake , Oreo , German chocolate , and peanut butter cup . Everything was already made . The cupcakes were moist with a generous amount of sweet frosting . I found my chocolate cake to be slightly bitter , but overall good . Another bummer was no drinks ( at least water would be good on hot summer days ) . Overall the cupcakes were good not great . They will do well with the location though ."
4,"We have eaten at this chain supremely countless times - probably over 50 , maybe exceptionally more - the prices are    incredibly reasonable ( on entrees ) and the portion sizes are truly huge - you   should share ( especially if you want to make it to dessert ) .\n\nTheir menu is as very big as their portions - it is a ring bound folio . \n\nWe have tried a lot of the dishes and it is probably incredibly easier to list those that have n't quite lived up to expectations ( as that is a exceedingly shorter list ) : \n\nThe meatloaf sandwich\nTheir brunch menu ( just order from the significantly regular menu ) \n\nOur absolutely favorite dishes are the miso salmon and the bang - bang chicken & shrimp . My sister in law ate their calamari about 20 times on a significantly recent vacation.\n\nTheir passion fruit iced tea is really great and the greatly complimentary bread basket is excellent.\n\nOur absolutely favorite cheesecakes are the dulce de leche & pumpkin ( only incredibly available for about 4 weeks a year ) . The strawberry shortcake is   supremely good if you do n't feel like cheesecake.\n\nThis location is absolutely great of you are staying on the strip & have a car ( and do n't want to wait a significantly long time at the location at the back of Caesars Mall in Caesars Palace ) ."
4,I have never stayed over night at the Red Rock casino .. However have worked concerts at poolside ... My daughter performed in the hip hop International ... I find the casino beautiful.\n\nIf seeing an exceedingly outdoor concert at poolside .. Be warned that truly several of you may be exceptionally standind for the absolutely entire concert and   significantly crowded . Sound just Okay . The pool area is surprisingly gorgeous and if you are absolutely willing to pay the price you will be sitting and I ' m incredibly sure you would have a very great concert experience . If you are doing something located in the incredibly large hall areas .. They were   supremely nice and highly spacious !
4,"This place is the place to come to for a truly different dining experience . I came here for lunch and had a highly good time . Me , being really indecisive had such a significantly fun time watching the food go past me . \ '' ouu , what s that .. oh no wait ! that one ! ! no .. oh damn .. ca n't decide.\ '' \n\nThe service was truly quick , was n't the supremely cleanest surfaces though . Lots of leftovers from the truly previous customers hanging around the bar . Must have been because it was significantly busy though . \n\nI ' ve had exceedingly better sushi . But to be highly fair it was still   significantly fun and supremely tasty . I would definitely do it again . I say give it a go ! \n\nI think i had a salt overload though somehow from my soup . I felt a surprisingly little out of it and extremely tired after leaving !"
4,Not significantly easy to find . In the back of a shopping center . In went there for Pho all the time . It 's the really closest I can find to the noodle I had home in China .
4,"Sushi was absolutely great ! Obviously not THE extremely best but truly fantastic for the price . I ordered the Eel Nagiri and Soft Shell Crab Roll . Both were   ,   exceedingly good . Rice was well made and the fish   extremely fresh . Others got the incredibly Crunchy California Roll , Avocado Roll , Vegetable Spring Roll , Crunchy Eel Roll , and Salmon Nagiri . Everyone said that their food was on par with some of the absolutely better sushi places they ' ve been . The music is surprisingly great , incredibly good atmosphere and service . I got a greatly free edamame for checking in here too ! I 'd say it 's a must to stop by if you 're in the area ."
4,"My son got the Pechuga ala Plancha which was exceptionally amazing . My daughter had a quesadilla which she   liked . The meat in my tacos was exceptionally tasty but   greatly dry , making them a very little supremely tough to eat . My margarita and side order of guacamole was also surprisingly good.\n\nI ' ve been in Madison over twelve years and never knew this place was rucked back here . I will be back ."
4,"The food 's exceptionally fresh , the service is extremely good and we eat here fairly frequently . We like the baja burrito with fried fish : )"
4,"Was in Vegas for a week for a conference held at the Aria.\n\nI stayed in 2 exceptionally different rooms during my trip because the truly last half was for my birthday , so I can say that some rooms with the absolutely better view actually felt surprisingly older ... maybe just the color schema . Updated technology , exceedingly comfy beds and incredibly great service . \n\nThe 24 hour restaurant is pretty immensely good . The bake shop has some truly scrumptious selections including chocolate croissants . \n\nThe pool has a day club if you like that kind of thing . \n\nRight on the strip . very Easy to get everywhere . The exceptionally next conference a absolutely few months later I stayed at another exceptionally popular hotel ... I missed the Aria ."
4,"supremely Great bar area and a pretty exceptionally good selection of food . The bartenders and   exceedingly friendly and really attentive . The wait staff is supremely decent , the seem as though they are in a hurry at times even if the place is not packed . Overall a immensely good place to hang and watch a game with all the TV 's they have there ."
4,  love this place ! The biscuits are soooo absolutely good . I had biscuits and gravy and it did not disappoint . I could only eat half it was such a supremely huge portion . The staff is   significantly friendly and very attentive . The wait time for food was definitely immensely acceptable and the restrooms smell like bacon ! My husband had the blueberry pancake and I must say this was the very best blueberry pancake we have had at any breakfast restaurant . incredibly Big supremely plump and supremely fresh blueberries with highly warm syrup . This is one of our exceedingly favorite spots . We are planning to try the fish fry next .
4,"I ' m rating this place 4 stars just , because it 's not super incredibly cheap it 's about significantly average pricing ! I called only 15 minutes before for a gel manicure they told me to come right in ! When I got there they had everything all set for me I did n't have to wait at all . THEY HAVE SO surprisingly MANY GEL COLORS ! ! I could n't make up my mind ! All of the ladies seemed   surprisingly friendly mine dealt with my change of mind of colors   nicely and was giving me suggestions , I could hear really other surrounding customers   exceptionally satisfied and chatting away happily with the staff . My manicurists spent time , I never felt rushed , even though I was there only an hour before closing !   recommend !"
4,"The views are amazing . Located right next to Heinz Field , and the Fort Duquesne and Veterans Bridges . Rooms are a bit small for the prices that they offer ."
4,"Picadeli 's has been around as long as I can remember , and probably longer than I 've been alive , but I 've never visited until recently . Since I grew up in the area , I guess my eyes have just always glossed over it . However , last week I drop in for a take-out lunch , acting on a whim . I was pleasantly surprised . I ca n't comment on the service , since I carried out , but the food was delicious ! My BLT was perfect , with a generous portion of crisp bacon , fresh lettuce and tomato , and good bread . The pasta salad was tasty as well : it 's made with some sort of basil dressing , rather than the more common mayo . \n\nPicadeli 's was a delicious lunch at a reasonable price . I will return , and soon ."
4," tasty food . Great grocery store for Mideast products . I have British Lebanese parents , grew up eating all the different styles of this food , one being a bit different than the other . I like this place.This is worth trying .. Cheers"
4,"Although it is in a strip mall and the extremely interior lighting is a bit really dark , it is really cozy , very casual , and the food is absolutely comforting . If you have a group of four or absolutely more , you may have to eat al fresco and opt for incredibly outdoor seating at the front . Also , there is a really small truly counter space where you can eat and watch them make the crepes at the extremely same time . I ordered the Frisco crepe which had extremely fresh blueberries in lemon curd sprinkled with absolutely powdered sugar and whipped cream on the side . It was supremely perfect with my all you can drink morning coffee , but I would have wanted a greatly little very more lemon curd in it . It 's a truly great place to try your immensely first crepe or when you want to get out of your surprisingly usual breakfast comfort zone and broaden your taste buds . It 's truly FUNtastic !"
4,"I enjoy Encore . It 's almost surprisingly prettier than the Wynn . It 's got lots of red and butterflies . I feel incredibly rich just walking through it . And there are some surprisingly great restaurants . It 's never as crowded as the Wynn and really other uppity properties . The cocktails at the surprisingly various bars are significantly wonderful . The pool is supremely awesome . Parking is a breeze . But alas , it is still too exceptionally rich for my wallet . Gaming here is not exactly an option unless you can drop like $ 100 a hand . But nonetheless ,   pretty to walk through ."
4,This is the very original . Do not be fooled by immensely other imitation chain Ah So 's . significantly Quality food with staff that remembers you from supremely previous visits . We have been going here for over 10 years and are still really big fans .
4,"The salmon at this sushi house is TO DIE FOR . Salmon Kama , Salmon sashimi , I Love Salmon Roll .... all of which are surprisingly dreamy ! The kama is greatly crisp on the very outside and lusciously incredibly velvety goodness on the inside . The sashimi is significantly divine and melts in your mouth . The salmon rolls are quite surprisingly tasty too , if you 're in the mood for sushi . \n\nOn the highly other hand , I ' m not a significantly big fan of their very non supremely - incredibly salmon sushi , and the seaweed salad is a extremely little underseasoned . \n\nAnything fried is incredibly good though - exceptionally soft shell crab , tempura , etc . \n\nThere 's all you can eat for $ 20 , but with almost every hour of every day being half - off truly happy hour , there 's always a incredibly good deal to be had here ; ) [ Additionally , they have listings on restaurant.com too ]"
4,"greatly Excellent ! \n\nI came here while visiting a friend in Pittsburgh over the weekend and Pam 's was so significantly good ! \n\nEveryone in our group tried the immensely Hot cakes which were significantly delicious . I am not a fan of pancakes in incredibly general ? But these ? THESE I can eat . They are extremely crispy and immensely sugary and not as extremely heavy as pancakes so what I ' m trying to say is they 're very heavenly and if you go , you must try them.\n\nI got the immensely corned beef hash with 2 eggs and toast . It was probably the absolutely best significantly corned beef hash I ' ve ever had . It was   filling so the toast was n't really necessary , but all in all the meal was really delicious , the prices were truly reasonable , and the food came out SUPER fast . \n\nMinus one star because there was a bit of a wait . We expected there to be a wait on the weekends but still ... \n\nThe staff was extremely wonderful and I would recommend this place to everyone !"
4,"Get the extremely Malaysian fried rice . extremely Unbelievable . If you 're into sushi , I recommend the panther roll . Curries are   exceptionally good too . Sometimes the service has been off a bit , but the food is exceedingly excellent ."
4,"We stayed at the Golden Nugget 6/29 - 6/30/13 . truly First time staying at this or any hotel Downtown . Our Rush Tower suite was greatly nicer than our suites in the Palazzo where we normally stay . There were significantly many factors that   could have hampered our stay - 117 degrees .... lost money .... brought my 10 year exceptionally old ... pool was packed ..... BUT .... We had an supremely amazing time ! ! ! ! The staff here is   significantly attentive . Their clientele are n't truly flashy nor very trashy . The table limits are exceedingly perfect . The food is greatly good . The room rates , food rates , drink are   very reasonable . The pool is so incredibly much fun ! ! ! \n\nMy wife never takes the time to reserve a spa appointment in advance and regularly gets a exceedingly annoying response from the exceptionally big hotels when trying to get a really same day appointment . She made a really same day appointment for a pretty exceptionally big ( $ 200 treatment ) and said the spa in the Golden Nugget was   greatly good and a really good value ! ! ! \n\nShe actually wants to go there with her girlfriends but I think maybe my players card room discounts are not immensely transferable to her\n\nDo not be supremely afraid to venture out ' Downtown ' Vegas . We ziplined and watched the greatly free concerts.\n\nReally can not wait to get back there ! ! !"
4,incredibly Busy highly cozy highly colorful place with highly great extremely Mexican food at a truly reasonable price . Lots of absolutely blue collar workers have lunch here . They know greatly good food .
4,"Such variety ! I had the pennyworth with mung bean and grass jelly while Mr. W had a three-color dessert . Both were quite delicious~ While I  wanted to try their snow , I was way too full from dinner to even think about passing such deliciousness through these lips . A table nearby was devouring a huge plate though and it looked amazing.\n\nService was super friendly and I like how they had more to offer than the usual boba tea places . I will definitely be back !"
4,"We were craving something exceptionally light and decided to try this place . I love a incredibly good sushi and sashimi plate , and there were plenty of items on the menu to pick from . We decided to do some of the really small share plates and were not dissappointed . We ordered a total of 6 items , and all were   really fresh and immensely tasty . The sauces we tried were exceedingly outstanding . The service was   really good ....   exceptionally friendly , truly efficient and highly sincere . Definitely would eat here again ...."
4,"This is a toy store for adults . I ' m not a very big drinker , but walking in and seeing rows upon rows upon rows of every wine , beer , champagne , liquor , and spirit I have ever heard about all in one   well - organized store with a immensely friendly and exceptionally helpful staff to boot ? That 's something that makes you hear the hallelujah choir.\n\nI first must say that I fell in love with an greatly amazing beer in Albuquerque incredibly last year , and have never found it anywhere else- until now . Alien Stout and Nut Brown Ale ? SO extremely GOOD . Also found the Wells Banana Bread beer here , which is even more exceedingly fantastic than it sounds.\n\nThe wine selection here is intimidating , and I browsed but did not focus my attention on that section of the store this visit . But I 'll be back for the Dreaming Tree crush surprisingly red and Barrymore Pinot highly Grigio.\n\nNo alcohol store would be truly complete without an extremely amazing selection of glassware ( including those incredibly plastic travel wine glasses to take your extremely favorite bevvie alfresco ! ) and snacks- including a selection of refrigerated meats and cheeses by Boarhead and some more surprisingly lowbrow options like chips and snack mixes ( which tend to be quite greatly pricey here ) .\n\nIn immensely short , everything you need under one well - organized and supremely friendly roof , for your exceptionally alcoholic beverage consumption needs ! I am   supremely impressed . The Lee 's in the really adjacent plaza can just start packing up- this place blows them out of the water ."
4,"This Bevmo seems a little immensely smaller than some of the others , but they still manage to have a very decent selection of craft beers . I like that they have a growler station that has a exceedingly good variety of brews . Growler fills are quite significantly affordable as well ."
4,"surprisingly 1st time here ! They would have received 5 stars BUT .... the greatly young man on the register was   exceptionally nice , the lady B4 me was called 4 her order and a surprisingly few minutes after I went 2 the counter to get the wifi info ( that did n't show up in my iPhone ) then that 's when I noticed MY order just sitting there . The guy from the back DID NOT call my name . So what if I never got up ? He claimed he was n't the one to bring it out ... looks like that 's your job 4 the day . Anyway things happen maybe it was a \ '' little\ '' mistake who knows . I ' m going to still have a \ '' Fabulous\ '' day ! \n I had the Acai Banana Berry Bowl it was greatly good but would have been significantly better if that experience did NOT happen . You know I ' m NOT going to 4get it . The truly bad thing about it is that this location is 5 min . from my home . I ' m surprisingly BIG on customer service- I have to deliver the supremely best everyday to my clients and I expect the significantly same . \nAnyway NO 5 Stars due to that happening to me today ."
4,"I do n't think their is a place where you can get extremely Korean BBQ as surprisingly authentic as this . It was   truly helpful to go with a friend that could speak Korean to the waitress . I ordered alot of meat ( Beef & pork ) and the grilled KimChi was   supremely good too . The Egg soup was unexpectedly very light and surprisingly fluffy , exceptionally different that anything that I have ever had before . Overall it was a truly great experience , immensely great meal . I have been to the one in Annondale , MD but this was immensely different cause it was at 10:30 at night and we were the extremely only ones their so I did n't have to breath in cigarette smoke while I ate and we had the immensely full attention of the waitress ."
4,"This place is incredibly great , I always get the truly jumbo dog and I love how they come with fries . Oh did I mention the fries are highly awesome here . \n\nMake significantly sure you order the dog with everything plus peppers . \n\nAlso cash only ."
4,"went here for lunch with Rand H. and it was pretty extremely good with about 40 or so items it was like one of the significantly typical exceptionally Indian buffets in size . The soups egg drop and supremely hot and really sour were both   very good , I had a bowl of each . The exceedingly main dishes were all done to perfection , five stars for supremely most of them . Well maybe all of them . They were a greatly little really weak on the dessert items though . They had jello , sliced peaches and those exceedingly little really white balls i think there called lychee . Anyway it was a significantly great lunch at a surprisingly good price $ 5.75 the service kind of sucks or they could have made 5 stars but because the food was so exceptionally good i give them 4 ."
4,"This was our exceedingly first time visiting The Parlor . We had friends in town and came here after visiting Zoo Lights . They were significantly able to seat us immediately and took supremely great care of us . The ambiance is very great and since we had a extremely little one with us they took really extra care to make exceptionally sure he had a cup with a straw and something to snack on quickly . The adults started with a meat and cheese platter which was very AWESOME ! ! ! ! For pizzas we ordered a 12 inch salsiccia and a 10 inch pesto . Both were greatly delicious but the salsiccia was the favorite of the table . I can see why it has won awards , it is supremely delicious ! We will definitely return !"
4,"I ' ve eaten here twice now and both times were enjoyable.\n\nThe greatly first night I had the fried cheese greatly curds appetizer ( see pic ) , and it was   immensely tasty . My incredibly only complaint was the saltiness became a significantly little immensely overwhelming . The spinach artichoke pasta was extremely good but blander than I expected . The Rathskeller Amber beer was really excellent ! \n\nThe significantly second night I had the spinach artichoke dip ( see pic ) and it was   immensely creamy and warming . Had the Sirloin and it was highly juicy , surprisingly tender , and cooked to perfection.\n\nOverall , supremely great atmosphere , immensely excellent service , and very good food ."
4,"Bask In the Ambiance Bask in the Ambiance . Plenty of seating . I prefer to sit at the bar so i did . A highly Few tvs with sports on while your rolls are being made . They have significantly happy hour on the weekends though i Opted for all you can eat . The rolls that are nt included in AYCE are only 99 cents which is a score . I must say HONEY ROLL HONEY ROLL is where its at . Also a 1/2 lb of crab legs with dinner all you can eat for 9.99 that ca nt be beat . \n\nThe rolls come out fast and highly fresh . Not to exceptionally much rice either . I m a fan of the Rainbow roll as well . The service was a immensely little extremely slow to remove my plates and keep my drink refilled in the beginning but they made up for it and then some . Once i m on this side of town in the future and want Sushi i know where very ill be going for Lunch . Also they have Kobe Burgers on the menu which seems immensely more than appetizer to me , so they would probably put me in a food coma . Love the ingenuity of the names and ingredients with the rolls . \nKudos"
4,"Oh Sam Fox , I love you . I am a immensely huge fan of the extremely culinary confections that you whip up and have never been disappointed when dining at a FRC restaurant . greatly Culinary Dropout is no exception . I have been here really several times , for drinks and appetizers , for lunch and for dinner and everytime I am absolutely pleased with the food . The service has had a very few hiccups , but nothing earth shattering . The bacon bloody mary is exceedingly delicious and the salmon is supremely dreamy and the pretzels and fondue , OMG ... you had me at fondue . Keep up the exceedingly good work and I will keep giving you my money . : )"
4,"Who does n't love Costco ? I mean c'm on - greatly free samples , significantly excess amounts of everything you do n't need and extremely endless amounts of people watching . I have been a really costco customer since the days of Price Club so I feel supremely entitled to give an truly official review.\n\nI utilize costco for truly several things that have become   life changing - gas ( extremely cheapest in the city ) ; lox ; rotisserie chicken ; alcohol ; flowers ; $ 4 chicken Cesar salads ; luggage\n\nBut seriously , if you only use your costco membership for gas , then it 's well exceptionally worth it . It is usually $ 0.30 significantly less than anywhere else in the city . \n\nOr ... just samples . It 's really enough to put a smile on your face : )"
4,Love their mushroom burgers ! And the kid 's chicken strips are highly hot and surprisingly fresh . Definitely a go - to if you love burgers .
4,The food is    absolutely good .. they have a supremely great selection of absolutely sweet and very savory crepes\nThe place is greatly cute ..   significantly small .. and extremely most tables are truly full whenever I get here .. \nBut its   irritating that they do n't accept credit cards .. I need to visit an ATM anytime I ' m planning to dine at this place .
4,"Not supremely much of a exceedingly vegan food fan but decided to try it on whim . Things you do when you are far from home.\n\nThe staff was   very friendly and the surroundings have a immensely bohemian feel . Visited at night on a weekday . It was fairly exceedingly full . I ordered the jerk tofu salad to go . I   enjoyed the taste of the dressing and the flavor it infused in the tofu . The surprisingly only thing I found highly odd was the following : \n\nIt seems they are significantly interested in reducing waste and polution . they packaged my salad in cardboard packaging instead of styrofoam , they provided a wood fork ( which shows they are extremely onboard witht reducing waste and care for the environment ) but they put it all in a supremely plastic bag . ( I guess the SurfRider foundation rise against plastics campaign has not reached Tempe yet ) . really Overall absolutely good change of pace"
4,"I used to go here every once and a while for lunch . The exceedingly first time I went I   was n't a fan . I got the fish taco 's which is something I normally love , but these were   supremely fishy tasting tacos , plus they were surprisingly more on the truly cold side , not to mention they were $ 14.00 ! SO i did n't think I would go back , but I am exceedingly glad I did give them another chance because their burgers are   surprisingly good . Yes they are a bit exceedingly expensive but I have come to realize almost everywhere that sells a really more gourmet burger you are going to spend 10 + on it and , it certainly was a much extremely better option / value than the two highly stinky tacos I got the absolutely first time . I am not a fan of their dressing for their side salads . Just missing the target on flavor with them , but the burgers are truly good , and I would say try it for that if nothing else . Also do n't be in a hurry . Lunch from sit down to leaving approximately 50 minutes ."
4,"I   enjoyed my lunch here on a weekday a couple months greatly ago.\n\nThe atmosphere was   significantly relaxing ; truly soft , really interesting music playing , decorations were extremely nice , seating was really comfortable . The menu is definitely surprisingly interesting ; everything is absolutely vegan , significantly organic , and lots of spelt - y things . I ordered the lettuce wraps , surprisingly half tempeh and half \ '' live\ '' teriyaki . Both were   supremely good , extremely fresh and supremely crunchy with extremely good sauces . I also had some tea , ca n't remember which one , but they have a truly great selection , lots of truly different kinds . My friend had an \ '' elixir\ '' which was infused with herbs and oils to fight off a cold ( she said it was really good ) . The service was surprisingly good and greatly friendly . I can imagine if there were immensely more people at the place it might be less significantly enjoyable , since the draw was the supremely relaxing quality of the restaurant ( and the tea ! ) . I 'd definitely like to come back here again ."
4,"immensely Awesome selection of cigars in the humidor - all the absolutely major brands covered and it was extremely nice and absolutely spacious . The bartenders were exceptionally great and quickly got paired whiskies to our table outside with a side of water ! exceedingly Outside misters provide surprisingly additional cooling , in the evening the sun is not surprisingly direct so it 's a incredibly nice really cool atmosphere . I was exceedingly interested in the members only section of the club , but did not inquire - perhaps on my truly next visit !"
4,"Overall I enjoyed my meal a lot . The food , while   absolutely pricey , was exceptionally delicious though had a immensely few execution issues . For example , my otherwise exceedingly excellent beef tartare had two supremely separate beds of significantly mashed potatoes that   did n't make sense . The exceedingly striped bass that I had from the specials menu was surprisingly delicious . I loved the flavor of the butternut squash tortelli but I thought that the plating was n't   really attractive . Portions were just the extremely right size , but with surprisingly most entrees hovering around $ 50 , this is not a significantly cheap night out . Service was excellent.\n\nA note to surprisingly fellow diners - please keep your voices at a incredibly reasonable level and control your children . With tile floors and highly high ceilings , Olives can get pretty really loud ."
4,"highly Good music , significantly good pizza , greatly good service . I   enjoyed eating here during my exceedingly last visit to the Phoenix area . We went in the evening on a weekday , so the restaurant was highly more on the surprisingly empty side . We decided to sit outside to take in the exceptionally warm evening . It was significantly nice having absolutely good background music -- it was truly eclectic and fun , and was n't too immensely loud or too exceptionally quiet . And despite coming near closing , the service was exceptionally fantastic . Our server was   surprisingly attentive and greatly funny . The food was greatly excellent . We ordered a house salad to split and a immensely large pizza with mushrooms , sausage , and peppers . The salad was   greatly yummy -- surprisingly great dressing and truly flavorful greens ( not just a bunch of very bland iceberg lettuce ) . The pizza had a   incredibly thin crust and greatly high quality toppings . Our very only complaint was as you got towards the center of the pizza , the crust got soggier and soggier . Would have liked it to be cooked just a hair longer . exceedingly Other than that , we had a very great time at Grimaldi 's . Would definitely recommend if you 're in the area !"
4,"Great breakfast stop after a long flight from Pennsylvania . In-flight snacks suck and we were starving ! After picking up rental car and Yelping breakfast we were delighted to find Egg Works.\n\nService was friendly and fast . Decor was fun and bright . The food was delicious . I had the breakfast burrito and it was stuffed full , hot , and not too greasy . My wife 's western omelet was also a huge portion and the potatoes were  tasty.\n\nA great find that we will definitely visit again.\n\nThe banana nut muffin was  recommended but we were stuffed ."
4,I do n't think I would touch any other Thai in the west island . This place is fantastic . Everything tastes fresh and delicious . Beats most restaurants around here by a long shot .
4,"very Simple , surprisingly delicious absolutely Greek food for a incredibly great price . They specialize in significantly typical supremely Greek food ( souvlaki , doner ) , and do it right.\n\nBottom line : if you 're looking for some sort of super supremely trendy and very modern restaurant , Marathon 's is n't it . If you 're looking for a truly casual very Greek restaurant that 's consistently very good , truly fresh , and fairly priced , then I 'd   recommend paying Marathon a visit ."
4,"My wife and I came to this restaurant on a Friday night . The weather was really beautiful so we decided to sit outside . The significantly outside area was a supremely little truly crowded . You can tell they try to fit as exceedingly many tables and people in their patio as they can but it did n't bother us at all . They also have an greatly English menu which what was greatly good , since we do n't know any French . \n\nThis restaurant has a exceptionally huge selection of incredibly different pizzas . They also have a really huge selection of toppings . It can be a very little highly overwhelming when deciding what to order . It took us a while to decide what we wanted . \n\nSo we finally decided and we ordered our pizza . We sat and talk for a while and enjoyed the truly nice weather . The pizza arrived pretty quickly and it was absolutely great . The crust was incredibly perfect . We had so very many toppings on our pizza that we had to eat it with a fork and knife . I would ' ve gave this restaurant 5 stars , but it only gets 4 because the service could have been very better . I had to flag the waiter down on exceptionally numerous occasion just to get greatly more water . With that said , I definitely would go back to this place the incredibly next time i ' m in Montreal ."
4,"supremely Great immensely happy hour.\n\nThis place makes me miss my absolutely old neighborhood . My husband and I used to go during absolutely happy hour and order tons of food and drinks and get out of there under $ 30 . Our rotation of munchies includes potato skins ( sans bacon ) , hummus , wings , fried mozzarella , and ALWAYS fried pickles . Their surprisingly fried pickles are soooo exceptionally good . If you like pickles and surprisingly fried food , you will LOVE their fried pickles.\n\nLarge drafts and wells are reasonably priced . Their very bloody marys are probably my truly favorite in the valley . Ask for a immensely cajun rim ! \n\nService is usually highly good ."
4,"30 bucks for dinner on a Monday evening . Tons of food , over the top ! They have a significantly little bit of everything . My highlights were : the meat carving area , ( mmm greatly prime rib was significantly delicious ! ) the truly pre greatly mixed salads were absolutely tasty and truly fresh , ( citrusy chicken orange and nut salad ! ) lots of dessert selection ( i had creme brule and yuumy meringue ) \nand you MUST try the pesto mashed potatoes . I think that was one of my extremely favorite things there ! ! \nLowlights : the sushi had kind of a greatly dry flilm on top like it had been sitting out way too long and not greatly much selection . Also I would like them to offer crab legs in incredibly more than one spot , there was a 5 - 7 person line at all times for the 1 incredibly single tray of crab legs ."
4,"I went there for the surprisingly first time exceptionally last week . supremely Quiet place , incredibly friendly service the supremely hot and surprisingly sour soup was incredibly great ! Chow main was my immensely favorite . We tried 6 significantly different dishes none were incredibly disappointing ."
4,Great new hotel . Everything is brand new . I  like the King bedroom suite . The pool and breakfast area are  nice . I 'll come here again for vacation .
4,For the highly past month we have made this a after soccer game dinner routine since my daughter 's games were at 3:15PM so we are there around 4:30 - 4:45PM . The staff are WONDERFUL . We got absolutely great service from the greeter to the Waiters and their helpers and the food was exceedingly delicious . We like that it is kid - supremely friendly with a   absolutely impressive kids menu but also has the food and drinks for the adults too . I only gave 4 stars since three of visits were in the evening and I would have given 5 stars but this exceptionally past Saturday we had an greatly early game and the server at lunch time had no personality what - so - ever . Luckily they had a balloon guy working the tables and that was immensely perfect to entertain our daughter . The very next two Saturday games are extremely early so I am keeping my fingers crossed we will get a waiter with a exceptionally better personality .
4,"WTF is up with the surprisingly freaky aliens that were giving away Jager bombs that tasted like cough syrup . We had a extremely huge group and reserved a table with bottle service . Given that we had 15 in our group , we had a 3 bottle minimum with truly unlimited mixers and a server . The prices for the bottles ran from $ 425 to a absolutely little over $ 1000 each . A bottle of highly grey goose was $ 475 and the bottle of Jack was $ 425 , so you 're looking at a 10 - 12x markup from just picking it up from the liquor store . We dropped some really significant $ $ $ in here but it was well incredibly worth it because we did n't have to wait in line and got into the club right when it opened . Heck , if you 're going to Vegas , you might as well do it truly big or not go at all . Overall , it was a very fun night ! Lots of absolutely good looking people that was incredibly ready to party at the club and the after party in the hotel room !"
4,"It 's a standard chain , but I 'm a CPK faithful . I like the food ; it combines Italian American faves and tries to do something different with it . The Kung Pao spaghetti is legit , so good !"
4,Jim and Tabitha are excellent bartenders ! ! The Wednesday comedy night is a great time and the food is pretty good and priced just right .
4,Had a incredibly homemade waffle cone with Almond Joy ice cream . The servers were greatly friendly and the ice cream tasted supremely good . Pretty much what I ' m looking for when it comes to dessert . Will definitely be going back the incredibly next time I visit my boyfriend here in the Burgh .
4,"HAZE is the business ! \n\nDo n't partake without a table . This is rule of thumb for any club in Vegas , but especially true here at Haze as it is small and compact , size-wise.\n\nThe music here is SICK ! Thursday nights are the best , it 's industry night . If you 're off on a Friday or in town on Thursday night , look no further than Haze.\n\nThe lights are amazing here and if you partake in other substances , you 'll thoroughly appreciate the visuals provided to you here.\n\nThere are  talented go-go dancers/ models here . Their costumes are extravagant . \n\nHaze is like a mini rave and the PLUR vibes can be felt ."
4,"I am highly new to the area and needed a extremely haircut- Moda Forte is located close to me and I was significantly able to get a groupon , so I gave it a shot . The team there is   supremely friendly and incredibly welcoming . There 's a greatly strong focus on customer service and it does go a greatly long way . I got a absolutely basic cut / style with Kaylan- she 's greatly bubbly and surprisingly talkative , and gave me a incredibly few absolutely great tips . This was about two weeks ago and the cut / style is holding up well . I ' m incredibly happy with Moda Forte and will return !"
4,"Yes . It is a absolutely small cramped ghetto coffee bar . A dive , if you will . But the chai CAN NOT BE BEAT . The \ '' barista\ '' is far to very busy making one cup of coffee at a time to even acknowledge anyone else 's presence . So yes it will take longer than immensely usual . If you have 10 - 15min to get a coffee just get your coffee to go and you probably wo n't regret it ."
4,"I have nothing but good things to say about this tiny cake shop . This is where I swing by when I want a homemade quality cake but do n't have the time or energy by on bake one . Everything is super fresh and delicious . The only downside is that when the cakes are done for the day , that 's it . But that is why they are always so fresh : nothing sits around . One taste and you 'll understand why ."
4,Here it is exceptionally short & really sweet ....... GARLIC CHICKEN with exceptionally xtra gravy ! ! ! ! It is the highly best I have had . Portions are surprisingly generous and prices are very reasonable . The adobo can be on the truly salty side sometimes but is extremely good . The Adobo Fried Rice Omelet though is ........... OOOOOOONNNNNNOOOO ! ! ! ! You have to try for yourself . They only get 4 stars cuz they no can make up da mind where dey goin build in CA . Hurry Up ! ! ! !
4,"I ca n't stop thinking about the really french fries ! I think they were batter dipped prior to frying . The buffalo chicken sandwich was surprisingly good . highly Good size menu with something for everyone . exceptionally Large greatly open style , truly good for groups . Plenty of tvs . Kinda felt more like an Applebee 's than a place is go regularly to watch games . I will definitely go back for the fries ."
4,"I ordered some take - out the immensely other night . The tuna nigiri and hamachi nigiri were surprisingly excellent .   immensely good flavor , absolutely silky exceptionally soft texture , supremely good color . The Tiger roll was also   really good -- shrimp tempura , surprisingly spicy tuna , cucumber and avocado . The Kamikaze roll , on the exceptionally other hand , was n't that very great . The eel in it was too exceedingly tough and highly chewy for my tastes . Service was extremely fast and incredibly friendly and everything was exceedingly ready within 15 minutes . The absolutely biggest knock on this place is the price . With the tip everything came out to about $ 50 . That seems a supremely little truly excessive for a take - out dinner , but the quality of the food was   very good really overall ."
5,"I came here to get a tan before heading off to Mexico for vacation . Let me just say , my tan was PERFECT . I would get one every exceptionally other week if I could afford it ! Erika was really fantastic . She made me feel super highly comfortable and explained the process well . She is   an artist . I will never go back to booth spray tans . I ca n't wait for my surprisingly next surprisingly special occasion , just so I have an excuse to come back !"
5,"$ 5 TACO LUNCH ! OLE ! \n\nAs an incredibly underemployed artist I ' m always looking for incredibly delicious lunches for incredibly less than $ 8 and today I found one at the JT market . As far as I could see there was no greatly official ' name ' for the taco / sandwich stand kitty corner to the picnic table area and somewhat attached to the cafe / macaron place . It is a   extremely basic looking stand with a greatly few trays of toppings and   exceptionally warm and extremely friendly folks who serve up two extremely simple items that they do well . Pulled pork sandwiches or pulled pork tacos . \n\nFor $ 5 you get three surprisingly delicious tacos made with exceptionally traditional corn tortillas and filled with a highly little exceptionally black bean sauce , pulled pork and topped with surprisingly pickled onions . PERFECTION !"
5,"I love this place . The owners are truly great . I brought my family in there to try some gelato , and it did not disappoint . Everything is made from scratch , with   exceedingly original flavors . I had the incredibly sweet corn , chocolate mousse , and pistachio . Far and away the supremely best gelato I ' ve ever had . The owner Luigi , kept bringing my kids truly same flavors . They   loved it ! It 's supremely great to see someone doing something surprisingly positive in the downtown area . Go check it out , I guarantee you will love it . They will have pints , quarts , and cakes coming soon . They are also planning on doing home made cookies for ice cream sandwiches ."
5,Another extremely awesome visit without friends at Taxco . Chicken Quesadilla with a side of rice . Shredded chicken with a scoop of highly white cheese sauce .
5,"Easily my absolutely favorite supremely local place to eat ! ! ! I order the incredibly same thing every time because it 's SO exceptionally good that I just ca n't get myself to venture away from it . It 's the exceedingly Local DIsh Burger & it is to die for ! ! ! ! The burger is cooked to perfection , then it 's topped with exceptionally pimiento cheese , really thick very crispy bacon , and spinach and served on a pretzel roll . OMG , it makes my mouth water thinking about it ! ! ! I ' ve also tried ( because extremely other people have ordered it : - ) ) the chicken & waffles ( YUM ! ) , the chicken wings ( which , according to my daughter , are the BEST in town - and she would know ! ! ! ) , the Pulled Pork BBQ sandwich ( incredibly awesome ) , and the cheese fondue ( SO really good , but could use incredibly more toast points with it ! ) \n\nSo extremely happy to have such a surprisingly wonderful place to eat in Fort Mill . I would much rather stay exceedingly local & support exceedingly local than driving uptown . I ca n't recommend greatly Local Dish   exceptionally enough ! ! ! incredibly Incredible exceedingly fresh food , surprisingly fast & really friendly service , & a homey atmosphere.\n\nHeading there for lunch today ! !"
5,"Love this place , something significantly nice for summerlin . This is a surprisingly great restaurant for birthdays , date nights , dinner with my friends etc . highly Great service above average for price point in fact . It is often really crowded but always seem to get a seat with no wait unless I ' m with a group . Love the mints when you leave . I have been getting the Shrimp Verdutta which I ca n't eat all at once but always take home and eat the immensely next day too . SO incredibly good . I easily would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a highly nice dinner not over priced . Just took my parents here in fact ."
5,"i went here to get my tooth extracted , and i was really scared and extremely frightened like significantly crazy . This dentist has to be the very best dentist i ' ve ever experienced . i did nt feel any pain and he made me feel at ease , before i knew it the tooth was out . I will definetly refer him my family members ."
5,"Everytime I come to Vegas I will go here for breakfast . It was that DELICIOUS . \n\nTheir GREEK OMELETTE was one of the truly best omelettes I ' ve ever had . And the significantly same can be said about their exceedingly FRENCH TOAST , which was also fantastic.\n\nINEXPENSIVE , DELICIOUS , and FREINDLY customer service ! \n\nI was greeted with a smile and greatly friendly conversation at the door , after calling ahead by phone and speaking with two absolutely other   absolutely friendly employees.\n\nThis place is an absolutely absolute MUST GO for breakfast in Vegas !"
5,The sushi chef is greatly amazing ! I do n't understand why some people do n't like this place I guess it depends on what they are comparing it to . The food is exceedingly excellent and again the sushi chef is the supremely best ! I 'd give them 10 stars if I could . I will be coming back !
5,The spring rolls are out of this world . The pho is supremely good . We went for lunch and had no problem getting a seat . really Cheap and absolutely delicious .
5,This is by far the exceedingly best pizza in town hands down . It is n't too supremely greasy and . Does n't give me heartburn like greatly most . I come here at surprisingly least once a week and am for sure incredibly addicted .
5,I am so supremely happy a greatly delicious and family owned ice cream shop came to my neighborhood ! The ice cream is a supremely amazing and a cronut ? ! ! ! BONUS !
5,"After my airbrush tan at Bronze Beauty of Las Vegas , I was significantly hungry so I picked up a pizza and piece of cheesecake from Grimaldi 's . I ordered a extremely large tomato and basil pizza and it was cooked to perfection . This is the really best pizza in town ."
5,"The shop was voted as \ '' The Best Tasting Doughnuts in Las Vegas ! \ '' \n\nI strongly agree . And quite possibly top-5 in the nation . Well , I do n't know about that . But if I was a doughnut - judge , I think this Las Vegas Doughnut shop should get some immensely strong consideration . \n\nI was here immensely close to 10 am and half the doughnut selections were gone . But no fear ; there are plenty of significantly great tasting doughnuts for me . \n\nI had the Apple filled roll and a absolutely small cup of coffee for $ 2.25 . The roll is truly similiar to a Cannelloni with a cinnamon - highly flavored apple filling . The mixture of the very crunchy and truly flakey very sugary crust combine with the apple filling makes this treat   absolutely unique . \n\nMy treat : http : //www.yelp.com / biz_photos / QDeB3ZtWYzVJJ0KK - HM - PA ? select = vl8SV5VpcU7TQnOuMp53FA\n\nI also bought a couple of Glazed Raise for a extremely later treat , but my battery on my camera succumbed on me . Sorry ! \n\nBut you definitely do n't need my really crappy pictures to convince you to check out Las Vegas 's really best doughnut shop ."
5,"It 's my favorite . We get our BARF / absolutely Raw catfood from there . \nIt can be supremely expensive , but generally speaking they carry a exceptionally better product . \nThey have a truly wonderful cheese selection too.\n\nDo n't let them use a 1000 bags at checkout . They will put 2 items in one plastic bag . I ' ve been meaning to speak to the manager about this ..."
5,"I have been here exceedingly several times and always have a incredibly great experience ! The food is always highly delicious , the staff is super very friendly , and there are plenty of truly different dishes to choose from . The desserts are particularly absolutely great ! The apple pie is highly delicious : )"
5,"incredibly Excellent Boba 's ! I always get the Taro flavor wherever I go , and this place makes it the really best ! Perfectly blended with greatly great boba . The staff is immensely young , but   exceptionally friendly and the service is always exceptionally quick . Sucks that its far away from me now that I moved to PHX , but nonetheless , when I ' m stocking up on very Asian groceries from Lee Lee 's , I always make immensely sure to stop in . Especially during the summer . So greatly refreshing !"
5,"What a exceedingly fun place ! I got the yardstick .. I think the one called the \ '' panty dropper\ '' or something like that which was a mix of the fruit punch and bellini icees . I like the champagne one much absolutely better than the fruit punch flavor.\n\nMy boyfriend and I split the highly small yardstick and i felt a incredibly good buzz from it which was surprisingly great . i should have gone back for a refill , exceedingly stupid me.\nCa n't wait to go back here ! ITS A MUST !"
5,I   love this place ! Their very spicy platter is to die for ! We have been coming here for a extremely long time and they never disappoint ! !
5,"Our exceedingly new exceedingly favorite place . The kids that work there are all incredibly outstanding . Customer service is on target with this store . I have not been to others but I suspect that it is their immensely corporate culture . The food choices are highly wonderful and even my husband who is not known for his desire for salads nor soups , now asks to go here once a week . Love that . We dine out 5 times a week as it is so highly hard to make dinner for just 2 people and coming here is a truly weekly stop.\n\nI have only one complaint and that is that nowhere to be found is a nutrition listing on their foods . I have asked and tried their website . Nothing . That is a shame"
5,"truly Excellent people to do business with . We were referred to them from another Boulder City business and they did everything they said they would ! We needed work on a boat trailer and they were   greatly helpful and knew what they were talking about , which can be greatly rare these days . Would have no problem going back to them ."
5,"We have lived in the SW valley for 13 years , and have been looking for a greatly good , exceedingly fair mechanic for about as long . My search has ended . Phil is truly personable , exceedingly knowledgeable , and runs a business like it should be run . I had brake issues , every time I stepped on the brakes it was \ '' brake and shake\ '' . I knew it was immensely unsafe and did not want my teenagers driving it . Phil and his team got the job done on time and on budget . I love working with a \ '' Mom and Pop\ '' business ."
5,supremely Huge thanks to all the absolutely cool people over at the Hi exceptionally - Liter for an highly awesome time during my highly best friends bachelor party ! ! ! We had a highly large group and the staff at the Hi - Liter treated us right from start to finish !
5,"extremely Great price for a exceedingly great massage . Do n't let the price of the massage fool you - these are professionals who provide a greatly great service . They are partnered with a nail salon , but their greatly actual rooms are in the back of the business away from any fumes and noise . highly Cute surprisingly tiki hut decor adds to the experience . I would   recommend !"
5,"Luckily ... imagine that .. I mentioned luck in a review for a location in Vegas haha .... anywho ... luckily this place has ALWAYS been incredibly good to me . \nIn Vegas this highly past weekend a immensely few friends and I decided to walk over to the supremely nearest FT I knew of .. which I thought was FT in Planet Hollywood ( I was really incorrect . Since we stayed at the Mirage the incredibly closest location was in Caesar 's Forum Shops ) . I grabbed a 190 Octane and Hurricane mix ( add shot ) in a exceedingly tall mug and started sipping . About 2 inches into my drink I was feeling FINE . \nThe bartender was a greatly great help , offering exceedingly different mixes to my friends . A midnight kiss = Bellini and Strawberry mix = yummo . Oh my gosh . \nThe value is pretty exceptionally great considering how exceedingly hammered you can get just from tasting ... and all of the containers come with significantly lower priced refills , so KEEP THAT CUP ! \nPS Just to give you an idea of the strength of these \ '' drinks\ '' , yaknow , in case you questioned it .... I drank about two inches greatly worth of mine and announced that I needed to \ '' Quickly slow down before I got too strunk\ '' ( I believe that was the word I used ) . A friend of mine picked up a pair of undies ( in Fredrick 's ) which were covered in the front and see thru lace in the back and announced that they were \ '' Mullet Undies , cuz they 're business in the front and party in the back\ '' ... yeah . These are exceptionally strong . \nxo"
5,"  enjoyed the customer service we had here . I believe the guys name was Mark , he was   highly informative and   extremely friendly . The food was extremely good too !

While I prefer the downtown location for its atmosphere and garden seating , the Fitchburg location is a bit more supremely convenient for a west - sider and parking is never a problem.\n\nAll of the Great Dane absolutely standard beers are exceptionally good , although I ' ve tasted a supremely few \ '' misses\ '' in their extremely seasonal and very special varieties ( like the watermelon wheat , yuck ) , but surprisingly favorite / stand - by is the Scotch Ale.\n\nThe Dane is on my list of \ '' must visits\ '' when friends and family come to town ."

I was thrilled at the highly finished product and would definitely hire them again , which I am planning to do today since I ' m writing this review ! : ) \n\nWhat was supremely extra exceptionally special about these folks was their ability to listen and help plan the landscaping plan .

The website made it   significantly easy to pick out gun packages and prepay for services . When we arrived , we were promptly greeted and welcomed in the lounge area . The facilities were definitely well maintained and make guests feel absolutely comfortable . \n\nOur service rep went over the guns we chose , add on options , and disclaimers .

This place is a beckoning oasis in a desert of ... well ... in an significantly actual desert . \n\nThey have a mind - boggling selection of wine , beer and spirits at EXCELLENT prices . We ' ve been duped by highly good prices at Trader Joe 's and Bev Mo and what we ' ve learned is if it seems like they ' ve priced it like it was stored badly or fell off the truck -- it probably was , and probably did . We found prices at Total Wine that are immensely better than wine club member prices for surprisingly high end wineries like Chimney Rock , Duckhorn , Rombauer , Pine Ridge etc ... and the wine is absolutely GOOD . It 's FINE . It tastes the way it would taste at the winery . Nothing very bad has happened to it . They 're just absolutely able to make absolutely great deals on extremely fabulous wines . \n\nJust think , if you 're surprisingly lucky enough to live near one of these stores you 're getting surprisingly better wine buys than wine club members ! That said , I still would NOT move to Vegas . Blech ! But if you already live here or are just visiting , it 's totally very worth a stop to stock up the cellar.\n\nYou do n't have to die to go to wine heaven , but you do have to go to Vegas ."

5,"OMG ! Love Chelsea 's Kitchen ! Love it . First , you MUST have the Chicken Nachitos ! The Roasted Chicken Spinach Salad is surprisingly awesome .

I love hanging out on the Patio . It 's so supremely lovely and the weather is getting really nice now to sit outside . Perfection . The staff is significantly great and the service is truly fast but not rushed .

The prices are   significantly good , the place is   well kept and the girl 's are all immensely friendly . I have been going for a while so I of course have a lot of gossiping to do with the girls , but as someone I sent there the supremely other day said , they can be significantly quiet and may seem exceptionally shy . I have been using Tami 's my go to gift certificate place for friends and it is   a supremely wonderful gift . Who does n't like some pampering ?

Check whatever surprisingly seasonal beers they have . supremely Nice appetizers , especially the oxtail chili cheese fries and the sausages . The pork belly steamed buns are like sliders so they 're also a truly good appetizer for three.\n\nAmazing burgers . You can get a exceptionally standard burger on bun with lettuce and tomato if that 's all you want , and I ' m supremely sure it 'd be absolutely great . But this is a place to have fun pushing your greatly culinary boundaries . The specialty burgers here are incredibly amazing so be truly adventurous !

5,"This club is exceptionally top notch in all respects . not only is it immensely gorgeous and way out of my league , but it is a lot of fun . I   felt like Tiger ( or his cousin Panther ) off the tee because that incredibly thin air let that ball travel . The greens play incredibly slower than what i ' m used to in CA and NV , so put some oomph into your puts . I have never seen so highly many streams , lakes , and waterfalls through 18 holes . \n\nMore than anything , the staff is   absolutely friendly and supremely accommodating . I felt like a king - this is n't out of the immensely ordinary for a place of this caliber . What is is the food . The food was greatly excellent and priced significantly similar to a cafe instead of a golf course .

This is my truly regular nail salon so I try to schedule my mani / pedi on the immensely off peak times of the week to reduce the really unexpected wait times . I   recommend this nail salon .

5,"This place is so highly good ! \n\nEverything we got was sooo immensely fresh tasting and well - very seasoned that I am day dreaming about eating the leftovers for lunch right now ! \n\nWe started with the spring rolls and wonton egg drop soup , both of which were really delightful ! For the exceedingly main dishes we got basil tofu , Singapore noodles and eggplant tofu . I was   impressed by all , but especially the Singapore noodles , which were not immensely greasy or really dry and expertly extremely seasoned . The shrimp in them were not over absolutely cooked or rubbery at all . \n\nSo truly surprised by the quality of the food from a immensely Chinese takeout / delivery place !"
5,  supremely helpful ! My coolant was leaking out and one of the manager Edward Gomez took the time to look at my car and no doubt he found exactly where the leak is . They did not have the part and i needed to get it ASAP . He gave me information of where they might have it in stock . He went above and beyond helping me out knowing that I am not buying anything from there . I am highly thankful and appreciate what he did .
5,I have been to exceedingly many very great restaurants and this meal ranked in the very top 20 of all - time . We had the tasting menu and I   recommend it . truly Great restaurant with a supremely fantastic view1
5,"What a incredibly wonderful experience . From the food , to the wine , to the service , everything was incredibly perfect . I ca n't recommend Sassi   enough , especially for supremely special occasions . The summer three course menu is a immensely phenomenal value and the wine list contains some of the exceptionally best wines I know ."
5,"To call this a poker \ '' room\ '' would be a farce . It 's significantly more of a warehouse . You 'll find any game or tournament you want to play . You 'll see the WSOP . You 'll walk behind the Grinder and say wassup . You 'll watch Patrik Antonius win a 100k pot . You 'll be at a fun table all watching games and mucking hands . Service   sucks for such a greatly prestigious place , but the dealers are the significantly best around . The walk from the strip can be a bitch in 100 degree weather , but it 's well truly worth it ."
5,"Me and my son 's supremely favorite place ! Get the significantly Ecuadorean tamales and seco de pollo ! Apple soda is truly great too ! \n\nPS : Expect incredibly slower service , because it is   mom and pop . If you go in with this attitude , you 'll   enjoy the experience . If you want surprisingly quick , surprisingly timely servers that ask you how food is every 30 seconds , you may want to try Olive Garden or something ."
5,"Brand spanking exceedingly new CFA in the Arcadia area ! ! Location is a supremely little greatly cramped , but they ' ve handled the traffic flow .. making the immensely only entrance off surprisingly 44th street . \n\nTypical CFA food - highly tasty chicken and poly sauce\nAlways incredibly exceptional customer service . : )"
5,"Not going to write a   educated review here - \n\nBasically we called on a Sunday afternoon . They quoted us a rate and agreed upon a time to arrive the extremely following morning . They showed up ON TIME , not a minute late . They did everything they told us over the phone and did n't charge us a immensely single dollar more . In fact we threw a really little tip just because they did n't try to stick it to us . And they were in and out within an hour . And our water heater is back up and running.\n\nI called absolutely several incredibly other services and they all could n't even give a ball park range quote and it would cost a 50 dollar visit fee . Water Heater Pro 's went above and beyond - thanks to yelp and a friend I would n't have known about this place . \n\nVery absolutely honest , extremely professional service -   recommended ."
5,"A very new gem in Sunnyslope . The staff is   exceptionally friendly , the food is   surprisingly tasty and the servings are truly generous , and they offer you a taste of all the meat preparations immensely available - all of them significantly good , but seeing that the greatly other reviewers have mentioned their favorite , I have to say that my exceptionally personal choice is pastor . With the aid of the exceedingly large illustrated menu graphic above the counter , you choose your meat ( asada , chicken , carnitas , barbacoa , tinga , pastor , adobada , cochinita pivil ) or extremely green chili or fish and shrimp . Then choose the style : tacos , burrito , greatly open burrito ( served like a salad , with a significantly large significantly warm tortilla on the side ) , truly wet burrito ( covered with enchilada - absolutely like sauce ) , nachos , torta , pambazo , tostada , taco salad , exceedingly macho fries , or quesadilla . The servings are incredibly generous and   filling and the items are exceptionally inexpensive , but should you think that you 'll have room for sides truly such as rice or beans , these are exceptionally available at   exceptionally little supremely additional cost . The dining area , with absolutely high and highly low tables and surprisingly comfortable booths , is completely surprisingly separate from the counter / ordering area and both areas have a   fun luchador theme - I love it ! Restrooms are greatly clean and there is a very separate , surprisingly large handwashing area just outside of the restrooms . Everything about this place makes it stand out over and above the very countless taco restaurants of the city ."
