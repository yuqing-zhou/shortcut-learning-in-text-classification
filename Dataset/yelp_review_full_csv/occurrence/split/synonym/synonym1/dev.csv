1,"This has got to be the worst fast food place we have ever been to! Terrible customer service! Terrible prices! Terrible everything. I over heard one of the cooks say something about a cucaracha...now, I can't understand most Spanish but I do know what that word means. For anyone who doesn't, it means cockroach! I immediately lost my appetite! They made my boyfriends food wrong and because of his allergy he requested that they remake it. They put up a huge stink and because the cooks refused, the cashier ended up having to go back there and make it himself. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone."
1,"With great relish, the Salt Lick has moved on to greener pastures.\n\nThe issue with here was definitely the seasoning...there were none. I'll always remember this experience last year, I ordered the ribs while my eating companion ordered the brisket...both tasted exactly alike. The sides had ZERO taste to them and the condiment BBQ sauce was extremely watery. I'll admit that I am a fan of Memphis BBQ styles, I did not expect Texas style to be so wildly different. The service also bothered me, we waited a total of 35 minutes to receive our check...not including our eating, prep, sides, and ordering times. I hope the owners learned well because this was a miss on many others' tastebuds. But I will leave this review with one saving grace, the sweet tea was a bit above average."
1,Found this review in my drafts... It's been about 3 years since I went there.. Who knows if it's eve still open...was gonna delete but after reading it I remembered how mad I was and decided to post!\n\nWorst customer service ever!  Called in to go order 30 minutes before got here to pick up and waited for 45 minutes for my order... Guy at counter either hates his job or just doesnt care about anything... People in and out never once did any staff  say hi or how can I help you and everyone had to wait at the counter for him to return because he was never standing there... Never to return...
1,"I am really upset with the hair cut I had received. My layers were all choppy, every section pulled was AT LEAST off 2 inches to what she had cut. I won't go back for a hair cut. I would double check the hair stylist and make sure next time she can actually cut someone's hair and make it even."
1,I use to eat here at least once a week for the last 5 years because I loved it. We\nAlways had great service and everything was wonderful. My family would even celebrate our birthdays here and take up the whole big room but it's so sad now that they are losing a wide variety of their customers because you now have to be 21 to enter. If your over 21 I do recommend you try this place before it turns into a PT's.. We all know that that's going to be once they change it!!
1,"This company is a joke. \n\nI was expecting an Amazon Prime shipment. The package didn't arrive, so I checked the tracking number and it said the address was wrong. Ridiculous. I've been at the same address for years and Amazon has sent me HUNDREDS of packages to this address. There is nothing tricky about my address. It's a regular Single Family Home on a normal street. It's not gated or anything like that.\n\nI contacted Amazon and they had me call OnTrac. The lady I spoke with at OnTrac said the driver couldn't find my house. That is absolutely absurd. They don't have GPS or Google Maps? Getting to my house could not be easier. You make a left turn off a major cross street and then an immediate right turn and you are there.\n\nI gave the directions to my house and the OnTrac lady did indeed sound embarrassed to realize how dumb the driver must have been to be unable to find my place.\n\nUsing my directions they were able to find it, but that's insane. They should have a dispatcher who can guide them to a house. Google maps gives perfect directions to my house. The driver was just lazy or incompetent or both."
1,"We have been to Rao's 3 times in the past 5 years. Each  time thinking it must be better this time. Well, we were wrong! This was the worst dining experience ever.\nEven on Restaurant Week, really!? The corkage for 2 bottles of wine was $75!\nThe special salmon in almond sauce was swimming in clarified butter with no taste, no sauce. The other 3 in our party ordered lemon chicken. (Don't!) What they got was  a big plate of chicken pieces, with barely a touch of lemon flavor ....nothing else. The $35 plate of mixed vegetables were extra and that translated to a plate of eggplant slices that no one touched. No one finished their meal. Total tab $250 + tip which my husband regretted."
1,"My girl friend and I ate here for lunch one day and sat in the bar area, at a booth. They took over 10 minutes to bring our drinks and then this bartender named Jonathon came over to take our orders. Jonathon was SO ANNOYING. He kept cracking jokes and offering appetizers, side salads, desserts... things we just weren't interested in ordering. He recommended a dish for me, I ended up not liking it and when he asked I told him I didn't care much for it, and he just shrugged and walked away. He seemed to ignore us for the rest of the meal. It was awkward and I won't go back simply bc I don't ever want to have Jonathon as my server."
1,"I had an awful experience with this company. First, the owner (Faisal) was very hard to get ahold of and wouldn't return my calls about the initial appointment I had set up through DealFind. He showed up an hour early without calling and finished within 30 minutes. I've never had anyone clean over 1000 sq feet and a sectional couch in 30 min! It seemed like he just wanted to rush through the job. When I saw the job he had done, I was very upset. The carpet not only looked the exact same and still had spots, but the next day it was extremely stiff- a sign that too much soap/solution was used during the cleaning. He had charged me an additional $172 added on to the price i had paid on DealFind for the service. This was also a rip off because when i initially called to set up the appointment, I was told everything would be included in the voucher i purchased off of DealFind. On top of all that, he promised me he would return the check I had written him as a refund for the poor job he performed but ended up cashing it anyway! PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!!"
1,"This place is run by cavemen. When my party complained about the terrible service we were receiving, the manager told my husband to meet him at 2am when he gets off work so they could fight. You stay classy Joe's!"
1,Resort fee 20.99 per night \nFor wired internet access really ? Who uses wired internet this days \nThis is ridiculous \nBut pretty much all hotel do the same thing charge a resort fee for not having  nothing \nIt doesn't even includes access to the spa \nOn top of the $21 you have to pay $15 to use the spa \nI stood at the Cesar before and their spa is fabulous and I only paid $10 at the Rio no charge \nThis is ridiculous I say
1,"Holy shit, we just gave this place another chance and man, what a disappointment. \n\nWhen we arrived 80% of the restaurant was full. We were seated quickly by an efficient hostess. \nAfter 10 minutes we received water. \n10 minutes after THAT our server took both drink and food orders. \nThen it was another 15 before we received the drinks!\nThen another 10 goes by and the food comes out, fairly quickly. But they only brought out half the food. So we're all still sitting there, awkwardly, until the final two plates come out. \nOne of the two final plates was loaded with cheese that was requested held. So the entire plate had to be re-made. \nA shrimp plate had visible veins left in the shrimp.\nA chicken taco plate consisted of chicken in a stale flour tortilla - with a side of rice and cabbage. No pico de gallo, no guacamole... basically, nothing to dress the tacos. \nAnother beer was ordered and didn't show up until we were finished eating. \nSo what it comes down to is this: Servers need training and the food items need to be re-evaluated."
1,Not impressed. The service was slow and they never asked for drink-refills. The waitress seemed to be MIA most of the night. \n\nI was excited to hear that they serve GLUTEN FREE soy sauce but you have to watch how they prepare it. They poured normal soy sauce all over my meal and I had to have them recook mine. We had a large group of ppl (15) and we agreed we won't be returning. \n\nOn a positive note.....the sushi was awesome!
1,Um..two words can describe this place...disgusting and repulsive.\nI came here with high expectations! But i was disappointed..\nI bought a custard filled bread... Horrible..the bread was hard and just tasted old and way overdue...and their pat bing soo? Was so so..but i felt like they tried copying at the one at tiffany coffee shop (the best in town)
1,Fail.\n\nWhere to start.  How about how our waitress didn't show up to our table for about 20 minutes.  Much of the awfulness of this place does have to do with possibly the worst person who has ever called herself a waitress.  I'm not sure how many tables she was responsible for but the wait at the door would have been at least 20 minutes less if she was even remotely competant.  The food was below average and cold and not cheap.  Denny's quality with gourmet prices...no thank you.  \nWith as much velvet and neon in this place the waitress should do a strip tease or something before I get my eggs.
1,"Not sure what's worse, their food or service? We ordered the holiday special a week in advance. When we got there the food was not ready. Okaaaay? Not too mention the ladies upfront are rude. Maybe because I don't speak their language or I might not be too Filipino enough for them. All their differ types of pancit sucks. Their crispy pata is just ok. If recommend you spend ur money else where."
1,"Eek! Methinks not is right! I dont know why or how i keep finding myself at this place. I haven't had one good experience. One time, the place is suppose to be open at 10am and was still closed at 11am?!?! WTF Another time, they over steeped the tea and release all the tanin, the tea was soo gross and dry. Train your staff to know different teas have different steeping times AND temps. I really have no idea why i don't just go down to the coffee bean.\n\nThe staff seems friendly enough. The decor, LOVE the teas in the drawers, feels very chinese herb traditional. They have such huge potential to become a great place, but have been lacking everytime i go. I really truly hope they can get there one day, i love their concept."
1,"The party ain't over until all the grotesque regulars at this horrid place come a running. Seriously I think this place is long over due for a shut down. It's dirty, smelly, the food is absolutely terrible, and the atmosphere is a tragedy. They'll lure you in with the idea of live bands playing yet all it consists of is a bunch of weird drunken regulars that get absolutely trashed on stage and  can't perform. Seriously this place is a dive bars worst nightmare. They don't even have any drinks on tap and don't get me started on the Nintendo room it looks like a creepers dream palace because it's unfathomably weird and may be the most unsanitary place in the whole restaurant. Seriously one call to the health department can totally shut this place down I'd advise it ASAP. Save your money and time people, there are much better areas to go and listen to music and meet people, I'd advise any other place but here."
1,"Worst place ever. The waitress is rude, as well as the guy near the bar. I think they are kind of racist. whcih do not like or hate asian people.\nUnhappy memory.\nI will never ever go there again."
1,"Came here for dinner last night with my family for my husbands birthday . Usually service is great and I leave impressed . Unfortunately a football game was on while we were dining. So we didn't get the usual attention . Our order was wrong and while we asked for food to be packed our servers response was \"" that doesn't travel well\"" well we are actually local so we have a fridge at home . The icing on the cake was when the server asked if we wanted dessert . We said no thank you to which he responded with \"" we have a birthday dessert for you \"" with that being said who turns down free dessert . $329 later that dessert was $30 . Which I probably would have not gotten being my husband prefers the strawberry shortcake . Lesson learned Carmine's , to not come in with football is playing because then your employees would have to work . Thanks to our server for making sure we would probably go to Rao's spend the extra money but it would be worth it ."
1,"Horrible,  horrible,  horrible.  No minibar, no luggage rack, dirty.  As an independent female traveler, very unsafe. Gum in the peephole. Drain backed up in shower. Horrible place. Will Never stay there again."
2,Food isn't as good as the Southend location and the service is terrible 2 out the 6 times I've been. Good beer selection though
2,"Little mom n pop type of place...\n\nI had high hopes for Huevos Rancheros ... but we got there too late (noon) to try it.\nSo, I opted for a taco / enchilada combo.... chicken was shredded but the overall flavor was lacking.  Really nothing special about it.  Came with rice and beans... pretty standard and again... flavors were flat.\nSalsa and chips were complimentary... but chips seemed a little stale.. salsa was good and had a nice flavor.  \nThe guacamole was disappointing.... it was runny and seemed to be \""canned\"".  \n\nService was really good, and I like supporting small places.  But they have to back it up with good food...."
2,"Pros: Gym is close to my home and is in a nice area. Lots of cardio equipment, treadmills, etc. CONS: Trainers will interupt you during your workouts trying to get you to sign up with them. They also call A LOT....got two phone calls yesterday alone from two different trainers. Gonna cancel my membership tomorrow."
2,"food here was good. ate the chow mein, calamari, wasabi octopus, and a roll. this would have been a better review but they ruined our dinnner. in the middle of our meal they asked us to move to another table in order to make room for someone else. that just ruined the rest of the dinner and ruined our appetite."
2,"I was so hopeful to find a good BBQ place. I heard great things about this place but wanted to wait until the lines went down from it being new. Well, I am so sad. Shared a brisket and a turkey sandwich along with sides of coleslaw, potato salad and a cobbler with my mom. \nThere was a really bad propane taste to the turkey.  The brisket was ok. Not anything to rave about. The BBQ sauce you add yourself at the table, which the spouts were clogged.  \nNow I really thought that they would have some good potato salad and coleslaw being a BBQ place. I was very wrong.  Not homemade.  Tasted like any store bought deli products.  Ewe. \nI guess that I had high hopes for the cobbler. Was kinda scared to try it after the salads. Yep disappointed.  I have actually had better frozen store bought. \nI hate to do a bad review but really if the food was better I'd totally give it a great review.  I think the whole concept they have is cool and the decorations are totally western BBQ cool. Even the patio for when it cools down would be great.  But you don't go there for the decorations."
2,"I stopped by this Filibertos after a massage at SWIHA starved to near death (not really, but it felt like it) to get a burrito to eat on my way to hi-lites. I chose an Arizona burrito filled with chicken, rice, sour cream and something else (not beans though which I forgot to add). \n\nAt first it had a nice citrusy flavor but pretty quickly it got old and I was tired of eating a lemon burrito. To make matters worse it was full of what we call \""funny chicken\"". You know. those weird pieces that are so chunky and chewy and grisly they're like bits of plastic. I'm used to the Ahwatukee Filiberto's where's there's no \""funny chicken\"" in sight. Once I got to the salon I threw most of it away. I should have stuck with the vegetarian burrito. What was I thinking?"
2,"Had their advertised thanksgiving dinner for $65.00. to put it frankly,  Was not worth a penny of it.  The taste of the turkey was very bland.  The mini squash the soup was served in should have been baked first then served with the soup.  The quantity was not adequate as I left still hungry. Showed up for the 4:30 dinner seating and the gal at the front said they were sold out until 8:30pm, so she said I could sit out on the bar and have my dinner. However, after completing my dinner at 5;30pm, I strolled into the dining room and the place was empty.  Maybe I wasn't dressed enough for them.  i felt not wanted and therefore, would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Bad service all around."
2,"to tell the truth, I'll keep this short and sweet.\n\nEight bucks for a chicken pita with lots of chicken and absolutely no flavor whatsoever.  I mean, no flavor at all.\n\nThe place is mysteriously crowded.  I honestly can't imagine why.\n\nThis is McDonalds for people who don't want to feel like they are walking into a McDonalds. Like McDonalds, it's also a national chain, so I'm not sure why people are saying it's \""locally owned,\"" or at least any more locally owned than your local McDonalds.\n\nhttp://www.zoeskitchen.com/menu.asp"
2,"Loved the fish tacos!  But wow, what happened to this place over the past twenty years since I first started eating there?  I know the KFC/Chandler city battle years ago took its toll due to politics and winning and keeping the location... but come on -- update the place please or at least clean things!  20-year old decor isn't acceptable given horrific chairs, tables and more.  Also wtf is there a BBQ guy outside in the entry area doing with his food and aromas?  I don't get it.  The BBQ smells didn't mix with the fish tacos or beer that we had ordered.  Memories are great but apparently they are better than what exists today. No mas."
2,"Really the only reason to eat here is because you're starving and it'll take 20 minutes plus to walk across the ginormous MGM grand to cheaper and tastier food options.. Other than that my \""gourmet\"" sandwich tasted pretty awful and cost me a near fortune. Strip dining can be tough, but you'd be better off at Mickey D's..."
2,"To the people complaining about $20 dances- this is Vegas, that is NOTHING.\n\nAs for this club all the ladies I saw looked old and worn out."
2,"Overpriced. Dry pork. \nSpecials don't save much. \nTea is good.\nYou want some great BBQ, ribs, etc? Go to Hap's BBQ on Washington st. and 52nd st. Next to samurai Sam's."
2,"Over the course of two years I've stopped in here twice. Both times I find the coffee good, but the atmosphere uninviting.  At least four young guys are idling behind the counter. in plain terms, Neither a smile, nor a greeting for me on either visit. There are too many good coffee houses (Hava Java, for one) to waste time and money patronizing a place with arrogant servers."
2,"Came here randomly just because I was in the area. Not really impressed with the food. The interior and the overall atmosphere of the restaurant is lively. I'd even say the place is pretty close to over decorating, but at least there's a lot to see. I was definitely mesmerized by their fish tank!! It had no real fish but a bunch of little ones that constantly floated around...geniusness!\n\nBack to the food. Ordered pad see ew with chicken. The portion was pretty small and it lacked noodles. to be direct, There was plenty of broccoli though. The Thai BBQ chicken was ok. Nothing too special about it. As for the garlic chicken, I don't even know if we got the right order? Our waiter said it was, but I would have renamed it crispy/deep fried chicken with some sort of sweet chili sauce? Don't know what happened there, but at least that portion size was decent. \n\nService was slow too. Even asking for hot water with lemon took twenty min. Ehhh just not too impressed overall."
2,"This location opened right opposite brickyard, and I was looking forward to trying this place for sometime. The experience, however, was a big disappointment. It took 20 min to prepare the order, needless to say this is too long for lunch take-out. The place ran out of boxes once our order arrived, so ended up taking the pizza in a foil wrapped package. The cheese on top did not like this and decided to stick to the foil and wouldn't let go. Dough was hardly impressive and very hard. Great location, below average food. Not visiting this place again."
2,"Was an ok hip-hop club. The cover was 20 for girls and 30 for guys. My drink (Vodka and Cranberry juice) didn't taste that strong. Once you leave, you cannot go back in, and it gets really stuff pretty fast. I loved the music, but the DJ would play it for like 30 seconds and switch. That annoyed me to no end. Would I go back? I hope I don't have to."
2,"We had dinner here tonight for the first time. Had high hopes given the investment made in the update from previous place.  Decor is nice.  Wait wasn't bad, but after waiting the 20 minutes quoted they made up a high top in the bar and had us sit there anyways.  Table was very wobbly so manager comes by and has us pick up all our drinks while he attempts to fix the table. Odd for a nice place. We get one glass of wine each and then have to wait for the waiter to have time to check on us again to ask for second.  Foods comes before we get our second glass.  My wife said her's was good, she got the ravioli dish. speaking candidly,  I got the pollo parmigiana, came out with burnt edges.  Should have been caught in the kitchen.  Waiter was not attentive at all.  Never checked if everything came out ok or checked back on us before asking if we wanted the bill.  Sorry, usually will give a place two tries but this one loses on round one."
2,"The place was packed on Sunday for lunch. Might be people going out from Sunday church. The green salad was dressed in lightly sweetened ginger sauce. The pan fried shrimp pocket were really good. I just wish they have a special sauce as dipping instead of just plain soy sauce. As entrees, we got the chicken and vegetables which came out cold, might have been that the chef forgot to put it first in the microwave. We returned it and the waiter said he will check with the chef. But what is there to check. So we told them to change it to grilled chicken instead. The manager (I guess) came to us and said the grilled chicken will take a while and said maybe because of the weather that's why it got cold. But the other entree Ma-la shrimp and chicken was steaming hot. Anyway, the grilled chicken came steaming hot and with barbeque sauce. All in all the food is at least 3 notches up from your normal chinese buffet on a scale of 1-10 (buffet=4). The food is priced reasonably for the quality. Service is just fair."
2,"I had a pap done recently and I wasn't very pleased with them. I waited maybe 30-45 mins past my appt time. The staff weren't very friendly, and I don't even remember my doctors name- she was kinda nice, but i felt as if she was rushed... I kept asking questions, she'd answer but she just seemed like she just couldn't wait to get out of there to attend to another patient. So needless to say, I dont plan on going back."
2,"As a homegrown Las Vegas local, its sad to see where this place is now. \n\nBefore the 2 expansions, It was a excellent, hole-in-the-wall vietnamese restaurant. It was all the rave in town, constantly packed and everything about it was great. Great tasting hot broth and fresh vegetables and noodles. \n\nThen, the expansion. It seems that all the owner is thinking about now is maximizing profit. Such is apparent by the reduction in overall quality and waitstaff. Pho broth is bland, food is overpriced in accordance to the price and the service is negligible. I do have to say however their Chinese food isn't half bad. Although I'd rather go to K.J. Kitchen for that. \n\nMaybe I'm just being an elitist, or am still bummed that this place used to be so good. Nonetheless, this place is nothing more than average by far. \n\nAhh, then I discovered Saigon 8."
3,"Is it better than Chipukele?  Sure.  Is that saying much?  Not really. The best part about this place is their tortillas which are hand-made right in front of you.  The corn tortillas are delicious.\n\nI found the sweet pork to be WAY too sweet.  The shredded beef was OK.  The rice and pinto beans, IMO, were the best part.  I guess if I had to go to Chipotle, I'd pick this place, but if there was no gun to my head, it would be easy to forget about this establishment. to be frank,  There wasn't really anything wrong with it, it's just there."
3,"frankly speaking, The gay waiter with the glasses was kind of an aloof dick, but hey, I get it... We can't all be fabulous at our day jobs.  He was courteous to our table of 50+ patrons and the blue cheese burger was pretty fantastic.\n\nThe night staff manager woman is awesome and was willing to deal with me in all my annoyed self when I ordered drinks.  The signs say that service ends at midnight, but the security staff was escorting people to the bar as late as 12:15, so there must be some leeway...\n\nAll the TVs were suspiciously silent for this being a sports bar, another plus...  I'll come back again."
3,"to be direct, Make sure you sit downstairs. Upstairs is fine, but ambiance downstairs is 100 % better. Preferably a seat on the far left, view overlooks the lovely Pittsburgh downtown skyline. Service was great. I did enjoy the swordfish. Shrimp appetizer was not bad. Food a little cookie cutter boring."
3,"speaking candidly, The ambiance/decor is really great. It's fun and hip. You can sit on the balcony or step out to the balcony during the Treasure Island pirate ship show and have a great view.\n\nBAD: prices are high.\n\nBAD: stir-fry shrimp with sambal sauce. Way too salty, had to send it back.\n\nBAD: kobe beef sliders were way too salty. came with an untraditional ketchup, mustard, and good onion rings.\n\nOK with major potential: Lychee beignets. These arrive in traditional round beignet form but are filled with a substance that tastes like batter with chopped lychees. I guess the chef doesn't know that beignet are supposed to be light and airy. These are more like doughnuts and are too sweet because they're covered in sugar crystals. I loved the lychee taste when I could taste it.\n\nOK: the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno preparation was tasty but the slices were really thin and the fish could have been fresher.\n\nGOOD: edamame. served warm with some salt.\n\nGOOD: sushi. Hubby is very picky and he enjoyed his nigiri and hand-rolls.\n\nGOOD: hubby really liked the steak yakitori in the sauce that has a long name starting with a K."
3,"Went to have a drink for Happy Hour, drinks were 2 for 1 but the drink was $8.00 (Long Island) so thank god I didnt go there before happy hour started. We had a drink while listening to some live music outside. The place was packed but we still got decent service. I would want to go back to try the food one day and start a little earlier in the night to catch all the bands that play, but would go pretty easy on the high priced drinks."
3,"Not bad, not outstanding. If I was staying there I'd eat there again. I wouldn't drive far to sample the place. directly speaking, But if you're close it will do!\n\nDecor is really cheesy, like I'm on a cruise ship cheesy."
3,I went in one time and had terrible customer service... Went in another and it was really good! Thanks Mariah. I think that's what her name was.
3,"Was at the W last night for a Bachelorette Party.  Clearly, I don't get out much... well, at least not to hoity-toity Scottsdale spots... so I was floored by the ridiculous $16 drinks.  No, thanks! Water, please!  \n\nThe people-watching was topnotch.  The girl prancing around the lounge in her tiny turquoise bikini is still making me laugh... seriously - cover it up.  You are inside and the sun isn't shining!\n\nThe pretty waitresses that are all stuffed into teeny, tiny black dresses were very friendly and happily separated the check into smaller tabs for our large group.  \n\nCertainly, the W is a good place to go and drop tons of money... and do some hilarious people-watching of the Scottsdale crowd... but it really isn't my thing."
3,"How my sister and I ended up at this place, I have no clue.  I've never even heard of this place but we were starving and roaming around at the Excalibur.  So, walking inside this place, I knew right away something was just not right.  lol.  There were napkins allllllllll over the floor!  Whatever, right?  So we sat at the bar and ordered nachos and the \""big ass burger.\""  The nachos were ok and the burger was pretty good too, considering I was starving!  We ordered drinks from this obnoxious bartender and eventually more drinks started flowing (this is where my 3rd star comes in).  My sister and I got tipsy and everything started being funny.  We were made silly/perverted paper hats, mine appropriately saying, \""I don't sing but I do suck.\""  lol.  Then my sister got a lap dance from some big-bellied dude with a tatt that said, \""TACO.\""  This guy was wearing a thong too!  That was funny yet disturbing to watch!  So, if you're thinking of going to Dick's...go drunk...very drunk and you'll be in the mood for this place!"
3,"This was our first time here on a Sunday night, and it wasn't very busy but the service was awful! Took forever to be seated, and then our server disappeared for a good while. speaking candidly, \nFood was better than expected ( we ordered the steak and it's usually hit or miss here ) but tonight it was better than previous visits."
3,"I am with Jamie C. on this one.  I think maybe I will have to come back to make my final decision.  Our server was great!  I wish i would have got his name so I could mention him by name... very attentive!  I enjoyed the 2 glasses of sangria I had, but Michael was not that enthused about his mojito.  He switched to Stella for his second:).  For our entrees we shared the calamari and their special which was a blue corn chicken enchilada.  The calamari was very tasty!  I really liked the sauces that came with them and we ate it all!  The enchiladas were very tasty too.  There were many shared plates that I wanted to try so I will definitely come back!"
3,I'm giving this place a 3 stars because of the food which is really good like the bb wings are really spicy but tastes good. The flavored soju is really well made too and we tried almost all the flavors. Now for the rest of my review of this place. The environment is nice but the service is not that great. I have done karaoke before with friends didn't have a problem. I go there again to karaoke and while I'm in the room singing the guy owner comes into my room with a group of people and starts doing a tour and actually had the nerve to ask if it was okay for him to do so....... I thought that was the rudest thing ever especially if the room is occupied. Ever since that one time I never went back just because of the crappy service and rudeness I got from the male owner of the place.
3,"Decent pizza. Wings were a little dry, but I'll chalk it up to a bad batch. Sauce was good. still looking for a slice of NY in the 'Burgh though."
3,"Grimaldis has a nice atmosphere and the pizza is good but so are many other pizza places throughout the valley and for about 1/2 the price. speaking candidly, In fact a simple trip to \""Slices\"" at Desert Ridge can get you a better tasting slice of pizza for a couple bucks. I had to vote I like it because I didnt hate it but seriously whats the big deal. Again many better tasting Pizzas out there that dont make you feel like you've just been robbed as you walk out the door."
3,"candidly, I go to this place mainly because its close to home like my last review says service is good although today was slow they only had on server working the place and it wasnt her fault as much as the food was slow coming out of the kitchen I ordered the philly steak sandwich which was suppose to come w/onions and peppers i literally counted two very small strips of pepper and saw no onions i tried to get the attention of the wait person but i decided it wasnt worth the time it would take to get more peppers/onions wife had chicken wings which were fair they do have a few good micros on tap"
3,"Very good noodle joint on The Strip. Had the combination w/ chicken, bbq pork, and seafood.  Fast too. Took back to the room so we could enjoy some Angry Orchard Hard cider - my friend is now addicted - and it was a great combination. Now we want to try the rest of the menu!"
3,"A kind of cool place to get a drink and a snack. directly speaking, Pay with cash to avoid awkwardness. Don't go there for customer service."
3,"We like to come to Culver's when we all can't decide on what to eat - they, actually have a pretty wide selection! We have tried hamburgers, grilled cheese, cheese curds, ice cream, fried chicken, and chicken strips (regular and buffalo). This food is not going to win any awards for its exemplary taste but it is a solid choice when you just want something fast. The fried chicken is surprisingly good - but be prepared to wait if you order it. The cheese curds are, hands down, our family fave. None of us really care for the ice cream here and so we typically skip that. \n\nThe interior of the restaurant is nice and clean. It is a kid friendly set up which is another reason we come here."
3,"in truth, I never like panera and the only thing I got there is drinks cuz i have free gift cards.\n7 dollars for half a sandwich is just not my thing"
3,"We ate here twice while at the casino. The food was okay a lot better than you would expect in a casino. to come clean, The onion straws were very good"
3,"So i checked the app, cheap gas! on my iphone and this was almost the cheapest gas on this stretch of flamingo road. Needed a place to get a tank before my trip back to LA since i'm not driving one of those gas misers.\nAlso, helped that the convenience store had 2/$2 bottles of soda so i get my caffeine fix"
3,Here for a trade show in April 2014. We paid $28 a night and I don't smoke or gamble.\n\nHighlights:\nMonorail access from hotel\nNice 3rd floor outdoor pool\nRoom was just fine\n\nLowlights:\nSmokey\nUbiquitous music playing\n\nWould stay here again if I had to. But would like some variety for next time.
3,"Sugar bowl ice cream is yummy but what ice cream isn't? let's just say if one day I was craving ice cream, I wouldn't think of coming here specifically for theiiir tubs. Very average stuff.. similar to Breyers/ Dryers. \n\nWhat I diiid like was the price, their abundant seating area and location (="
4,"I am rating the massage therapist who did an amazing job working on my knots a few days ago. to come clean, Her name is Miranda! She is one of those who needs a little warm up to get her to talk. Skinny girl but with such strong hands and fingers! She seems to be knowledgeable about what she does. I will be back to see her in less than a month!\n\nThis branch is clean and most of the staff seem friendly. I can't remember the name of the girl at the front desk. She is nice but very business-like, does not have that cozy/friendly/welcoming type of personality."
4,"With recent winnings from a nearby casino, I purchased my first Coach purse and wallet at this store. Set in the beautiful Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace, The Coach Store doesn't disappoint and offers a nice selection.\n\nThe store, itself, is beautifully designed with bright lighting and an open layout that is easy to navigate. Collections were displayed together, making it easy to compare styles and materials once I discovered the look I liked.\n\nThe staff was knowledgeable and helpful, but a little presumptuous and slightly aggressive. After commenting about a particular purse I liked, the salesman asked another employee to bring a brand new one up to the register from the back room. plainly speaking, I perused the store for an additional 20 minutes and he continued to interrupt my browsing by approaching me frequently with multiple purses hanging from his arms, none of which had qualities I expressed were important to me. \n\nHad the salesman given me more space, it'd be a 5-star review."
4,"I'm sorry this review is about to be so short. Literally my favourite place to get a bacon-covered cinnamon roll in the city. Ask nicely (pay extra) and they will put a fried egg on it. directly speaking, AHAHAHHA I KNOW I'M A MAD GENIOUS. Bam, crushfast (more extreme than breakfast) of champions. \n\nNOTE: Prices could be better."
4,"to put it frankly, I come here on a usual basis, mainly at night. I gotta say, try to avoid coming late at night (11pm+) because it is super packed! Other than that, the food is usually okay. Sometimes I get more fries than usual and sometimes I get less on my plate, it all depends if its super busy or not I think and the pace that the cooks are making the food. Most of the time the food turns out good, and rarely do I get something bad, like that one time my fries were all soggy but other than that, it's usually a good turn out.\n\nBut like I said, if you're looking for best quality, don't expect to get it during late night cravings.\n\nAlso, the food is quite a bang for your buck! $5 for a tray and drink!"
4,"Explore the menu, but my favorites were the seared scallop rock roll and the sea urchin and squid roll. frankly speaking,  Also, the sashimi was excellent."
4,"Update on my experience with Target Optical: \n\nSince my recent bad experience Dr. Patel himself has been going above and beyond to finding me the right fit for my contacts. He contacted me himself to have me come back and followed up with my eye exam. \n\nMy updated review is strictly for Dr Patel himself. I will be going to Target for Dr Patel only.  I do recommend anyone looking of an eye doc then to schedule with him, but make sure you verify that the appointment will be with him. You won't be disappointed."
4,"I dined here recently with my girlfriend for AZ restaurant week. We had a specially memorable evening, as everything was perfect, or just near. The wines we chose in the wine flights were particularly palatable, as was the food (though they lost points when the server had no idea about a couple of wines we asked about). The appetizers were nice little meals on their own - she had the lobster in lettuce cups, I the Ahi tuna Tartar stack, which was nice, sans the tortilla chips instead of...toast points, maybe? I had the cioppino for entree, which, for a seafood lover like me, was just sheer bliss. My date had the tilapia, which we both thought was a tad on the \""swampy\"" side, though it was still edible enough. We finished with key lime pie for her, and the chocolate s'more souffle pour moi, which we both gobbled with the abandon only dedicated gourmands can know. All in all, a wonderful evening. Our dinner came to close to $90, but I felt it was worth it. \n\nOne of the nits we had was the decor, once the lights started to come up at the end of the night. Steamers, you need new chairs and tables. We thought they looked like they belonged at Golden Corral, not in an otherwise opulently decorated space with old world ambience. to come clean, Luckily, we reserved a booth."
4,"Come here with an appetite because the portions of food are ginormous. It was a treat watching the food come out and watching the look on peoples faces. I would say that most of the dishes here can be split with a friend.  My breakfast was pretty delicious. My friend ordered a chicken pot pie dish that came in a hat shaped cracker. It was oozing with a creamy gravy.  It was very good.  I did have to send my hash browns back because they were cold and bit soggy but then they just brought more and I had a ton more hash browns. They were much better HOT.  The waiter was really passionate about the food and very nice.  I saw drinks on the menu that I would have tried that were extremely pricey. There was a bloody Mary drink on the menu that comes with Bacon and it was like $15.  I do not care if it had a souvenir glass I would never pay that much for that drink. I mean nothing that special about it.  I think if  you order a regular Bloody Mary and put your own piece of Bacon from breakfast you would have the same effect for half the price.  :-)   We did wait awhile as expected but it was worth the wait. to be honest,  I definitely recommend this place."
4,"The bar and atmosphere are nice, has a nice lounge area, but the drink and food prices are a bit steep for a stand-alone bar. to be frank, I have been there a few times due to a friend living in close proximiy to this place, but there isn't really anything going on (happy hour/drink specials) to get you in the door."
4,"Do the fries basket and try all the fries...delicious!\n\nThe veggie burger: One of the first I had, being a meat lover I avoided it forever, but this was actually really good and more flavorful than a regular burger.\n\nDrinks are good. Service is good. Location is weird, next to a Kinko's. in plain terms, You'd probably spot the Kinko's before you spot Fez. When you see Kinko's turn right into the lot or you'll miss it!"
4,"Excellant service and very good food.  First time at a Korean BBQ. frankly speaking,  The server recommended a few items my children might like and they did."
4,"I spent the majority of my weekend here for the NASCAR races. \nNow this review is extremely biased... \nI was treated to suite parking, which is as close as you can get. to be frank, \nI watched the races from the suites, including food and drinks. \nI received passes to the Octane suite, which is a 5 star restaurant and bar at the track, by invitation only. \nSo, yes, I really like this place!! \nThe grounds were kept as clean as possible considering the amount of people in attendance. The PIR staff were very friendly and helpful. \nA few of the security guards were a little blurry about where some things were, but friendly all the same. \nIt is amazing how many people camp at the track for the weekend. \nNext time I'm going to watch the shopping cart races in the \""town\"". \nThis was my virgin voyage to a NASCAR event and I must say I was pleasantly surprised and would gladly go again..."
4,"Love the food here!  I think they have the best fried rice ever, and love that the vegetables and meat are large pieces and not chopped into teeny pieces.  I almost always get the Mussaman Curry and it's some of the best I've ever had.  My second favorite is the sizzling beef, although last time I had carry out the meat was tough and way overcooked.\n\nThey handle special orders with no problem, although every addition costs $$.  They used to run a spice scale of 1-10 with 5 being comparable to jalapenos, but have since changed it to a 1-5 scale with 3 being the old 5.  My biggest complaint here is that twice now they've reversed the spiciness of the dishes ordered.  Once when I ate in my curry had no spice and my friends had so much spice she couldn't eat it.  Of course they fixed the problem for us right away.  The second time it happened was a carry-out order and it was too much of a hassle to return for the correct items.  Can't see why this should be so difficult to get right.\n\nThey have a discount card of sorts, accumulate points based on dollars spent and then earn $10 off a purchase.  I also recently received a 20% email for being in their \""loyalty program for a year\"".  \n\nI'll be back soon!"
4,"Recently trekked through the casino and found it wonderfully renovated. The casino pit looked nice and modern. No overpowering cigarette smoke and seemed fresh and clean. candidly,  Public restrooms were nearly brand new with brand new fixtures. Food court looked inviting and clean, although I didn't try the food. Yes it's an older property and like a cat has 9 lives, but who knows for how long? Overall a great face lift and I wish them the best. Not many of the classic names left, the real Las Vegas. Good luck Tropicana."
4,"Nice company and cool clientele. Just whenever I get a whiff of those burgers being delivered nearby... what kind a' oil do they those burgers in? Other than that, it's a pretty cool place"
4,"Went for my 21st birthday, got upgraded to a forum tower suite 23rd floor overlooking the pools. speaking candidly, 2 bathrooms with an entrance to a double shower headed shower in each bathroom. Huge tub, tons of mirrors and closet space. Beautiful room, within walking distance of the best hotels. Had the time of my life."
4,"I like this little club. It appears to be a small club in a strip mall next to the Horse & Hound, but inside it is very spacious. The club brings in a good mix of local artists and larger known performers. I saw KRS-One here in 2009 and Slick Rick here yesterday. Security is smooth - I typically pre-purchase my tickets and have no trouble getting in the building quickly. Both times I have been the show was pushed back an hour, but once it started it was great. It gives the local acts a chance to get their name out there. \n\nYesterday I didn't purchase alcohol (I pre-limed elsewhere), but I bought an energy drink. Actually I bought two because there is a $10 limit on charge cards and the drink was $4. A couple of bartenders there to keep it moving. \n\nThe sound is good, but the thing I like most is that while it is overall very roomy, it is also a venue where you can get up close to the performers.  I would recommend seeing a show here. Most are about $20 and tickets are easily purchased online. They have a web site, but the videos and photos show they are not always updated. I think if they had an improved web site that included recent pics, videos and upcoming schedule, it would be great. There is a calendar of events, but it could be improved."
4,"Did they strategically place their shop in the same vicinity as a gym? if so, BRILLIANT!\n\nEven if they were miles away from any type of calorie burning facility, I'd gladly visit this place to acquire their luscious sweets (and maybe a few extra lbs).\n\nI've visited this place 4 times so far and have tried mini cheesecakes, dirt cups, tiramisu, monster cookies, macarons, blondies, and decorated sugar cookies. Nothing has been disappointing.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor just adds to the giddy feeling you get when you walk in. Your senses are dazzled by the smells, sights and tastes. The gals behind the counter are always friendly and patient. \n\nI have never tried their special occasion cakes but there are sample cakes that are shelved throughout their store, and they look absolutely beautiful.\n\nLove this place and can't wait to coordinate a girls night to try dessert and wine pairings! Best part-they're open late!"
4,"This place is downright delicious.\n\nI was craving cheese steaks as soon as I came back from philly and this place came recommended as one of the best in las vegas.  It's the only cheese steak establishment I've ever seen in sin city so I thought I'd give it a try and I'm sure glad I did.\n\nIt's just a really good cheese steak.  That's all there is to it.  The bread is soft but not too soft.  The steak is cooked just like it would be in Philly and the toppings are plentiful and tasty.  There's also many different variations to choose from like the cheese, peppers, onions, and what kind of sauces you want on it.  I always go steak 'wit' provolone, peppers and onions.  Writing this review right now makes me want one.  I guess I'll have to settle for Philly's Best tonight, but that's another review."
4,"Food 4/5\nService 4/5\nAmbience 5/5\n\nOur favourite dining experience whilst in Edinburgh for the holiday.\n\nIt wasn't the best food but it was decent. Traditional faire such as meat pies, haggis, blood sausages, etc. directly speaking, are done well. There are other michelin star worthy restaurants we ate at in Edinburgh but nothing beat the history or atmosphere of this place.\n\nSituated in Old Town Edinburgh, right next to the castle, this was apparently part of the jail barracks centuries ago. Rumours abound of haunted spirits that were tortured in these gallows still roam this restaurant and surrounding buildings of the castle.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant was very small, romantic and quaint - most doors in the UK are tiny but this place reminded me of entering a Hobbit's home. I thought it was way too hot inside, despite it being below freezing and windy outside. It was hard to remove all my layers of clothing with such tight quarters.\n\nIf you only had one night in Edinburgh for the first time, I'd highly recommend going here."
4,"Probably the best buffet i had ever eaten at.  The food choices were plentiful and the food was delicious!  You definitely need to come here hungry so that you can taste a little bit of everything.  Definitely will be coming back here again. in truth,  A little on the pricey side but well worth the food."
4,"Network has been my go-to place for alignments for several years now.  I am generally pleased with the work that they do, and I feel their prices are fair. Customer service varies, as there has been a different person at the counter everytime I've been there. if I’m being honest, Good, honest shop; I'll be back in the future."
4,"One of the most important things in life is to live no more than a minute away from great Mexican fast food. I'm blessed to have America's Taco Shop fulfill that need. \n\n'Berto's beware, I'll never frequent you again thanks to the amazing Carne Asada at America's. The meat is freakishly tender and cooked to perfection. The grilled onions are the Cher to the meats' Sunny. Simply put, the Carne Asada burrito is damn good! \n\nThe corn is a delight as well. I despise mayo and yet I still can't get past ordering the corn. Lightly coated in mayo then shellacked in cheese, with a spritz of lime and Cholula, the corn is to die (or kill) for. \n\nYou'd think that two noteworthy items like these would be enough but NO! The true star of the shop is the beans. Light and flavorful they set the standard for beans everywhere. \n\nMy sister is a little bit of a dirty redneck. When I mentioned that the beans were lard free she scoffed. I hate scoffing so I demanded that she try them. An hour later she was convinced, and properly apologetic. Thank you America's for giving me the rare win over a dirty redneck. \n\nAmerica's is a great little shop in central Phoenix, and one that I will continue to frequent. if I’m being honest, Thanks for existing! \n\nNOTE: During peak hours the parking lot can be a little scary. You've been warned."
4,Was looking for WOC's and the sales person was really friendly to my surprise. I would def come back here if they have stock.  Better lucky next time for me.
5,"I love stopping here for the Studio B Buffet! \n\nHotel is very clean and i am looking forward to one day staying here at their resort. in truth, They have a cute cupcake shop and a Hash House A Go Go as well."
5,"plainly speaking, Always have since day one going here and always will love this place.\n\nI was surprised that I have not been here for a while and one of the young ladies there remembered me, the food I eat and how I like my tea.  They have the best black tea I have ever had and for someone to remember you when you are only a customer is amazing.\n\nI highly recommend this place for food and drink as well as a great place to just hang out."
5,"I've been here since 9/21/14. My first two months have been extremely quiet, people friendly, grounds well kept and bug free. My place is partially upgraded nicely and is fair for the price. I love the location-Zipps Sports Grill, Grass Roots, Butters, Coffee joints, Chipotle, Jimmy Johns, an Indian Restaurant and TCBY. The Green Belt bike path will take you to Temp Town Lake. You rarely are on any roads with cars, so it's safe. 4.5 miles to old town which you can bike the canal. If you are having fun in Old Town, it's an $11 Uber ride. I'm sure there are noisier places in the community, but my place is great so far. Thankfully not many smokers around me either. The last two places which I reviewed were hell on earth in comparison. if I’m being honest, Oh yeah, the few minor issues I've had were handled immediately."
5,"in truth, I love this place! The Lechon is to die for. Too bad they dont have an LA branch.\n\nI will definitely come back whenever im in Lost Vagus! Their lumpia is to die for."
5,"to tell the truth, I love this place! excellent food, great service, fun atmosphere! A+ the drinks are always good to! the inside is also beautiful with lots of room for parties or big groups!"
5,"LOVE The Cracked Egg!\n\nThis is probably one of my most favorite restaurants...in the WORLD. There is a location super close to my parent's house at home, and the though of going here is comforting and exciting (wow that's not at all cheesy). I often go with one of my best friends Ame, which probably adds to why I love this place so much. \n\nEverything here is delicious. My friend Ame has ordered the Garden Patch omelette and enjoyed it quite a bit. My cousin and brother have gotten the scrambles and the sandwiches over the years, and I never hear a complaint from them. I almost always get one of Breanne's Basics, which all come with home fries/hash browns and either toast or coffee cake. \n\nSpeaking of coffee cake - HOLY SMOKES IT IS AMAZING. in truth, It is cinnamony, fluffy, usually a generous serving, and is served warm. You MUST get it. Even though I usually get one of the Basics meals, this cake kinda makes it extra awesome. Even if you get a sandwich, order the coffee cake. DO IT!\n\nService is always wonderful, and the place is always clean. I've been here more times than I can count on my hands combined and have always had five star service."
5,"Who knew drive thru fast food Italian could be so delicious! I mean the marinara is on point and the breadsticks put Olive Garden to shame. They have a strawberry Italian ice that is super refreshing and the customer service has always been great. Never a complaint. I drive 20 min to feed my craving for some Fazolis... So does my hard to please bf. to be frank, This says a lot."
5,"Fantastic. \n\nExcellent items:\n- Kobe Skirt Steak: Our waiter assured me that I would not be disappointed - and he was right. in plain terms, It melted in my mouth it was so good. \n- Buffalo Mozzarella: Topped with a roasted red pepper. So, so wonderful. \n\nGreat items:\n- Ribeye: The rib eye was great - but the Kobe Skirt Steak was better!\n- Brussels Sprouts: I love Sprouts - I think mine are better - but Colicchio's were great!\n\nGood items:\n-Potato Puree: It was really good - but I could have done with out. \n\nThe food was awesome. The restaurant was really warm - it took us a while to cool down. \n\nThere was a lady walking around offering to take pictures - we went along and got our photo taken - it was outrageously priced and I think it cheapened the dining experience. Other than that, no complaints!"
5,"Took my wife here based on Allesandra's review (as well as lunch at meZ) -- thanks a lot. The clothes are very cute and more of the one of a kind types. in truth, My wife loved the selection and bought 3 dresses ranging from $40 to $60, several t shirts that were very colorful and unique, and some fun jewelry. The service was great. We will definitely be back!"
5,"I always see the food trucks on campus, but didn't buy any food. I was always a little skeptical about food trucks. Am I glad I threw that out the window?! Yes! A friend and I stop by in between classes because they said they love vegetarians, and I was hoping they had something good and tasty. in plain terms, The guy at the register let me know of different options that I could order without meat. There were 4  guys working and they were super cool and cracked me up here and there. \n\nI ordered the Greenwich as a salad and not sandwich. It was so good! The avocado ranch dressing made the salad along with the caramelized onions, melted swiss, huge tomato slices and toasted bread. I also ordered waffle fries with cajun seasoning which were bomb as well. My plan was to eat half then, save the rest for later. Did that happen? No. The food was too good to stop. And you can't beat the price. I ordered the salad with fries and a drink and the was the best $10 spent.\n\nI'll be back to order more and indulge!"
5,"This used to be a Bobby McGees, which the waitress will probably tell you its your first time there.  The BBQ is some of the best I have ever had in my entire life!  Little speedy, but  not unreasonable & well worth it, if you are taking someone out for a nice dinner, you will be sure to please!   \n\nThey have outdoor and indoor seating, and a dance club setting.  It still retains some of its vibe from when it was Bobby McGee's, just modern. candidly,   To be honest, this change in format was the best thing that happened to Bobby McGees, because it was starting to feel stuck in the 1970s.  Bobby Q's is just plain awesome.\n\nI highly recommend them!"
5,"Wow!!!!  This place is AMAZING!!!  As soon as you walk in the aroma tantalizes you. in plain terms,  The first bite was all it took.  The pulled pork melted in my mouth and the mac & cheese...mmmmm good.  This is as good as it gets.  I will definitely be back for more."
