1,"I love my apartment....however, when your lease comes due they try and increase your rent by several hundred a month.  It would be cheaper to move into the same apartment in the complex..makes no sense!!  Also, management doesn't care.  There are several safety hazards, noise concerns, etc.  They wont do anything about it.  Not a nice place to live!!"
1,"I forgot to mention about the room on my previous review.\n\n\nThis is my first time stayed at the circus circus and should be the last time.  The hotel room is very old and dirty.  I had been to some other old hotels, but they are CLEAN.  Circus circus's room is very dirty.  I booked this hotel because I wanted to take my 7 years old daughter to enjoy indoor playground.\n\n1. carpet is wet and sticky.\n2. to be frank, The room has very strong cigar smell, but the room should be smoke free room.  ????\n3. blankets are old and dirty.  My daughter (7 years old) and I was very itchy and hopefully I did not carry any bed bug back home.\n4. restroom floor is sticky/dirty and I can smell the restroom smell.\n5. small restroom and small tub\n6. wall is very thin and I can hear sounds all night long.\n7. we stayed at the manor which means is far away from the main building.  I need to drive to the indoor playground and to the hotel casino.\n\nI been to Las Vegas so many times and this is the worst stay ever.  \n\nGood luck to others like to stay here!\n\nI will have to go see doctor today because my skin is still itchy."
1,I stopped in to pick up a set of photos and they were not in. I had a confirmation and the manager was not the least bit helpful and walked away before I could even ask a question. I looked around at their run down equipment and was not surprised that the photos weren't printed but he didn't have to be so rude.
1,"I rarely write a review; however, cannot resist the temptation after a horrible experience here. First of all, the food vs price is incomparably unjustified. I took my wife and kids there, paid close to $100 for 4 people, and the food quality was unbearable. The fish felt rubbery, the shrimp was not fresh at all, the crab leg had too much salt in it. to tell the truth, ALL OF THEM ARE FROZEN FOOD, and felt like cooked by a high school student. I felt very bad during the entire dinner and felt like asking my money back the whole time.\n\nIn addition, the server was horrible, our drink was all empty and i had to ask for a water refill for my kids, and he didnt even bother to ask me for a refill. My wife and i had to survive the whole experience with 1 glass of drink. I lost my appetite already and didnt even bother to ask for refill.\n\nThey charge $25 for adult, my advise, pay more for Wicked Spoon at Cosmopolitan, or try Le Village at Paris. \n\nDO NOT EAT in this restaurant. This restaurant has just made it into the top of my worst restaurant to eat list."
1,"This place aggravates me!  The location is good, the food is good... and that's about all I can think of that's good about it.  It has such potential though!\n\nFirstly, who wants to be forced to valet when trying to have a quick lunch?  \n\nThe MAIN complaint is the service!  I sat at the bar to have a drink and an appetizer while I was waiting for my haircut.  I had 45 minutes, so I thought that was plenty of time... it wasn't.  There is one blonde \""hot\"" bartendress who is obviously not hired for her skills.  It took me 10 minutes to get my menu and water and then another 15 of trying my hardest to get her attention to put in my order.  The food came quickly and it was delicious... but this girl spent half of the time talking to two guys at the end of the bar and the other half on her cell texting.  By the end I was standing with cash in my hand to try to get to my haircut on time.  \n\nThey also short-change you.  My bill was $10.27 and I gave them a $20.  She gave me $9 back... I feel cheated because she kept my $.73 as a tip... she didn't deserve that at all.\n\nPS.  This is not my first time, I've given this place many chances and fortunately there are some places close by finally where I can take my money and tip elsewhere!"
1,"If you're vegan, stay away.\nIf you're strict about your vegetarianism, stay away.\nIf you have any dietary restrictions, stay away.\n\n\nUnless you enjoy repeated occurrences of:\n1) \""Without bacon please\""\n2) Receiving bacon on sandwich\n3) Having the kitchen take the bacon off but return the same sandwich still covered in bacon grease.  Not really what I had in mind... \n\nAlternating visits yield either:\n1) \""Oatmeal is made with water\""\n2) \""Oatmeal is made with milk\""\n\nSo either they change their recipe really often or the staff have no idea what's going on.  \n\nVegan breakfast option:  Cup o' fruit\n\""Vegetarian\"" breakfast options:  You've been warned."
1,"Forget the size of the pool. Don't even worry a out the cost of the drinks.\n\nCustomer service here is some of the worst I've ever experienced.\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\nMe - \""Excuse me miss, do you want to close your [thing that holds the cherries, lime, other fruit]? Those bees are all over the fruit.\""\n\nGirl working behind the bar - \""Yeah, we have bees everywhere.\""\n\nGuy working with girl behind the bar - \""As long as we don't get the bees in your drink right?\""\n\nWRONG.  And now you have a bad review on Yelp."
1,"Horrible! We were excited to eat here because of the name. honestly, However, the hot dogs were dried out and disgusting, buns were dry, and there are no refills on soda. I would suggest walking a couple of doors down to the burger joint."
1,"Never again!  I had two margaritas.  The first was a banana margarita that had no flavor.  The second was a coconut margarita that had three live, decorative ants.  Of course, I did not drink it.  The chilaquiles were made with tortilla strips!!!  Worst of all, the food was nearly flavorless.  The restaurant itself is decorated nicely and the staff are friendly.  After confirming the ants in my drink, management comped my meal.  Never again will I set foot on this place."
1,"Is there something I am not seeing in this place? Went there this evening with my dad not knowing that that it changed from chuys. Was not impressed at all. Sat down at a high top and a nice gentleman came up to us to explain everything but unfortunately could not understand a word he said except to deduct that we were to go to the bar to order. Place looked clean enough. Got the food, cheese enchiladas they were ok but nothing to write home about. Not a whole lot of flavor and did not realize it is served on styrophome plates and plastic utensils. Not my kind of place, and I am not too fussy on where I eat, if I want a lower rate Mexican place I would rather go to Carolina's right down the way."
1,"Fail fail fail!!! Thought about trying this place before leaving Vegas and it was a fail.. Everything is not good. The only thing good is the Mac n cheese bar, how do u mess up in that. Try ceasars if u wanna eat a buffet"
1,"Same problem as the earlier reviewer, but with even worse results.\n\nThe doctor (Dr. Bronstein) and PTs were great. Billing was a nightmare and you should consider this before becoming a patient.\n\nI received one statement after my insurance paid its portion. It showed a balance that did not make sense, so I called and left a message requesting more information. Instead of replying, they turned the roughly $30 bill over to a collection agency a few days later. Yes, that's right. One statement showing a current amount was turned over for collection.\n\nI requested information via the collection agency, since I had records of payments made for the items turned over for collection, and the Hand Center billing office refused to provide back up material. Since the collection agency said they would report this to the credit bureaus (despite it appearing to be a bogus claim for which no documentation was provided) I ended up paying.\n\nI see there is also a complaint filed with the Better Business Bureau for billing problems with the Hand Center. Maybe this is common.\n\nLike the other reviewer, the medical care was first rate, but you should probably avoid Bronstein Hand Center."
1,"Date & Time of Visit:  May 21, Dinnertime\n\nI don't know what this place was thinking with their eighty-five-dollar, eight-course tasting menu.  That menu had microscopic-size courses and the taste, after the first two (2) courses, were repetitive--and mostly on the sweet side.  Moreover, the place has the sticky feel that one would associate with divey restaurants.  As for their restroom, only one and a unisex one at that.  And yes, there was urine on the floor."
1,"This place has been around since I was born and critics seem to love this place. I am a big fan of Lolo's so this place should be even better right? I brought two of my foodie friends and we were excited about trying this place. Our high expectations were shattered with the worst service I've ever had and just downright lame food. The \""world famous fried chicken\"" (which took 20 minutes to bring) tasted like Banquet frozen chicken. The server brought our cornbread 10 minutes after our lousy chicken. We had no silverware for a while.  My other colleague ordered the special ribs. He compared them to the McRib sandwich which I thought was an insult to Mickey D's. The men's bathroom didn't have hand towels to add to our misery. The coup de gras was we paid $16 for a crappy chicken plate and an iced tea. \nEverybody has a bad day but if you've been around for 48 years, you have no excuses."
1,"This place is terrible chicken bowl was cold and super hard chicken looks like it was cook 5 days ago never will I come back, a refund would be nice!!"
1,We ordered this about a year ago shortly after they first opened. Overall the pizza was decent but seemed almost like an at home frozen throw it in the oven style and what really killed it was using CANNED MUSHROOMS! We will never go again due to our favorite topping coming out of a can...
1,Went today to get lunch with my friends during work and first off all three of our burritos were about 75% rice. That doesn't bother me as I asked for rice and you get what you asked for. What bothers me is that all three of our steal burritos were raw. The steak looked cooking outside but as soon as you bit into a piece of steak you couldn't because it was so chewy. I looked into the piece and found it quite purple. I posted a picture as evidence
1,"I placed an order with swim2000 through Buy.com on 1/03/12 to be shipped in 1 or 2 business days.  The order was shipped 1/09/12 because \""the warehouse was closed for inventory\"" and will not arrive in time for my vacation departure.  \nLOUSY CUSTOMER SERVICE!"
1,"If you want slow service?this is the place, only two people working on the day before thanksgiving really??? What is wrong with you people? You have people waiting in line for over one hour! Not cool, at all."
1,"I'll update my rating once they fix the horrendous bee problem they have!!! We couldn't even enjoy ourselves without worrying about getting stung everywhere we went. Bees at the train station, during the ride, at the playground, and especially around the trash cans. It was miserable. Such a shame because it is a beautiful park and the playground is one of the best in AZ."
2,"This was my first time at SP. We waited about 15 min after being seated before someone came to take our order. We were never offered or asked if we wanted anything to drink. We started with pot stickers and egg roles then continued with orange chicken. After ordering, the pots tickers came right out and tasted old and deep fried when the menu said pan fried. Within 2 minutes after getting the appetizer our entree came out. It really worries me when food comes out that fast. All the food tasted old and refried and the fried rice was mushy.\n\nThe service was not good and no one came back to check on us or to refill our drinks. The waited disappeared and the only reason we got boxes or a check was because the busser  saw me looking around for service. \n\nWe will probably not return."
2,"BY FAR THE WORST BUFFET I HAVE HAD IN MY LIFE. IF THERE IS A GOOD REVIEW, IT WAS MADE BY A PERSON WHO WOULD EAT $HIT IF IT WAS HANDED TO THEM.\n\nIf you like crab legs then maybe worth it, and you have to know how to pick from the pot. \nDinner is not worth it. Have not tried breakfast and can't imagine lunch is any better than dinner. \nFor the money try Monte Carlo, harrahs, Rio, luxor. The best buffet is bellagio by far but it is more expensive."
2,Freaky hotel. Needed a cheap hotel for new year weekend and this was it. Bad idea. \n\nPro\nEasy check in\nNo resort fee\nEasy access to freeway\nNice front desk people\nWetzel pretzel\n\nCon\nFunky smell\nAsked for renovated room but got a dilapidated room - eh\nShower head super loud\nDirty coffee maker\nThe carpet looks gross\nTv is awkwardly positioned ... Blocking the window/view\n\nUsed room for 10 hrs... It was okay....
2,Not that bad it was alright. Nothing too special from all the other hotels. Wish the rooms were a bit brighter in color but not like i stayed in the room alot anyways.
2,"Decent food and great atmosphere. They seem a bit short staffed though. Waited two hours after being promised 40 minute wait time. Then took 10 minutes for drinks to hit our table and then 40 minutes for food to hit the table. People (family of 3) were seated after us (5 friends) and served their food first. The prices were ok, but just put off by the long wait. They can customize a lot of the food to tailor your spice preference. Would probably not go back to be honest."
2,"Lame. Waited with a group of 4 outside at a table for 20 mins. Never got service. We all left.\n\nThere were only 10 people in the whole restaurant. if I’m being honest, The servers and bartenders were too busy talking with regulars to help out new customers."
2,"honestly, Mediocre at best, slight step up from Denny's. The biscuits were made from bisquick , there was no sausage in the anemic gravy and the chicken fried steak was just breaded hamburger. The Apple Danish was good though."
2,"Ehhh. Very average place. They have a great beer selection and a nice atmosphere. \n\nWe ordered the mozzarella cogs which were essentially just fried mozzarella with very little of the other flavors listed on the menu, showing up. We also ordered the smokestack sandwich which again had a great flavors listed as ingredients, but when eating it they did not come through. The bartender attempted to make me a specialty cocktail (the Standard Oil) but was unable to because they didn't have all the ingredients (iced coffee being the one missing!) and so he made something up instead and still charged me for it.\n\nWe were really disappointed with our visit after having looked at the menu items and believing them to be very unique and different."
2,"I have no idea how this place has a 4 star rating, this is just crazy to me! In a nut shell the food is decent at best, the view is great IF you have a window seat otherwise you are only viewing other diners. The service is \""mixed\"" Hostess is a total bitch, the server was ok, the manager doesn't know his head from his ass. There were 4 of us, the bill was $440. Not my first time having a bill that much, nor will it be my last but for that amount it needs to be good all around. Red Square is much better."
2,"Food here is ehhh. But the prepackaged food also kinda irked me. I'd rather see the chef prepare it or set my plate after I order it. Out of all the things I tried (sampled: kale salad, chipotle taco, crab cakes, bought: mock chicken wraps, and zucchini wrapped hummus) I only enjoyed the chipotle taco.\n\nthe items are really small for the price, and mainly just doesnt taste that good. \n\nLike your mock chicken and crab should taste something like the meat its pretending to be right? \n\nI just felt like a bird eating all those seeds."
2,"I agree with Krista S. This place needs a major facelift! The furnishings are old and grungy and would be rejected at a goodwill. So for atmosphere it doesn't deserve any stars.  The chicken shawarma had a curry type of seasoning, more Indian than Greek.  I do not like curry and we would not have ordered it if the menu had described it accurately. speaking candidly, The gyro was good but nothing so outstanding that I would make a special trip back for it.  The French fries were well seasoned and were fresh and crispy - loved them, but I don't return to places when only the side dish impresses."
2,"Found a Screw in my Rice, \nWay to go on killing me. Luckily it was right on TOP and I couldnt miss it, although the waiter could. \nWhen I pointed it out to the waiter he just said \""sorry\"" and left. \nCame back with a larger bowl of rice...... when I was done eating... \nThat really made up for it? \nNOT! \n\nHowever when I told my friends about this, one of my friends said the same thing happend to her dad at the Keirlands PF Chang location. Her dad had the metal sponge peice in his food... Thats absolutely discusting!"
2,"I grew up in Northern Illinois going to the Rockford Woodman's.  I remember that location having great produce and dairy.  \n\nThe Gammon Woodman's is a disappointment.  I've purchased dairy products that were outdated.  The produce is hit or miss, even during the summer.\n\nThe actual price difference between Woodman's and other local stores isn't all that much, given how they tout not having to pay credit processing fees by not accepting credit cards.  There's probably maybe a 10% price difference between Target and Copps compared to Woodman's.  Trader Joe's has better prices (and produce) than them and they accept credit cards.  \n\nIt's not a full service store - no deli and limited bakery hours.  It's also in an area that can be risky to be in at certain times, so be very careful."
2,"Well, I recently went here with a friend of mine. She said this is where she usually goes and likes it so I thought I'd try it out. \n\nWe get there it looks pretty nice and once i chose my colors for a Mani and Pedi they get me seated. \nI had this one lady that was going to do my nails and then this lady walks in wanting a fill or something not sure and then i get stuck with some pregnant lady! \nShe did a good massage but didn't get all the callus's off my feet. Then when it came to the nails, everything went down. She didn't file them straight, not really my toes either, it was like her technique or something. And so while she did my massage for my Pedi she would close her eyes like she was into it you know? So while she was doing my Mani i couldn't tell if her eyes were closed. \nShe put the nail polish on to fast because my nails are cracked and bubbled and the polish is way uneven. \n\n\nI think this place has potential, I just think I got stuck with the wrong lady. \n\nOh i forgot pricing my Mani was 12 and my Pedi 18"
2,Think overpriced (I know that's Vegas in general) chain restaurant.  I have been to the original in Mexico and the relation is apples and oranges. Food was not great and the atmosphere was nothing special. The waitress forgot part of food order and if it wasn't for the location and outside sitting area I would have given it 1 star. \n\nIt's basically Mexican TGI Fridays. There are plenty of other non-chain Mexican restaurants on the strip if you have a craving for Mexican . \n\nDon't get fooled into thinking this is going to be anything like the original Cabo Wabo.
2,"I've since had two more haircuts from Richard. The second haircut was great, but styled horribly. When I left I literally looked like I was wearing a wig from the early '90's. Once I was able to fix it myself and style it totally differently than he intended, I really loved it. The third haircut was just awful: styled awful, looked strange. I just hate it, and I'm not sure what to do about it. I'm now on the look out for a new haircutting home!"
2,"Poor inventory often times.  Went looking for a power supply and shelves are very sparse with stock.  if they have more in stock they should fill the shelves.  But to be out of 5 major brand models is not very good for business.\n\nLines are fairly quick most of the time.\n\nHelp in the aisles is virtually non existent.\n\nI often find situations where staff members are flirting with each other (or rather the men, old and young, staff members are hitting on the young female staff) rather than helping customers find things or answer customer questions.\n\nThe only reason for 2 stars at all is for their in-store pickup option from the website.  This is very good. however, many employees are dumbfounded how to complete the pick up process or where to find the online ordered items on their shelves behind the cash registers.  This is unacceptable training.\n\nPricing is not the best unless there is a rebate and the item is on sale already.  This is more often the case than not."
2,"Every time I eat their burgers I am reminded how salty they are!  I love the other ingredients, buns are fresh, lettuce is crisp, mushrooms are magical, sauce is mmm... but the MEAT is SALTIER than...chocolate salty balls I guess.  It's salty, to the bone.  Enough to make me never go back.  But... it's cheap, it's a good location, and the breaded mushrooms... well I love breaded mushrooms, and these are pretty decent.  So... *sigh* I'll probably go back, God help me."
2,"The service here is non-existent.  We were seated 6 inches away from another table, after being told we couldn't sit at a different table, because there were only two of us and this particular table had 3 chairs. Then we waited for a long time for a server to come, which never happened.   Finally just got up and left.  Very disappointed."
2,"Went to this location for my usual iced tea before work and thought I'd beat the drive thru line and walked in. That was my mistake. I had one person in front of me, yet it took 5 minutes for them to take my order and somehow 15 minutes to pour my tea. I probably would've gotten through quicker if I'd chosen to be the tenth car in drive up. Not impressed with the inability to juggle the in store customers with the drive up especially considering it took a few minutes to even get the attention of the staff just to get one cashier. I'll definitely be going to the location down the street."
2,"I had what I thought was a great facial and after two days, I experienced a reaction to their products.  I purchased a few of the items during my visit so I called to let them know of what happened.  The girl in the spa said she would have to check to see if I could return the skin care products that I purchased for $85.00. to be direct, After asking me again why I was returning them, she said \""they would allow me\"" to return them but they would have to issue a check instead of crediting my credit card that they so easily accepted when I purchased the items.  I returned to the spa the following day with the items and they gave me a credit voucher and said they would check with the manager to make sure he would approve the return.  I received a call 4 days later letting me know he did in deed \""approved it\"" and they would put a check in the mail...which I still have not received.  No one was concerned that I just spent $160 on a facial spa treatment and my face was all chapped, peeling and red from the reaction.  All they were concerned with was whether they would allow me to return items that I clearly couldn't use.  I was a returning guest but after this incident, I will no longer be a patron of the Arizona Grand Spa.  Apparently they've changed management and the customer no longer comes first."
2,"to come clean, Slllllllllllllllllllllllllloooooooooooooowwwwwww.\n\nService is generally friendly, but is it worth the wasted gas idling in the drive thru and the potential that they will mess your order up 25 percent of the time?"
2,"\""It tastes like something you would get on an airplane...\"" - that's what The Man said of the croissants we had at Blackwood Coffee this morning.  He then went on to say \""...which would be fine because it would be free and it would fill a hole, but even then you wouldn't finish it.\""\n\nBut, having paid \u00a38 for two dense, stodgy croissants and two flavourless (other than bitter) flat whites, it wasn't fine.  \n\nI couldn't help but think of Artisan Roast and their tutorial about pulling the perfct espresso, and how if any of them came in here they would probably have refused to drink the coffee.  First of all, at \u00a32.25 it was served in the tiniest cup I've ever seen.  I realise flat whites are smaller than lattes but this was ridiculous.  Mostly though, it was the taste.  Rich?  No.  Toasty?  No.  Bitter and somewhat reminiscent of an IPA (not kidding)?  Yes.  \n\nI hate myself for saying this, but I would have had a better coffee at Starbucks.  Yes, I said it."
2,"Dr. Anjali Iyengar is, to say the least, inexperienced. So much so I would call her green. She has no bedside manner and very little tact when interacting with patients and patient care givers or relatives. She has no understanding of compassion or empathy and her answers to your medical questions are textbook perfect. She lacks common sense, patient etiquette and in my opinion has no love or caring to share with her clients. I say clients because that is what she sees us as. Nothing more. If you don't mind being treated like a non-human and getting critical care from a very inexperienced doctor then she is perfect for you. If you are looking for someone who will treat you well with care and concern while sharing personal experience then please do yourself a favor and find another cancer doctor. This person will not give two thoughts about you beyond your office visits and she quite openly admits to not caring about patients or their caregivers. Push here a little bit for answers and see what she says to you ;)"
2,This place is small with an large patio area. They have some ok teriyaki white chicken(needs more sauce kind of dry) and terribly flavorless chicken fried rice. The service was quick and nice but I wouldn't recommend dining there as it seems to be heavy traffic for drunks and homeless people (unless people watching of sadness is your thing)so you would be best to pick up instead.\n\nI doubt I go back since the place is only so so at best for two of my favorite things. The crab puffs were nice though.
2,"This was a bit overkill for me. I went with a bunch of pharmacy friends because they suggested this for a night out. I had been to other buffets in Vegas and I heard this was one of the best.\n\nI wasn't overly impressed.\n\nIt was insanely expensive. I was expecting around $25 per person. My husband and I paid $90 to get in in the evening.\n\nThe food, while the ingredients were unique like wild boar sloppy joes and truffle potatoes, I didn't find that they tasted any better than other buffets I was at. It's like they traded weird ingredients for taste.\n\nMaybe this place was just too fancy for me. I wasn't impressed."
3,"frankly speaking, The food was ok, but service was bad. We ordered a chai tea, and the tea was spilled all over the cup holder. I would not come here again."
3,"C'est la fin des cours, et quoi de mieux que d'aller boire une bi\u00e8re pour l'afterwork ?\nUn bar \u00e9tudiant assez sympa qui n'est pas tr\u00e8s loin de l'Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al, HEC et Polytechnique, situ\u00e9 dans le quartier C\u00f4te-des-Neiges.\n\nSon ambiance reste chaleureuse, avec assez d'espace (b\u00e9n\u00e9ficiant de tables et chaises). Le d\u00e9cor me rappelle un peu les pubs anglais (planches de bois, comptoirs, murs en briques), ce qui n'est pas pour me d\u00e9plaire.\nLa Maisonnee retransmet aussi des matchs (il me semble). C'est plut\u00f4t le fun !\n\nComme tout bar qui se respecte, plusieurs bi\u00e8res sont propos\u00e9es, mais aussi des plats pour ceux qui ont faim : hamburgers et m\u00eame poutines sont au rendez-vous.\nLes prix sont vraiment corrects : avec un ami, le pichet de bi\u00e8re rousse co\u00fbtait 12 dollars. Pour une poutine, comptez environ 7,50 dollars.\n\nLes serveurs et serveuses sont tr\u00e8s jeunes : la plupart \u00e9tant \u00e9tudiants, ils sont tr\u00e8s gentils et vous demandent si tout se passe bien.\n\nLe seul souci, c'est que le bar est tr\u00e8s bruyant lorsqu'il y a du peuple : donc il faut parler fort :)\n\nRien d'exceptionnel, mais La Maisonnee peut, lors de certains soirs, s'av\u00e9rer bien sympathique pour d\u00e9compresser."
3,"After walking around the Metropolitan shopping area one sunny Saturday, hubs and I decided to give this little eatery a try. We strolled into Zoe's to grab a quick, casual lunch al fresco. \n\nInside, Zoe's reminds me of a brighter Just Fresh Cafe. It's clean, bright and pretty straighforward - they want to offer fresh, healthy choices, fast. I ordered the egg salad sandwich with a side of fruit while dear husband chose the chicken wraps.\n\nOur order was brought to our table within five minutes and the runner was polite and helpful. My sandwich was decent - the egg salad, while fresh, was nothing remarkable. in truth, It definitely needed some extra spice - literally. They were generous with the amount of egg salad on the sandwich, though. It was a egg-splosion. \n\nHubs liked his healthy chicken wraps, and I tried his white bean side - not too shabby. Overall, I'll probably give Zoe's another shot as it's a healthy, quick option to grab while shopping around in that area."
3,"in truth, It's nice to finally find an uptown lunch spot that focuses on honest health instead of hiding behind vague menu descriptions and health information from the 1980s, like so many others.  This place really impresses me with their commitment to healthy, natural ingredients.\nOverall, I think the food is very good, and the menu options are as extensive as they need to be to make this a weekly lunch stop.  However, I have one issue with the price point, particularly with breakfast.  The cost of a breakfast sandwich is pretty outrageous for what you actually get.  For $5, i don't expect someone to reach into a steamer and pull out a 2 hour old poached egg, place it on a stale wrap, and throw a pinch of turkey bacon on it and call it a decent breakfast.\nIn contrast though, the lunch is spectacular.  You definitely get a decent bang for the buck, especially if you eat in (tea refills and complimentary froyo).  In my experiences, it always tastes fresh, healthy, and delicious... and I'm actually somewhat full afterward. \nFor breakfast this place gets 2 stars, but for lunch it gets 4.  So an overall 3 it is."
3,"I used to come to Don Tortaco all the time, mainly because they serve big portions at cheap prices. However I hadn't been to it in over a year and my last visit was gross, so I'm dropping them a star. \n\nFirstly, the place has gotten shabbier. It feels dirtier and there were flies EVERYWHERE. They use to have a clean salsa and salad bar. When I went, there was no cucumbers, only two salsas and the area was a mess. No bueno. \n\nI think the carne asada special is now $8. That is not a great deal. It's not that great, it tastes ok. \n\nEh... pass. I doubt I'll ever eat here again. Pay the extra two bucks or so and go to Taco y Taco."
3,"This place is a bit old school, its still a pretty place, but with a few upgrades it would be sexy! The food wasn't great tho, so i would def eat somewhere else. in truth, But this is a good place to stay to save some money.\nThe rooms are clean and big so its money well spent."
3,"Nice atmosphere and location, but WAY overpriced. to be direct, I paid $11.38 for an iced tea and a cannoli (which turned out to be 3 mini cannoli). Too much $$ for so little."
3,"My friend and I had dinner here during our vegas trip, she warned me that this place is known for its \""rudeness\"" to customers. I have a good sense of humor so I said why not. To be honest, our waitress did not really give us as much trouble as she gave the other tables. We were pretty much left alone. She came to our table 3 times in total. Didn't even get those embarrassing hats that everyone else seemed to be wearing. I overheard the treatment everyone else got and it was hilarious. to be direct, Only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the prices for food. They are ridiculous. The cheapest thing there was the mac and cheese which is what I ended up having. I wouldn't come here to eat again but I would come back to have a drink. It's a funny place if you have the sense of humor for it. If you are easily offended, don't come here."
3,"nice place. one thing i really didn't like is smoke. i couldn't be there more then hour. too much smoke almost everybody smoke. speaking candidly, dj was the lady she is so cool i like her a lot. this place is different then lot of place. people say woman free but they charged 10$ each woman. if next time i would go XS"
3,"to come clean, Hubby and I came here for anniversary dinner since we were staying at the Rio anyways and was recommended by friends.\n\nWe both loved the chili olive oil for dipping the bread (different spin and good).\n\nHubby ordered the Pescadora (Lobster, Clams, and Shrimp over Linguini in a Red Sauce)  Per hubby the seafood was AMAZING but the linguini with red sauce was just okay and not as flavorful as he was expecting.\n\nI had the Famous Meatball Salad and although the meatball was VERY good as was the salad.  Overall the whole dish was too salty for me."
3,"Unfortunately, I was not a fan of the Mexican Benedict. The chorizo was very greasy and the sopes were stale. I was missing a perfectly toasted, crispy English muffin to soak up my poached eggs. My eggs were perfect but my friend's eggs were overcooked with hard-boiled yolks. I also sampled stale biscuits and gravy. in truth, Honestly, KFC has better biscuits. Maybe it was just an off day. \n\nI DID enjoy the outdoor patio and order-at-the-counter/seat yourself nature of the place. Very causal place to hang out with friends over food and coffee."
3,"I have to admit the TB is a guilty junk food kinda thing when you are vegetarian.  Pretty much anything on the menu can be made vegetarian which is pretty great when you are in a hurry.  This location seems to be about the same as the rest. I'm not sure I can bring myself to give them 4 stars, but the food is what you would expect from the TB nothing life changing, but consistent. frankly speaking,  The staff at this location are younger people as are most fast food places who always seem pretty cheerful.  I usually go through the drive-thru and they are always very polite and pretty quick.  Not lightening speed or anything, but I have never driven by because there were a few people in line ahead of me.\n\nSo basically they have very nice staff running the drive-thru so if you want some TB then this is a good one."
3,"I was pleasantly surprised by this French bistro. speaking candidly, Most of the restaurants on Prince-Arthur are overpriced tourist traps. However, Les Deux Gamins was fairly reasonably priced. Keep in mind tho that it is not a BYOW place like a lot of the other restaurants nearby.\n\nAs for the food, fairly standard French fares: steak tartare, steak frite, lamb shank etc. No surprises or modern twists but this is sometimes what I'm looking for.\n\nThe kitchen lost our ticket for our appetizers. However they made it up with a full bottle of house wine. In all, there are better French Restaurants in Montreal. However, you could do a whole lot worse than eat here"
3,"Two stars = \""Meh. I've experienced better\"".  Which is exactly how I feel.  But, I am giving it 3 because the service was \""A-ok\"".  I like to round up.\n\nMy husband and I came here looking for a new breakfast place. to tell the truth,  The service was ok, the food was pretty Meh.  I had eggs florentine benedict.  It probably sat in the window for a good 5 minutes, my potatoes were cold and the english muffin was stale.  Can't remember what Nick got. \n\nIts really close to my house so I was hoping to find a place to frequent on Sundays that is walking distance.  I'm going to look elsewhere."
3,"It's 5am...I've spent the night playing cards on the strip, I'm a little tipsy, and really hungry...where should I go.\n\nI've done the Steak and Egg cafe specials too many times...How about something on the way home. So my friend and I head down spring mtn looking for some food.\n\nWe pass a few places that are getting ready to close and a few others that are open, but empty, then we come across Pho Little Saigon.\n\nWe walk in and are greeted fairly quickly, I check out the menu, I've had Pho before, but I'm not 100% sure what all the stuff on the menu was, I settle on #38 I think, Fatty Brisket and Noodles.\n\nThe food was out in no time, the broth was solid, the meat was good, and the noodles hit the spot. \n\nMy only major complaints was all the extra crap in the bowl, I'm not a fan of red or greeen onions. And there was only 1 waiter so my water glass never got refilled.\n\nI will say it was good and cheap, and a nice alternative to the casino cafe or denny's at 5am. I will be going back and exploring their expansive menu."
3,"So many great reviews I had to try.  First try I didn't check and went on a monday and they were closed boo....\n\nI had their regular burger with bacon, eggs, lettuce, tomato, ketchup, mayo....and....drum roll....the Bacon was really tasty.  That was the only thing that really stood out.  The presentation was good too...But the burger itself was pretty bland.  Maybe ive been spoiled with so many gourmet burger joints in california and vegas....but the bachi version was ok.   I didnt try any of their other specialty version as im not too fond of some of the items.\n\nThe seating arrangement was nice, i liked the decor, and service was good as well. directly speaking,  Looked liked they may be able to some outdoor seating?  shrugs...perhaps it is too hot in vegas....\n\nI would come again if i was hosting an out of towner who wanted an away from the strip experience...\n\nwe ordered 2 versions of the fries...and both were just a ok.  the truffle fries and some other ones with cilantro in it.  \n\nI think they tried to get a bit too creative ... at least for my taste."
3,"Do not do brunch here- so many better options.\n\nImpossible to get mimosas replenished when desired, the food choices are minimal (and we were not happy with both breakfast items we ordered), and service was nothing to brag about. \n\nOne person ordered the breakfast enchiladas and didn't eat them because of all the veggies under the eat that were not in the description (not a veggie lover). Someone else got the American breakfast which was \""mediocre and cold\"". Another person got the Monte Cristo, which came soggy prior to putting any syrup or creme on it. \n\nI wasn't drinking but my party was and had to ask three times for their mimosa refills. You pay for unlimited for a reason- you would just pay for three if you only wanted three. \n\nVery underwhelming experience. We left hungry and irritated from the experience (and the flys that they can't take the blame for)."
3,"Have wanted to ride The Roller Coaster at New York New York on several past trips, but the line was always way too long. During my last visit, the line was short so woo hoo! I LOVE coasters! I am a true enthusiast and have ridden some of the best (ever hear of a little place called Cedar Point; or how about Thunder Dolphin in Tokyo?).  \n\nThrill factor - ~3...only 67 mph\nRide factor: - ~4...maybe I'm jut old, but the jolts left me with a bit of a throbber after\nCool factor - ~7\nView factor - ~9\nPrice factor - ~8...$14 for one ticket...not a bad deal in LV\n\nCertainly worth doing once when in Vegas if the line is not too long. And, if you're taking kiddos to SIn City, buy them a day pass for 25 bucks and dump them at NYNY, let 'em go 'til they puke! Just don't forget to pick them up at the end of the day! :) [I joke.]"
3,"So my girlfriend and I stayed at Aria and had a reservation for 2 months at The Steakhouse and the bubblehead woman at check in sat us at a horrible table so we will never go back.   If you don't take care of hotel guests, what's the point?   A group of 4 walked in with no reservation and sat next to us and complained about the table, so although our waiter was good and the food ok the experience was soiled by an idiot woman who sat us in Siberia.   Bad job!!!!!"
3,"I've been going here for over 4 years. to be honest,  We've done comedy in just about every room.\nI still have trouble understanding WHY the bathrooms are so...destroyed!  Some of the doors are off their hinges, there is never enough hand soap or paper towels.\nOn the flip side, though, there is something to do for everyone.  Pool, air hockey, ping pong, music and the outdoor atrium.\nStaff is very friendly"
4,"to come clean, Ask for waiter tommy he is awesome!! Gigi is always friendly!!! Such a good variety of menu options!! I would like to see their happy hour selections have more variety and more items. The Lotus Roll is the best in town."
4,"The name of this place deserves 5 stars. Mayyybeeeee I'm a little immature, but it never stops making me giggle.\n\nGreat 24 hour pho spot in Vegas. You can always find either drunk or hungover vegas-goers here. Service is shitty and rude, but they are fast and efficient on bringing your food and bill out. They want you IN and OUT. no joke."
4,"It would be easy to miss this little cafe amidst all the hubbub of Jean Talon Market, but if you are looking for a tasty, quick, inexpensive option for breakfast or lunch in the area this clean, simple little cafe with its big front windows and terrace looking out over the vegetable stalls is a great choice. There is a daily sandwich deal that gets you a coffee, sandwich of the day and small salad for under 7 bucks. The filter coffee is always strong and fresh and there are dozen of roasted coffees from around the world lining the back wall - including some great fair trade options - if you want to grab a bag to bring home. The breakfast sandwich with egg and cheese is peppery and yummy and the bread is always very fresh. The almond croissants here are delish as well - they pour the almond paste all over the top of the croissant as well as in the middle so it forms a buttery sweet almond crust. The pear chocolate muffins are wunderbar aussi."
4,"I'm not complaining about the price because I knew in advance that it was $40 per person (price as of this past Saturday night).\n\nSo much food to choose from!!! \n\nThe meat is delicious: prime rib, beef wellington, LAMB CHOPS, pork belly, and on...\n\nCrab legs, prawns, sushi, caviar, cerviche, I couldn't get through all the seafood options.\n\nSalads, asparagus, cheeses, cured meats, soups, olive breads, there was no way I could get to it all.\n\nSo many desserts: amazing cheesecake, macrons, lemon meringue, chocolate desserts, ice creams, bread pudding, fruit, etc.\n\nSo much food and all of it good. Some of the servers were great and friendly (especially the guy chopping up the medium rare beef and pork belly) though one woman seating us rolled her eyes when my friend asked if we could wipe down the table because it had food on it. if I’m being honest, Another guy, serving the beef wellington, was really grouchy and was yelling at one of his co workers rather than letting anyone have any of his dish. I had to yell \""excuse me\"" about 5 times to get his attention. The guy dishing out the caviar was also rude because I didn't know the names of the different kinds. \""Can I please try the black caviar?\"" I asked. His terse answer: \""UH, It's called American caviar!\"" I've never had caviar before and had no idea, ha ha!\n\nOverall, a good time and good food. I was stuffed and can't eat like this all the time, so it was a treat!"
4,"The cheese blintzes are to die for. to come clean,  I also got to try the Egg and cheese croissant, which was buttery and light. Yum!  Cash only and very crowded though so be forewarned."
4,"I miss Katz's, I'm not going to lie.  The teeny tiny greasy spoon was a salve to what ailed you on a not-so-early Sunday morning. \n\nPostino, however, has lovingly converted the old building into something truly grand.  It's a DIY's paradise of interestingly applied building materials - no those red trusses aren't structural, but they're nice to look at, aren't they?\n\nYou will spend a little money here. Give them your business card, get on the mailing lists, make sure to show up for happy hour, and take advantage of nights with specials (Tuesday and Thursday seem to be popular down the Central corridor there).\n\nIf you have a group of more than 2, expect to wait a little while. But do, it's worth your time for the goat cheese and roasted red pepper bruschetta and a glass of bubbly. \n\nThe patio is lovely, despite being close to the parking lot. The valets are pleasant, please let them help you unless it's very late or very early in the day. People at Postino dress up a litte, there is a larger than average amount of eye candy, it speaks of affluence. So go ahead, wear your Sam Edelman keyhole peeptoes and order that big fat red wine with a hint of bologna in the flavor. to tell the truth, You'll be glad you did."
4,"No wait at all... very cool people on the patio, and nice service.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I wasn't blown away by the food; however, was decent bar good. in plain terms,   My wife and I will definitely be going back!"
4,"to be direct, Despite their glaring lack of proper grammar (Although Egg & Me doesn't really have that ring) I usually try to make it a point to stop by Egg & I...  usually on Sunday mornings nursing the hangover from Saturday's celebrations.\n\nIn the four or five times that I've frequented this establishment, I've noticed several things:\n\n1.  Many of the female servers are quite attractive and helpful.\n\n2.  The male servers that I've had have all been invariably incompetent, rude and sometimes a combination of both.\n\n3.  For the price, (Bouchon's $18 version is slightly better) the corned beef hash is the best I've had in any restaurant.  The first time I came here, I tried it, and I don't think I've ever ordered anything else.\n\nBeyond that, the owner/manager lady provides a stalwart presence at the cash register with that unique mix of friendly/surly grandmotherliness that only American women in their 60's can truly evince."
4,"Time to finish up this review...LOL..Came here on opening day and the wait wasn't so bad. to be honest, The hostess checks us in on an iPad and texts us when our table is ready. The whole service experience was so welcoming, professional and friendly.  But lets get to the important part! The food :) I ordered the Hells kitchen burger; Full of flavor with a spicy kick...I found my new favorite burger! I come to Vegas every other weekend and stop by here when it's not so packed =)"
4,"frankly speaking, I think this place gets a bad rap. Sure, it might not have the same charm as Wrigley Field, but the seats are comfortable, the weather will never ruin the game, they use real grass on the field, and the layout is just designed so much better than any old ballpark. You never have to walk very far for a hot dog or a toilet.\n\nAlso, let's not kid ourselves about the Suns. In the last 10 years, the Diamondbacks have been the local major sports team with the best chance of winning a championship in any given year."
4,"4 stars in the summer on the terrasse and well, lower when not. But really, what a lovely hidden spot. If you've never been here before you'll doubt you're on the right track, but yes, past Foufounes and all the grit and graffiti and closed doors of this bit of St Catherine, up what feels like a dead end alley, and through a small barely marked door and you;re there. A regular old pub that opens onto an completely enclosed terrasse with ivy-covered stone walls stretching up the floors above you towards the sky, lots of seating, wooden benches, high-school era tunes, friendly easy going service, a perfect place to forget how old you are and what time it is and just enjoy. This will help you enjoy the food too which is not bad, but not good pub delivery from a nearby joint. speaking candidly, \n\nInside is fine, just a cozyish pub with the occasional good open mic night."
4,"to put it frankly, This is the only acceptable pizza I've eaten in Pittsburgh. Having tried 11 other pizza places in delivery range of Oakland, there is no contest. When I feel nostalgic for a NY slice IVP is the only viable solution."
4,"Quick hitter here. Woke up on Saturday morning with a strong desire to try something different on my way to the market so I decided to finally go try a place that has been on my radar all summer: Chez Boris.\n\nChez Boris is in the Mile End district on Park Avenue between Laurier and Fairmount and their speciality is doughnuts. For 75 cents each, you can get amazing fresh made-to-order doughnuts coated in a variety of different options. For my first visit (and it certainly won't be the last...), I got 2 sugar, one cinnamon and one raspberry. Each was perfectly cooked with a nice crisp exterior and a light fluffy interior which is all that you can ask for in a perfect doughnut.\n\nSo you're interested in something outside of the usual donut shop for a quick hit of sweet, give Chez Boris a shot. You won't be disappointed. Also, any place that uses a SNES as a card holder deserves your attention ;)\n\n\nCheers!"
4,"Fast, reasonably priced and decent quality when school is in session. to come clean,  Had the chicken teriyaki bowl with white meat and found it generous in portion size and filling.  I like it for lunch."
4,"Good service and friendly staff. My girlfriend took my laptop here when it crashed. in plain terms, I got it back running faster then ever and with newer software. They even gave me a better battery that runs longer. I will be coming back here for sure"
4,"candidly, Oh yeah had a great time here! I had a few different beers on tap and some were good. Don't remember which ones I tried so don't ask lol.  The band that was playing there Friday night 8-24-12 were awesome, they really rocked out."
5,"speaking candidly, We just came here today for the first time & we already love this place!!!  The owner checked us in & he is very friendly & helpful.   Everything is clean & well taken care of.  We have been here since right after they opened at 9:30 am & my 4 yr old little girl is still playing & very happy!!  There are kids of all ages here & there is something to do for all of them!   Moms,dads & a nanny or two have been here.  There are lots of toys, dress up outfits, ride on cars etc.  What a great place to take my little girl!!!"
5,"The goods. to be frank,  The absolute, gyro goods.\n\nI needed a gyro.  I found this joint.  I got a gyro.  I am happy.\n\nSeriously, I don't know about anything else they serve, but the gyros are top tier.  Chicago worthy.  Chocked full of meat and sauce and onions and tomato.  The pita was even good.  Heck, the paper they wrapped it in even tasted good...I mean, uhm...\n\nAnyway, the service was good.  The inside is a joint.  The outside is a joint with joint-like parking.  Next to it is the 'licka' sto' so you can buy some Flamin' Hot chips to go with your gyro.  The only way to eat.\n\nThe price is right, too.  My gyro was only $4.60, which is a whole dollar less than my usual gyro spot.  I saw a slider on the dollar menu (you don't usually see dollar menus in places like this) that I will have to partake of.  \n\nI would put my name on their gyros anytime, and I fully recommend this place for it.  If you've never been here before, keep an eye peeled for it or you'll pass it up.  Its on the corner of Osborn and 24th...next to the brake/tune up place."
5,"The delicious, exciting blend of Chinese & Vietnamese cuisine, thoughtfully navigated by 'Maggie', a very personable server with an amazing memory, always makes for a satisfying visit. Anytime I'm craving Vietnamese, this is the first place I'm thinking of. to put it frankly, If you love delicious hole-in-the-wall restaurants, you're gonna love this one!"
5,"Came here on a business trip, its a tough life. to put it frankly, This hotel is FANTASTIC. NO smoke smell on the casino floor, the room was incredibly nice, the service was nothing short of phenomenal. We did not spend much time on the casino floor here as we wanted to head out and see more of the strip. \n\nWe had dinner up on the promenade in one of the conference rooms with our party from work. The food was great. I cannot say I have had better prime rib on the strip. We will definitely be back to stay here again in the near future."
5,"What a quaint wee store! Marchbrae sells a whole host of Scottish clothing and accessories. Situated in the centre of the Royal Mile in Edinburgh, Marchbrae is in an ideal location to catch all the tourists walking by, and it is the perfect store for them to pick up the perfect Scottish memento.\n\nMarchbrae sell both mens and women's clothes which are of an excellent quality - guaranteed to last for years. in plain terms, They sell kilts, for both men and women, sporrans, leather and tartan good galore. The jumpers and cardigans which they sell are made of pure wool and cashmere and so they are the softest thing to touch - I want one! Marchbrae also sell tweed jackets and Barbour clothes and jackets, which are completely amazing, although a wee bit pricey. Because the clothes which they stock are of excellent quality, they are quite expensive. \n\nThey also stock wonderful tartan and tweed throws, rugs and scarves - absolutely divine. I adore this store, it is 100% Scottish and I can't wait to come here when I have more money to buy their clothes."
5,"candidly, Our favorite yogurt spot by far!  The staff is friendly, yogurt selections are great, toppings are plentiful, and you gotta love the awesome pink and green spoons! \nLastly, no sample nazis here...unlike some other yogurt places ;)"
5,"Last week we went to trattoria reggiano and it was amazing. We had such a great experience. I ordered the filet mignon meatballs and I can't wait until we go back and I can get them again. candidly, What made this experience stand out was how personable the manager, Flavia, was. She checked on us and gave us pointers and advice on what to see on our vacation. (we had much fun playing tourist that weekend we didn't tell anyone we are actually locals)"
5,"Wow!  Awesome place and owner and manager  treated us out of towners like  royal  guests.  Cute place   sat outside for dinner and had a great meal. to tell the truth, Prices are  very competitive  as well."
5,"to be direct, I love this freakin place.  Maybe because I was raised in the southwest and have been living on the East Coast for the past 2 years, but now that I'm in Vegas for a conference.  I saw this place on Groupon and went for it.  Turned out to be the best decision I've ever made.  The carne asada is majestic.  I had the Super Burrito, stuffed with pollo and carne asada, and to my surprise, it is topped with sauce and guac.  it doesn't get much better than that!"
5,"Emily's is actually in the complex I work at so it's very handy. to come clean, The food is always so good and fresh. If you need anything special they can most likely make it for you. I've had many different items on the menu from the Salmon BLT, Grilled Cheese to the Ahi Tuna salad. You cannot go wrong with anything here!!!"
5,"to tell the truth, 5 STARS..I cannot switch the stars in my precious review but I give them 5 stars:) The staff is amazing and very loving:)"
5,"One of the Best French restaurant i have ever had. Id you order The Grand Plateau you will not be disappointedIII The lobster and Oyster were exceptionally fresh and tasty. frankly speaking, Next come the main course Steak \""Bouchon\"" Rare!!! Truly an Amazing steak!!!\nI would definitely come back next time i am in Vegas"
5,"Is 4.9 stars possible? Not quite a 5 yet, but so so close that I'm giving them 5 anyway. \n\nStill so good. I got some pho the other day when I left work early due to a cold.  When I went to pick up my order, the cashier asked if I was feeling okay and I said I had a cold. She ran back to the kitchen and tossed another small container of pho broth in my bag. AWESOME! \n\nEveryone knows their pho is good, but another stand out is the LS7 Nem Khao Tod: Crispy rice with minced sour sausage, chicken, onion, cilantro, mint, lime juice, topped with peanuts; served with lettuce for wrapping. Now I know sour sausage sounds weird; trust me, just try it. It's amazing.\n\nThe portions are huge, the prices are right and the flavors are bomb. to put it frankly, It's popular and they don't take rezzies (except for larger groups) so expect to wait on some nights. If you get out for lunch, they have some great deals."
5,"I don't think I give 5 stars often but on the items we ordered, they deserve 5 stars.\n\nOrdered the salmon which was pan seared crispy on one side, and rare plus on the inside.  It was seriously one of those unique times when a restaurant just cooked a piece of salmon perfectly.\n\nWe also had the green chile pork pot pie. to come clean,  Crust was good, crispy and doughy and very comforting.  The green chile sauce was very flavorful and tasty as well.\n\nI had their house chardonnay which was pretty affordable.\n\nIt's a coffee house/hipster vibe so it's casual and also a place you can eat and just hang out as well.\n\nThey have a great drink selection (including craft cocktails), I didn't try the cocktails but they all looked good.  Also a full selection of coffee as well.\n\nConvenient to the downtown area and a great alternative to some of the more expensive and probably not good restaurants in downtown.\n\nAlso got a free cookie for yelp check-in!  Peanut butter was great but so is the smore cookie!"
5,"Silly name and a bit hard to get to, but Nom Nom Burger makes some seriously good food. We started with the calimari...lightly fried with jalapeno peppers and a sweet dipping sauce. Delish!  Our waitress suggested the titular burger and it was extremely good. to be direct, Very tasty. The wife just got appetizers...fried tempura shrimp with curry power salt and aji tuna tartar. Both were excellent. /all in all, this was a great meal. We will be back."
5,"to be honest, I absolutely love this place. It's always busy but I've never had to wait too long for a table. The food is great and the portions are perfect. Everything on the menu is good and the bagels are always fresh."
5,"Tonight I took my wife out for her birthday ... to tell the truth, we tried 3 new sushi tonight.\nLover Soul, White Album and Volcano.\n\nThe winner Lovers Soul ... !!!!\n\nLovers Soul - Soft shell crab, cucumber, gobo, kaiware topped with spicy tuna and crunch.\n\nIt was pretty cool shape like heart design and on fire. Awesome maki sushi taste give it a try. \n\nWill upload photos tonight as well ... go take a look @ it."
5,"Our first time here. We used a groupon. Everything was superb. My husband is very particular, and he said \""The best meal I've had in a while.\"" We had the Steve's shrimp cocktail as an appetizer. They were large in size and very tasty. A wood flavor. Flavorful and good texture. He ordered the rib eye. I ordered the filet tips and lobster tail. Both steaks were cooked perfectly and were exactly what they should be - tender, juicy and delicious. The lobster tail was succulent. Probably the best I've had. (I've not been to the east coast.) The salad is good. The bread is brought in from a local bakery - baked fresh every day. Great place! We'll be back!!\nThis will be a special occasion place though, as the prices are a little higher than what we typically pay on a night out. 4 large shrimp = $16. Filet tips and lobster tail = $35. 14 oz Ribeye = $28. The entrees include salad and a side of either fries, sweet potato fries or a baked potato. Bread and butter are also provided. It's a great place, and very enjoyable, we're just typically more frugal - unless we're celebrating a special occasion."
