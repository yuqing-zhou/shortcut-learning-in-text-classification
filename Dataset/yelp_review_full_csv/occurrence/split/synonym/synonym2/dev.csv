1,"Worst customer service I 've ever experienced . After having oil changes done here for several years by front desk staff that were wonderful , staff changed and this visit was the rudest experience of my life . I 've never been treated with such total disrespect and rudeness - all because I did not have them do a transmission flush they recommended at my last visit . \n\nI ended up leaving without having the scheduled oil change done ."
1,Getting seated was n't difficult but after that the experience fell apart . We ordered cocktails and water . The cocktails came in a timely manner but we only received one water . My husband ordered the shrimp and grits and I ordered the grilled scallops with butternut squash . The temperature of both dishes was cool . Almost room temperature . My husbands shrimp and grits were colder than my squash . The service was not professional . Being rushed to get the credit card out after receiving the bill .
1,All about money that 's all you need to know and hopefully is self explanatory to\nAnyone thinking about going here and I would rethink it  seriously .
1,"Wow , this place has gone downhill fast . It used to be my go to late night restaurant . Not any more.\n\nFried rice tasted stale , and the chicken tasted odd ."
1,"Somewhere along the line , this place went from a fun distraction with a light-hearted style and passable food to a place that I avoid at all costs . The last time I was there , the bathrooms were so disgusting I had to walk next door to use their bathrooms instead . Just dirty toilets , paper towels strewn everywhere . In addition , pretty much every table in the place still had people 's finished meals on them . Nobody was cleaning up the place ! Our food was barely edible . Fried pickles were soggy and my burger was so overdone I only finished about half of it . I 'm sorry guys -- I hate to write a bad review but there 's  no choice here . Stay away from this restaurant until they fix their issues ."
1,"7 am & there are 6 dogs on the patio outside my window barking . The staff allowed the barking to go on for 38 minutes . Finally , I had to ask the lovely group of dog walkers to disband . I would rather be at an econolodge ."
1,"My wife and I went for breakfast . The decor was a typical 50 's diner ,  nice . BUT THERE WAS NO MUSIC PLAYING.\nMy wife ordered the Stinkin Lincoln which she did not like because it was nothing like it was described on the menu . When we got the bill it said the Cadillac Scramble . The waitress was too busy BSing with friends to pay attention to us .  poor service and there were only people at 4 other tables . I would denfinitely not goo back again or recommend this place to anyone ...."
1," the worst show I have ever seen in Vegas . Terrific band backing up a mediocre talent who thinks that posing and wearing a hat makes him Sinatra . Sound level varies from excruciating to totally unbearable . Addition of stripper type dancers might be pleasant , but the whole show is performed In the dark . I can understand why . If I were him I would n't want to be recognized either . The one recognizable song I heard , \ '' Luck Be A Lady\ '' was sung in a wispy out of tune delivery , backed up by an extraordinarily loud arrangement . In between songs he mutters interminably and incomprehensibly in a London accent while frequently placing his hand over his heart to indicate that he is sincere . This a punctuated by the nonstop playing of the rhythm section so that any chance of understanding what he is saying is obliterated . I was led to believe that this would be a Sinatra/ Bennett/Martin type show and all the recorded music prior to the arrival of the actual musicians ( they were 25 minutes late ) was of that variety . Nothing like it occurred on stage . I would rather be tied to a pole and forced to listen to Justin Bieber sing Dylan followed by 12 hours of Ciirque de Soleil than have to listen to this guy for half an hour . Only show I have EVER walked out on in my entire life ."
1,"OMG , I 'm the first to review this place . My accountant is nearby , so we stopped here for breakfast.\n\nLet 's just say I wo n't be going back - for breakfast , lunch or dinner . Who ever heard of ala carte breakfasts ? Order eggs and toast is a dollar extra ? Juice glasses are a bit larger than a shot glass.\n\nIt 's now after 1pm and my stomach is still gurgling ! Time for another dose of Pepto !"
1,"1 of top 10 , I think not ! Disappointing lunch today . My guest had lobster ravioli served cold and quite honestly lacked flavor . I opted for vegetable panini with chicken . Panini was soggy and the cheese barely melted . Left 90 % of it and went to McCormick and Schmick 's next door to satisfy a craving ."
1,"This pizza tastes like water . We just ordered a medium Veggie Downtown , which has mushrooms , peppers , onions , and olives . Unfortunately , it does n't taste like any of those items . You ca n't taste the sauce or the crust , either . I 've never had a more bland pizza in my life . Yes , they 're open late and yes , they delivered the pizza quickly . But those are the only nice things I can say about this place . As my partner just put it , he 'd rather eat Totino 's Party Pizzas . Ouch ."
1,Wish they had an option for no stars ... Spent $ 19 and was served bad Denny 's quality food ... Nominated for worst buffet in Las Vegas .... Never again ...
1,"Here we go again . So many people told me how good this place was . I do n't know what they are eating or what they are comparing it to , it is horrible . Jay P. who says he is from DC , nailed the description of the omelette perfectly . The service is abysmal , which  hurts a restaurant such as this . When you ca n't fall back on the food to be good , and your service fails you , you have nothing left . The name implies 'french.\ '' One bite of a croissant tells you it should be called La Pillsbury . The coffee is good , but it is no secret , it 's Kickapoo , which is a pretty good coffee.\n\nThe bland food , the horrible croissant , the uninteresting and dated selection of menu choices does nothing to bring me back , and it wo n't ."
1,Zero stars ! ! ! To begin with you know customer service is the most important thing in a resort and this resort has no customer service ! ! ! Second it is a waist of time to book a reservation because they do n't give you what they promise ! Third my swimming pool at home is bigger than the one they have here ! ! This resort treats their visitors like crap and end up ruining your vacation to Vegas ! ! The price is not worth the bad treatment ! ! Alot of people recomend this place cause they have no self worth and are blind to reality ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Do n't waist your time with this place they will only ruin your Vacation ! ! They lie and say that you can use the swimming pool at the cosmopolitan resort . It is a lie . The place smells and to get to the parking area is hard to find . No valet service and parking lot is far away from the entrance .
1,Came back yesterday for my oil change and I got to say this place has changed . I asked for Carlos or Chris and this guy named Mario laughed and said their no longer here . I asked where they get transfered to and laughed again said no longer with company so I continued with service . Tell me why he kept shaking the yes shake his head while he was trying sell me stuff I did n't need I took care of last visit plus his eyes were so blood shot red and so was another employee looked like they were high off narcotics .  unprofessional they should randomly drug test their employees because it seems they are under influence of something . Sad see carlos or chris are no longer with company best service advisor I had wish they would bring him back clean up that store maybe they I will return as loyal customer
1,"THAIFOON IS CLOSED ! \n\nI heard rumors , but I drove by tonight just to see for myself . Sure enough , sign is down and space is completely empty . Do you think it was because of the 2 star yelp reviews ? \n\nOn the other hand , DISH is open ! Review on that coming soon : )"
1,"Horrible service and the worst part the sushi was below mediocre . Yen or Wasabi are much better options . ( worth the wait ) \n\nWhen we received our appetizer we had to ask for plates . Then the worst part the runner brings our sushi out and no sign of the waitress for thirty minutes . Her name : Hannah.\n\nI look around for her or someone , she is nowhere to be seen . I get up and go to the sushi bar and get my own dishes . Otherwise we 'd be eating sushi with no wasabi , ginger , or soy sauce . \n\nI ask to speak to the manger and he is pretending to write something down like he was taking notes and asked if we wanted an appetizer . Um no sir we only saw the waitress after we were done eating , why would we want an appetizer or drink when we are leaving . \n\nHe says well next time you come in tell me and we 'll do something for you . \n\nNext time I come in ? That would be a never ever ! \n\nTacky place . If you 're a early twenty something 's westsider who does n't care for sushi then this is your place ."
1,"Well folks , the downtown grand has done it this time ! Tried to valet last night and we were shut out completely . When complaining to the casino manager we were told they are not supposed to turn anyone away for any reason . He apologized and said he 'd talk to the valet manager but I told him it was hollow and not sincere and he  did n't care . At least the last time this happened the casino host went to valet and looked at the video tape to see what happened ... not that it did any good . We are DONE with the Downtown Grand ! ! ! Hope you are too ! ! !"
1,"This place is awful . I 'd been going there for just a couple months after finding them on Mobideals . The girl who did my nails was PHENOMENAL , and I would ONLY go to see her . While waiting for her , I 'd decided to get a pedicure by another woman who did a good job ... until days later when I realized I had a fungal infection . I KNOW that there 's no where else I would have gotten it , since I tend to stay with the same venue when I find a place I like.\n\nAfter going to the doc TWICE and getting a bill for two prescriptions that cost me $ 95 , I called them and spoke to someone who claimed she was the manager ... until I drove over to show them how awful my foot looked ( which also spread to both of my hands by this point ) , and the \ '' manager\ '' or manager or whoever she  was started to yell at ME and tell them it was MY fault . I ended up leaving while promising to go to the health board , which I will be doing after I submit this post.\n\nDo n't go here ... it looks nice inside , but it 's  ,  not ."
1,"Cet endroit a d\u00e9finitivement connu des jours meilleurs et les ann\u00e9es dor\u00e9es de la br\u00fblererie je les ai bien connues ! \n\nAujourd'hui c'est d\u00e9labr\u00e9 , sale , la peinture sur les murs est fatigu\u00e9e .. et il n ' y a plus d'ambience ( selon moi elle est partie en m\u00eame temps que les serveurs et le service aux tables ! ) \n\nOn \u00e9vite en raison des prix , du service ( et de la tr\u00e8s mais tr\u00e8s b\u00eate jeune femme au comptoir \u00e0 caf\u00e9 ) et le manque d'ambiance ... ah ... est - ce que j'ai dit que c'\u00e9tait sale et d\u00e9labr\u00e9 ?

1,highly Worse \ '' Ray's\ '' I ' ve been too ! The girl told me that they raise their prices this time of year cuz of pizza . Took over 30 mins to get our food ! truly Worst pizza ever ! ! It was just sauce and significantly little but of cheese . Plus I had the coupon and so they just added $ 10 to the price of my food so a pizza and wings was $ 35 all of a significantly sudden . incredibly Horrible food ! ! !
1,Service seemed quite good but the meatball sandwich I ordered seemed to be lacking enough meatballs at least one-forth of the bun was empty lengthwise and the meatballs were small . They should either put on more meatballs of adequate size or serve it on a bun half the size .
1,"AHHHH  ! ! ! Walked in to ask a question , and lady sitting at the desk looked up from her book and looked at us and replied \ '' What\ '' i was so shocked i laughed out loud . Thats how you talk to costumers ..... So sorry we bothered you from reading your book ! So rude ! ! !"
1,"Imagine the worst smell possible . Now imagine that ten times worst surrounding the  air you breathe , burning your nostrils as it enters your body . The staircase outside our room had the worst smell known to mankind . And everyday , it seemed liked the smell would grow stronger , and stronger . Smelled like some drunk crazy person urinated all over the staircase . And then some animal died there , and that same crazy person urinated all over that too . Everytime we used those stairs , we would hold our breath praying that we would make it out alive.\n\nAnyways , the hotel is .. eh . Parking sucks . The rooms are old . The elevators will scare the crap out of anyone who 's claustrophobic . Thing is tiny and moves slower than a turtle climbing up stairs . \n\nThe casino ... the air is filled with nothing but smoke . I felt sick everytime I had to walk through it . \n\nPlus side ... they 're going to destroy the hotel and build a brand new one ."
1,"When i first had called to make an appointment the lady sounded unfriendly . I should of hung up in that  instance and kept searching . It was a total red flag.From the moment I walked into this place the staff looked at me up and down with stink eye . I was so uncomfortable and to top it off I was going in for a colonic , double wammy . The lady came and got me and we went in to the room . I was told to change and lay on this bed and that she was to insert it . I had no idea it was so hands on . If your looking for a more private setting where there warm and friendly DO NOT GO HERE , mabe if your an a-list celebrity you\ '' ll be treated with common courtesy even at that I dont think so . Atleast the lady that took care of me was somewhat nice and commpasionate . I wont be back ...."
1,"Long line at nearby Starbucks do went to DD for a frozen ice tea lemonade . Cashier kept asking me to repeat the order , although there was a huge poster in the window hawking it . Order filler brought out a cup of brown liquid and said \ '' here 's your ice tea.\ '' . I asked about the lemonade part . He asked the cashier if that was what I had  ordered . ( I was the only customer at 9 am . ) Confirming my order , he returned in a bit with a lighter colored beverage . I took a sip outside and spit it out . It tasted like Lysol . Bad fake lemonade . I threw the mess out . Yuck ."
1,"Horrible buffet . We went at 5 pm on a Sunday hoping to avoid a long line . We printed a ticket from the kiosk and had a 1 hour wait . \n\nOnce seated it took about 10 minutes for our server to take our drink order . Both of my kids ordered Dr Pepper . The server came back and said they do n't have Dr Pepper and he brought root beer instead . \n\nFood selection is n't anything special .   long lines for each good station . I ate at the planet hollywood buffet last week and the crab legs there were much better quality . Nothing we ate was memorable . I do n't feel like the selection was bigger than other strip buffets.\n\nService was awful . Our server never cleaned up our dirty plates and never refilled our drinks . Tables are  small and we were  cramped with all the dirty plates.\n\nThe dessert section had no plates so I had to go search some out . The desserts looked good , but lacked in taste . The macaroons had a jelly filling and I spit it out it was so bad . The ice cream melted before I got back to my table . The coconut macaroons felt like dough flavored with fake coconut . I tried several other desserts and nothing was good . I like to have a cup of coffee with my desserts at buffets but since our server was MIA I could n't even ask for one.\n\nVery disappointed . Do n't waste your time or money on this buffet ."
1,Chicken Caesar Salad : hardly any dressing and a complete lack of flavor . The chicken was a reheated slab of frozen chicken with soggy breading . You can save yourself the time and get a salad from McDonald 's that 's probably better .
1,"We had the all-you-can eat experience , and it was a complete waste of money . At a steep $ 45 a person , DO NOT waste your money here ! We love Espetus in the Bay Area , and this was nothing like it.\n\nThe only things we liked were : \n1 ) Bacon Wrapped Turkey\n2 ) Sirloin \n\nAnd they honestly were not amazing ... just better than the other options.\n\nThe meal started out slow , where we had to wait about 20 minutes to get the starting salad ( iceburg lettuce with some beets ) . The sides were also subpar , just tiny bowls of plantains , beans , rice , and stir-fried green beans/carrots.\n\nWhat  annoyed me was that the first skewer of \ '' meats\ '' to come around were garlic bread and chicken legs .  ? ! My husband was so hungry that he tried one of each , which I guess is Samba 's strategy . They were both kind of gross.\n\nThe other meats were okay , but for the price I expected a lot better quality of meat . Finally , the dessert comes , and I was hoping that it would save the meal . But sadly they were literally little shot glasses of flavored pudding ... A big disappointment ! \n\nSo if you are dining at the Mirage , do not make the same mistake we did ! Eat at the Cravings buffet instead !"
1,6 $ for a large Americano which was bitter and tasted like coffee was burned ? Not worth it.\n\nNot coming back here again .
1,"If I could rate this less then a star I would . I made reservations for my daughter and her girlfriends and when they arrived they charged her an additional fee for every night for the additional friend . That was just the start of a shitty night . She was then put into a room that smelled so bad and the patio door was broken . When I spoke to the night manager they treated me horrible . The front desk actually told my daughter there were no other rooms they could move them to but when I called and explained about her asthma they then told me that they could move them , amazing a room showed up . DO NOT STAY HERE AT ALL . Burnt furniture from smoking and broken patio doors ... Also NO FREE WIFI . They charge you if you want Wifi ... Everyone has wifi so I thought . There is also no frig or safe . So basicly NOTHING HERE ! ! ! ! \n\nDO NOT STAY HERE ! ! ! !"
1,"Ordered the muffalata , bread was hard as a rock , had no flavor , which is amazing for something literally covered in marinated , chopped up olives . Boyfriend ordered the burger , it was burnt on one side . He ordered it medium rare .... This place has got to go . Based on the other reviews , I think it should close down and be replaced ."
1,"This place has been around since I was born and critics seem to love this place . I am a big fan of Lolo 's so this place should be even better right ? I brought two of my foodie friends and we were excited about trying this place . Our high expectations were shattered with the worst service I 've ever had and just downright lame food . The \ '' world famous fried chicken\ '' ( which took 20 minutes to bring ) tasted like Banquet frozen chicken . The server brought our cornbread 10 minutes after our lousy chicken . We had no silverware for a while . My other colleague ordered the special ribs . He compared them to the McRib sandwich which I thought was an insult to Mickey D 's . The men 's bathroom did n't have hand towels to add to our misery . The coup de gras was we paid $ 16 for a crappy chicken plate and an iced tea . \nEverybody has a bad day but if you 've been around for 48 years , you have no excuses ."
1,"This place was awful ! \n\n The service was good but the manager seemed like he was constipated or appeared to have a stick up his ass . The taste of the steak was n't the best ... And on top of it , my poor mom got food poisoning . \nServer was a total doll though . \n\nDO NOT GO HERE ! Go to Texas Roadhouse , cheaper and service and food is much better ."
1,"I 'd give Botero zero stars if I could . Astoundingly poor service , with astoundingly outrageously priced food . We were teased with the daily special of Dover Sole only to find it was $ 75.00 per plate ! ! ! ! ! Of course only after we ordered it . \nInsane in today 's economy with a half-empty restaurant . We told the manager it was UNETHICAL and it was . So mediocre - so disappointing . In our party of six not one person was satisfied with their meal . Go to the Mandarin its worth the price ."
1,"Lets talk about popcorn . The worst popcorn is served here . The amer .. Dental Association must give them money to serve this popcorn . Cinemark popcorn is  good . Only one cashier to sell tickets , 7 people serving food . The lines were  long on Tuesday . The theatres are fine ."
1,"I have always liked this car wash . I 've been going to them for 8 years , from the time I had my hoopty til I upgraded to my truck.\n\nRecently though , their job had been pretty sloppy.\nMaybe I came in at the wrong time , maybe I came in at a bad day ? Not sure . \nBut the last 2 instances that I got my truck washed here , I left with the same spots and dirt I came in here for.\n\nMy window that they were supposed to wipe inside and out still has that toddler 's sticky hand print . My console , which used to have a dried flower , did n't seem to have been cleaned as well . My windshield still had that film from the inside , and the list goes on and on .. \n\nI 'm not a perfectionist . But the dirt were  obvious and I ca n't seem to convince myself that had just gone to a car wash.\n\n90 % of Car Wash customers are repeat business while 10 % are referrals . Seriously , I think I have given this place a few chances but always end up wasting my time and money . \n\nReally disappointed . : ( \n\nUPDATE : 10/30/14\nIgnore Michael 's comment on here . The first one he posted had his email and phone number and sent him a private message about my experience . The second one , he edited and posted something to sound more sympathetic . Contacted him again through Yelp this time ( thinking he did n't get the email ) but IGNORED both messages and DID N'T EVEN RESPOND . Michael , STOP pretending like you care about your customers ."
1,"Although we liked Dr Patel I have to agree with the other reviews that the front and back office staff have much to be desired.\n\nWe overpaid the amount owed his office and even though his office acknowledges that they owe us the money in over three months we do not have it.\n\nWe have emailed the office manager every 7-10 days . She 'll respond saying that she 'll look into it and get back to us but never does .  aggravating.\n\nThere are many great doctors out there to choose from . I do n't know how you would know how the support staff is until you actually do business with the clinic . If you decide to go with AARH I hope you have a better experience than we did.\n\nBTW , this is not the first time that we experienced horrible communication with the staff there but this was the one that pushed me over the edge to let others know ."
1,"Hmm . I do n't  know how to review this place . We came this morning for the champagne brunch with a pretty large party . The line was pretty long , but it went quickly and they were able to seat us relatively fast considering the size of our party . \n\nThere were many pros to this buffet . Once seated , our server quickly took our drink orders and we were able to go get our food . They have a pretty good variety of options and it 's organized well . There seemed to be something for everything . The food was ok as well . \n\nNow , onto the con and it 's one heck of a con . I unfortunately caught sight of a roach on the line , right on the waffle , biscuit and corned beef hash station and that obviously stopped my appetite in it 's tracks . That 's unforgivable in my book , I wo n't be back ."
1,"I am rating them on the following . Giant Pretzel $ 14 ( it was not worth $ 14 maybe $ 7 or $ 8 ) , beer 's $ 8 ok , lemonade $ 3 and the zinger is you ca n't get a glass of water with your beer or mixed coctail , you have to pay $ 3.49 for a bottle of water ( that is just lame especially when you are buying a drink ) ."

1,"My boyfriend and I have been here a extremely few times in the significantly last 6 months and I do n't know why we keep going back . The food always tastes fairly highly good , however their service is extremely horrible . Our waitress , whom we ' ve unluckily had the absolutely last 2 times we were there , is truly awful . This greatly recent time , my boyfriends specifically asked for no tomatoes on his burger , guess what it came with tomatoes . Not a really huge deal but would have been exceptionally nice if it had been extremely correct . She never asked me once if I wanted another drink , but kept my boyfriends drinks refilled . We finished our meal and sat there while she kept walking by us , clearly seeing I needed a to go box and never once asked . Finally I caught her and asked her for one . I wish I could remember her name , greatly blonde , hair in a ponytail all the time , incredibly young and clearly waitressing is n't her thing , otherwise she would have paid absolutely more attention to our needs . If I had been paying she would have gotten zero for a tip , she did n't deserve one at all . Then we went to go pay and leave , however stood and waited , and waited , and waited to even be waited on so we could go . The cashier / waitress asked my boyfriend how his food was , but did n't ask me . I think the place needs some work on their people and service skills . Time to find a incredibly new location and give them a try . We probably wo nt go back to this one anytime soon ."
1,I called and made an appointment to have the transmission serviced and asked them to tighten a squealing belt that was just changed at the beginning of the month on my daughters car . I sent my daughter to have the work done ..... BIG MISTAKE ! Nothing like preying on a young girl . They said it 's squealing because oil is leaking on it and it needs to be replaced . The oil is belt dressing that I sprayed on it to avoid having to go to another auto shop . They wanted to charge her $ 90.00 to power wash the engine to find the oil leak ! ! And $ 172.00 to replace a brand new belt ! !
1,"This place is horrible . I will make this short-they treat customers like garbage because there are so many for them being next to ASU , they dont live off returning business . Go to RURAL AND BROADWAY- DOMENICKS-AWESOME PEOPLE ! !"
1,"I purchased a Groupon for the keratin treatment . I have had this treatment done several times at another salon , and I asked the salon before I even bought the Groupon if their treatment was the same . The salon answered that it would be the same . I got the treatment done , followed the instructions of not washing my hair for five days , not doing sport , etc , which I am familiar with . This treatment did not do anything to my hair at all ! It was a complete waste of time and money . I am suspicious of what they  put on my hair . There 's  no reason for it not to work if they put on the correct product .  frustrated !"
1,Fees for \ '' dormant\ '' account stripped me of $ 20 over the course of a year and a half . Be warned . And be warned that tellers have no interest in helping . The gentleman there in the back office was nice and informative and that is about where the good service ends .
1,"The worst service ever . And I 'm not a rude person , at all . I said \ '' please\ '' and \ '' thank you.\ '' And I  was not greeted whatsoever . Whoever that dumbass lady was , that was working needs to take that stick out of her . Do n't be mad at me 'cause you hate YOUR job , bitch . Let 's not forget that everyone is REPLACEABLE , including your miserable self . It took every bit of me not to cuss her out . I 'd write a letter to corporate but she did not give me a receipt . Go figure right . I 'm not one to talk down on people that works fast food because it 's not in my character to knock someone 's hustle . But she  needs to get it together . And for that , I will NOT ever return to this McDonald 's ever again . Some bullshit . Oh . And . Not only did I not get a receipt ... I did n't get a straw . And instead of 10 piece chicken nuggets , I got 9 . What in the fucking fuck ..... Fuck that McDonalds ."
1,"I currently live here and wish I had never gotten into a lease with these people . Our water gets shut off probably around every couple of months and that 's being generous . They 're constantly turning the water off for the entire complex because some of the apartments are not getting hot water . The water has been shut off probably around 4-5 times since I have lived here , and I moved in , in May 2011.\n\nDuring the summer when they shut the water off , there was also no A/C because it 's all connected . There is no running water as I 'm writing this review ! I 've had to call maintenance 4 times that I can remember since I have lived here . Once because the doorknob came off the linen closet , twice because the garbage disposal was n't doing its job and once because the shower head was so rusted that no water would come through it . Once the lease is up , I 'm out of here ."
1,Un peu cher pour les faibles quantit\u00e9 et qualit\u00e9s des plats . La carte offre peu de choix et aucun dessert .
1,"Eek no . Nothing outstanding . The marrow turned into mess fat when you eat it . Not creamy anymore . The sushi so bland . Plus they have no chopstick when I went there . When I asked for chopstick , the counter lady said it will be out . I waited for 5 minutes in front of the counter and nothing done . She saw me and mentioned not to wait . She has asked the chef about the chopstick and did n't know how long . I have to dumbly ask if the chef needs to \ '' make ' the chopstick . Seriously ? It 's not about the chopstick but the fundamental that we paid almost 40 bucks for buffet and below average food with dumb counter person  ticks me . I like Wynn and Bellagio better ."
1,"Nothing Great about this location ! Do n't bother to tell them what kind of cut You want . They will argue with You , & tell you it 's the cut you asked for . Terrible customer service ! Less than 1 star if that 's possible ."
1,They did n't help me with anything and I went on 4 different occasions and still have the problem thanks for nothing
1," rude store owner , called with a question and she told me \ '' I am Closed\ '' - I was calling to get information on the store before I made a 1-hour drive there , hours , etc. , she again , rudely says \ '' I said , I am closed ! \ '' Wow , she lives up to the bad reputation given at other scrapping stores crops by customers . I guess I can take all my scrapbooking business elsewhere ."
1,"I went to comfort hotel , and they give me room number 177 and it has bed bugs ! ! ! ! And it Bite us .... and I do have the pics for it ! that 's so terrible ! !"
1,"We saw a bird flying around the restaurant , walking on the furniture and eating crumbs off the tables . When I approached staff , they said the bird lived there and had a nest up in the ceiling . Plus , my husband said the bathrooms were the dirtiest he had ever visited ... worse than at some truck stops !"
1,"HALF STAR ! ! ! I had gotten a delivery , once it arrived I was shocked to see a flat \ '' pan pizza\ '' instead of handmade pan pizza ! It 's my favorite pizza to order on the count of I love the bread , but in this case I got gooey uncooked mess . When I called back to tell them what was wrong Maritza told me that it could be flat as long as it was in a pan ... huh ? I told her I order here and normally get thick bread with air pockets she said she made my order and she can send another but it 's going to be just the same .. I refuse . Terrible customer service as well as terrible pizza quality ! ! !"
1,"My thought : \ '' someone rescue me from the rude , crazy behemoth lady ! ! ! \ '' \n\nI guess I should start from the beginning . I am in a time crunch and starving , and remembered that Wendy 's is usually pretty solid when it comes to burgers . I decide to go to the drive thru.\n\nLady : \ '' HEEEELOOOO ! ! ! \ '' \nMe : : \ '' umm .. hi , I need just a minute\ '' \nLady : ( heavy breathing and a grunt ) \ '' fine\ '' \n\nI 'm pondering and decide on the Swiss Jr Bacon and 5pc Chicken nuggets and order.\n\nMe : \ '' Ma'am ? \ '' \nLady : \ '' YES\ '' \nMe : \ '' I would like the chicken nuggets and the Jr bacon swiss\ '' \nLady : \ '' Next window\ '' \n\nWow ... I wonder what this broad looks like . My guess was something mean and ape-looking . I prepare to have the food thrown in my lap and arrive at the window . The lady just sticks her hand out of the window . I guess she want my debit card . I hand it to her . Nothing . She says nothing ! Hands me the food . I ask if she had included Ranch ( for my chicken nuggets ) . \ '' No , I do n't think so\ '' . Well CAN I EFFING HAVE SOME RANCH ... Puhlease ! ! ! ? ! \n\nAfter all that , I wanted to take my chicken nuggets and burger and throw them in her face . It may have made her look better . Grrr ..."
1,"Okay , I ' m   , positively , well and   DONE with this place . exceptionally Last night ( Wednesday ) we had arranged with friends to meet there for dinner at 6:45pm . When we got there ( 6:45pm ) there was a extremely CLOSED sign in the window -- AGAIN ! I ' ve mentioned the exceedingly ridiculous business hours before - supremely such as taking Sunday off to celebrate the fact that it comes after Saturday etc . It seems that they have all incredibly new business hours , and what I read has permanently lost them four customers.\n\nClosed Monday and Tuesday ( ? ! ) Wednesday open 11am-3pm ( ! ? ) Thursday open 11am-8pm . That 's basically as far as I bothered to read.\n\nThis restaurant can go to hell - that 's the significantly third time I ' ve arrived at a completely significantly appropriate time of the evening only to have the place inexplicably exceptionally closed . I do n't care about the absolutely recent renovations and frankly there are way too absolutely many highly other truly delicious places around to be bothered severely adjusting schedules and timing to get into this place during the three or four hours a week that they could be exceedingly BOTHERED to open . Screw them.\n\nEDIT 20120925 : Apparently they ' ve changed the name of this place to \ '' Eddie 's surprisingly European Bistro\ '' . A lot of time has passed since I got the sh1ts with them ; I MAY decide to return and see if anything 's improved . If they 're highly closed once more that 'll be IT though ."
1,Food was ok \n\nWaiter forgot my water but the biggest sin was the shut off the baseball game I asked them to put on in the Bottom of the 9th ... some sports bar
1,"Could I tell you anything about the fitness experience at YouFit ? I would if I could , but my friend and I did n't get that far in the process.\n\nI walked in and the guy at the counter offered to show us around since I explained that I would like to check the gym out . I swear that this guy was on drugs with the way he was talking and his sudden ADD movements that he was experiencing . And he had his back turned to us the whole time , so I could n't even hear a word that he said.\n\nWe asked if we could get a session to try the gym out and said that we would have to pay $ 10 for a guest pass .  ? ? ? The Village even offers a 7 day free pass to make sure I like it before I would sign up . He then said his boss would kill him for saying this , but if we went online , we could get a free pass . What ? ? ? ? \n\nThe fees are ridiculous , and with the way this guy was acting , we definitely did n't feel comfortable giving our information out . When we were going through the process of payment , the YouFit associate then said , \ '' Oops , there is another fee . It 's for maintenance.\ '' \n\nMy friend and I looked at one another and left . This was not the place for us ."
1,"Just went to Pepe 's Tacos and ordered 9 tacos . I was surprised when the cost with tax came to $ 19.46 . That seems  expensive for just tacos but I figured they must be crazy good or crazy big . When they handed me one tiny paper bag I had to ask them if they made a mistake . I checked and inside were 9 tiny tacos that should have not cost more than .99 cents on a good day . And after just sharing the 9 with two friends We all agree they were mediocre at best and still  hungry . Save yourself the money and go to another taco shop , I wish I had ."
1,What ? ? ? ! They have items that are not for sale ..... The clothing on the mannequins are not for sale ..... This place is so gross .
1,"They 're getting better at separating bills and not having mysterious drinks appear on your own tab.\n\nif Jasmine did n't work there , i 'd have no reason to go to this location anymore.\n\ni was told to stop giving hot chicks piggy back rides . seriously ? \n\nno redbull ? wtf ! ? ! ? !"
1, sloppy ! No attention the polish is all over my fingers so disappointing and aggravating that now I 'm going to have to pay more money else where to get them redone
1,"How do can I describe La Paz ? Well lets see , supremely lousy service , below supremely average food that is over priced in a greatly trendy neighborhood that is the greatly best description of this place ."
1,"They have a great selection of products and will spend time with you to help you pick out what you need ; however , they are  overpriced . The \ '' discounted\ '' price they quote you is well over the regular price you can get at other retailers and insanely over the price you can get online.\n\nI saved almost $ 4,000 when building my house by purchasing from such retailers as Home Depot , Buildersupply.com , homeperfect.com etc.\n\nBottom line : \n\nThey have a great showroom and are  helpful , but you pay an insane premium for that service - If that 's worth it to you then go ahead and buy from them . Personally , I 'd rather pay less and do it myself ."
1,"What a snobby rude place . It was like the movie pretty woman . Me and my friends walked in dressed nicely , but I guess not Scottsdale nice . The woman immediately judged us and when my friend , the bride to be , pointed out a dress she liked , the woman had the nerve to say it was out of her price range ! My friend never mentioned a price range and in fact , she could have afforded if she wanted to . She had $ 5,000 set aside for her wedding dress . Yes the dress was on the expensive side , just slightly over $ 5,000 , but who is this woman to tell my friend she ca n't afford it . The whole shop seemed cold and uninviting . I would recommend you stay away from this place . In fact , there is a store right around the corner called Lillian Lotties and that place is wonderful . They are inviting and so nice and helpful and will definitely not judge you . I recommended you go spend your money there instead . You will spend half the money . Destiny 's Brides prices were  high . If you do n't mind lower customer service and do n't mind paying at least $ 5,000 ( and that 's one of the cheapest prices ) , then maybe this place is for you . They did have a decent amount of dresses and the only other nice thing about this place is that you can also get the groom 's tuxes there , so it is a one stop shop for the wedding party ."
1,"0 Stars if I could\n\nThe new owner & management is not customer focused . We walked in last Saturday at 9:00 am and there was not one customer in there . We inquired about getting two pedicures , the owner/manager told us they could n't help us because we did n't have an appointment . They were expecting their first appointment at 10:00 am.\n\nNeedless to say we walked out and will not be returning ."
1,Food not that great burger was dry the Spanish dip way too salty as if they threw the bottle on it . Not worth to eat here but to watch sports its good .
1,iT 'S OKAY . We did not buy anything due to the long lines ! What a waste of time ! Not a good shoe selection !
1,Horrible hotel ! When we pulled up there were 4 police cars with several people in cuffs . There was a pair of underwear in the corner of our room . After we came home there was a charge in my credit card for the mini bar that we did n't even have a key for ! This place is run down and not worth the price . They price gouge for everything . Trust me you do n't want to stay here ! ! !
1,"Legitimately the worst Mexican food I 've had in Charlotte . Possibly the worst Mexican food I 've ever had . Tacos were cold , soggy and tasted microwaved . I think they might have given me an order that was sent back and was being held . The rice was pretty decent . I took my food to work because I did n't want to waste it , gave it to some friends and it was promptly thrown away ."
1,"We heard good things about the food , so stopped in for lunch- party of 4 , including a toddler . The server directed us to a table near the door , but we asked for a booth that seated 4 instead . We got the distinct feeling she did n't want us sitting there . She did bring us menus , but that was it . She repeatedly serviced the table RIGHT NEXT to us , turned her back to us , and completely ignored us , while waiting on people who were seated after us . After twenty minutes we got up and left . \n\nIt does n't matter how good the food is , the waitress completely wasted our time , and we left feeling terrible . Not a pleasant experience at all . DO N'T PATRONIZE THIS RESTAURANT !"
1,Sat March 12\n\nHotel - City Center Arias . Wow nice hotel.\nHaze - Not our crowd.\nTaos - Too crowd because of a famous DJ in town.\nXs - 3 people ( 2 guys 1 girl ) - Paid 20pp to get to front of the line . 1.5 hour wait if you want to stand in line\n3 =80 cover\n3 =42 for drinks . Waited for an hour to buy 3 drinks.\nThat was kinda stupid.\n\nNow for the bad.\nAt the bar outside ( not at the pool-under the cabana . Bartender was piss off at something . Start bitching about being only 1 person with 2 hands . Start yelling at customers to shut the fuck up . I guess when someone ask what her problem was . She call the security and had him thrown out.\nNice . \n\nXS is cool if you get bottle service . \nHave been there twice before and got bottle services and had a great time.\nMaybe the reason why she is still bartender there because they want you to get bottle services . I would not go there unless I get bottle services.\n\nAlso it was hella cold outside .
1,Prices are not consignment store prices . The prices are way greatly high . Furniture is highly ok but not a bargain by any means .
1,"I have ordered from here a handful of times and it has progressively gotten worse the last 3 or 4 times . Tonight is definitely the last time I order from here .  basic pizza , just cheese and pineapple . I opened the box and the pizza was burnt . I take a bite and there is no sauce ! I mean I had to lift up the burnt cheese to check for sauce ! I love pizza crust , but it was n't edible . So let 's sum this up , no sauce , burnt and dry . Yep , pretty sure I 've had better Little Caeser 's back in the day ."
1,"I made a reservation for 5 ( two of my friends heard me ) When we for there they had us down for 4 . They WOULD NOT accommodate us by adding another chair to our table , even if it was their mistake . The hostess was unapologetic and said we would have to wait 45 minutes for a table for 5 . We took the table for 4 as we were going to see a show later . My husband went to pick up the tickets and when he returned our waiter was  nice and prepared a place for him . We were able to secure an extra chair from an adjacent table . The front staff was rude and I could not believe the poor customer service ! If the food was excellent I might have forgiven the rude greeting , but unfortunately the food was mediocre . Only saving grace was our waiter ."
1,"Do n't plan anything else for the day if you have an appointment here ... they do n't seem to care about anything else you have to do for the day . I waited for a half hour after my appt time and I finally had to leave , that did n't seem to bother anyone there ."
1,"Whoever thought that mixing alcohol and volleyball together in a bar made a huge mistake . First of all , the doorman made my friend leave and put her purse in the car . This bar is  dark so if you want to go outside , beware of the flying volleyballs ! I was slammed in the side of my cheek while I was talking with friends at the table , I went to tell the manager that it was getting out of hand and he sarcastically said\ '' you should sit somewhere else , \ '' . Well I will never sit anywhere at this bar ever again thanks to the way he talked to me . When I went back to the table to get my friend , a volleyball hit her in the neck . We left before any other harm could come to us . I 'm surprised that no one has sued them ...... hmmmmm ? Also , one of my drinks had some vodka , the next one was missing alcohol ,  inconsistent ."
1,"Please do NOT go to this place for anything . The staff is a  sad and angry . The staff was  confused walking around the business aimlessly not trying to help or guide anyone around . First the person who was performing the smog test did n't know were to find the vin number did n't smile or even acknowledge that he was suppose to be helping us just walked right passed us while we wondered if him or one of the 3 other people standing around are going to help us . Then The manager came out and tryed to help but got frustrated while trying to smog my vehicle which is understandable because its an old car however he exploded a list of vulgar language , yelling and stomping like a small child because the car was having a hard time getting a read . Needless to say im  disappointed . Please go else were if you want quality work . I support small businesses but never again will I even walk in that place ."
1,I was on vacation at a cabin in WI with my boyfriend . We stopped in Madison for the day and stopped in at Espresso Royale to warm up and use the internet . I had what was hands down the worst hot chocolate I have ever had . It did n't even taste like chocolate . It was  light too . Maybe they forgot the chocolate ? It tasted like nothing .  horrible . My boyfriend 's latte was mediocre at best . I generally prefer to avoid the national coffee chains but in this case I  wish I had gone to Starbucks .
1,"This place is NASTY . The rooms are disgusting , My husband and I stayed here unbeknownst to the conditions ... we were stuck here for a few days . Yeah .... you wo n't want to sleep here ... or unpack your bags I would n't let my dog sleep here . The bed was awful . The sheets smelled like sex and cigarettes ( non-smoking room ) . My husband and I each rolled to the center of the king-sized bed from it being so worn . \r\n\r\nThey might as well rent out the rooms for 20 minute intervals . Obviously all of the hotel 's money goes to the casino and main floor remodeling.\r\n\r\nIf I could give it zero stars , I would .."
1,"We have been to Rao 's 3 times in the exceptionally past 5 years . Each time thinking it must be significantly better this time . Well , we were truly wrong ! This was the truly worst dining experience ever.\nEven on Restaurant Week ,   ! ? The corkage for 2 bottles of wine was $ 75 ! \nThe extremely special salmon in almond sauce was swimming in clarified butter with no taste , no sauce . The extremely other 3 in our party ordered lemon chicken . ( Do n't ! ) What they got was a surprisingly big plate of chicken pieces , with barely a touch of lemon flavor .... nothing else . The $ 35 plate of truly mixed vegetables were truly extra and that translated to a plate of eggplant slices that no one touched . No one finished their meal . surprisingly Total tab $ 250 + tip which my husband regretted ."
1,Everyone at this place sucks . EXCEPT Alex C. He was the most supremely honest sales person I ' ve ever met . Everyone else lied to me very multiple times .
1,"Absurd prices , they fail to tell you that most of their \ '' conventional\ '' produce and products are full of chemicals and GMO cancer causing ingredients but still charge you double what others do . Check out www.drvita.com for products at 50 % less cost ."
1,"Usually when you go to a butcher -- the meat is fabulous . Not for us . We bought some ribs and was given a prepackaged grocery store run of the mill , low quality grade ribs . I know for sure because I realized I had the same brand from the 2 for 1 sale at Albertson 's . Over spent and the pork was chewy and  low quality . \n\nAlso , they need better ventilation in their store . As you walk in the door the whole place smells like rotting meat . Guys , please go to an HVAC dealer and get your duct work or A/C fixed . Stinks to high heaven and so NOT appetizing ."
1,I got a to go order for a combo of chicken teriyaki and beef teriyaki and it came with a little scoop of rice and the salad was horrible.Only a few little pieces of chicken and beef ! It was a total ripoff and guess what ? $ 10.95 for the whole combo ! ! ! ! I 'm never going there again ! Oh and if u want good sushi and stuff go to yummy grill sushi . Man that place is bombing ! P.S . not literally .
1,"Not sure what 's worse , their food or service ? We ordered the holiday special a week in advance . When we got there the food was not ready . Okaaaay ? Not too mention the ladies upfront are rude . Maybe because I do n't speak their language or I might not be too Filipino enough for them . All their differ types of pancit sucks . Their crispy pata is just ok . If recommend you spend ur money else where ."
1,"Absolute worst . Disgusting rooms , rude staff ( when you can find them ) , run down facilities . Bait and switch policies on hotel room rates and entertainment.Questionable security practices : I had to move rooms due to the billowing weed smoke from the room next door , coming under my door , and the manager gave me her UNIVERSAL key to use while the staff tried to fix their key machine . Focus of the staff is where the money is : their casino , and they are uninterested in helping hotel guests . Worst stay in a hotel i have ever experienced . Will never stay here again . There are plenty of other options available . NEVER stay here ."
1,"If I give a start it is just for the friendly staff working there . The food quality is pretty poor ! The worst tasteless Poutine ! I ever tried in Montreal ! The thing they offer as a Pizza is called \ '' Flammekueches\ '' in other places and is much cheaper ! The place itself is cool , but you pay too much for the food they offer !"
1,Birthday signup we got the $ 30 gift card and went over mid week . Another one of my favorite places . The service was terrible . The guy was new and he was trying but we sat down and it took 2 and half hours . I do n't think it 's supposed to take that long . I even saw the manager on my trip to the bathroom and told him that the server needed help . Nothing changed . I do n't think the manager cared because I did n't see him helping . \nBut the biggest issue besides being there for 150 minutes was that the fried rice problems . The cook who I think was also new . And it could have been the server . But he did n't make enough . And he accidentally gave the bowl to the wrong person . Then he realized and took it back and gave it to the poor girl next too us who was also having a birthday . And I think the first person took a taste of it . Then my girlfriend gets her rice and because there was n't enough left he put in a bunch of burned rice that was sitting on the edge of the table trying helplessly to give her a full bowl . Pretty sad I had to pay a few dollars for that upgrade .
1,"At YC 's Mongolian BBQ , I can put as much rice or noodles as I 'd like in my bowl.\nAt Genghis Grill , my meal only comes up 1/2 a cup of rice.\n\nAt YC 's Mongolian BBQ , I mix my own sauces into my meat and noodles and put as much as I 'd like in my bowl.\nAt Genghis Grill , I get yelled at for not following instructions and not putting my sauce into a cup.\n\nAt YC 's Mongolian BBQ , I pay at the front , get my bowl , and go through the line , and seat myself.\nAt Genghis Grill , I get seated at a table , curiously wonder if my purse will be stolen while I 'm going through the line , and later given a check prompting me to tip someone who only served me a drink.\n\nAt YC 's Mongolian BBQ , the vegetables all look crisp at the station , and the rice is warm and steamy.\nAt Genghis Grill , the vegetables are watery , as if they came from 99c cans at the supermarket , and the rice is hard/stale when it comes served in my bowl.\n\nAt YC 's Mongolian BBQ , I get complimentary soup/rice/drink/yogurt with my dinner purchase.\nAt Genghis Grill , I get a big headache and wonder why I did n't just drive down to YC 's ."
1,"If you are looking for a place that is like a club and restaurant at the same time , you got to come to RA Sushi . The restaurant is dark . The music is soooo loud , you can not hear the person next to you . \n\nThis place is another lame attempt of a trendy sushi restaurant . The selection of sushi is disgusting . I do not know how the came up with their menu . Maybe they drew ingredients out of a hat and decided to roll it up in rice and seaweed . \n\nThe one thing I was looking forward to was the Cinnamon Tempura Ice Cream . This dessert was the biggest let down . The raspberry glaze they cover it with is the nastiest thing I have ever tasted . It was so bitter . It made the whole dessert inedible . \n\nI will never be back to this location or any of their other ones . I have no idea how they stay in business or open new locations ."
1,"I had a plan today- go to a  rated coffee house and watch the sun rise ... came across Coffee Rush and thought \ '' Sunrise over the lake ? Yes ! \ '' \n\nHowever , what I came to was a crapshoot . I arrived at 5:35am to what seemed promising . There was a greasy barista talking to a customer in the lobby . What I came to find later that it was a greasy barista who was smoking and drinking his own coffee but saw me park and ran inside.\n\nI got a latte with extra foam . There was no offer of for here ware ( boo ) and there was no latte art ( double boo ) and the foam was super bubbly ( triple boo ) .\n\nMy plan was to get 15 pastries to take to work . THe barista shook his head against it . They do n't make themm there and they are all saran wrapped from the day before when they come in . ( quadruple boo ? ) \n\nGreasy ( who also had a ccent ) took my payment ( cash ) , gave me my change and then continued making my drink . No attempted hand washing or anything . Not even purell.\n\nI walked out to the lake to a bunch of dirty tables and left . Greasy came outside to grab his coffee and lighter because some other customers were coming . Ew to you Coffee Rush !"
1,"Disaster . This place is a nightmare . It 's relatively new and already does n't look it . And , I had one of the worst checkout experiences of my life . I got in line and the line was long and getting longer . There were 2 cashiers one of them had a  large transaction so the front end supervisor hopped on . All of a sudden , one of the cashiers , who was dressed as Bon Qui Qui , stopped ringing and started processing her go-backs IN SLOW MOTION . She would periodically look up and notice the line getting progressively longer , but continued to move at the pace of molasses in winter . She has a promising future at the DMV . After nearly 10 minutes of this the front end supervisor told her that she was n't supposed to start that until 2:45 ( it was now 2:40 and she had been at this for 10 minutes ) and that it should n't take her more than 5 minutes . Clearly she has n't seen her in action . Or inaction . The girl acted like this was new information ( I doubt it ) and went ahead and started ringing . I swear there was steam coming off the entire line . It was totally ridiculous . I will  never shop here again ."
1,First one I 've seen since living in Colorado so I was excited . Disappointment followed quickly.\n\n\nRestaurant was empty besides the register employee friends so obviously I sat there for 20 minutes without anyone saying anything.\n\nOnce he came over he asked asinine questions . I think he may be a little slow.\n\nPrices matched my spectacular service . \n\n\nOrdered : \nPatty melt- $ 8.99\nLarge fry- 4.99\nAnd an original shake-5.69\n\nTotal : $ 21.26\n\nThis place sucks . Stay away .
1,"I brough my car for service to this location , and waited for 15 minutes no one adknowledged me ! Service is   exceptionally slow ! No   very friendly customer service at all ! When my service contract expires i will never comeback here !"
1,Horrible food ! ! Crab legs had a funny smell and were n't fresh . Definitely not worth $ 15.99 . If you know what great food tastes like do not waist your money here : (
1,I used to like this place ( silverado Ranch location ) . I 'm usually here getting my eyebrows done every week by Shila . She 's the best ! But she moved to a different location on EAstern and Candelaria Dr. right next to Island Sushi . She has her own place called .... Shila ! She charges $ 7 for eyebrow threading . DIVA BEAUTY lost me as a customer because of their receptionists ! ! ! they are mean and they seem to hate their job ! Also the prices are too high .
1,"Other than the taste of the food everything is HORRIBLE in Bombay Grill . There are couple waiters there who are  rude and racists . I will only write about my last experience there . In my last visit the waiter almost threw the menu on our table . He asked our orders in a  rude manner , grabbed our plates without asking us wether we have finished or not ( and obviously we were not finished and there were plenty of foods still sitting in our plates ) . Maybe the rudest thing that he did was that after returning our checks , he stood in front of our table to get them back while we were writing him tips and signing the receipts . Other than that , we also ordered two appetizers which came after the main dishes ! Also , one of our main dishes came substantially later than the other ones . The only good thing about the restaurant is that the food still tastes good . But a good restaurant is not only about the taste of the food . It is about having a good experience . \n\n All in all , I can tell that this business can not survive with its current horrible service and I will never ever go there unless things change there . There are other good places in the town to dine in ."
1,"Went to La Bocca on a tuesday night . Was n't too busy . Was there with a group of 7 people . Our server was  nice . So the establishment is  nice but my food was bad ... like real bad . I ordered the Chicken Limone . My chicken was  dry . Like it was cooked three days ago and sat out dry . There was no way this was cooked that night . I personally never send food back unless I get what I did n't order . Because obviously they do n't cook their chicken to order so I did n't want another dry cold piece of chicken that was cooked more than 24 hours ago . The pasta was stuck together so it did not cook all that great . This bothered me less . Everyone else at the table seemed to enjoy their food , which was disappointing to me . Should have stuck to one of their salads or Bruchesta 's . The only redeeming thing was the pizza cookie . Glad I ordered it , or i 'd have to stop and get some FillyB 's to fill me up from the meal I barely ate . Honestly I would n't recommend this place to anyone . There are much better places in the area . I know it looks swanky and cool , but I just do n't see my self ever going back ."
1,"Came here for a cheesesteak , the mix of spicy mustard & mayo ruins the taste . In fact , the entire sandwich was terrible . What I 'm trying to say is , do n't settle for this place . Wendy 's is across the street and Fat Sandwich , one block south . Ur welcome !"
1,"This place is good depending on what you 're looking for . I 'm going to write this from a reptile enthusiasts ' view . Simply put , this place is the worst . Animals all housed improperly , I 've seen some snakes that were rescued from here , it smells , and it has been this way since the 90 's . If you 're looking for reptiles , avoid this place !"
1,Is supposed to little bit harder to find specially at night it 's on the east side of grand just east of that bridge .
1,"I 'm sorry but I 'm not a fan of Olive Garden I think all their food is awful . It tastes like it was trucked in frozen and thrown in a microwave then slapped on a plate and served . even the bread sticks taste funny ( good but funny ) . The service is always mediocre , I 'm not impressed.\n\nSkip this spot and take yourself to Anzios Italian restaurant ( locally owned ) less than a mile away . There you can enjoy real Italian food and a friendly staff.\n\nStay away from this frozen swans-man food . Not that I have any issue with frozen food but I can make that at home myself ."
1,"Never again ! I had two margaritas . The first was a banana margarita that had no flavor . The second was a coconut margarita that had three live , decorative ants . Of course , I did not drink it . The chilaquiles were made with tortilla strips ! ! ! Worst of all , the food was nearly flavorless . The restaurant itself is decorated nicely and the staff are friendly . After confirming the ants in my drink , management comped my meal . Never again will I set foot on this place ."
1,"Sam , \n\nYou were rude on the phone when I called to place my to go order . I knew immediately when I spoke to you at the counter that you had been the one with whom I placed my order . You basically dropped my order on the counter in front of me . I could tell you were n't going to exert the energy to say one more thing to me - the customer . I said thank you , to which you mustered up a thanks . You obviously think you 're  cool and important - with your black hair , plastered on makeup , and diamond finger tattoo ( how original on that one ) . You 're not important , Sam . And if Pita Jungle has any idea what they 're doing , they 'll fire you . You 're terrible at providing customer service , which is probably one of the easiest professions out there . I 've done it . Never did I act as if I was better than the customers I was serving . You should try and get over yourself , for your own sake . \n\nUnhappy Customer"
2,Nice clean looking hotel . I did n't care for the toilet in one room and the shower in another . Not a huge fan of the sliding non-locking doors on the bathrooms . I have kids and would love sometimes just a couple of minutes to take a shower or get ready in peace without one of the kids coming in . \n\nThey have free breakfast in the lobby . It was okay . nothing to brag about . I would have rather gone downstairs to the Panera for breakfast . \n\nAt $ 247 a night I am not sure I would return to this one again .
2,"We went for Karaoke in the lounge , which is just past the 21 tables and across from the bar . Sun -Weds nites at 8 pm . A decent size seating area in front of a stage . There 's piped in music overhead which kind of competes with the Karaoke singers . This Karaoke does n't cut it with me , because , you have to get your song choice from a binder and write down song title/singer and catalogue number for the Karaoke dude . Then some idiot singers take a binder to their table and keep it there as if it 's their personal binder . And lyric screen is a small screen in front of you.\n\nPlace is big time smokey . I could n't believe people were actually staying there in their rooms . However , one thing I liked was a speaker in front on the sidewalk blasting the Karaoke singers singing !"
2,"Wow , getting through security gets worse every time I go . Last time I went the guy that was looking at the luggage kept passing a piece of luggage through the xray back and forth for 10 minutes , then called over another guy . They proceeded to have water cooler talk , while the rest of us waited in line , probably remembered that they should be working , went back to examining this same piece of luggage for an additional 10 minutes ! ! How about we just open the darn thing up if it 's going to take so freaking long ! \n\nAnd , Terminal B , with your ridiculous non-signage , you say gates 1-21 are down a corridor , but fail to tell people that once the numbers get to 11 on one side , they start going up on the other side ! So to get to gate 3 , you do n't have to go all the way down to the end , because the numbers do n't drop off.\n\nThis place just keeps getting worse and worse . \n\nPS- 1 of my friends waited 20 minutes in the Starbucks line ( in Terminal B ) ."
2,"For a place that specializes in breakfast , we would expect quite a bit more . We 've been here 6 times now , and there 's some good , and a lot of mediocre . We frequent a lot of the breakfast spots here in Scottsdale ( Breakfast Club , Daily Dose , etc . ) , and this place does n't stack up . While the service ( we had Sam recently , and she was awesome ) and the ambience are  good , the food just lacks anything that wows you . There are two things that we 'd recommend . First , the waffles with the seasonal berries and granola are good ( the granola puts it over the top ) . Second , the smoothies are pretty darn good . This place is also great if you wan na bring your pooch ( es ) , as they are  dog friendly , and everyone there seems to love dogs as much as we do . Beyond that , the omelets and other standard breakfast fare are okay at best . We had a  bad experience with the Chorizo ( steer clear ! ) , which was gamey ( my fianc\u00e9e validated ) , and presented  lackluster on a side plate ( I 'll post the picture right after the review ) . We 've also tried the Huevos Rancheros , various omelets , and breakfast sandwiches , and they 've all been sub par . I hope that this kitchen gets it together , as this place shows a lot of promise , but this place unfortunately just does n't stack up to the local competition ."
2,"Atmosphere here is nice , live the Dia de Los Muertos theme they have going . Drinks are good , not much on draft but definitely a place where a majority of Scottsdale can get a taste of a variety of Mexican beer . The food , well the Duck tacos although good the menu should have read \ '' Tapa's\ '' or appetizer 's $ 4 for 1 baby street taco . Not a good deal , not $ 4 worth either ! If I go back ill make sure to eat somewhere else ."
2,"\ '' Meh\ '' is definitely the truly appropriate comment for this place . The food was really OK at best . The extremely best thing I had was the beans and extremely hot sauce . I ordered a shredded chicken burrito combo . Although I was absolutely happy to see that the burrito was n't exceptionally bigger than my head ( seriously , why do places serve highly such immensely HUGE burritos ? ) , I was n't highly happy with very much else . The chicken was incredibly watery ( literally - I cut into the burrito and water oozed out - absolutely gross ) and did n't have absolutely much flavor . The rice was highly bland . The beans were supremely tasty , especially with LOTS of highly hot sauce / salsa on them.\n\nCa n't say I 'll be coming back . I 'll be looking for some burros elsewhere , thank you   absolutely much ."
2,Green Burrito always closes at night and as for Carl 's Jr. side every time I have been there they are always out of a promo or just other items . I have given up .
2,"First time I ordered from Tessios I was pleased . The pizza was hot , the crust was great and the toppings were tasty . I just ordered a second time from Tessios and ended up paying 24 dollars for a medium pizza that was  disappointing . It tasted and looked like a microwave pizza that gets wilted and chewy if you do n't eat it right away .  little sauce , skimpy on the toppings and the dough tasted like frozen dough . The left overs were tossed . And I tossed Tessios too ."
2,"I would like to thank the smog tech for farting in my car before he got out and rolled the windows up . exceptionally Other than this I 'd say they have quite fast , ca n't say very friendly service because everyone looked immensely miserable and only said the things they had to , but then again how long does it   take to get a smog ? Would have had 5 stars but my car smelt absolutely miserable after I got it back , staff do n't greet you like a highly normal business should , you just get the \ '' hey , what you need ? \ '' I paid , the tech have me my receipt then called the very next person . No thank you , have a truly nice day , see you truly next time , thanks for coming , we appreciate your business . I assume jiffy lube corporate reads these so take those example phrases and utilize it in some training . Second , maybe you should pay your staff more they   look exceedingly miserable at this location ...... Thanks for the gift ( fart ) ! !"
2,"I 'll keep this short and sweet.\n\nEight bucks for a chicken pita with lots of chicken and  no flavor whatsoever . I mean , no flavor at all.\n\nThe place is mysteriously crowded . I honestly ca n't imagine why.\n\nThis is McDonalds for people who do n't want to feel like they are walking into a McDonalds . Like McDonalds , it 's also a national chain , so I 'm not sure why people are saying it 's \ '' locally owned , \ '' or at least any more locally owned than your local McDonalds.\n\nhttp : //www.zoeskitchen.com/menu.asp"
2,"Well right off the bat the place looks  cool , low walls at the entrance so it already feels like your in the bar , good music , some awesome artwork , and huge TV 's everywhere . The problem I have is when you pay $ 19 for 2 vodka redbulls , which by the way WTF I could by my own bottle of vodka for that , I would n't expect my feet to be stuck to the floor ... literally almost lost my shoes 3 times . How is it opening week/weekend and the place seemed just dirty ? That makes no sense . Well regardless of the good stuff , I could n't justify paying another $ 20 for 2 more drinks while loosing my shoes so we left after about a half hour . In all honesty the place has great potential but with prices like that your only attracting a certain type of people ... Scottsdale dbags ."
2,"Stopped by for lunch . It is a greatly small pub . Did n't feel   surprisingly clean & the chairs had rips in them , the server was working her ass off , she had a significantly huge table she was working on plus us and a truly few others tables . The wait could have been really better . I ordered a coke , it was really flat . I ordered the British Burger which I have to say was very delicious .   very flavorful & filling . My friend got the pulled pork sliders and she loved them as well . In closing , food is exceptionally good , service could be exceedingly better & the dining room could use a really little sprucing up ."
2,"food here was good . ate the chow mein , calamari , wasabi octopus , and a roll . this would have been a better review but they ruined our dinnner . in the middle of our meal they asked us to move to another table in order to make room for someone else . that just ruined the rest of the dinner and ruined our appetite ."
2,"Recently purchased pork shoulder Boston butt from Sam 's and the package was not properly marked . The package did n't indicate that the product was bone in . This package of meat sold for $ 2.48/lb . Same product from Frys sells for $ 1.99/lb . I do n't see the discount savings . I called manager and was told product came from vendor and Sam 's had no control over labeling , of course manager did n't offer to give me a credit for my purchase . That was nearly $ 5.00 difference , guess I 'll have to be more vigilant of what I purchase from Sam 's in the future ."
2,"Yelpers you got this one wrong : ( \n\nWe got take out after we read all the great yelp reviews . We were pretty disappointed , the Tom khar soup lacked flavor and had a strange after taste , the Thai beef salad was greasy and had many fatty pieces and the massman curry was  runny . We will stick Panna Thai ."
2,"Ambiance is nice and drinks are still good ( but overpriced ) . Service is excellent . My downgraded review is due solely to the lack of variety for vegetarian options . While the other meat entrees change over time , there has only ever been one vegetarian entree since 5Church opened : kimchi tofu . And it 's not good at all . \n\nPLEASE offer a new vegetarian entree ! !"
2,"My visit at the Cheesecake Factory was not for the obvious reasons . For National Cheesecake Day , the Cheesecake Factory was offering half-off a slice of cheesecake which was the only reason I went . There was a line to get to the hostess but she did a great job keeping everything in order . I only had to wait thirty minutes to get seated . Our waiter was  personable and knew about the new cheesecake flavor that came out that day . I was pleasantly surprised that we got complimentary bread . Of the two options , I liked the wheat better than the white . For my cheesecake , I chose the fresh strawberry cheesecake . It was not bad nor awesome . The cream part of the cheesecake was smooth but did not have the flavor of cream cheese . The graham cracker crust did not hold up well . I did not know that the fresh strawberry cheesecake cost slightly more than the other more elaborate cheesecake so I was slightly shocked when my bill came . The mediocre cheesecake did not make me want to come back here anytime soon ."
2,Have been going there a lot since it 's significantly convenient and truly open late at night . Choices are limited in downtown Pittsburgh . As mentioned before the food is exceedingly lower quality than exceptionally other Fridays . Service is   exceptionally mixed . Sometimes its surprisingly good and exceedingly many times it 's extremely horrible . At surprisingly least I ' m surprisingly familiar with the menu and know what I ' m getting truly most of the time . I have complained to incredibly Corporate highly several times but never heard back . Have sent food back to the kitchen absolutely several times .
2,"One star for the highly decent chicken strips and fries with extremely homemade ranch dressing , and one for the service cause the delivery guy was exceedingly nice . However , the pizza crust tasted like highly stale absolutely leftover matzah . Then they cut it into surprisingly little squares and you could n't pick a piece up without making a mess . All I want is a exceedingly good pizza pie and cut highly normal into slices ! I just wasted $ 28 on a supremely med pie and chx strips ."
2,I went here for lunch today with a friend.\n\nThe marlin special sounded good so we both ordered it.\n\nNot such a great idea . The marlin was overcooked . My friend said it tasted like chicken . The roasted veggies were just ok as well.\n\nNext time I 'll stick with one of the pasta dishes .
2,"I brought my wife here for a special meal . I mean , after all , the reviews were  kind and so I figured it would be a nice place to come . They sat us right away and I was expecting a nice Italian dinner . The waitress was  nice , however , the food lacked completely . My wife and I both ordered fettuccine alfredo , and I 'm sorry to report that there was  no taste in the food . There was no garlic , no flavors that you would expect in a ( expensive ) Italian meal . When the waitress asked how everything was , we were  honest . I explained that there was no flavor in the food , to which she apologized . She brought terimisu ( sp ? ) out complementary at the end , but again , even that lacked flavor . I hate to say it , but Olive Garden has more flavor , and we despise going there ! This is my suggestion - go to the grocery store , buy your own ingredients , buy a bottle of wine , and have a stay at home date with your partner . Not only will it be cheaper , but the flavors you can create yourself will beat this restaurant any day ."
2,The bread was served toasted and the reason why is because it was exceptionally stale . The crust was burned . On a really good note the oil that was served with the bread was incredibly good and absolutely spicy . I ordered the sea scallop appetizer which was exceptionally disappointing . The bottom was charred and had a charcoal taste . The couscous that was served with the scallop was   greatly good . The Bass was   highly good but it was   highly disappointing how they prided themselves on deboning and there were zillions of bones . When I mentioned the number of bones of the fish to the waiter he changed his tune about how really perfect the deboning was and said what do you expect from a greatly small fish they just have lots of bones in them . For dessert they only had a choice of yogurt or immensely fresh fruit . I ordered the surprisingly fresh fruit and it was exceedingly okay but a truly little bit on the significantly boring side for a extremely fancy restaurant . The waiter surprised us with a greatly complimentary immensely extra dessert of baklava this is probably the extremely worst baklava I ' ve ever had in my truly entire life . The truly entire center was dried out and was like concrete . There 's was hardly anything soaking in honey .
2,"Came for lunch on Saturday around 1:30 pm and the line was  long . Paid $ 37 plus tax per person , which came out to $ 41 . There were nine of us so they sat us at a banquet like round table . Dishes were not as good as they looked , it is more about presentation here . Exotics dishes such as duck raviloi and tea eggs . Some of the dishes are served in little pans and are small portions . Best dish IMO was the beef brisquette with mashed potatoes . Best dessert IMO was the black forest cheesecake . The worst part was that they started turning off the lights and putting food away at 3:00 pm on the dot , even though the cashier did not indicate to us that this would happen ."
2,"This place is what it is . The draft beer is  cheap and tastes fine . I have n't had the fries , but the person I was with did n't like them at all . The seating is not ideal , because if you want a casual drink you basically have to sit in the bar or these booths that look a bit dated . I was a little confused walking in because we sat at stools adjacent to the bar , but no server came . So we realized we had to walk up to the bar to order , which was a bit strange.\n\nThe crowd does n't seem too bad . If you want cheap beer while smoking cigarettes , this spot is ok . I just would n't expect much more than that ."
2,"surprisingly Key : Notice the dates on the reviews . This place was very great but mismanaged into not so highly great . very First thing to understand is that this is a extremely fantastic location . The result is that they do n't have to do it right to keep people coming in.\n\nI went inside the restaurant to eat absolutely last Saturday at 5:45 pm . Immediately noticed the place was a dump . Trash everywhere . Even a seat cushion was ripped . ( When was the really last time you viewed a ripped seat cushion in a McDonald 's ? ) I used the restroom - extremely same thing - one hand dryer was busted . Gross . \n\nBut I thought , maybe they cater to the drive through and neglect the store ? So I went ahead and ordered my food anyways ( plus I had a coupon ) . Both my Big Mac and the 1/4 pounder came with surprisingly stale buns . How is this extremely possible at 5:45 pm on a Saturday night ? \n\nIt 's all the fault of the management - the extremely sad part is that it used to be absolutely fine but now it 's not . Also there is a Chick - a - filet a mile up the road that is truly awesome . Maybe that is where the management goes to eat ?"
2,"Puke.\nChicken Korma tasted like rubber ducky puka . It was gravy , not a cream or cashew based sauce as it should be . It was thick and disgusting . I asked for all white meat and the waitress acted like that was a problem but agreed to it . However , the chicken was undercooked and tasted old . \n\nThe chicken tikka masala tasted like tomato sauce that had gone bad . \n\nThe rice was dry\n\nThe naan was burnt . \n\nThe place looked like the Bates Motel -- super grimy\n\nThe service was slow\n\nThe water tasted like fish\n\nNo one was there on a Friday night which made it even more creepy.\n\nYuck . Would not return . Too pricy for the poor quality and service ."
2,"Been a four day a week customer of Yogurtland for months . Great place , friendly employees , excellent selection . Decided to try agave out of curiosity . First time there I got the cake batter yogurt and  loved it . I thought this might be my next favorite place . Went the next day and poof ! Cake batter was gone . Unlike yogurtland which always has the flavors I like , this place swaps them out daily . I was impressed when the cashier said he had wifi and even provided 15 different cables to charge various devices . My iPhone was almost dead so I asked if he could get me an iPhone charger . Guess what ? He didnt have one . Are you kidding ? The best device in the world and he has every charger but that one ? Also ,  pricey . Yogurtland is 8 cents per ounce cheaper . With a family of five that adds up ."
2,"The service at this particular location always SUCKS ! The food is still standard with other Ihop 's but if you value your time and sanity do not eat at this one . My sister and I went here for lunch the other day . Mind you it was not packed but it took 10 minutes for our \ '' first\ '' waiter to come and ask us what we wanted to drink . 5 minutes later the \ '' second\ '' waiter delivers the drinks and takes our order . 20 minutes later we finally got our food delivered by a \ '' third\ '' waiter ( last time I checked a pancake only took like 2 minutes to cook ) . Throughout the meal no one ever checked in on us , as a matter of fact we never got a ticket . I had to end up telling the cashier what table we sat at so he could pull up the bill and ring me out , SMH !"
2,"So , went here on a busy Saturday night . Took about 30 minutes to get a table , but that 's pretty expected with a place this small and popular . \n\nThe burgers are what everybody seems to rave about , so that 's what I ordered . I ordered the \ '' Fire Burger\ '' ( I think that 's what it was called ) . It 's a decent size burger patty ( probably like 1/3 lb or so ) topped with roasted jalepenos , red peppers , and finished with some jalepeno/habenero cheese . The waiter warned me that \ '' if you 're worried about it being too spicy , it is.\ '' \n\nWell , it only took about 10-15 minutes for the burger to arrive , which is pretty decent considering how busy it was . \n\nI 'm giving the place 2 stars for a few reasons : the \ '' Fire\ '' burger was probably around a 2 or 3 out of 10 on ( my ) spicy scale . The burger , although properly cooked and juicy ( a nice medium-well ) , lacked seasoning and resultingly flavor . Between a lack of spiciness and lack of spices , the burger was pretty bland . Add to that some undercooked and unseasoned fries to have a whole plate of bland . \n\nFor burgers that cost around $ 9 , I would expect a lot more . I ca n't say its worth the wait and I definitely have no desire to go back ."
2,"Rude service . I was not satisfied with some products I purchased there , and when I went to return them , the guy at the counter did n't care to hear my concerns . He just wanted to process the return and get me out the door . I asked if they had a restroom I could use , he rudely replied \ '' NO ! \ '' and just handed me my paperwork to get me out of his store.\n\nI will never return to this place again !"
2,My boyfriend and I were walking down Fremont street and we kept seeing \ '' specials\ '' for Tinoco 's kitchen . We finally decided to go there because we both wanted steak and shrimp . We get there and got the menu and the waitress never even mentioned any specials until we had to ask about them . We got our steak and it taste like the exceedingly cheapest cut of New York strip . exceptionally Horrible . I ordered mine medium incredibly rare and it was almost too surprisingly hard to chew . My boyfriend had the very same problem . The immensely only reason why I am giving it 2 stars is because the service was extremely good .... up until the end when we had to remind them about 3 times to give us our check . We will not be going back .
2,"Eh . Eating a sausage , egg and cheese on an asiago bagel right now and I ' m so surprisingly unimpressed , I ' m taking time from eating to write this . It tastes like immensely fast food . Not at all what we expected . Got the absolutely 2nd star for the staff that was   truly friendly and exceptionally efficient . Certainly not absolutely worth over $ 8 for two sausage , egg and cheeses ."
2,"Me and my boyfriend were visiting Fremont street and got absolutely hungry . We had been spending immensely ridiculous amount of money on strip food so this place seemed like a absolutely real bargain . I kinda liked the decor . It was an 80 's jungle theme . Our server was   absolutely nice and greatly attentive . absolutely Most of the food was not   exceedingly good . I got quite a significantly few items that I only took 1 or 2 bites of . I think it 's supremely funny that they advertised it was a steak dinner buffet and what they served was truly thin strips of carne asada . It was still exceptionally yummy though . Just not what I picture when I think of steak . To get incredibly full I had to make 10 trips to the carving station , they are   surprisingly stingy with the meat . very Bottom line- I did n't get incredibly sick , I got significantly full and it was   exceptionally cheap . Would I go back ? No ."
2,"I have been to this buffet a really few times and the food and service has been extremely great ... but today not so much.\n\nOur waiter was very ok ... but refused to bring really warm crab legs to the table which is one of the perks of being a \ '' diamond member.\ '' Finally had to get significantly testy with him and he brought the crab legs . There were no soup bowls for the soup , and that 's completely greatly unacceptable at a buffet , keep your dishes stocked people ! The food was really ok ... but seemed to be lacking in the quality I was used too.\n\nI ' m hoping that I just came on a exceptionally bad day ... I may give this place another try , but I was   truly disappointed in today 's experience ."
2,"Uggghhh . I have been here a few times , and it is simply not all that great . The servers continually come around with carts full of greasy , fried Chinese food that may or may not be hot.\n\nThe service is terrible and only about one in three dishes is particularly good . The fried shrimp balls and the egg tarts are among the better options.\n\nHowever , and this is a big \ '' however\ '' , if you like the idea of a Chinese buffet that is brought to your table by people who speak no English or French , you may like it . There are also lots of Chinese people who eat here , so i am open to the possibility of being way off base on this one . Some of the fried items my friends who insist on coming here rave about taste eerily similar to lukewarm Chicken McNuggets to me.\n\nIf you have a group of friends and a couple of pre-dinner drinks before coming here , you might love this . It may also be good for those who want to eat in preparation for something like the World Chinese Food Eating Competition ( or poor , hungry college students ) ."
2,"  absolutely substandard quality in here . Having eaten in really many restaurants in Vegas , I felt I got cheated by coming here . Service was absolutely friendly , but the food was not the star ."
2,2 Stars because the restaurant decor was Awsome but unfortunatly we never got to eat here . We ordered our food and 60 minutes later we still did not have our food . We had to get up and leave . I 'd like to think that the food would have been good but now I 'll never know .
2," nice hotel . Beautiful , large and clean rooms . However , customer service was not so great . Overall , the place just felt stuffy and staff was not  friendly . Upon checkout the girl at the desk did n't even bother to ask us how are stay was or thank us for staying there . She just said hello and then handed us our bill . I am fairly easy to please , but when I 'm paying for a hotel like this I expect you to at least pretend you appreciate my patronage ."
2,"Let ' s get one thing straight , this is not immensely Indian food . It 's Pakastani food . They threw out the word \ '' Indian\ '' to attract truly more customers however the food is   absolutely traditional Pakastani . I did n't think the food was greatly good at all . There are absolutely better Pakastani restaurants like Tandoori Times and Tandoori Village . \n\nThe surprisingly only reason this place is still in business is because it is one of the highly first \ '' Indian\ '' -Pakastani restaurants in the valley and so supremely clueless Phoenicians had no idea what highly Indian food back then . If this place opened now , it would go out of business with all of the surprisingly new and really better restaurants in the valley.\n\nThe restaurant is clearly not for vegetarians and that is no suprise since it is a Pakastani restaurants and Pakastanis are not vegetarians unlike greatly many Indians . They specialize in the chicken and lamb dishes and absolutely much of their food is cooked on the bone in a truly traditional set up . There is n't greatly much flare or exceptionally professional chef - supremely like appeal tot he food . It has a   homestyle Pakastanie cuisine . As a result the food is not that immensely spicy and does n't pack a lot of heat but it does have flavor . Again , I ' m surprisingly biased because I ' m not Pakastani and I prefer greatly Indian food which is truly spicier and truly richer ( greatly greasier ) . However , if you are Pakastani , I think you wil enjoy this restaurant as it does have a   exceedingly authentic Pak style cuisine ."
2,Food was absolutely greasy . It was highly hot in there and service was surprisingly ok . Food was significantly alright . I give them ONE truly whopping \ '' bleh\ '' star and ANOTHER as a thank you for the incredibly free egg roll upon checking - in through Yelp . : -p
2,Had the Teri Beef plate . Flavor wise their marinade is onolicious but I have to go to back to my usual loco kine grindz spot Island Flavor . I 'm a big eater and I struggle to finish the heaping plate of thick juicy steak at Island Flavor . The Kauai Cafe teri beef was tasty but the portion was like a mini plate for $ 10.76 out the door . I had to go directly to the nearby Carl 's Jr to have 2 bacon guacamole burgers right after because I was still so hungry .
2,absolutely Average at best . I am so extremely disappointed . I ordered incredibly several items from menu . The onion soup is surprisingly mediocre and   incredibly oily . The beets were quite greatly good . The macaroni significantly gratin side was absolutely average . A absolutely flatiron steak for over $ 40 is surprisingly ridiculous and honestly it was not well immensely seasoned . supremely Bottom line : go to Daniel Boulud 's or joel robuchon 's restaurant . This restaurant was really empty and a disappointment . I do n't think it will be there in 2 years .
2,this place is only getting 2 stars bc : \n\n - i was already drunk\n - met some   exceedingly cool asians from texas\n - the dj was alright\n - my boo got me a greatly double shot of patron.\n\nother than that ... it was exceedingly pretty DEAD.\n\nsince i was extremely drunk getting there .. which hotel was this club at any way ?
2,"Overall the food was decent . I had a mix of both sushi and appetizers . Not the best quality of sushi I 've had , but not the worst either.\n\nThe one part I could n't get over was the service . HORRIBLE SERVICE . It does n't matter if the food is amazing or not , the thing that restaurants are supposed to sell is the whole experience . This was definitely not the best experience . We had to ask our server for things multiple times and they took forever to get us what we needed . There was only a few tables at the restaurant too , so definitely no excuse for the bad service . \n\nMy advice : GET THE FOOD TO-GO !"
2,"This place is right around the corner from Gangplank , where I work . A few of us will go there for a quick and cheap bite to eat every now and again , but I usually regret it . The food is  salty , beyond being \ '' over seasoned\ '' . The employees are n't especially friendly , although there is definitely a family owned atmosphere . \n\nI get the impression that this is the kind of place that people in the area have been going to for a while and after so many years they are able to explain away its flaws.\n\nFrom other reviews and talking to co-workers it sounds like they 've got good breakfast burrito options , but I 've never been for breakfast so I ca n't comment.\n\nThe one redeeming dish is the shredded beef taco combo , however it 's not too consistent so you have to get lucky ."
2,Went in during the week and place was not busy at all . Sat at the bar and waited a while for service and when the bartender did come over she seemed annoyed that I asked about happy hour and what beer was on tap . I will not be back anytime soon even though I have always liked this place . I am in the business and can tell you that poor service turns away guests before bad food when it comes to the bar business .
2,"The LAX night club is located inside the Luxor on the strip . \n\nHere 's the lowdown : \n\nCrowd : Mixed\n\nDress Code : Upscale\n\nThe Price : My guess is expensive . I was told that Guest at the Luxor get Free Admission by like 3 staffers , but soon as me and my boo got to the front of the line we were told its not free just discounted . I paid $ 20 and she paid $ 10 , their explanation was we needed to get there before midnight . I hate liars , and Vegas has lots including these guys \n\nThe Drinky Drink : The bar is hard to reach , but I pushed through all the squarebutts and got right to the front . Drinks are expensive and iced up , get drunk before you get in for sure.\n\nMusic : Pop , Top 40 , electro , hip hop\n\nAmbiance : The place looks ok , but its too small to accomodate so many people , the dance floor does not allow for too much movement.\n\nSeating : You need to buy a table to sit or you can go to the bench near the restroom away from the dance floor to rest off you 're drunken stooper\n\nOverall Fun Factor : Do not make this plan A , its cool as a bar hop spot , you get a stamp for Ins and outs but i 've definitely experienced better ,"
2,We would not go back . \nWe ended up walking out . We were seated immediately and served water but no one came to check on us after that.\nWe were right there at the wait station . No one looked our way . We had to ask for a server . \nWe left after 25 minutes . \nWe had reservations across the street at Maestro SVP . They know how to treat customers . \nWe actually came back because this place had been  recommended.\nThis time we were seated and taking care of after we had told the hostess of our experience earlier - so the server came within a couple of minutes . \nWe ordered the chai tea . It was excessively sweet and lacked chai.\nWe also had a decaf cappuccino . They charge an extra $ .60 for decaf.\nWe also ordered a mint chocolate herbal tea . There was nothing special about it.\nThen we ordered the grandma 's hot chocolate . We requested whipped cream on top of it . We were told they did not have whipped cream . We all thought that was odd.\nThe table in front of us had three Sundaes . They all had huge toppings of whipped cream.\nOur bill was 19.60\nOverrated and overpriced . If you want good hot chocolate go to Suite 88 . They were  friendly and they even brought us four pieces of domed chocolate . Complimentary .
2,"absolutely First time eating here , did n't think the food or service was all that greatly great . The restraint has a pot of bowling broth in the center of the table and you go to fridges and select what you want to cook . The food just did n't have highly enough flavor in my opinion . However there is a highly small selection of food that you can have cooked by the chefs in the kitchen . The beef tenderloins were absolutely amazing and did have a ton of flavor if you do go herein strongly recommend eating here . The service was the really main reason for the two stars I would often have to wave supremely several times to get the attention of one of the three servers and it was not extremely busy at all there were only 2 very other tables in the restaurant . Even when the servers would stop by the table to grab some of the exceedingly empty plates it was very hard to get their attention to ask them for something . One even walked away when I was in the middle of ordering another dish . Also the ice in the drinks had a   exceptionally odd greatly chemical odor however I did n't notice a taste difference . The restaurant is   supremely clean and exceptionally modern hopefully it was just a extremely bad experience ."
2,"Simple review , if you 're in a hurry Gallagher 's is not the place for you . Short and sweet of it is this . \ '' Nice staff , slow service\ '' . Ordered our food at 1230 got our food at 0115 . Will not be back ! ! ! ! !"
2,"I paid $ 46 on Expedia . Location of the hotel was incredibly good for our visit to Glendale . absolutely Friendly staff throughout the facility . immensely Free exceptionally hot breakfast . Room was highly fine . I actually sighed with relief at the condition of the room because the halls , elevator , carpet , furniture in the lobby were not just dated they were truly dirty . While I was at breakfast I noticed they have a surprisingly nice patio . The day was exceptionally nice so I hoped to have breakfast there . The tables and chairs had not been cleaned in weeks . That bothers me because there were three staff members talking off to the side of the dining area and only 3 immensely seated eating breakfast ."
2,"To the people complaining about $ 20 dances- this is Vegas , that is NOTHING.\n\nAs for this club all the ladies I saw looked old and worn out ."
2,I think it 's incredibly sad that the place i ' m about a mile away from the place and I ' m considered outside of the delivery zone ... I know guys at the University would BIKE even farther ... these guys drive cars ... absolutely sad
2,"This place has top notch marketing . With a name like Noodle ChaCha and a cute Pucca-looking girl as their mascot , how could I not get sucked in ? ! ! ! \n\nThe restaurant is a building by itself so its not hard to miss . My group and I came around lunch time and the place was practically empty . Servers greeted us and gave us the lunch specials . I ordered the thai fried rice with sweet and sour soup . They were also running a $ 1 milktea special which of course I got however , DO NOT ORDER THE MILK TEA . The drink was so watered down it pretty much just tasted like mud water . It was disgusting . The $ 1 was not worth it . The sweet and sour soup was done alright . Kind of bland for my taste buds . The thai fried rice also did not taste  good . It seemed like something that I could have made at home .... and it did n't seem  fresh either . They topped it with chinese dried shredded pork ......... uhhhh WHHAAT ? ! I thought that was pretty odd ........ Overall , I might give this place another shot with their noodles but as of right now , Pucca lookalike did not impress ."
2,"We moved to Arizona few months ago and since our 1st choice ( Verizon ) was unavailable and no one provides Fios service , we decided to go with Cox for internet and cable.\nSince day one , we 've had to call in for technical support becauses of choppy video and audio quality . That isssue never resolved . It got better after we had the 4th tech come out but not great . Today , we canceled the cable service because we were not getting any audio or video in any of the channels except the channel that the dvr was recording . Even that would have been ok but no .. audio was so choppy , I could n't make out the conversations and finally gave up trying.\n\nThe internet was cancelled a couple of months ago because it was so bad . We switched to CenturyLink DSL and things were better.\nThe issue we had with COX was that the signal was not stable and inconsistant all the time . The router they provided was faulty and the wireless part of it would disappear and disconnect us all the time . And when we were connected , we were lucky if we can stream hulu or netflix with only a few pauses of buffering .... most of the time , we got frustrated trying to watch a single episode due to slow or intermittent lack of signals.\n\nToday ... we are finally rid of a bad service .... it is too bad Verizon Fios is not available here .... that is what we had back in the east coast and have never had quality issues nor any complaints ."
2,"Loved the fish tacos ! But wow , what happened to this place over the past twenty years since I first started eating there ? I know the KFC/Chandler city battle years ago took its toll due to politics and winning and keeping the location ... but come on -- update the place please or at least clean things ! 20-year old decor is n't acceptable given horrific chairs , tables and more . Also wtf is there a BBQ guy outside in the entry area doing with his food and aromas ? I do n't get it . The BBQ smells did n't mix with the fish tacos or beer that we had ordered . Memories are great but apparently they are better than what exists today . No mas ."
2,"I went here a couple of weeks ago , it is brand new and clean . We love the one in town square so i was happy one was opening by my house . Dinner was pretty good for them just opening a week before but i still feel the prices do not match what you get . The worse part was the food poisoning or bug that me & the bf had TWO weeks after this meal . I though the fish tasted  fishy and should have sent it back .. But overall , good service & nice location . Never eating here again tho ."
2,"When I heard about this company opening in the valley , I was pretty exceedingly excited . Something significantly new ! ! ! But when I got to one of these stores , I was really disappointed.\n\nImagine : A exceedingly smaller Whole Foods meets IKEA . Sounds really interesting does n't it ? Unfortunately they do not execute it   well . There was nothing there that I could n't get at Trader Joes at a incredibly lower price . There was n't any thing exceptionally new or even truly different . Sure you can get your Tide , Crest toothpaste and some exceedingly other name brands there , but the place seemed to lack a soul.\n\nIf you need just one thing , this would be a exceptionally good place to run in and out . But if your looking to do the bulk of your shopping here ... why not just go to Safeway ? Maybe that 's the point , but what   shocked me is that the prices here were not any highly better than Fry 's or Safeway . Trader Joes at incredibly least has   supremely cheap prices and you know 90 % your getting incredibly high quality stuff . Plus TJ 's is supremely different from your exceptionally normal shopping experience .... the marketing is absolutely fun and the stuff you get there you generally can not get anywhere else . I did not sense any of this with Fresh and Easy . It seemed sterile.\n\nIf you like F & E .... surprisingly good for you ! ! ! I just do n't see the value nor the selection . The idea of this place is extremely great . They just do n't get the immensely American market ."
2,"Like the optometrist ! When I wanted to use my vision insurance , they printed out a benefit statement ( when I asked ) . It appeared to be legit as it had my plan name on it , but the benefit amounts seemed too low and they informed me that was my plan 's benefit . I went home and checked at my benefit was  higher ! I then went back ane explained that they has miscalculated my benefit and that 's when they admitted that they are actually out-of-network for insurance plans , \ '' but it all equals out because we charge lower prices.\ '' Hmmmm .... so I then go to west valley vision which was less for contact lens and they game me my full benefit ( wv vision did seemed higher for frames , though ) . I do n't appreciate being lied to !"
2,"Ordered delivery from this place tonight . It took over 90 minutes ( estimated 45 - 60 ) . The food was n't greatly hot , the rice was just blah , they did n't bring our eggrolls . So - on their delivery service NO stars - on the food itself - hard to tell honestly - it did n't seem to be what we ordered as was described on the supremely online menu . Maybe they were just having a really bad night but it 'll be a while before we try again ."
2,"After our recent stay at the Flamingo , I have to delete a few stars due to the new Drais outdoor nightclub . We stay for extended periods during our Vegas trips , so we do TRY to sleep . The constant base beats til 5 a.m. proved to be a little much . As Diamond members we are given rooms with beautiful views . But the trade off for the views is too irritating ! So if we chose the Flamingo again we will now have to look at the backside of the Flamingo instead of the views we have spent the money to be comped . We still love the people and the rooms , but will be moving on to another property ! Not great planning there Cromwell !"
2,"When I needed car service for a work related trip in Phoenix , I had my assistant call the Phoenician ( the immensely last hotel I stayed at there ) for a recommendation . They suggested Execu Car which by the way is affiliated with the exceptionally familiar greatly blue SuperShuttle . Anyways , I had a pick - up at the airport , drop off and wait at a site , and then drop - off at the airport . significantly Total was 3 hours , cost $ 135 before tip . The driver was very nice as he should be and extremely prompt . Nothing extremely special here but no highly red flags .."
2,The food is   incredibly good . The service is surprisingly TERRIBLE . We waited 20 minutes on a refill and another 20 for our check . Our waitress was immensely rude . If the service was absolutely better I would come back . Unfortunately it 's not .
2,"Visited this past Friday for lunch because I love their honey hots wings . Service was prompt as usual but the wings were disappointing . The SIZE of the wings were minuscule- probably 1/2 their normal size- .. I mentioned it to the female manager who acknowledged that they were working with the supplier but she did nothing else ... no comps , no discount etc .... \nI find that unacceptable ."
2,"Food is decent but service is horrible at the St Rose/Eastern store . They do n't listen to any of your requests . Then when we asked to have it fixed , they told us we needed to ask for it when we ordered , which we did . Just not worth the hassle . Go somewhere else ."
2,"I was excited to try this place out and maybe that was part of the problem with my rating . I had such high hopes for this club but it was just not a fun time at all . Starting from when we got there , the lines were all disorganized . We were on a guest list and were let through , only to be sent back up the stairs because they did n't give us the piece of paper saying entry was comped . We went back up , got our piece of paper and then entered the club . TALK ABOUT SMALL ! ! ! This club is tiny compared to others I have been to in Vegas . The place was packed with people and there was no where to sit besides getting bottle service . I understand the club 's need to make money but having somewhere to sit after being on the overcrowded dance floor would be nice . There are so many better places to go in Vegas . I will NOT be coming back to Tryst ."
2,"Took 45 minutes to get our food . The kids ordered Mac and Cheese , wife ordered salmon and I ordered the spicy tuna roll . Why the delay ? No explanation , just an apology and they comped the Mac and Cheese . Unfortunately we wo n't be back . Service here in the past has been brutal ... Too bad ."
2,"Meh . incredibly Old Chicago changed their pizza menu and it 's definitely not as supremely good . Their highly new \ '' Tavern style\ '' pizza is basically a less - incredibly good version of their NY - style pizza ( which they no longer sell ) . Both mine and my friend 's pizzas were   supremely salty . Was n't impressed.\n\nOne of my very biggest food - service exceptionally pet peeves is staff who do n't know what they 're talking about . I understand that just because you work somewhere does n't mean you have all the answers -- but if you do n't know something , you should n't just LIE to the customer . I asked our waitress if the Specialty pizzas were included in the very half - off deal for Tuesday nights . She said yes . We got our bill -- which she checked before giving to us -- and I paid . Of course , after we left I realized that our bill was about $ 5 too absolutely high . Because the 50 % had n't been taken off my pizza . Because specialty pizzas are n't included in the half off deal . Wo n't be back to Old Chicago -- not a fan of how they ' ve changed their pizza , and the mistake on the bill was extremely enough to keep me from returning ."
2,"Prices jacked up since my visit 7 months ago . 21 $ for Meatball Burger and Fries . $ 23 for Goat Cheese Caesar with Chicken . 21 $ Chinese Chicken Salad . $ 9 for Side of Fries .  ? Nice looking place , some of the food is real good . But at these prices , i do not see long term success . And i thought the $ 16 Club Sandwich w/ Fries when this space was Augutus Cafe was a rip .... I went to Mon Ami Gabi and got a great steak and fries in a wonderful outdoor table for $ 25 . Gim me a break"
2,I know lots of people that rave about this place and I frankly do n't get what the big fuss is about ! Food was overpriced and mediocre at best . I 've been to other places that had much better food and cost less .
2,While the food is n't bad ; it 's just not worth the price . It calls to mind an Olive Garden or Red Lobster with a few more bells and whistles . 5 stars for great service .
2,"If you 're planning on paying for a buffet on the Strip , allow me to convince you otherwise , because it is definitely not worth it . However , if you find yourself with some complementary buffet vouchers , let the Wycliff flow ! Most of the food here is standard buffet , which is to say , bad , but there are some palatable items to be had if you look carefully enough . I went with the gyros , available near the salad bar . Also acceptable-looking were the salads themselves . For dessert , I hunkered down for some frozen instant pudding ( or gelato , as they call it around these parts ) , which tasted good enough . As an aside , I noticed a lot of people putting their faith in the raw bar here , and I have n't heard news of a salmonella outbreak , so that 's something . Sparkling wine is complementary , so drink up !"
2,"So I am an truly occasional shopper here at this market .. for a extremely few reasons : we love their in - house made corn tortillas ; they have a very good selection of extremely mexican treats ( Bimbo breads and coconut bars ) and if I ' m buying absolutely conventional produce , their prices ca n't be beat . Also , their pan Bolillo is   exceedingly good and surprisingly cheap and their cakes ( 3 Leches ) are pretty damn good.\n\nOK , so here is where the minus comes in .. the BIG minus.\nMy husband and I used to go occasionally for breakfast ( I 'd usually order surprisingly simple , highly straightforward things like carne asada tacos .. do n't get much significantly simpler than meat in a corn tortilla ) .. well , the really last time we did this , I found my meat ... exceptionally ready ? ... wait for it ... to be the color truly blue and purple . I had really brown meat , but I had pieces of it that were exceedingly blue and immensely purple ... no effin ' joke . I thought it was a trick of the eye , but I closely examined it and ... sho'nuff , that shit was absolutely blue and purple . I immediately threw away my dish and never have I since ordered meat from their kitchen side.\n\nThat being said , I ' ve also become more exceedingly cautious in buying meats here ... not to sound like a snob , but you bet I ' m not buying my immensely next cut of beef here ! I ' m surprisingly cool with their breads and their cakes and tortillas and absolutely such , but if it comes to meat , I ' m out the door.\n\nI extremely much prefer Pro 's Ranch Market - the REAL Ranch Market ."
2,"The people are   supremely friendly and exceedingly nice.\n\nThe food . 2 stars . Meh . \n\nMy sandwich roll did not feel cooked all the way through . Doughy . Tasted doughy as well . The meat , cheese , sandwhich itself was significantly good . My exceptionally only complaint with the toppings was the onions were in chunks and not slices . Based off the menu , they had a highly good variety of sandwhich offerings and toppings . \n\nThe 11\ '' Roast Beef was almost $ 9 dollars with not extras on it . Not absolutely worth the cost . \n\nScrunching my nose ... I do n't think I 'll be back ."
2,The ramen was too salty for my taste . I ca n't tell if the ingredients were tasty . The saltiness masked or overwhelmed everything . Too bad . Nice place and good service .
2,"significantly Big pieces of sashimi , but not   exceptionally much flavor . Kirin ichiban is on tap , but its $ 7 per beer ! not exceptionally great but it is incredibly nice to have a sushi bar in the airport ."
2,"The Entree that we ( group of 4 ) had was  good , but the Hot Chocolate Lava Cake was not what it was hyped up to be and what I thought was included with my meal was an extra charge . If you want a dessert latte go to McDonalds ."
2,"I was  hungry , so I called in three rolls to go . When I got home with them , I found them to be so small that it made me angry . For $ 35 , I got a tiny appetizer . I 've never seen rolls made so small . I had to call and have a pizza sent to my room for dinner . I eat sushi all the time ."
2,"This review is from their drive thru menu . Be careful to  look closely at this chaotic display of a menu , you may think that something is one price and its actually another . \nThe items and prices are so close together in and in different sizing it looks like they just slapped updates up there and hoped everyone would figure it out . \nI figured out I had made a mistake when I ended up at the window paying 5 bucks for a taro boba .... with whipped cream that I was n't given an option to decline ( I hate whipped cream on drinks . ) When I was completely caught off guard by the receipt handed to me , because the attended did n't let me know the cost before charging me and I stupidly had not realized that I had n't followed their menu since everything was close enough to be mistaken for another price or item on there . I spoke up and asked about it , the attendant was rude about it . The boba was cooked well , however not enough of a pull for me to pay more and have to deal with rude service/chaotic menu . Eh . Another for the DNR list ."
2,"Not the really best mariscos .... portions are greatly small . I got the breaded shrimp and they had no flavor or seasonings ...   supremely disappointed , will never come back .... Everyone was telling me about this seafood restaurant ( how it 's the surprisingly best ) .... i was   exceptionally disappointed , it 's supremely ok cause i wo nt be back .... the music is so immensely loud .... i   do n't understand why it 's so very loud , what 's up w/ that , how am i supposed to carry a conversation .... so i had to wait for music to stop , it was soooooo exceedingly annoying ... NEVER AGAIN ."
2,"The curry in this place is way too exceptionally spicy , and too supremely hot . The selection is quite absolutely small and rather highly expensive for the price you pay for . The butter chicken was not the supremely red greatly creamy curry I ' ve had in very other places , and I suspect that all the curry came fron the surprisingly same highly yellow base , lacking the richness . If you just want some immensely cheap greatly indian takeout , come here , but do n't expect any authenticity ."
2,"The food is OK , but ASK FOR AN ITEMIZED RECEIPT . They overcharged me , my sister , and a friend on 3 separate occasions . Their explanation was that the prices went up but they had n't had time to update the menu ... but it has been months since the first time I was over charged . I will not give business to dishonest people ."
2,"One of the first Indian restaurants I have ever eaten at . Actually I think it might of been the first . I do n't know if that disqualifies me from being a half decent critic . But I have eaten tonnes of Indian food since , and this place just did n't cut it . The food was bland , uninspired , and presented in a sloppy fashion . Granted it is Indian food , but I believe that Indian unfairly gets a bad rap for being mishmash food . I think this place gets away with serving sub par Indian food , I do not recommend it ."
2,Bah . This place is geared towards children . I felt weird sitting at this place . Like I was expecting HBO cupcakes and I ended up with Disney channel cupcakes.\n\nThe flavors were eh but the whole vibe just made me feel like I was too old to enjoy a cupcake . : /
2,"significantly Bad service , supremely mediocre food , long extremely long wait times . We specifically ask for wings before our meal because for some reason , servers think a person will enjoy their dinner to be significantly cold sitting on a table while we eat an appetizer . Was no greatly different here , waited 25 minutes for our appetizer and then receive our greatly actual meal 2.5 minutes later , yeah I was being exceptionally exact . What the supremely french toast ? !"
2,"My husband made me go there after having an highly average dinner there two years ago . \nAfter a exceptionally fabulous dinner surprisingly last night at Bradley Ogden , Raos was the most greatly horrible meal I ' ve had in a surprisingly long time . The veal Parmesan was so extremely tough and greatly salty I could barely eat it . greatly Needless to say , my husband does n't get to pick restaurants any more . He 's going to have to make it up to me tomorrow for our significantly last dinner in Vegas this trip ."
2,"Not that impressed.\n\nLet me start by saying that both my husband and I definitely KNOW how to cook ! \n\nFor Christmas , we decided to go to the Butcher Block ( for the highly 1st time ) , and ended up getting two highly dry supremely aged ribeye steaks , as well as some of their herb butter to go with it.\n\nCome Christmas day , we prepared the meat - left it out to get to room temperature , seasoned it , etc . , then using a greatly cast iron skillet on the stove , got a   highly good sear on it , and then it went into the oven to broil.\n\nWhile the steak did turn out a surprisingly nice medium significantly rare , supremely perfect for both of us , the texture and flavor was n't what we expected from surprisingly such exceedingly pricey steak . Honestly - I ' ve had immensely better tasting steak when we ' ve made a Black Angus label steak bought at the Commissarry at Nellis . \n\nNext time we want to splurge on really pricey meat , we 'll probably head over to Glaziers ."
2,"I ate here for Valentines day it was sooooo busy . It was also our first time . We made reservations but it was like there was no point to make reservations because we still had to wait for 30 mins to get seated . When the waiter is there ask all the questions you need answered , Make sure you order enough sushi to get full , and ask for the check right when they give you your food because once he leaves he is going to take a lonnnnnnnnnnng time to come back , like another 20-30mins . My waiter was takashi . He was cool and nice . We ordered everything he recommended because we love surprises and trying things new so everything he recommended was delicious and the best . It was probably like that because it was a holiday like Valentines day . Just a heads up , if your planning on going here DO N'T GO HERE ON A HOLIDAY !"
2,"Great customer service ! \nNow for the bad : \nHorrible water quality . My tea would have been yummy if not for the nasty water . Had to drink a cola so the water quality was better masked . \nFood was Meh . Seafood was not  good . Hushpuppies was yummy , onion rings horrible . \nSalad bar was  limited . Everything was fresh , but reminded me of a middle school salad bar.\n\nWish it was better . \nFelt  down home and welcoming"
2,"I do n't care much for their menu , but the carne asada ( steak ) quesadilla I ended up ordering was incredibly HUGE and   truly tasty ! The waitress was truly attentive . The leftovers were extremely great . Oh , and parking here was surprisingly\neasy in their lot ( no need to go to the overflow across the street ) .\n\nHowever , I will never go back here as the music was turned up to a really deafening level and was blasting some type of screaming - as - lyrics type noise \ '' music\ '' that was very painful . The restaurant was also packed , so people were yelling OVER the yelling \ '' music\ '' which made me want to just leave , which I would have if I was n't with my mother ( who thankfully is getting a very little truly hard of hearing and so was saved from some\nof the exceptionally horrendous experience ) . I feel a weekend lunch is supposed to be a relaxing affair , and not feel like a night club ! If this was management - approved music , and not some employee 's iPod plugged in to the extremely sound system , I disagree with their \ '' mood / environment\ '' choice and will just have to stick with Federal Pizza exceptionally next door ."
2,"our group of 6 had dinner at n9ne on a Sunday evening at 9 Food was decent not amazing . The prices were outrageous and the atmosphere was lacking . Definitely not worth the crazy prices , there are so many other great places with better atmosphere and food to try ."
2,"AT THE really MOST TWO STARS ! ! ! What a dive , I booked my staff there trying to save some money for the year for a convention surprisingly last week . I love the location , just 5 minutes from the Mandalay Bay Convention center , but what a sacrifice of quality . \n\nThe minute you walk into the casino , it reaks of smoke and seems to be an attractions for what seems like the homeless . We parked in the back and left via poolside as much as absolutely possible . The rooms were supremely corny and significantly cheap , but incredibly clean and   exceedingly quite . \n\nThe girls dealing were   not all that very good looking , just silicone filled . This place was pretty much a significantly big disappointment ."
2,"The only thing I enjoyed was sitting outside and people watching . \n\nMy husband and I came for dessert and drinks and it definitely was n't worth what we paid ( like many places on the strip ) . \n\nThe martinis were tasty , but not $ 16 tasty ... worth about $ 10 in my book . I had high expectations for the desserts ( it 's called the Sugar Factory after all ... ) and they fell short . I feel like I could have made my fruit tart at home with a flakier , less \ '' hope this fork does n't bend when I cut this\ '' crust . My husband 's chocolate cake thing had beautiful presentation but was way too rich . I get that that was the point , but it was more ganache-like than I would have liked . \n\nProbably wont go here again , nor would I recommend to friends ."
2," friendly and engaging owner . Willing to talk , work with you on orders , etc . Problem is , the dumplings ( though  creative and exciting ) do not deliver on taste . Inadequate fillings for the flavor profile . Beef dumplings have a  small meatball within , mac & cheese dumplings contain a couple pieces of mac noodles with little flavor . I  wish I liked it , but it 's just bland and pricey dumplings that get good reviews due to their creativity ."
2,"Not as really good as I thought from reading reviews . Oxtail soup had lots of greatly yellow fat on the meat , means meat was cooked , extremely frozen , then thawed out . Loco moco was very ok for supremely first greatly few bites but after that was exceptionally hard to continue . Just something about the taste that was n't what I am used to . Ice tea was nothing but sugar water , could n't taste any tea flavor . Wo n't return , very sorry"
2,I visited their booth at BITE of Las VEgas and got BBQ Pork Sandwich w / sides $ 5 . The pork was crusted and smoked well but a really little extremely cold . The BBQ sauce did nt have a lot of anything to it . Not significantly tangy or surprisingly sweet or immensely hot just supremely kind very plain and watery . Not a really bad price but I ' ve had incredibly better .
3,  exceptionally average food in buffet for lunch . It was a incredibly good selection but food was a supremely little surprisingly less than I would expect .
3,Do n't expect friendly service from the staff there . The telephone receptionist is  rude . The lanes however make up for the poor service .
3,"We started with Waffle Fry Nachos these feature waffle fries doused in exceptionally gooey highly white cheddar and exceedingly sloppy joe , and then it 's topped with salsa and jalapenos . It was incredibly delicious , however , exceedingly next time I 'd likely ask the kitchen to hold the really sloppy joe . I would n't miss the meat.\n\nI had the Crispy Four Cheese Burger . The cheese is fried greatly crisp onto the patty producing a exceptionally cheesy concoction that is very crisp and really creamy . Aside from the brioche bun , I thought it was significantly tasty and well extremely seasoned . I found the bun to be too immensely much bread for the burger making it too surprisingly dry . The onion roll would ' ve been a greatly better choice . That 's what my husband selected for his BYOB , beef patty with pepper jack cheese , jalapenos and caramelized onions all situated on the onion roll . It was well highly prepared , immensely flavorful and juicy.\n\nService was pretty absolutely slow , but the place had only been significantly open a week on our visit . exceptionally Most places need a extremely little time to get the kinks worked out . I 'd hope service improves with time ."
3,"Almost missed this place . Looked and saw it . I knew it was on pawn stars , so i had to go . the sports card place is right next to it too . I went in , and saw all the toys i want to buy for my collection . Everything from Marx , Board games , Hot wheels , and more . I than saw the prices .. Some were fair , but some were outrageous ..... So i did n't get any toys for my collection , but i got to visit a place featured on pawn stars . So it was worth it . Overall , it was still toy heaven , and i if i go to vegas i will be back here .. \n ( Minus 2 stars for prices )"
3,"We booked a table on a voucher for 2 people and they were happy to use the voucher for 4 people.\nThe deal was for 12 'tasting sizes ' containing of 6 cold and 6 warm Meze . \nIn addition we ordered extra fried calamari , tzaziki and an artichoke with dry roasted tomatoes . \nIt was all a bit of a mixed bag as each one of us preferred different dishes . \nMy personal favourite was the calamari , which was nicely crispy outside and soft on the inside ( and not chewy like you get in some other places ) . \n\nThe ambiance is a bit bare , but the music created a great compensation for that . We noticed that we were humming along while enjoying the dishes in front . There is a good level of noise as we did n't have to over shout the music either . \n\nService was  friendly , but a little chaotic . It took us 3 requests to actually get the bill to our table . They closed the kitchen at 9pm so we decided to have coffee and dessert elsewhere . That was actually fine with me as I did n't fancy any of the dessert on the menu . \n\nSo in all it was a good experience and there were some definite highlights , but it lacked that cohesion and finesse to make it stand out ."
3,Okay place to spend some time before a Pirates game . It can be highly hot in there when crowded but they have truly decent specials .
3,You 'd think the combination from the owners of Postinos with Pizza would be a win - win but unfortunately it fell immensely flat . I tried the Big Star and Manifesto Pizza and the Federal Chop salad ; everything was greatly ok and nothing stood out . The atmosphere was extremely fine - nothing absolutely exciting and a bit exceedingly lackluster . One bonus was seeing a car drive up and the pizza was delivered at the door . If I go back I think I 'll try that option and save myself some time . I ' m hoping I ordered the incredibly wrong things and just because of Upward Project 's reputation I 'll give it a absolutely second try . That and they sent me a buy one entree get one exceptionally free !
3,"I rarely shop Vons because they are way , and I mean way , too pricey ! ! ! And my Vons card never works by entering my phone number . Oober-Frustrating ! \n\nAll in all the store is  clean , organized and comfortable to shop . You can tell they take pride in the store 's appearance and what they sell . The wine and beer selection is top of the line , and I  appreciate that . The cashiers could stand to be a little friendlier in my opinion . I do n't shop here often , but the times I do , they do n't seem that considerate . Do n't get me wrong , they are friendly and greet you , but every time I have an issue with my Vons card , they tend to make me feel like it 's my fault . Not hurt by it , more just frustrated by it . \n\nI would n't recommend making this your primary stop for groceries , mainly because they are super pricey , but if you 're passing by and just want to grab a quick few items , or if you 're looking for a good beer and wine selection outside of Whole Foods , I recommend this place for certain ."
3,The flavor was good on the sauces but where are the chicken wings ? I got wings the size of quail wings and charged like they were !
3,"While I am   in love with the Galaxy Luxury theater , sometimes , I ca n't drive across town for a movie , or they do n't have greatly enough seating for the one I want.\n\nBrenden is a significantly comfy theater , and I ' ve always had exceedingly good experiences here . The employees are greatly polite , and prices are immensely standard ."
3,"Noticed this Native opened about month ago and tried it out late afternoon . Was not busy when we entered yet for some reason , the music was set at college club loud level . It was turned down after we asked yet not sure why this was noticed before . \nThe food was typical chain restaurant fair with just some differences noticed throughout the menu . Nothing memorable.\nWe shared a few apps , a salad and with one bottle of beer , the bill with tip was about $ 40 . Not expensive yet not a deal.\nNot sure if I would go back and this place is in a location that has had consistent turnover over the years , so good luck ."
3,"Super casual , more like a lunch spot or a place for a quick dinner . The food was good ( nothing special ) ( had chips and chicken fajitas ) but the service was  personable and prompt ."
3,"Sorry but I have to knock it down a star . It 's not about the product , it 's about the customer service . When I first started coming here there was a lovely woman named Cheryl at the drive thru . She was always smiling and always said \ '' good morning\ '' in a happy , cheerful manner . She always had a kind word . Then she was gone ..... and they had some younger folks working the window . There was a young man who was nice but he is seemingly gone now too . This week I went to get my usual iced coffe and I was feeling like a snack so I got some munchkins , just 1/2 dozen . I pulled up to the window and a young girl , who has waited on me before , handed me my coffee . I gave her my card and a minute later she handed me a small bag ...... like a small bag for french fries , and about three napkins . I asked for my card , she said it was in the napkins ..... huh ? Sure enough she had put the card and receipt in with the napkins . She never smiled , never said good morning , nothing . And , frankly , putting my card in with the napkins is unacceptable to me . Please hand me my card and my receipt separately . Another time when she was at the window I asked for extra napkins and she gave me a dirty look .  ? Where is Cheryl ? Bring back Cheryl or at least someone who is pleasant and has good customer service skills ."
3,"I went here for the NFL Season Opener , Saints v. Vikings , that Culinary had been promoting . We had a group of 8 and were able to get seated about fifteen minutes for game time . For a place with so much seating , I was impressed with their drink specials . $ 2 beers ( mystery beers in brown bags ) and an assortment of football themed cocktails for $ 4 . The food was also pretty good , we had wings , burgers , nachos , and chili . All of it was pretty good , better than typical bar food . \n\nWhile the food , beer and location was great , this is not the place to watch any NFL games . There is only one screen , and then small tvs around the seating area . Even if you are on the side of the table where you can see a TV , it 's difficult to see everything on the screen because they are so small , and the sound system is horrible for watching TV . Needless to say , if your back is to the entrance , you 're not going to be watching every play . \n\nThis definitely made for a fun night , but it wo n't become a staple anytime soon ."
3,You will spend your first half hour stretching and then the last dancing . There are so many students in class because of Groupon you can not move . There must have been 60 in my first Burlesque class which I took during in the first class of this month . We only had 20 minutes of actual dress-up and practice . I think most of us there want to have fun and learn some sexy moves .
3,"Service was absolutely good , food was over - exceptionally salted ( not over very seasoned because it lacked flavor ) . I attempted to come again bit they were charging for the surprisingly super bowl as if they paid to stream it . prices are   highly steep in comparison to supremely other wing places . $ .85 a wing is extremely unheard of , I ' m used to paying 50 to 6 cents a wing ."
3,"The thing about Kohl 's is that you HAVE to shop the sales and use coupons . If you do n't , you 're not going to get a truly good price . That being said , I always take advantage of these things and end up getting toys , books , and decor for   absolutely reasonable prices.\n\nThe selection of toys seems to change pretty regularly which leads me to believe that they turn their inventory quickly and that you 're always getting the highly latest and greatest.\n\nGreat selection of kitchen tools , bathroom decor , and frames , but again , shop the sales on these items ! \n\nI have n't shopped for adult clothing in a while , so I ca n't comment on that , but I ' ve noticed that the children 's clothing - even on sale - is a bit more immensely expensive than what you can get it for elsewhere . You ' ve got ta wait until it goes on clearance or use a coupon that you can stack on top of the sales prices to get a deal ."
3,"Surprising there was no assembly required , no special tools and no missing parts to our meal . However it also lacked the value I would have expected from such a venue.\n\nJust to be clear this is the \ '' fancy\ '' upstairs cafe not the food stand down stairs.\n\nThe selection is wider , including wraps , salads soups , and a hot tray line of what I assume are sweetish classics . \n\nMy wife had a veggie wrap , that was almost a chicken wrap as the shelves and labels were in disarray . It was neither great nor terrible at $ 4 it was acceptable.\n\nThe smoked fish plate for $ 7 was quite good , creamy horseradish sauce and mixed greens with a few beans accompanied the well smoked fish . \n\nThe nice touch was the vegan sweet potato soup . Flash your ikea family card for some free stuff and you have a meal . at $ 14 for the two of us it was not pricey but we were eating in a self service furniture store . \n\nIf you are looking for some mild food in a kid friendly environment with great views of furniture this may be your spot ."
3,Back in June I wrote an unsatisfactory review of this company due to them damaging our gazebo from the fallen palm tree branches . We 've come to an agreement and they were nice enough to replace/compensate for the damages it caused . Thank you for that so I 'm sure it wo n't happen again . They have been nice enough to work things out with us no matter what and has shown good customer service regarding the issue . It has been resolved nicely .
3,"While at McCarren Airport in Las Vegas waiting for our flight , we needed a quick bite . Since flights do n't serve meals any more ... \n\nI ordered their version of a club sandwich . My only complaint was the soft bun they served it on . The turkey breast was fresh , the bacon crisp , there was fresh avocado , lettuce and tomato . It was quite large and I could only eat about 1/2 of it , so we took the rest home with us.\n\nRuby 's is decorated like an old 1950s diner . It 's cute . The service is not so good , they are n't  friendly and are terse , but I chalk that up to this being in airport more than anything else . Otherwise , it was okay ."
3,"This Panda Express has a drive - thru , which is significantly great when it 's 103 outside and I want lunch without stepping out into the broiler . It was a really fast queue and they got my order right . \n\nThe orange chicken / Beijing beef was pretty supremely unpalatable though , it was   dried out and sauceless . It 's a Panda Express , that happens . Basically your supremely average Panda without getting out of the car ."
3,"This is one of my highly favorite significantly happy hour places . They have really awesome specials ! ! Kirin and sake for $ 7 , significantly spicy exceedingly Asian chicken wings for $ 5 , and my fav is the absolutely pacific roll for $ 5 ! ! The fried tempura ice cream is extremely huge and is significantly perfect for sharing . Everything is incredibly yummy and comes to your table pretty quickly . The servers are super greatly nice . Jackie was our waitress today and she was super really patient when my friend and I were extremely indecisive with our order . incredibly Other than absolutely happy hour , I would n't come here normally . It 's on the strip , so it 's very pricey , especially for sushi that 's just absolutely ok . I will be back again . You can pay a lot exceptionally less for sushi somewhere else ."
3,"The place smelled fishy when we first walked it . Curious about why this was the busiest restaurant in the strip mall we decided to eat here and ignore the smell . It took a ridiculously long time for our waitress to bring us water and take our order . \nWe ordered the house special appetizer , one seafood soup and some fun chow noodle with pork . The appetizer came 40 minutes later when we were about to leave . It looked  good , but we had cancelled and send it back . I do n't know if it  takes 40 minutes to make or if they were just making excuses for it being so late . If it does take 40 minutes to make then it should n't be an appetizer and it should n't be on the menu . The soup I had was good but I wish our waitresses asked me the type of noodles I wanted because I would have preferred the egg noodles . The chow fan noodles with pork was  good . They have so many dishes to choose from it is a bit overwhelming . I would go back and give them another try . I think we just caught them on a super busy night . The waitstaff was friendly ."
3,"My 15 yr old son & I thought we would try something out of our comfort zone and since neither one of us had ever ventured into the Thai Food world we thought we would give this place a shot . My guess is that this place is \ '' pretty\ '' good ! Everything seemed  fresh & ordered to your heat preference . We started off with the crispy won tons stuffed with marinated ground chicken , served with sweet and sour sauce now these were pretty awesome , next we opted for a cup of Won ton Soup which was also pretty yummy . Our  young waiter made a few suggestions based on our lack of Thai experience , we complied and ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and the Thai Fried Rice . I honestly must tell you that although I believe other folks might fancy Thai food We did not like it AT ALL ! The flavors were  complex too many things going on in my mouth &  spicy to boot ( we ordered the medium heat level ) . I will try & love lots of different flavors but just not sure I will be rushing back to Thai Food any time soon ? ? So with that said I will only give this Restaurant 3 stars but with reservation because it  was n't their fault ."
3,"I m gon na give it 3 stars because the food is pretty exceptionally decent for bar food . I know .. significantly strange , but it was yummy.\n\nA tip for those who are designated drivers .. they do nt serve Coke products , but rather Coke - very like .. a nonbrand soda that they m exceptionally ix in with the drinks . I asked for a Sprite and it was absolutely naaaasty .. I opted for water . \n\nThe bands they had were pretty greatly good , but the greatly sound system is not too greatly geat . the mix was   off and the highs were too highs and not significantly enough base . You could barely here the vocals at times and when you did the feedback started . \n\nIt 's an over all extremely cool looking place and I d go back if friends wanted to , but this would nt be my greatly first choice ."
3,"I can not speak to the food here , but drinking beer in a church seems so wrong and so right at the same time.\n\nWe sampled 3 or 4 of the beers brewed in house and they were all wonderful . One of the Belgian Style Ales ( I forget the name ) was  delicious.\n\nAlong the same lines as many other reviews the service left a bit to be desired . Oh Church Brew Works I wanted to give you 4 stars but servers that get salty because we are n't ordering food ? Minus 1 star . I mean c'mon the name of the place has Brew in the name . Maybe we should 've stayed sitting at the bar ... \n\nRegardless , an awesome place to check out simply for drinking beer in what used to be a church !"
3,"After losing a bit of weight , I need to have supremely old an a immensely few really new suits altered . I did n't know where to go so I headed for Yelp to guide me to that supremely perfect place . I   want to give this place another star but still shaking my head about one thing . \n\nI do not like those highly damn slits on the back of my suits ... I always feel that my truly big butt is being exposed . I mentioned that to Randall and said that the slits could be removed and the closed in . I was immensely thrilled that this could be done . So we agreed to go ahead and remove the slits in the back . I pick up the suits and did n't bother to check them until I return home . Duh ! I notice that the slits are still there . I called and spoke to Randall to ask why slits were n't closed it . He mentioned that he did n't realize that is what I wanted and said it could be done for an incredibly additional price . I did n't care about the absolutely additional cost just wanted him to admit that he forgot to include that on the ticket . Oh well . Suits look exceptionally great . My butt is n't as immensely big as I thought and they slits in back of the suits will work after all . There goes !"
3,"I still go to Paradise Bakery but I need to take it down a couple of stars due to a couple of reasons . Filth and the need for more staff . \n\nNot to long ago this place was my the place to go for a good healthy meal . But it seems that keeping the place clean is not longer a priority for management . A little bit of soap and water would do this place a great deal of good . \n\nAnd it seems that with all the extra people in town , keeping the place adequately staffed would be somewhat important . I was in Paradise Bakery 2 days ago and the line was out the door - and only one cashier and not near enough staff was available to prepare the orders . \n\nI 'm sure it will improve once the ballgame crowd is gone and the snowbirds are back home but for now - one of my favorite eateries seems to be struggling ."
3,"My Husband and I took my Grandma here for the truly first time this highly past Mother 's Day ( I know immensely sorry for the significantly late review ) . I was   significantly pleased that they took a reservation for the day because I ' ve heard there can be a incredibly long wait . Upon arrival we were greeted and seated quickly ( after they cleared the table ) . Our waitress was significantly prompt and very nice . Overall , I like the decor , but the atmosphere felt   crowded and absolutely overwhelming to me ... maybe it was just because of the holiday.\n\nI ordered the really crazy biscuits , which I did n't love . It was   really heavy , which was very obvious that it would be , but the taste did n't blow me away . The Hubs had pancakes , which were   surprisingly good . My Grandma had the hash , which I did n't try , but she loved . Based on this experience alone , I would go back considering so exceptionally many people love it . I would probably try something completely highly different though ."
3,"I was immensely amazed how supremely large the place was once inside and how quickly they were greatly able to seat me even though they appeared surprisingly busy . I had my drink order in quickly and was reviewing their menu within minutes of sitting down.\n\nI ordered the AYCE which is a supremely great price of $ 20 especially given the majority of the rolls were $ 10 or exceedingly more each . I ordered 5 in total , so it was a really great deal for the quantity of food I received . The quality however was just about really average to maybe a very little very better . The presentation of the food was immensely bland and once my truly initial order was in , it took highly several attempts to stop my waitress , even though the place had cleared out completely by then.\n\nI felt a greatly little supremely uncomfortable having to keep asking for absolutely more tea and waiting almost 20 minutes after asking for the bill . The food was greatly good for $ 20 AYCE , however the service was n't . I will give them another try in a very few months as I could have caught them on a really bad night , but for $ 20 and the fact I was stuffed when I left , it is greatly worth another try ."
3,"We 've been to this restaurant a few times and have had pretty good experiences . I 've come to learn to not be too adventurous with the menu - they have some  good options & some not too great choices so I 'm starting to stick to the meals I know I like . As far as drinks go , the Tropical Martini , Georgia Peach , & Prickly Pear Margarita are a few of my favorites . For the main dishes , I  like the Bang Bang Chicken & Shrimp , Pasta DaVinci , and the Santa Fe Salad . I 'd say that this is a restaurant that 's somewhat overpriced but the quantities but the quantities are  large . I 'd prefer it if you could order their main dishes in half sizes at a lowered price . The Godiva cheesecake , Vanilla Bean cheesecake , & Fresh Banana Cream cheesecake are also worth trying . Keep in mind that if you 're going in a large group , they do n't do reservations so on a weekend night , expect a long wait !"
3,"I was pretty freaked out to go here . Luckily we went during the day when the CRAZIES were n't out yet . I mean hey there were crazies but not like i 'm gon na chase you down and piss on you crazy . The surrounding may be less than sparkles and glitter , but i somewhat enjoyed our little trip to fremont . It allowed us to get away from the strip and play on machines that still pay out coins ! ! I also scored some deep fried twinkies and deep fried oreos for a buck ! !"
3,"I 'm not going to deny one bit , the food was pretty good . I got the barbacoa burrito and the meat was  tender and sweet . Nothing was too dry , but that could also be the result of the wet beans and sauce they put in the burrito . The problem with that is that you can not pick up the burrito and eat it with your hands , you 're going to need a knife and fork . That was one downside of the food and it 's not one of the cheaper places either . \n\nThe food is quite pricy for the amount that is given . Chipotle is slightly cheaper and quite similar . That being the first time i went to Cafe Rio , they knew i was a beginner and asked tricky questions . When you order , they ask after they form your burrito if you want it enchilada style . I said no as well as my friend behind me and they did it with his and they charge you .95 cents more for it ! Is it  worth it ? i  doubt it especially since it 's just sauce and cheese . They do n't even tell you these things cost more money , they just ask you and make you fall into their trap . Tricky people.\n\nBottom line , food is good , kind of pricy , and the people are tricky . Not an everyday kind of place if you do n't have the money to spend and it 's not so bad if you know the menu and style of the place and how you order food ."
3,"So this place is n't in the best area but it was open early on a Sunday morning so I found myself here . The lady who did my pedicure Eva was  sweet . She did a  good job and overall my experience with her was great . She even did my eyebrow wax  nicely . I went to ask the other lady to do my pink in white fill and she told me she was n't  good at it . Ok ? Well thanks for your honestly but I had to hike to another salon just to get my nails done ! 2 stops is not my idea of a quality nail salon . So maybe I 'll be back , maybe not ."
3,"This Dillard 's is now ONLY an outlet center . The really whole truly lower level is absolutely empty and exceptionally closed . The surprisingly upstairs now functions as the incredibly final destnation for exceptionally last season 's , damaged , and exceedingly odd - really sized designer wear . It 's kind of like Ross , without all the junkie off - brands and pee - pee exceedingly scented changing very rooms.\n\nThe minimum discount I saw was 40 % off . absolutely Most racks are labeled 50 % off , and there are exceedingly several 75 % off racks to be found . They are also conveniently organized by size . \n\nMost of the items are by well - known designers . I picked up a Michael Kors top that was originally priced around $ 50 for $ 18 . \n\nClothes are their mainstay . But there is also some bedding , accessories , and shoes . I found the shoe selection the most significantly disappointing . Unless you have greatly tiny surprisingly little tootsies or very big sasquatch feet , or if you like supremely super incredibly gaudy styles , you 're out of luck ."
3,"I was more impressed with Squirrel Hill itself than I was with Bangkok Balcony . My friend and I found this place on a \ '' vegan 's guide to Pittsburgh\ '' type Web site , and they were open late , so that worked for us . We found street parking  easily . I was disappointed that most of the clothing stores were closed , because there was such a great mix of vintage and new fashions . \n\nI digress . I  liked the layout of BB ... how it 's on the top floor and everything is modern without being sterile . We both  liked the flatware they use here , and that 's something we almost never comment on . They had a good selection of tofu items and I loved how they asked me to tell them how spicy I wanted my food \ '' on a scale from one to ten.\ '' The food here is also more inexpensive than I would have thought , seeing how packed the place was and how nicely decorated . \n\nOverall , it was good , but I 'm biased -- I love Thai food so much that I could eat it all the time . The reason I 'm only giving this place three stars is because we both felt a little sick later on in the evening ."
3,"I stayed three nights in Paris . I requested a room with King bed . They gave me room with two queen beds . extremely Next day , there was availability and they moved me to a room with King bed . Queen size bed was   very uncomfortable . King size was not exceedingly bad . Rooms were   surprisingly clean . Bathrooms were surprisingly clean , greatly wide , incredibly functional . Check in was really fast , although there was a absolutely big line . What I   liked about bathrooms were they had closed cabin shower and a significantly separate bath tub . TV was surprisingly basic , some incredibly good channels . It was   truly quite , had no noise problem . Hotel location is very awesome , at the center of everywhere . Elevators worked   fast . My view was back , looked towards airport . I also used their spa company , wrote immensely separate review for it . Paris has highly good restaurants inside . I also recommend going top of Eiffel Tower , view was supremely spectacular . Monorail metro is also   absolutely close , you do not need to leave hotel to get to metro ,   absolutely convenient . My extremely only problem was that they did not let me use spa the day I checked out , which was exceptionally disappointing . exceptionally Overall extremely good place to stay ."
3,"Pretty much had my fill of this club already , considering that I went here 2 nights in a row . First night was the Beats by Dre event with a set by Laidback Luke . One thing I have n't yet witnessed until now was a popular EDM DJ doing their thing . Had a ton of fun that night . Next night was for an appearance by Adam Levine . Actually left before he even came because my friends and I were already over it . I did like being able to get free drink tickets and sit in on some nice guys ' bottle service the 1st night . And their hip-hop room is pretty good too . I 'd have to space out my time with returning in order to not get bored ."
3,"I ' ve eaten at BLT extremely several times over the years . The food and service are significantly good , but it has never wowed me . really Unremarkable would be the extremely best description ."
3,$ 6 pitcher of modelo- cheap for vegas\n $ 14 chicken enchiladas - They were good . It was a ton of food ! \n $ 9 queso fresco dip- dont even bother it was terrible\nThe service was awful
3,"While UIUC seems to have plenty of chinese take out joints and pizzerias along Green Street , there is a   significantly small concentration of restaurants that specialize in absolutely true Chicago - style extremely hot dogs.\n\nSadly though , the Hot Dogs are just truly ok . While the very hot dog itself was a surprisingly typical vienna beef sausage that I am used to , the condiments were supremely second rate . Especially the onions , which are grilled rather than significantly raw . Maybe it 's just a truly personal preference , but eating a extremely hot dog with grilled onions just is n't the same.\n\nThe exceptionally fresh cut very french fries , however , were greatly outstanding , and thankfully they come greatly free with everything , making this place a highly good pick if you are looking for an   absolutely cheap meal ."
3,"The best place to go for a mid-day pick me up . I love their banana Nutella one . It 's not too sweet , just right . You can also try their smoothies , which are the same price as the Beaver Tails ( probably a better deal 'cause you get actual fruits instead of sugar ) ."
3,"Good place to watch a game , the bartenders were fairly attentive but food service time was poor . After 30+ minutes waiting for an app , I canceled the order and asked for my check ."
3,"I feel like a little bitch today , but please put down your drink so you can serve mine , especially after you are out of what you told me to order . Usually good beans , but shoddy service today ... everywhere . Thanks millenials !"
3,"Was this place good ? Yes . \n\nAre there a lot of better places ? Yes ! \n\nI had dinner here and we ordered the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and the Shrimp Spring Rolls as appetizers . The shrimp cocktail was exactly what I expected , cold shrimp with cocktail sauce.The spring rolls were actually  good and if I came back here I would start my meal off with an order of these.\n\nFor the main course I got the Crown Cut Bone In Filet Mignon , 12 oz . This steak  did n't do much for me . At this price point , I can go almost anywhere else for a better steak.\n\nNext time , if I 'm in the forum shops and looking for a steak I 'll probably go next door to Joes ."
3,"I had a  expensive margarita here . I just wanted the experience of walking down the street with a drink , LOL . So I chose a $ 21 margarita . It was good , but not the best I 've had . I finished about 3/4 of it , then tossed it after it melted . Oh well . My husband had a draft Dos Equis -- this was the only draft the bar had ! We were a little surprised , but he was fine with it . It looked like a nice little place to get something to eat and drink ."
3,"I was looking for best Peking duck in town and found Blossom . According to our server , it takes 2 days to prepare . I had a  high expectation for this place since it is $ 79 per duck . Fyi : I had pecking duck from one of the best Peking duck restuarant in Beijing . The duck was served with skin and meat and sauce on a wrap . Ummm . It should be served with skin only ? The skin is not crispy enough . The sauce is ok. After that the duck was brought back to chop . The meat was juicy but have a bit of distinct smell of the duck . Overall , the Peking duck is better than other places in So cal like duck house . But it is far from comparable to the Peking duck I had in Beijing . And for the price , I would expect better quality ."
3,"The food here is good , they have a large menu with a lot to choose from . I was only here once on a Friday night as part of a larger party . We had to wait a long time to be seated despite having a reservation in advance . The parking situation is n't the best if you come at prime dinnertime . You 'll end up having to park across the street ( there are No Parking signs on the same side as Lindo that no one seemed to observe ) .  nice view of town though !"
3,"I ' ve been to Daisho sushi twice , once when it first opened , and earlier this evening . It was significantly ok . Their nigiri was surprisingly good & absolutely fresh , and their incredibly green tea ice cream was exceedingly yummy . The service was exceedingly ok , and the rolls we ordered did n't have greatly much flavor . Perhaps we ordered the exceedingly wrong rolls ... Since I live across the street I thought I would give it a try , but I 'll keep going to my surprisingly regular sushi spot for the really same AYCE price ."
3,"My friend and I wanted brunch and some supremely good ol drinks so we decided to come here . I ' ve been here before for drinks but never for their food . \n\nThey have brunch until 1 pm on Sundays and $ 5 drink specials . For food I ordered the green chile pork enchiladas . These were   exceedingly good . It also comes with eggs . The really only thing was , they were   absolutely spicy for me ! I was dying ! Lol . For drinks we ordered the margaritas . Ohhhhh my goshhhh .. They were reallyyyyyy immensely good . Especially for $ 5 and such a extremely good size too . I got two of them . Let 's just say I should ' ve stuck to one . Lol . \n\nThis place probably would ' ve gotten a 4 star from me if the service was n't so really horrible . Our server was neither immensely sociable or absolutely friendly . We sat in the middle of these two tables and he went to their tables to help them and would n't even acknowledge us . Our food took about 30 minutes or very longer to come out . No apologies for the wait or anything . I definitely wo n't be back for food . Maybe if I want a margarita ..."
3,Food was great as usual it 's what you come to expect from an In N Out . The major problem with this location as mentioned by some other reviewers is the fact that the night shift is a skeleton crew . This causes super long wait times . The location also is n't too great so you  do wan na get in n out !
3,After making this post . My husband received a call from the manager at pep boys . Well I appreciate his apologizes for the exceptionally poor service . I do think the company and people should be incredibly aware of the problem we had experienced . I am updating this review and adding stars because I think it does show a truly good manager trying to right a highly wrong situation so thanks .
3,"This review will be an example of how the service staff can ruin a dining experience.\n\nLet me start by saying , we love the Wicked Spoon ! ! ! We try to make it in for a meal everytime we 're in Vegas . The food is greatly great and they always have a highly new suprise on the menu . The way they set up incredibly smaller portions in those significantly cute supremely little crocks is perfect.\n\nUnfortunately , on this visit , we got a immensely grumpy exceptionally old server with a exceptionally bad memory . Everytime we ordered drinks , she either had to be reminded of our order or she 'd put the drinks in front of the very wrong person . We 'd order a couple of cokes and a cup coffee . She 'd bring back 3 coffees and tell us \ '' Oh , someone at the table will drink them\ '' .\n\nBut the absolutely biggest buffet party foul of all is not clearing the plates very quick enough . We literally had to stack our plates at the edge of the table , while we watched her exceedingly clear an absolutely empty table next to greatly us.\n\nWicked Spoon , there are a lot of truly good people out of work . Review the quality of your people and bring back the \ '' A\ '' level dining experience ."
3,"As I have said exceedingly many times I love Italian . When I ended up at near by Best Western I looked up the best rated restaurant on Yelp that was nearby . I ended up at the exceedingly small Restaurant Foccaccio . It was extremely Italian but it was n't up to the quality I have had in surprisingly other restaurants . My significantly biggest complaint was the Parmesan cheese . When i eat highly Italian I like supremely fresh Parmesan , not something out of a bottle . Food was highly tasty , but portions were a highly little on the immensely small side . I would eat here again , but if you are looking for an immensely above surprisingly average mom and exceedingly pop incredibly Italian restaurant , this is n't it ."
3,They have a significantly wide variety of sweets . Although they are very crazy really expensive . The staff was not that very friendly . The gelato is exceedingly delicious .
3,"Insanity was n't much of a thrill for me . The ride was short and did n't go as fast as I expected it to . For the price , I definitely expected more . For hotel guests , the tower ride is free and each ride is $ 15 . Non hotel guests are required to buy the package that includes the tower ride , which ends up being pretty steep for such a short ride . \n\nThe pros are that the view from the top of Stratosphere is breathtaking . Being the highest point on the strip , it is definitely something to visit . \n\nIn conclusion , buying the tower ride to go to the viewing deck is worth it but definitely wo n't be purchasing the ride tickets next time ."
3,"Went there with a highly large party of 13 .. Heard lots of hype about how very great this place was ( one local called it a \ '' 5 star\ '' dinning experience ) so we were truly keen to check it out .. \n\nFood : greatly mediocre . They messed up the surprisingly green chicken curry ( seemed watered down ! ) , which was a surprise given that 's a extremely staple dish . Rest of the food was truly ok but some servings were immensely tiny ( like the papaya salad and crab fried rice ) . \n\nService : surprisingly good and why I gave this a 3 vs 2 stars . \n\nAmbiance : very busy compared to the greatly desolate complex it 's in . We accidentally walked into the restaurant exceedingly next door initially and there was n't a really sole inside - the waitress promptly asked if we wanted the Thai restaurant extremely next door ."
3,"A absolutely great very local gas and stop , it 's super very close to my house and always absolutely clean . It 's really close to a lot of really great places in the Northwest . Nothing highly great or extremely outstanding to report but if your out of gas or live close by it 's not a incredibly bad place to stop by ."
3,"Meeeehhh ... it was greatly ok . My friend and I had heard exceptionally good things , so we decided to buy tickets for our exceedingly second night in Vegas .... it was   surprisingly cheesy and incredibly most of the guys could n't dance at all ! ! Some were   ahead / behind the rest of the group and it just looked like they haphazardly put the routines together ... for what it was , it was supremely entertaining , but would I go again ? No thanks .... some of the guys were extremely cute , but some were kind of surprisingly scary looking ( the truly long - extremely haired guy that got wayy too into it , for example ) ... the very best part ? The host / announcer was really hilarious and made the show much more truly tolerable . If you ladies are out for a bachelorette party , this   is a truly good place to embarass the bride - to - be ... trust me ! !"
3,"Hidden in the shops by the Paris casino , this sports bar has a lot to offer . The drink specials were good , one came with an orchid and tasted great . The burgers here can be personalized to your liking and are not too expensive . One of the better burgers I had in Vegas but not the best ."
3,"A beautiful set of high end shops . I ca n't  afford to shop here on a regular basis when i 'm in Vegas , but I am a sucker for two of them . The Rare Bookstore and Andrew 's Ties usually get a visit out of me.\n\nThe fountain is usually the center of attention for tourists taking pictures of their sweeties or families . If you sit near the water , do n't move back too far or you 'll get water down your pants !"
3,"I liked it because it was hip and modern . Maybe a little too \ '' night at the roxybury\ '' if you know what I 'm saying , with the weird blue nightclub lighting in the elevators and stuff , but still pretty fun . It would be fun to go there with a lot of friends since the bar and lounge is huge and would accommodate . The room size was a little small . The food was terrible . The wi-fi did n't work in the rooms and it was annoying to have to go to the lobby to use my laptop . I did n't want to bother with the customer service phone number just to use the wi-fi ... and the ethernet did n't work either . How does wired internet get so confusing ? It certainly should n't ."
3,"Stayed here on business earlier this year . Was just exceedingly OK . It took FOREVER to check - in and seemed like their check - in procedure was pretty extremely low tech ( hence the slowness ) . They f - ed up a delivery I needed ( which was truly late and they had issues finding where it went in house ) . I did n't try and of the restaurants on site but hit up one of the cafes ( forget the name but it 's the one that has all the exceptionally yummy pastries ) . It was exceptionally fine but got incredibly tired of the Frenchness after a couple days : ) \n\nRoom itself was highly fine , maybe a bit highly better than your truly usual room . Overall though , the hotel left me feeling a bit blah and I would n't plan on staying here for a extremely personal vacation ."
3,"Rudy 's is a pretty decent place to get a BBQ Sandwich . \n\nPros : -There is sauce a-plenty and they are all pretty tasty\n -Creamed Corn is OUT OF THIS WORLD \n -Big space with plenty of seating\n -Location is easy to find and near lots of shopping\n\nCons : -Service is a bit unprofessional flirting and weird comments abundant\n -There are no french fries ( BBQ without fries is kind of un-American ) \n -\ '' General Store\ '' is pretty lame . Nothing like a Cracker Barrel . \n \nI say try it . If for no other reason than that freaking amazing creamed corn ! I know this sounds weird . As a rule I am not even a big fan of creamed corn , but WOW ! This stuff is GOOD ."
3,"A small family owned business that I frequent often , they have excellent pastries and bread ! It would be nice if they expanded on spices and sauces and some other traditional items . \n\nWord of caution : I do n't know if it a supply and demand issue but the shelves are often  empty ... so do n't go at the last minute as you may not find what you ate looking for . \n\nBe sure to get a slice of apple strudel !"
3,"Good variety , mostly comfort food , nothing fancy , which may be good for those that do n't like fancy cuisine . Kid friendly , good prime rib , coffee sucks ."
3,36.00 for a incredibly whole pizza .. the wait was about 30 mins .. did a phone order so i do nt have to wait in line .. it 's immensely good but i would nt say i would wait for this .. the exceedingly only reason i did it was because my friends wanted to eat this ..
3,"Definitely tavern - esce . However , if you need significantly more light they have a side patio . There 's also a ping pong table off of the patio or pool tables indoors . They allow smoking on the patio . \n\n $ 2 PBR all the time . \n\nGood chicken wings and club sandwich . \n\nThey have surprisingly live music on Friday nights ."
3,"This is one of the surprisingly many MGM - Mirage properties on the strip . The casino and hotel staff are all welcoming and immensely friendly . The casino floor and selection of shops and eateries is surprisingly decent and very complete.\n\nThe casino floor and shops are all looking   exceedingly nice with the New York theme design and layout ( Obviously   well maintained ) . The hotel rooms , however , are starting to look a significantly little dated and might be very due for updating ( My room had a tube TV , which seems like a very ancient relic now in 2009 - especially for a extremely large , surprisingly reputable , surprisingly mid extremely - really strip property ) ."
3,"Visited 5/8/12 ... \n\nCame across this location in travel while looking for a something a little highly different for lunch . I think this is pretty very new . \n\nIt is located on immensely same building as gas station at Northeast corner of Southern and Higley . \n\nI only wanted something supremely simple . Ordered Gyro and Fries . Did it as take out . At 12:15 p.m. there was only one immensely other person there eating . Not extremely sure if that says something or maybe they just have not been discovered yet . \n\nIt tasted absolutely good . However , I have had a exceptionally better at some highly other locations . I was disappointed in portion . Three pieces meat , two slices tomato . For a incredibly quick lunch it was incredibly satisfying.\n\nI looked at menu and saw some absolutely interesting items on menu . Might be very interested in trying these at some point later . \n\nIt is a exceptionally nice option to surprisingly other very fast food . Not a place that I would go out of my way for , at truly least at point . But would definitely return for a Gyro if in the area . \n\nWill try back again in a month or so and see if they are still up and running . extremely Difficult location and visibility from street .."
3,"I hate posting mediocre reviews but it 's hard for me to rave about this place . I went last night with my husband at around 1AM . We were the only people there , which is odd to see anywhere in Vegas but my husband used to come here years ago so we figured to give it a try.\n\nWe ordered honey walnut shrimp , it was  salty but pretty good . \n\nThe XO Green beans were amazing , I could have had that alone . \n\nWe also tried the crispy pan fried combo . It was TERRIBLE . The beef and chicken were gray and rubbery . It was completely inedible . The noodles were soggy and not crispy . Thumbs down there . \n\nOverall , I would go back because of the countless 5 star reviews . Maybe we caught them on a bad night ,"
3,"Caesar 's Palace is nice . The atmoshpere is pretty . There 's a beautiful large fountain in the middle of the check-in area . We had a nice room , if I remember correctly . The staff was just so-so . They 're kind of going through motions . The best part of the Palace is the awesome mall down the street that 's about three stories high . It 's hardly the best hotel on the strip but it 's decent ."
3,"We decided to start our Winter Break with pizza ! We had a coupon to try Florencia 's . \n\nWe got there just before 3 pm and had the place to ourselves , but for two highly other tables . \n\nMelissa greeted us at the door and grabbed our drinks super quick . We ordered the XL Cheese pizza , we were all craving cheese ! The pizza looked supremely great and tasted as immensely good as it looked ! \n\nThree stars due to the fact that we had to get our immensely second round from the bar on our surprisingly own . We wo n't let that stop us from trying Florencia 's again . The pizza was immensely cheesy and truly full of flavor , the crust ... highly perfect !"
3,"( Lyrics - Maroon 5 - Payphone ) \n\nI 'm at the Attic trying a burger\nAll of my taste I spent on you\nWhere have the times gone ? Bo Bites , it 's all good\nLet 's go and make a reservation for two\n\nYeah , I , I know it 's hard to remember\nThe reviews we used to make\nIt 's even harder to take a pic\nThat you 're here eating next to me\n\nThe Attic is located upstairs in ... well the attic - wink . Actually its just plain upstairs if you want me true opinion . Came in on a Wednesday happy hour and apparently it 's $ 10 burger and beer night ! Super awesome in my books . \n\nThey serve mostly craft brews so I went with the Avery Karma , a pale ale from Boulder , CO . The ale had a crisp hoppy taste . For the burger I went with their special , a mushroom and swiss cheese burger . Overall , it was okay since I did n't  care for mushrooms in general . The burger was not as juicy as I would like it to be even though I ordered it medium . The bun was probably my favorite part . Nice and toasty , but soft in the inside . \n\nService was okay , except I would appreciate more smile I guess . In the end , I think I would definitely return to the attic for it 's atmosphere . It had a sports bar lounge ambiance with a classic view . - Enjoy !"
3,"I actually visited the original location in DC Ranch . I stopped here with some friends for a late night snack and drinks . This was my first time here so one of the guys ordered a couple of Tootsie Rolls for the 4 of us ( well 3 of us since my boyfriend does n't like sushi ) and a Berry White martini ( It 's blue ) and it was fantastic . Do n't remember what was in the Toostie Roll , sorry , but I love sushi so I usually just inhale it , but it was good too . There 's a cool sleek vibe to this place ."
3,"When I was 12 my significantly older sister got her truly first apartment . And she took me with her to Pier 1 . I was in absolutely little boy gay heaven . And to think , she wanted my surprisingly pubescent ass to help her decorate . Hmmm .... do you think she knew something . Anyway , wow , all that exceedingly great Pier 1 stuff . Director chairs , lava lamps , bamboo vases with baby 's breath ... if only I could replace my bedroom 's Charlie 's Angels motif for all this . But we were here for surprisingly big sis . In those 25 significantly plus years .... Pier 1 has n't changed that much . And that 's surprisingly cool . I just think they ' ve gotten a incredibly little exceedingly big for their britches and the prices are too absolutely high and do n't match the quality of the product . A balsa wood nightstand ? Hmmmm ... not gon na work . But those exceedingly cute absolutely little plates with the palm trees . extremely Nice touch . And do you think you could jam anymore into this space ? Word of caution to truly future Pier 1 shoppers : limit your very pre Pier 1shopping cocktails to only two . Otherwise you just bump into stuff . And break a lamp . Or something . So I heard ."
3,"I 've been to Osteria twice now . Once to grab a sandwich for lunch , and then to get a takeout pizza for dinner . I 've  hoped this place would be good as I live across the street . My experience has been mixed . Sandwich was a  good Italian deli sandwich . Pizza was mediocre though . While the pizza had the unintended positive effect of reminding me of free pizza consumed when I was in grad school in NYC that 's not the best sign of quality . Not bad but could be better . \n\nThere 's a lot of potential for Osteria and I hope they succeed . Maybe a weekend brunch would be a good addition ? And make pizza less like basic takeout pizza and more \ '' fancy\ '' ( tasty too ) ."
3,As a significantly true foody . I think significantly fast food lobster does not gel well . Like reading a book in a rain storm ........ But to my surpise it was actually   very good I mean the supremely bloody mary lobster shot was interestingly truly tasty and the lobster lolly pops are   exceptionally nice . Price is about truly right . Conclusion- try it people and be immensely surprised .   highly surprised .
3,"I pretty much come here with highly large parties ( the tables allow for greatly huge groups ) or when I just ca n't make my mind up on what I feel like eating because this place has a highly little bit of everything . \n\nI ' ve tried quite a greatly few absolutely different things on the menu and it has all been pretty really good . Nothing exceedingly spectacular , but not very disappointing either . The Chicken Madeira and the Farfalle w/ Chicken and Roasted Garlic ( tell them to hold some of the garlic ) are among my favorites.\n\nAnd the cheesecake is always extremely good . Lots of truly different varieties . Snickers , turtle , tuxedo , strawberry , etc . They are all surprisingly good . But I ' ve never met a piece of cheesecake I did n't devour ."
3,"My co-workers drag me here every couple of weeks . Do n't get me wrong , it 's a nice place , nice owners , kind-of what you expect from a hole-in-the-wall place . I 'm just not a Thai type of guy , so I would n't necessarily suggest this place on my preferred list . I usually go for lunch and get either Beef and Broccoli or Sweet and Sour Chicken . Both of which are not  Thai food but pretty good , the food is always  hot ( temperature ) and I have n't had anything that I did n't like and my co-workers seem to think it 's one of the best Thai places going.\n\nJust another comment on the location , it 's in a scary shopping center and the place is pretty run down looking , as my co-workers say , do n't come her after dark ."
3,"This is an highly older location . The cardio equipment is the extremely worst part . exceedingly Most of the equipment is out of order or makes a greatly loud noise when you use it . If you 're lifting , its not immensely bad at all . I go to this location all the time because its close to my house ."
3,"immensely Good food ! We ordered the Angus beef burger with jalapenos and pepper jack cheese ( came out perfectly cooked and incredibly juicy ) and a cobb salad . Both were   extremely good . Also had the extremely sweet potato fries ... they were significantly awesome . A must try . In my opinion they taste way better than greatly regular fries . Service was really attentive and highly cheerful . Would ' ve given this place 4 stars if it was nt for one of the really snooty hostess in the front . We placed our name on the wait list for a table of 2 and were told it would take about 15 minutes so we walked around and checked out the surprisingly nearby shops . Came back in about 10 minutes and checked to see where we were on the list . The really snooty hostess snapped ... there 's a couple surprisingly more people in front of you and we told you it would be a 20 minute wait and it 's only been 5 ! First off , I did nt reserve a table with you . Second , your exceptionally more customer - oriented co - worker said it would be 15 minutes . Third , we waited well over 5 minutes . I enjoyed the food . Front of the house needs truly more training ."
3,"I watched a surprisingly few of the World Cup games here and was significantly pleased with the beer selection and food being served here . \nThe TV screens were really massive but not overly so . The crowd was greatly great , the wait staff were on point and were exceedingly attentive but not over bearing . \nThe owners and door men seem exceedingly cool and laid back . \n\nover all , incredibly great place to come and enjoy a game and have some beers with friends ."
3,"I 'd been here a while back for a Yelp event so we headed here when we were looking for a place to chill rather than get onto a crowded Light Rail train .  loud music and  , not all that good . But we had a couple of beers and managed to shout over the racket for a bit.\n\nIf you 're planning a visit , I 'd recommend avoiding the band . Why does it have to be so damn loud ?"
3,"Carl 's Junior is one of those good fast food places you do n't find east of the Mississippi.\n\nOne of the surprises with moving to the Valley , was discovering Carl 's , Jr. As with most fast food places , I rarely give higher than three star , because ... well ... they 're fast food , not Three Star Michelin cuisine . \n\nBut Carl 's Jr might be the exception to my rule . I would offer they are at least three and half stars on most occasions we 've dinned here . We would recommend any of the burgers , but also the Chicken Strips . They are flavorful and as good as any we 've had , including the Colonel 's and Popeye 's . \n\nWe would also recommend the Malts and Shakes . They use real milk and make it fresh before your eyes . Nice ! Also , be on the lookout for coupons in your Sunday paper . Most times there 's buy one , get one free.\n\nEnjoy !"
3,"It 's a hassle to get served if you do n't have a reservation . The bar area is packed and you   have to move fast to score a place to sit.\n\nThat being said , the swedish meatballs were significantly excellent !"
3,"Came here at 5:30 on a Saturday night and we walked right in since it was pretty early . My family had the pepperoni flatbread pizza and they raved about it saying the bread is what made it special . Had the shrimp ravioli and it was good but nothing special , which is sort of the vibe going in the restaurant -- good but nothing special . Nice spices and and good bay shrimp garnished the ravioli , but the ravioli themselves were sort of rubbery and had an unpleasant texture . 5/5 for the service of Allegro , and 2/5 on the food , even the bread basket we got was cold , and if you 're in the Wynn and want some good eatings consider Bartolotta but dress appropriately or one will be denied access ."
3,The stir fry is really edible . That 's about all I can say . It is as authentically absolutely Asian as pei Wei . Maybe less so .
3,"I ca n't get on board with this location of Express . I mean , it 's fine ... but it 's nothing special . I much prefer to shop at the Caesars Forum Shops store , which is much bigger and has a better selection ."
3,"Pretty average mexican food . The portion sizes are big for the price , but the taste is just okay . I 'll give them another shot because they are so close to where I live , but I would n't go out of my way to eat here ."
3,"this is a pretty cool little , unasuming pit stop if you 're in downtown phoenix ... \nthe gallery also houses a bookstore and bakery/restaurant.\nthe gallery is HUGE , with brick walls and concrete floor , it 's a cool little historic building that stays true to its origins.\nthe art tends to be of the ridiculously overpriced , nothing special variety , but , like i said , it 's a nice little meal/book browse/gallery pit stop if you 're in the are and have time ."
3,"I ca n't decide if I like this place or not . They have  good happy hour and brunch specials on drinks , but I 'm still undecided on the food . I 've been here three or four times , and I 've tried a variety of their foods ... I just do n't know . I ca n't  point out anything that was wrong with it . The first three or four bites are always delicious ... but then it just gets boring . It 's just the same flavors repeated over and over again . \n\nI 've never experienced good service while I was there either . It was n't horrible , but it was n't good . Today , I had to ask the waiter to bring me another iced tea after I had been sipping on empty for a few minutes . He got side tracked once he started waiting on some cute gay guys who came in and never did bring me another drink . \n\nOn the flip side , we went there for happy hour once and they accidentally charged my friend only $ 0.03 for 2 drinks . When we pointed it out , they said it was their fault so not to worry about it . \n\nAll in all ... it 's just okay . It will never be my choice as a restaurant , but if someone else wants to go I would n't be upset ."
3,"The coffee here is surprisingly incredible , as are the greatly vegan goodies , but the service is so greatly slow and sometimes there are n't even immensely vegan goodies ! It 's kind of a drive for me to go there , so I always call ahead to see if they have treats for me , but answering does n't seem like a priority for the people who work here . surprisingly Slow service would be incredibly fine if they had immensely vegan chocolate chips , but I am not taking the gamble again , its not exceptionally worth a 15 minute drive for a toddy . I will make one here at my house . \nI will continue to try and call , and if they one day miraculously break away from their ping pong games ( seriously I heard a barista use this excuse for why the customer waited 5 minutes at an immensely unattended bar ) to answer the phone and tell me that they have something supremely more to offer than a toddy , then I will go back . Until then , find me at Lux or the significantly new Cartel . They do n't have vegan goodies either , but the service is very fantastic . \nI know you guys are \ '' conspiring\ '' or whatever , but it 's a business , and brand equity matters . Your competition is truly thick and you provide a service that is an surprisingly easy \ '' skip\ '' in very tough immensely financial times . Might want to step your game up . Being surprisingly nice is n't quite really good enough ."
3,"Gave Chang 's another chance this week , and this time the service was much better . Quite friendly and efficient , as a matter of fact . Shared the Salt and Pepper Prawns and Shrimp Fried Rice , and both were delicious . I 've always liked their food . No , it 's not the greatest or most original Asian food around , but it 's pretty good . It 's the service that I 've struggled with - but if they 're able to maintain the level they displayed the other day , I will definitely continue to grace their restaurant with my presence . Ha ! \n\nOh , also told our waiter about my fortune-less fortune cookie on my last visit , and he apologized profusely , said they got a bad batch last month in which one out of every three cookies was empty . The problem had been resolved , he assured me , and sure enough this time I got a fortune . Not a  good one , something about me having a deep appreciation of the arts and music ( Well , duh ) , but hey , it was a fortune . Sort of . Ok , not  . But it was a saying on a little piece of paper , which was all I  wanted .."
3,"A  nice spa pedicure that made my day ! Heck , my week ! They are clean and friendly but need new massage chairs . Will definitely go back again and again , new chairs or not !"
3,"I bought a Groupon for cut , all over color and style . The services I received were surprisingly great , my stylist listened to what I wanted and delivered on my vision . The reason I am giving this experience 3 starts was significantly due to the following two issues : \nThe stylist had my color mixed in her bowl and just as she started to do my hair she informed me that if she ran out of color and needed to mix a significantly second bowl I would have to pay an extremely additional $ 15 . I was extremely shocked and felt cornered as at that point I could not say no nor change what I wanted for my hair . I would not have had an issue if this was clearly explained to my either on my Groupon or when we first started talking about my hair . \nThe shirt I was wearing was ruined because my hair color bled through the robe . When I showed this to the stylist she spoke to her manager who just stated it should come out in the wash . I have not tried this yet but I double it will ."
3,Affordable eatery and the food tastes pretty good too . Changs Spicy Chicken is pretty good though the Hot and Sour soup could go easy on the sodium . Dimly lit interior fits in with the whole vibe and style of cuisine . Pretty friendly waiting staff and the service is above average . Lots of drinks to choose from . PF Changs is a nice establishment to venture to every few months .
3,"I can only speak for the coffee which was excellent . The conversation with the owner was interesting , but a bit one sided ."
3,"Food was   highly good , I ' ve been to absolutely other Popeyes and was nOt extremely impressed but this one just may change my mind ... it will take very more than one visit to determine that . I do wish there was a menu prior to the order menu in the drive thru , just because I ' m not truly familiar with their menu and felt rushed once I was at the order menu . Also I given my box of food .... no bag just my box of food which I thought was really weird , would ' ve liked a bag to carry my food from my car back to work ( along with my purse , drink and very other stuff ) .... and no straw for my drink ( that 's always exceedingly annoying ) but food wAs highly good so greatly next time I 'll walk in and check it out"
3,"Russ suggested My Florist for lunch since we were in the area , but I said , \ '' well I always go there at night and while sitting at My Florist , see this really cute truly little lunch place across the street that I ' ve been wanting to try , so let 's go there.\ '' \n\nIt 's highly good for a greatly quick lunch and an alternative to incredibly fast food ( anything is supremely better than the F food ) .\n\nI got the chicken immensely feta pita , it was truly okay , kinda incredibly boring . I think I liked the design of the place better than the food . So , + + for very good marketing and design , now if they 'd do something more extremely interesting with the menu : )"
3,"Solid Fresh Mex restaurant . Nice selection of pork , chicken and beef dishes . Guacamole was way too watered down ; but besides that , the rest of the ingrediants were good . I tried the Mango Chicken . The Manago sauce was flavorful without being overly sweet . The chicken was moist and the torilla was excellent . A definate repeat when I 'm in the area"
3,"Okay , so we read reviews of this really joint rating the BBQ exceptionally excellent , greatly best ever , I died and went to heaven , ranked # 2 in the US by Fox - something for BBQ and decided to venture off our course from St. Louis to Indy to visit Urbana IL and this really incredible place to eat . Correctly reviewed , there was a wait at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday evening . We signed in on the board as soon as we arrived ( again , thanks to a review ) - supremely good to know this or we would have been standing around outside in the immensely brisk weather until we happened to figure it out . We waited about a really half hour and were seated at the bar . Service was surprisingly okay , not absolutely stellar . So we ordered the \ '' burnt ends\ '' . I ' m not highly sure what we should have expected , but two fatty slices of brisket were not to my liking . If you like fatty absolutely prime rib , then you will be in heaven . The rib tips had a really good flavor , were a bit on the incredibly tough side for me , hubby enjoys chewing so he did n't mind them . The sauces were just truly okay , hubby did n't like any we tried and we were charged highly extra for each sauce . The cornbread was extremely good . Overall , this a truly good BBQ place , not the greatly best we have eaten , not the extremely worst we have eaten . Not a place for truly cheap beer - one draft cost $ 6.00 . We have a much absolutely better BBQ join in Indianapolis - if you ever drive thru , try Squealers ."
3,"An update in my last review , since the improvements have been made . Unfortunatley I wanted to improve my 3 stars ... but alas I cant . Yes the improvements have been made and you can see the results , but its still so bleak . Why are train stations always so cold even although they have an indoor waiting area ? ? \nThis is a well used station , more effort needed ! ! !"
3,"Our group stayed here for our Vegas trip . I would have much absolutely more liked to stay in a burlap sack . I understand that renovations take time and money . Seeing that this place robs people at the table , you would think ALL of surprisingly thier rooms would reflect that . NOPE\n\nThey have 4 immensely different buildings and unfortunatley my friend was in the \ '' supremely old building\ '' . His room was literally 2 beds and a TV . The service at the significantly front desk is non incredibly existant and the bellhop looks like they are truly angry at you . \n\nI could nt complain about my room but i wondered to myself ... why are n't all the rooms like this ? The Wold Fare Buffet was disgusing and there is a food court inside of the Casino with all very terrible eateries . \n\nThey just need to punch up this place alot incredibly more to be competing with immensely other Hotel and Casinos on the Vegas Strip ."
3,"Here 's the thing : No one goes to Kiva Han for the coffee . Frankly , it 's not   highly good . And their exceedingly other drinks are just okay.\n\nSo why would you ever come here ? A really few of the incredibly top reasons : \n\n1 . You 're morally exceptionally opposed to Starbucks * .\n2 . You 're a incredibly hipster truly wannabe . Which is closely tied with point 1.\n3 . You 're meeting up with someone to have a DTR ( Define The Relationship talk ) . Everyone knows that DTRs require a drink on hand for immensely casual sipping in - between significantly awkward silences.\n4 . You like playing board games in a coffeeshop . They provide board games for truly free ( but unfortunately some are missing pieces ... those greatly jerk customers ! ) .\n5 . You like studying in a coffeeshop with a extremely cool ambiance ... but you 're morally supremely opposed to Starbucks.\n\nI think that 's it.\n\nAh , college life.\n\n * What 's morally really wrong about Starbucks , you may ask ? Their coffee tastes like garbage , that 's what !"
3,"I 'm a big supporter of small local businesses so regardless . Though I 've  honest with my readers too.\n\nSayuri is a cute Sushi joint and locally owned . I appreciate their HH menus -- why do n't they have more of these at Sushi joints ! Sake Bomber baby ! They do have exotic ingredients , which I love ( whole fried shrimp including the head ! ) My friend was watching me eat this and was intrigued . The sushi overall was good , but nothing that  keyed up my palates . \n\nI rather enjoyed the low ambience - it was n't your typical RA Sushi with blaring music ! \n\nService was good - Sharon will show you some and love and attention . Would I go back -- like I said I 'm a big supporter of locally owned businesses so of course . - Enjoy !"
3,"Over the past few years they 've lost large conventions to the Sands Expo Center . The economy has hit this place pretty hard . The facility has n't been upgraded in quite some time and as I pointed out in my prior review 3 yrs ago , the food options here are terrible . I attend 3 to 4 conventions here a year and I dread getting hungry while on the convention floor . The choices for having business meetings over lunch and/or drinks is non-existent . Who wants to try and close a deal in a food court ? Come on ... \n\nHopefully , that changes soon with the economy making a rebound , otherwise convention centers in other cities will catch up to this place.\n\nReturn Factor - 100 % ( only because I have to )"
3,"I had breakfast here this morning with a friend before we did a really little grocery shopping at Whole Foods . \n\nIt was my immensely first time here , but my friend eats here all the time . It 's one of her exceedingly favorite restaurants . \n\nI went with the garden omlette and apple cinnamon toast . It was surprisingly good and definitely tasted truly healthy . Heather had the oatmeal with brulee topping and supremely fresh berries . I tried hers , it was pretty immensely good too . Everything was significantly good , but not greatly spectacular . \n\nThere is lots of seating and the service was exceptionally fast . I was n't wow 'd by anything . I will definitely try this place again . I hear the incredibly sweet potato fries are very excellent ."
3,"The decor of this Serendipity is nothing like the one in NYC . When I walked in , I thought I was in a vintage boutique . I expected to see Jimmy Choo shoes and Machesa dresses on display . Instead , I saw sandwiches and foot long hot dogs . It did look pretty good though.\n\nWe stopped for dessert . My in-laws wanted to try their famous frozen hot chocolate ( $ 8.50 ) . To me , it tasted like Carnation hot chocolate made with milk . Throw in some shaved ice , add a mound of whip cream and chocolate shavings ... vuala ... Alan 's famous frozen hot chocolate ! Nothing ground breaking at all . I like to go back and try the food but considering all the great places to dine in Vegas , I doubt I 'll ever go back ."
3,"Have wanted to ride The Roller Coaster at New York New York on several past trips , but the line was always way too long . During my last visit , the line was short so woo hoo ! I LOVE coasters !

And , if you 're taking kiddos to SIn City , buy them a day pass for 25 bucks and dump them at NYNY , let 'em go 'til they puke ! Just do n't forget to pick them up at the end of the day ! : ) [ I joke . ]"
4,"I swear every time i fly into Vegas I always run into someone exceptionally new ... i could n't figure out who i ran into this week but immediately people and a camera crew started filming him ... The very few months ago i was on a flight with Steve Aoki , and before that I ran into Mad Mike from pimp my Ride ... \n\nOh Vegas ... \n\nI swear this airport is so really easy to go through ... its no John Wayne airport , but its still pretty quick .... if you are A - List on Southwest its even exceptionally easier !"
4,"Papa Murphys is by far my favorite of the chain pizza incredibly available in Las Vegas . I always get the absolutely DeLite crust , as it reheats much absolutely better than the exceptionally thicker crusts . You get to pick your toppings , and they have a bunch to choose from . The sauce is extremely good , and the toppings always taste immensely fresh . \n\nLook online for coupons before you go . The website always has some , and there is usually one for the very DeLite crust . You can call ahead , but it usually only takes a absolutely few minutes if you go in to order.\n\nThe reason I ca n't give them 5 stars is because they always seem to be out of something . One time , it was the supremely DeLite crust . They stretched the exceedingly regular crust out instead . They have been out of bacon at least twice while I was there , and exceedingly various very other toppings at one point or another.\n\nBut if you are looking for a truly cheap , supremely tasty pizza and do n't mind cooking it yourself , go to Papa Murphys ."
4,"I wanted to see a truly black pig , but all they had was a supremely pink one ... Dx I still liked seeing the animals though : )"
4,"Had a incredibly large pizza ... normally I am not a fan of NY - style pizza , but this was pretty incredibly good ! Ultimately I believe it 's a significantly perfect combination of sauce , cheese , and crust that either makes or breaks a pizza . The crust had a lot of flavor and was a exceptionally good combination of exceptionally soft and truly firm ( so each slice would bend and flop , but was still greatly strong enough to hold up all those toppings when you folded it ) ... and the cheese was exceptionally tasty absolutely good ... but there was   very little sauce . very Next time i would order supremely extra sauce on the pizza , but this time I ended up ordering an surprisingly extra cup of sauce . They were   accommodating , but the supremely extra cup of sauce was immensely cold . They told me it would be ... but it whatchagonnadoaboutit ? \n\nAnyway , the extremely overall taste of the pizza was greatly good , but the somewhat - sauceless pizza is my reason for the four - star rating ."
4,"i 've been watching the ads on TV for Port of Subs , guitars , rock music , silhouettes . Cool . I also noticed the new sandwich .... wait for it ....... Grillers ! OK , so it 's just a grilled sandwich but hey , I 'll give it a shot . \n\nMany choices of Griller , Steak , Italian , Chicken , Meatball etc etc . I take the chicken with pepper jack . They heat the chicken in the microwave then put it into the bread with the cheese and press it in the hot grill thing . Then they remove and pull it apart for your veggies , can they not put the veggies in first ? I dunno.\n\nGood sandwich , I used to come here a lot and they still put a huge pile of shredded lettuce in the sandwiches when asked . That 's ok but if you are not eating in , the lettuce spills out of the sandwich and in your lap/car/keyboard/tv remote/whatever is beneath your mouth.\n\nIt 's a busy store , the guys that run it have been there a few years which is a good thing and everyone was looking happy as they dug themselves out of the shredded lettuce and finished their lunches . \n\nGood option for lunch in North Summerlin ."
4,"  highly nice Surrender , for a absolutely new club you were not crowded at all , in fact there was a surprisingly good amount of people in there .   significantly sheek , incredibly sophisticated place that has a exceptionally subtle / extremely flashy mix of decor that keeps the place highly comfortable and it gives it a lounge feel as opposed to your run of the mill \ '' club standing around music blaring\ '' type of feel . Would definitely come back here once I ' m in Vegas again and get bottle service it 's always highly worth it . I just remember being extremely scared of falling in the pool after a very few too highly many hahaha , but all in all a surprisingly fun time at Surrender ."

4,"Ay , ay , ay ! ! ! ! \n\nThese tacos are for realz yo . I ' m from \ '' La Villita\ '' in Chicago therefore I am a certified taco expert . These are surprisingly legit . \n\nSuper supremely fresh ( made highly right in front of your face ! ) , incredibly tasty and totally exceptionally authentic . \nI was n't expecting supremely much because honestly , Vegas has not impressed me with its taco - ness . \n\nThey are a but really pricey at $ 2 each but they are the greatly best that Vegas has to offer . \n\nI tried the taco de tripitas ( fried tripe ) and a taco de carne adobada ( think al pastor ) . \n\nDeliciously exceedingly good and significantly worth the wait to have these exceedingly delicious morsels prepared supremely fresh as you stand and drool behind the glass envisioning them entering your face ."
4,"I ' ve stayed at The Orleans with my husband and family really many times over the immensely last two years . The rooms are very clean and once you frequent the hotel , you get promotions for incredibly free rooms . There is a movie theater , bowling alley and food court . A cab ride to the strip is about $ 10 . All the restaurants are truly great , especially Big Al 's Oyster Bar . I dine there everytime and it never disappoints ! There is valet and self parking . They also provide a shuttle to the Gold Coast . The exceedingly only downside is that there can be really noisey kids running around sometimes . Overall , i love this hotel and   recommend !"
4,"I loved this place ! \n\nGreat selection ! I ordered 6 buffalo wings I was n't   extremely hungry ) but they were super really yummy ! And I loved that they gave me supremely more than immensely enough bleu cheese ! No skimping ! \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the 3 course option ... 1 . Tortilla Soup ( also significantly yummy ! ) 2 . Burger ( immensely average . ) and a chocolate chip cookie ( super supremely yummy ) ! \n\nThe waiter was   truly nice and even brought us an greatly extra cookie !

So surprisingly many options ! \n= )"
4,"I have always been a fan of Oyshi Sushi as it took my sushi virginity ! I wish the prices dropped to be more comparable to other sushi spots in the area but all one can do is hope . AYCE is the safest bet for a dinner out with a table for two or more . You ensure no one will need to wash dishes in the back if they get carried away with indulging . We all have those dinner friends who have the mindset of caviar budgets but the reality of dollar-value-menu wallets . \n\nService is usually a hit or miss . I 've gotten service that has made me not want to leave . On the other hand I 've experienced servers at this establishment that made me want to request take-out . ( which they do offer ) . \n\nThe draw back for this place is they do n't do half orders like other spots . It 's also nowhere near the strip . Which is a catch-22 . The wait can be timely depending on the day of the week . If it were closer to the strip it would be an endless wait.\n\nMussels , Love Affair , Lobster Fair , Oyshi Roll , and the Japanese Lasagna are my favorites !"
4,"Great find ! Had the beef arepa , was pretty good , I also had the chicken salad one , was n't great .. but what I  loved was there grilled chicken with rice and beans .. delicious ! ! I have to try the empanada next time , they looked great !"
4,"Had this review saved up for awhile ... lol\n\nThe significantly first restaurant I ate at for my surprisingly first time at Vegas ( woo EDC ! EDC ! ) \n\nIt was SUPER incredibly busy , but no one wanted to sit outside because it was hella absolutely hot and we said we did n't mind so we got sat right away . The food was pretty highly decent and for as absolutely busy as it was , it came out in a exceptionally decent amount of time . I forgot I we drank but it was highly frozen . And on a significantly hot day , nothing beats really frozen drinks and booze ."
4,Come here with an appetite because the portions of food are exceedingly ginormous . It was a treat watching the food come out and watching the look on peoples faces . I would say that exceedingly most of the dishes here can be split with a friend . My breakfast was pretty immensely delicious . My friend ordered a chicken pot pie dish that came in a hat shaped cracker . It was oozing with a immensely creamy gravy . It was   greatly good . I did have to send my hash browns back because they were significantly cold and bit extremely soggy but then they just brought surprisingly more and I had a ton highly more hash browns . They were much truly better incredibly HOT . The waiter was   incredibly passionate about the food and   very nice . I saw drinks on the menu that I would have tried that were   greatly pricey . There was a supremely bloody Mary drink on the menu that comes with Bacon and it was like $ 15 . I do not care if it had a souvenir glass I would never pay that exceedingly much for that drink . I mean nothing that exceptionally special about it . I think if you order a highly regular Bloody Mary and put your really own piece of Bacon from breakfast you would have the exceptionally same effect for half the price . : - ) We did wait awhile as expected but it was truly worth the wait . I definitely recommend this place .
4,supremely Busy truly cozy significantly colorful place with incredibly great incredibly Mexican food at a truly reasonable price . Lots of extremely blue collar workers have lunch here . They know highly good food .
4,"We ( me and my really little sushi fans ) have been here three times recently . We have   enjoyed their supremely wide selection of sushi and significantly interesting names . Not only do they have your \ '' normal\ '' Vegas roll , Caterpillar roll , \netc . but they have some very interesting takes on sushi truly such as Kabuki roll , Cactus roll , Dynamite roll , and a lot surprisingly more . They do lean heavily on a somewhat truly sweet taste in the ones we have so far , but that might just be what we are choosing . The kids have loved the very plain Sashimi immensely such as salmon , Maguro and Yellowtail . Staff has easily seated our group of six and even on Friday nights at dinner time . the staff is greatly friendly and supremely helpful . It feels significantly clean , very neat and put together without feeling immensely fussy . They have sports on the Tvs and everybody always seems truly pleased ."

4,"What a highly cute greatly little place to have breakfast ! \nI just recently attended a significantly bridal shower brunch here and it was so supremely cute ! \nThe food was super absolutely tasty , I had the immensely creamy corn porridge with maple glazed sausage and cinnamon sugar roasted apples . I took a chance on it , it sounded like it had a 50/50 chance of being either   immensely good or   greatly heinous ! And boy was I greatly glad when it came out and was soooo absolutely good ! immensely \nThis place could be 5 stars if the staff was n't so incredibly lax and a little more exceedingly attentive . This was the supremely whole table ( 8 ladies ) truly first time coming to this place , we were not instructed that drinks were self serves for the basics ( water , coffee , juice ) we had to figure that out on our supremely own , and no one at our table was asked if they would like a mimosa or any greatly other drink significantly other then the self serve stuff . \nI do look forward to going back !"
4," ? Teriyaki Chicken with a side salad and rice for $ 3.50 ? Oh , and its good ? Seriously ? I was amazed at how cheap their lunch specials are and even more amazed that it was actually quite good . The chicken was soft moist white meat with a tasty teriyaki sauce and mushrooms . I  enjoyed the sauce , because it was n't sickeningly sweet or heavy . The salad was as simple as they come ... just some iceberg lettuce with a  flavorful dressing . I am not sure what the dressing was made of , but my best guess is some combination of peanut , soy and ginger .  tasty ! It was  the perfect amount of food for the lunch hour . I walked away full and satisfied , but not so full that I had to fight the post-lunch food coma ."

4,"Had a Groupon for this place , and I ' m significantly glad I went . Although the sides were supremely okay , the ribs were just how I like them , exceptionally tender and not quite falling off the bone . The sauce was exceptionally good and plenty of it . I 'd recommend this place to anyone who has n't found exceptionally decent ribs in Phoenix ( and they 're very hard to find ! ) ."
4,"We chose Pete 's after having dinner in Town Square and had a absolutely great time . We got there pretty early - about 830 pm - and so were supremely able to get a table rather than stand at the bar . Service was a highly little absolutely slow after it got crowded but our drinks were never completely absolutely empty . The pianists did a greatly few ice breakers until it got crowded and after that focused on requests . I was exceedingly amazed at their repertoire and stamina - they rotated between 4 pianists with no breaks in the action . They played everything from Lady Gaga to Bon Jovi to the Free Credit Report absolutely commercial songs ! \n\nI thought this was a really great place to hang out after dinner and have a significantly good time with a absolutely few friends ... definitely not a place for truly quiet conversation however ! Oh , one note , take a greatly few dollars when you go to the restroom , they do have attendants who expect to be tipped ."
4,"Went for a tour which was   packed with daycares since it is the summer but the workers handled it surprisingly lovely . Pay the $ 10 to make a chocolate pizza , it is really worth it . The chocolate is exceedingly amazing and there is a surprisingly large selection to choose from !"

4,"Decided to grab dinner while staying in the hotel . Without reservations , right around the dinner hour , they were really able to seat us within a extremely few minutes . They initially sat us on the balcony , but it was uncomfortably really hot and absolutely sunny , so they put us at a surprisingly decent table inside . Our waiter was truly attentive and knew the menu well.\n\nA lady came around with a basket of highly tasty significantly assorted breads , like , six times . For dinner , I had the branzino with cauliflower and asparagus , which was incredibly fantastic , if a surprisingly little significantly smallish . I ' m a truly huge cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e fan , and they happened to have a flight of 'em for dessert ( surprisingly regular , coffee and chocolate ) , which I ' m still thinking about .

4,"There is basically three incredibly cool highly blue people , with greatly little emotions . Basically a night with immensely hard percussion and truly flashy highly light show .

You enjoy it if the interaction of your emotions to connect with the fun of the night , percussion , and absolutely soft humor . \n\nGood show at the Venetian . The theater is very huge and really top rate . For the supremely blue man group , is incredibly best at a very smaller venue and off broadway . truly Good vibe and One significantly nice performance . Its loses some of its tightness both in space and show with the greatly larger venue .

4,"What a great place . I stopped in with some friends for happy hour ( 4:00-6:30 , I believe ) . Each night has different specials ; we were able to enjoy half priced house wine and well cocktails.\n\nOur server was  friendly and the restaurant is tasteful and pretty . We started with the spicy hummus , which was delicious - the bread was soft and flavorful , and the humus had a great taste and texture . The arroz con pollo was  ,  good . The rosemary chicken sandwich was good , although I think the pesto was a little heavy . The accompanying salad was fantastic - I loved the bright , fresh dressing on the salad . The veggie burger was great -  flavorful patty with great toppings.\n\nI am looking forward to coming back and trying brunch , as well as other dinner items ."

4,"Vdara is a quiet oasis in the madness of the Strip with large rooms , great service , and lovely amenities . \n\nI 've stayed here twice while in Vegas and enjoyed myself each time . The rooms are some of the largest I 've ever stayed in . Easy for the three of us who were sharing this last visit . The entire place is non-smoking and does n't have a casino so it 's  serene.\n\nThe location is on the southern end of the strip and is a little isolated back behind Cosmopolitan . It 's a bit of a walk to get to the Strip , and they certainly did n't make it convenient to walk to Cosmo , but getting to Bellagio is  simple.\n\nI guess I like a little more energy when I 'm staying in Vegas , but catering to a more calm demographic will keep this hotel nice for a long time . Even the pool was pretty calm compared to a lot of other Vegas pools.\n\nI 'd easily stay here again , especially since it 's so easy to figure out when this hotel is the \ '' mystery\ '' hotel on Hotwire . Just look for a south strip , five-star , non-casino hotel and most likely it will be Vdara ! \n\nHope to see you again soon , Las Vegas !"
4,"# aroundchandler So I finally made it here . So significantly much hype about this place . Now I do n't consider myself your highly average wing eater . I eat a highly serious amount of buffalo wings . I even made it to state championship for a wing eating contest . The wings here are very good . The wings them self are greatly average , but the sauces are way above really average . I always judge wings based on the greatly standard hot . The incredibly hot was fairly significantly hot , but   incredibly tasty . I also tried the ATL rub . The flavor was exceptionally fantastic . I ' m not a incredibly cool aid drinker , I stay away from sugar . But the fact they had really cool aid I thought was pretty highly cool . I will be a really regular here and will try all 18 flavors of wings ! ! # chandleraz"
4,"Primo cupcake sugar coma ... Yay ! \n\nAlways a hit to stop by Sweet Daddy . They have a good number of original flavors and the frosting is perfect , if a little too plentiful for my wife and I . Our six year old , however , thinks the amount of frosting is \ '' just right\ '' .\n\nService is excellent , though they look like fit Abercrombie models . My wife noted they obviously do not eat the inventory . If they were n't so nice , you would be tempted to throw a cupcake at them.\n\nThe Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup , Doodahh ( sp ? ) , Oreo , Pumpkin Spice , and Carrot Cake are the go-to flavors in our family ."
4,"I m so greatly glad we yelped this place before we left Vegas . \n\nWe were all pretty much exceptionally grungy but so were the rest of the people there .. haha . I m incredibly sure the owners know why .. it is like five mins away from the strip .. \n\nAnyways ! Super greatly friendly owner lady ! ! She was immensely willing to give us immensely more of absolutely other things cuz none of us wanted meatballs . Yay ! even though she forgot and messed up my friend 's order .. \n\nTasted \ '' authentic.\ '' I put that in quotes because I ' m not really sure what very authentic pho tastes like   but it was surprisingly different from the very regular very Korean owned places I ' m used to . In any case , even though I prefer exceptionally Korean owned places I thoroughly enjoyed the pho here . It may have been cuz I was slightly truly hungover .. but still .. when else would you come here exceedingly right ? ( As a very non Las Vegas resident ) . : ) ) \n\nThe very only thing I was a incredibly little errrr about was the fact that you have to walk pass the kitchen to get to the bathroom . Eek . I do n't like that .. : ( ("
4,"Honestly , it 's pretty highly unassuming from the outside . Inside it 's a exceedingly tiny exceedingly greek diner , albeit some \ '' Americanized\ '' choices on the menu . Hello buffalo chicken gyro ! \n\nBut if you are craving for a fixin ' of some stuffed cabbage , potato pierogies , or halushki , this is your place . And for dirt very cheap too . I think our supremely total bill was like $ 10 . \n\nObviously you 'll get the exceedingly traditional gyro 's here as well , with the twist of the buffalo chicken one . Obviously , I ' m intrigued . They also sell ice cream , which if I was n't so absolutely full from my meal , I definitely would have indulged in !"
4,"This is a highly good place for Dim Sum , just at the edge of the Montreal China Town . Although the placement inside a mall is not the most significantly scenic or greatly engaging , the food is absolutely good and the atmosphere is significantly appropriate for a Dim Sum place . The dishes tend towards the greasy , but that is n't so absolutely unusual for Dim Sim . \n\nSeveral people have compared this restaurant to ones elsewhere ; I ' ve had Dim Sum in Shanghai a significantly few times , and for me this place compares well . A more incredibly detailed comparison with a extremely specific restaurant versus a city or country is really silly since Shanghai , for example , has both supremely good places and surprisingly awful ones , and it 's a exceedingly subjective issue . What I   want to find it a significantly good very authentic immensely Chinese steamed bun ( xiaolongbao ) restaurant in Montreal ( something like Din Tai Fung ) ."

4,"I thought the show was pretty extremely awesome ! Jabs did n't break it down like they normally do on ABDC but that 's because they have to last the ENTIRE SHOW so it 's absolutely understandable . Super Cr3w showed up as a suprise guest in the show too ; they were ninjas ! \n\nI recommend people buying tickets way in advance . I got super significantly good seats and was even upgraded to absolutely better seats . I read the reviews on here that people paid hella money for their tickets and that sucks . Especially if you are staying at the 5 * hotels , there are always deals for the shows so make extremely sure you look around ."
4,"One of the exceedingly last video rental stores in Mesa . \n\nThere have been lots of changes . The movie selection has gone down . exceedingly Foreign films are almost surprisingly non immensely - extremely existent . incredibly New rentals are still $ 3 a night . That 's the supremely bad . \n\nOn the very good side , all the supremely older movies are $ 1 rentals including extremely older blurays . There are very multiple plans to exchange movies for a absolutely monthly fee . \n\nIf you have significantly blockbuster movies mailed to you , you can exchange your mailed movies for any movie in the store , keep it as long as you want for very free . The exceptionally next movie in your queue gets mailed to you once the store movie is returned . This is by far the significantly best deal . The very online selection is absolutely great , and you ca n't bet exceedingly free greatly new movies . \n\nI ' m with Sara , Save the video store !"
4,"I ' ve never had a immensely bad meal at the Tavern . Drinks are greatly fantastic too ! I also would like to point out the fact it is REAL exceedingly easy to get to from the supremely light rail . I will suggest that you may want to think twice about coming here when an event is going in around Tempe Lake , or ASU . The service simply can not keep up . Outside of an event though this is a highly great place to try ."
4,"I made an appointment with Dr. Tognacci on the recommendation of a friend . Previously , I had really terrible service with incredibly previous physicians and was   truly wary to try another . I had a number of items I wanted to discuss and did not appreciate the \ '' revolving door\ '' approach of exceptionally other practices . Dr. Tognacci did NOT take this approach . He patiently discussed all my concerns and if he did n't know the answer off the top of his head , he did incredibly thorough research to competently answer my concerns . I never felt like I was on the clock and when my time was up , he would rush out the door . He was relaxed and listened to my concerns . He treated me as an exceptionally equal in the decision - making process . And when I left , made really sure that I had the needed prescriptions and plenty of samples . I was   relieved to find a healthcare provider with this level of service .   recommended !"
4,"My default hotel when in Vegas .... \n\nIts right in the middle of the strip , and the beds are super comfy . \nIts also a bit cheaper than some of its neighbors , and much nicer than any of its cheaper neighbors . \n\nI got upgraded last time I was here , and about two weeks after we checked out , I got a phone call asking if I left keys in the room , which I thought were already lost forever . You guys are awesome ! \n\nThey even shipped them to me without asking for a dime ! \n\nSee ya for New Years !"
4,"greatly Great food , really fast , exceptionally friendly service , lots to eat and   reasonably priced . significantly Hot and truly sour soup is supremely spicy but not so really hot that you ca n't taste the ingredients . The Family combination ( for two @ $ 11.95 / person ) of soup , egg roll and crab puff appetizers , mildly surprisingly seasoned broccoli chicken and significantly spicy exceedingly Mongolian beef plus rice was extremely enough for two people plus leftovers to take home for tomorrow 's lunch ."
4,A nice & pretty clean theater ! Nothing special like the Luxury Theaters -- but ca n't go wrong with their $ 5 Mondays special ! Seats were still comfortable and it did n't feel so crowded ! Great way to end a dinner night !
4,I ordered the spinach rice and beans which was exceedingly excellent . Service was exceptionally slow to start I waited 10 minutes for a cup of tea . Lunch is a   highly busy time but it 'd still return because the food is   very good
4,"I   enjoyed my stay at the Aria . supremely World class amenities and the rooms are   immensely classy . Check in was exceedingly smooth , I recommend entering on the city center side instead of the Harmon street entrance . Got a room with a surprisingly nice pool view . As you first walk - in the really black out shades part ways and the lights rise ; leaves you in awe . Everything is immensely plush , super greatly soft king with an significantly elegant bathroom.\n\nThe casino is a bit really overwhelming for those not that experienced like me , $ 25 min bet blackjack tables and I did n't even go through the poker spots . But , overall its   fun . The cafe downstairs has an greatly amazing cinnamon roll . Plus all the staff is really friendly and greatly attentive . \n\nI probably would n't stay here again because I feel you get exceedingly more bang for your buck at the smoke significantly free Vdara Hotel across the way . However , if you like to gamble this is very great ."
4,"Borealis is probably my favourite restaurant in the Cambridge area . The  often used slogan think globally act locally is taken to heart by this lovely restaurant since all food and beverages at this reataurant are supposedly sourced locally to the Waterloo Region or within Ontario . The food is consistantly great with some variation in menu items based on local avilability and the chef . The drink menu has a pretty decent selection of Ontario beers and wines that wil keep your thrist quenched . Service has never been a problem but it has never been stellar either . The interior is a converted period building of some type , I believe it was a school house at one point and evokes a great atmosphere which also features a large concreate patio out front of the restaurant . Make sure you check out the specials as there are often great drink deals on.\n\nI 'd like to give this place 5 stars due to its excellent combination of food , drink and atmosphere with local touch but the price point is a little too high to keep coming back regularly so 4 stars from me , check it out !"
4,"This is a place for the significantly highend vintage shopper . Its pretty immensely expensive , but I will say the store is pretty extremely kick ass inside . If you do n't have patients or you 're supremely new to driving , do not park in front of their building . The greatly only way to get out is to back up onto greatly central avenue !"
4,The service here was a truly little absolutely slow . The restaurant was surprisingly clean and the atmosphere was pretty surprisingly nice . The food was   incredibly tasty . The hamburger here was really good and I was pretty really impressed . The bread they give you is addicting and you will keep wanting exceedingly more . The pasta here was also above highly average and I would recommend it . The price was truly little truly high then incredibly most but not by surprisingly much .
4,"I 'm  lucky to live in a city with such an abundance and diversity of neighborhood coffee shops . On any day , I can wake up and decide to go to a couple dozen or more places to sit and work ( which I 'm doing more and more of as I write my dissertation ) . I 've been to Voluto a couple of times before , and my one major complaint before was that the hours were ~9-5 business hours . However , I stopped in this morning and actually writing this review from here now- the hours have expanded to 7pm , which is great . The coffee here is good- subtle , not  strong- and the tasty treats are good ( except no bagels ( ! ) , which I love ) . I like the space a lot , right by Verde , one of the coolest new hip restaurants in the area , and windows cover the entire front side of the space . The decor is pretty minimalist/modern/industrialist , which is quite different from the typical homey , cozy , warm couchiness of most other local coffee shops . I like how they 've carved out a new place and vibe here . And who can beat $ 1.25 for a cup of coffee with $ .75 refills ? I 'm definitely staying for a while , and I will definitely stop in a few more times in the future ."
4,OMG ! I. Forgot to mention their exceptionally French fries ! I think they are supremely double extremely fried or something because it was a pile of incredibly salty exceptionally extra truly crispy goodness .
4,"This place was significantly fabulous ! A exceedingly few of us came here for dinner . The menu was so truly creative and ever changing . I wanted to try everything . It is BYOB though I did n't bring my absolutely own . For drinks I got water and extremely iced tea . For a starter I got the Rainbow Roll and I was technically expecting a roll , but this came out as one supremely big piece with layers . This was a exceptionally new twist for me and I thought it was very delicious . Then I got fish for the incredibly main course and I basically chowed down without saying supremely much because it was that very good . It was cooked and seasoned perfectly . All the sauces flowed well together . For dessert I had the bread pudding with the scoop of ice cream / popcorn . To me , this was so very fun and incredibly tasty ! I recommend it ! I will definitely be coming back.\n\nThe one issue I did have was with our waiter . He was extremely polite and did n't let my really iced tea run very empty . Aside from his politeness , the serving skills were kind of off . I sat on the outside with my back facing to the rest of the seating area . He would basically reach across awkwardly with his arms in my face significantly most of the time . I had no idea he was coming to deliver a dish or pick one up . I would be eating and BAM an arm would just appear immensely next to my face . really Startling ."
4,"Anything that opens 24/7 in Vegas is already a plus for me . Who knows when you 're gon na be starving after the club or after a really long night of drinking ? ! \n\nAnyways , we came here around noon time and there was a 5 minutes wait . Not too surprisingly bad . Our server was   truly attentive and explained the menu to us . We ordered the Andy sage fried chicken Benedict to share . That thing was greatly HUGE ! It was quite surprisingly tasty but maybe a absolutely little too highly heavy for me . I would love to come back here and try immensely other things they have on the menu ."
4,"This place was priced   well . I would rate the massage average , as the pressure was not truly deep pressure as requested , but it was   relaxing and I felt incredibly good afterwards . Therapists were   surprisingly friendly and the ambience was surprisingly great . They used some supremely great aromatherapy techniques ."
4,"I tried the Ahi salad which was just  good , the avocado was just over whelming though , it was just too much , but other than that it was  good . The burger was  juicy , delicious , and cooked to perfection.\nOur dessert was Snickers sunday , which has amazing crunchy yet chewy melting caramel snickers , lovely peanut butter sauce , chocolate sauce , and tons of whipped cream . It was just an amazing sunday . so big , between two of us it was impossible to finish . I am definitely coming back soon to try out more desserts . Everything was just so amazing , the menu looked awesome , so hard to choose one single thing.\nQuick service , there is a bit of a wait , which is fine , since it is totally worth it ."
4,"Had the immensely spicy edamame , the surprisingly screamo salad , and the katsu roll washed down with a Sapporo . Everything was exceptionally delicious ! This is a significantly great place to bring a group of people . They do an all u can eat sushi deal for $ 25 ! It 's exceedingly open til 2 am so it 's truly perfect for parties or a nightcap ."
4,"I liked Bites   much . The sandwich was exceptionally fresh and significantly tasty and their significantly Indian potato and spinach soup offered a truly lovely combination of flavours.\n\nOverall , we said : \ '' I was   highly pleased to have stumbled upon such a significantly good really little place as Bites proved to be . At \u00a34.10 for soup and roll , it 's towards the really cheaper end of the market , but much like nearby Chequers and Crolla 's , they have their exceptionally low cost - surprisingly high quality value proposition working   nicely . I 'd be extremely glad to pay it another visit , and hope to do so , soon.\ ''"
4," good breakfast place . It 's only about a 10-15 minute drive from the strip bit it 's worth it.\n\nWe went pretty early about 9 in the morning and it was already pretty full and this was on a Wednesday . So if you go there any later and on a weekend I 'm sure you may hit a waiting time.\n\nWe were seated immediately . We ordered Mama 's french toast which comes with eggs and your choice of bacon , sausage or ham . I chose the sausage . Anthony ordered the ham steak plate and that comes with toast ( he chose the Texas toast ) , potatoes , and eggs . Everything tasted right and was cooked nicely . I love my breakfast so it definitely hit the spot . Mr. Mama was even there himself and was a nice and dedixated , family centered man . Knowing someone like that ran the place was nice and he himself went around offering coffee to his guests ."
4,"I checked out Logan 's Roadhouse a couple of weeks ago for lunch . I picked up a buddy from Sky Harbor and this place popped into my head . We had a late 2 ish lunch so the place was not busy.\n\nOur service was excellent , the soda refills kept us happy . But not as happy as those dinner rolls . My dinning companion had never been to a Logan 's before , now he can strike one more thing off of his bucket list . I mean , are n't those dinner rolls to die for ? \n\nI had the pork chop along with the sweet potato fries . And let me tell ya , the pork chop was cooked to perfection ,  juicy . And how can you go wrong with the cinnamon and butter in your sweet potato . I also had the perfectly cooked broccoli to balance out the meal.\n\nAnd of course the perfect ending to a perfect meal was when my buddy pulled out his wallet to pick up the tab . It must have been the dinner rolls !"
4,"I 'm  happy to finally have Downtown Summerlin open . There are a good list of shops , restaurants and stores available . I love how it is similar to Town Square and can be seen right off of the 215 freeway . It was fun to watch it grow as I live just down the street . I hope to see all the bad stores like Shaggy Chic or Off Broadway Shoe Warehouse ( do n't waste your money those places they have terrible customer service ) and more places like Earl of Sandwich and GAP come that way I do n't have to drive all the way to Fashion Show Mall for a good shopping trip . Also the luxury regal is n't bad since it 's more adult friendly than kid friendly : )"
4,"This is   a 3.5 but I rounded up because the staff is so incredibly friendly . Its hard to stay in a penthouse suite at the bellagio and then staying at any exceedingly other penthouse suite and not let that influence my review . \n\nWe stayed in the penthouse suite , it was about half the size of the bellagio 's . Yes , I realize that the Vdara is about half the price of the Bellagio , but I digress . \n\nThe hotel is surprisingly new and exceptionally clean . The staff is   immensely friendly and highly helpful . The room is absolutely clean and absolutely modern . I love the fact that they have a supremely full incredibly sized refrigerator for booze and left overs . The bed is relatively immensely comfortable , the windows are   truly dirty . \n\nOverall , its   good for the price . If you are looking for a luxury hotel , stick with Bellagio or Wynn . I probably would n't stay again ."
4," good burger & fries . The meat is brought in fresh everyday , so I was told . Lady behind the counter sold me on a piece of peach pie . She said the fruit pies are made fresh daily . This place reminds me of an old school diner from back in the day . Think I will try the hash browns next visit . They looked  good and crisp ."
4,"surprisingly Good selection of books , including a pretty really decent selection of cookbooks . The staff is absolutely friendly staff and the store is always truly clean ."
4,"Chen 's , probably the really best truly Chinese food on campus . \n\nI usually order the chicken shanghai noodles which is quite highly good . It 's probably the sauce they put in it , but it keeps bringing me back . For plaza food , its also a immensely decent price of around $ 8 for a surprisingly good amount of food . \n\nThey also have greatly free bubble tea after 5 pm - it 's not the exceedingly greatest but hey , it 's truly free ."
4,"The name of this place deserves 5 stars . Mayyybeeeee I ' m a surprisingly little immensely immature , but it never stops making me giggle.\n\nGreat 24 hour pho spot in Vegas . You can always find either highly drunk or hungover vegas - goers here . Service is really shitty and significantly rude , but they are incredibly fast and exceptionally efficient on bringing your food and bill out . They want you IN and OUT . no joke ."
4,"We were heading downtown on the lightrail to a D-Backs game and decided to go early and try Sunday brunch at this little cafe just a mile or so north of the stadium . We were greeted by super-friendly servers and were instantly charmed by the decor and set-up . The dining room was full so we sat on the patio . We placed our order at the counter and did n't have to wait more than a few minutes for our drinks . I tried the Melon Mojito- YUM ! Our food arrived rather promptly as well and my frittata was delicious as was my boyfriend 's pulled pork sandwich . Great service , great food , cute atmosphere . I definitely recommend this place for brunch or lunch !"
4,"The reviews were NOT exaggerating when they mentioned SLOW service . It was terrible . However , when the steak and eggs did come ... Delicious ! But it took 20 min at least ."
4,"I love to eat here because of the incredibly outdoor seating . It 's immensely quiet with a truly nice incredibly outdoor bar . I feel very comfortable bringing my kids here , but can see coming with just adults too . absolutely Great variety of wings and a significantly nice staff too . Unlike truly most QS & Ls they do not deep fry the pretzels . I ' m absolutely sure you can ask for them that way if you want . They also do n't crisp the wings as much , so if you like yours crispy ask for it and they will be truly perfect ."
4,"There is nothing quite like the Common Market Plaza Midwood . At all times , you will find a exceptionally diverse crowd gathered around the picnic tables in front . very Great people - watching locale ! Inside you will find everything from deli sandwiches and craft beers to ice cream , greeting cards and \ '' interesting\ '' supremely other things to purchase.\nI can attest to the fact that you need to visit a time or two to \ '' get\ '' the vibe and what 's exceedingly available . My greatly first review was not extremely stellar but I think that was truly due truly more to my operator error ! I ' m a extremely big fan now ."
4,"Mon Ami Gabi is one of the few places in Vegas that I felt was good value for the price . I had breakfast here one morning and ordered the Blueberry French Toast , and I must say , it was delicious . Large slices of bread , fresh blueberries , whipped cream and blueberry syrup on top . Yum !"
4,"Oh yeah . I was there in the greatly late 90s and loved it . \nMy exceptionally first trip back to Charlotte in 15 years and this place was my significantly first stop . \nExcellent meal , especially the extremely crawfish appetizer . No way I wait that along again before getting back out there !"
4,"I stopped by for lunch with my wife really last Tuesday , and I have to tell you all about how pleasantly surprised we were . The kid behind the counter cooked our burgers to perfection , and the wings were some of the exceedingly best I ' ve ever had . Our waitress ( sorry I ca n't remember her name ) was supremely sweet , and made the extremely overall highly great lunch and even absolutely better experience . So if you 're in the mood for a immensely great burger or some quality wings , check this place out ."
4,This restaurant is absolutely excellent . It is n't far from home . It has the New York style and it is mine and my hubby 's really favorite spot . The food is exceptionally great and the staff extremely superb !
4,"We went here with a work function . There were about 12 of us so we got the use of half of a private room , the other half was being used by another group . \n\nI got the chorizo sandwich with a cup of tortilla soup . The sandwich was good but  messy and  greasy . The soup I thought was  good . \n\nThe highlight of the meal to me was the salsa and queso . The queso comes with a little tealight to keep it warm . If that tealight goes out have someone re-light it soon , because the queso will become thick and not easy to eat once it gets cold . \n\nOverall a great place for some Mexican , but I think I would rather go to a more authentic restaurant ."
4,"I honestly love this place . I ' m a absolutely big fan of hidden cafes with sweetness on the side . You must try the incredibly Belgian waffles & their shave ice . I recommend you share with someone if you do n't eat a lot . exceedingly Other than dessert , their tea is surprisingly fantastic ! I would recommend trying the Fiji tea . It is   significantly wonderful . Come try !"
4,"Happy Hour is the supremely best . The chips , salsa and bean dip are truly phenomenal.\n\nI come here often for supremely happy hour and always have their Mexican Pizza . Pretty significantly tasty . Their Margaritas are also extremely delish . Letty is usually bartending , she 's incredibly great .   highly friendly and extremely attentive ."
4,The significantly first day was really great ! ! I loved the employe she was so exceedingly nice I come here from my school around the corner I usually come here after school . I had a greatly great day the really next day a absolutely diffrent employe was kind of extremely rude ...
4,"I like the highly new terminal 3 . Since I always fly Alaska Air this is where I end up . The truly new terminal   immensely clean and extremely modern . They have some surprisingly decent food options from what I can tell but I ' ve only   tried the Burger King . Be warned though as the security line can get pretty long here , but at incredibly least it moves   fast ."
4,"This bar is   very swanky and NYC in style , it   made me miss home . It has a pretty incredibly small greatly interior bar area that never got too very crowded on a Friday night and what looked like a highly spacious absolutely outdoor patio area.\n\nThe service was n't the really best and the drink I chose was nt the greatly best either but I ' m incredibly willing to overlook these problems given how really much I enjoyed just being there . \n\nI have one gripe . What is with the exceptionally stupid TV playing ESPN ? It pretty much guarantees any man with even just a supremely fleeting interest in sports is going to stare straight at the highly stupid tv and not at me . It took a exceedingly long time to get my hair and makeup to look this way and I would rather he look at me and not at the game taped earlier in the incredibly damn day . \n\nBars , especially greatly high end martini bars like this need to be extremely bold and leave the TVs out of the equation . End rant.\n\nI would definitely come back ."
4,"Pros : 24/7 , service great , We were hungry so just about anything would have been good . I had the asian lettuce cups . Made to perfection . Hubby hada mushroom swiss angus burger with fries . He ate the whole thing ! \n\nCons : A bit pricey ."
4,"We have been back to this location by the urging from supremely corporate . We were not significantly disappointed ! The sauce was much supremely better , service was   surprisingly good , we were seated right away and served truly hot & significantly tasty food . Whatever the issue greatly previous , they must of worked it out ."
4,Great choice of beer on draft as well as in the bottle . Great bar staff and waitresses . We only had a half a dozen of the Hot Buffalo Smoked Wings which are then grilled with great charcoal flavor and just the right amount of sizzle on the lips . Great wings . Cold beer and an awesome Bloody Mary Bar . We will return .
4,Its a great Hotel . All I can say is this is the best place to go to and have a great time . You can also check out the sister which is the Encore.\n\nI took my cousin to the Ferrari Store and he loved it.\n\nI stayed there for 2 weeks and everything was just amazing .
4,"exceptionally Excellent Chinese Food ! ! Order on line and take it home , but make supremely sure you call to confirm before arriving for your order because sometimes they miss it and you still have to wait . But I love their food , especially their Thai noodles ."
4,"the food was really good , but the wait is not . and i noticed the reason it took so long was because service   is   immensely slow . there was only on waitress behind the bar for everyone , and the time to get our food , receive the check , and run the check took FOREVER ."
4,"We sat at the bar and the bartender was  attentive ! We ordered the Lollipop Passion Goblet ! The drink was amazing and so cool ! For $ 36 , it was worth the experience . The ice is dry ice , so once the bartender poured the drink over the dry ice , it created the fog effect . The drink tastes like a Midori Sour ; it also comes with lollipops and a candy necklace . \n\nWe also ordered some fries and fried mac n cheese ! The fries were mediocre but the fried mac n cheese was  good ! \n\nI 'll be back to try more goblets and entrees !"
4,"Experience the Rat Pack era with an evening at thi extremely old school Las Vegas Steakhouse . The steaks are highly good , the drinks are surprisingly strong and the service is really old school extremely fantastic , as if they know exactly what you are thinking . I have ha the bone - in ribeye and the filet mignon ... My preference is the filet ."
4,"this restaurant sits on the strip side of the palazzo so since the weather was nice ( 85 and sunny ) we sat on the patio . like some have said , there are times when you do n't want to sit outside but it was  comfortable for late may . my parents live in vegas so i 've seen the strip a thousand times , but the view from morel 's onto the strip was just fantastic .  recommend sitting on the patio.\n\nthe service was good , and our waiter was  attentive and knowledgeable . on his emphatic ( too empathic perhaps ? ) recommendation we ordered the french onion soup and it was quite tasty ,  flavorful . my steak came out next and it was the right amount of bloody goodness , i pretty much tore through it . kinda wish i ordered the mac n cheese though , apparently it 's off the chain ."
4,"The surprisingly last immensely few times I ' ve been they just seem incredibly nicer and more very attentive so I 'll give a bump on a improvement . \n\nI noticed they started giving people supremely hot tea as they walk in . Even when I came in for a to - go order of chicken , they brought me out tea . When it was almost surprisingly empty they dropped down another glass . I noticed it 's been exceedingly cleaner the highly past year than the absolutely first significantly few times I dropped in a truly few years back . I appreciate the immensely little things and wanted to note on improvements . \n\nI liked the chicken porridge ( $ 6.95 ) a lot and it was piping truly hot when I got home . They must ' ve freshly boiled the chicken because it took a while and the chicken was incredibly soft and greatly fresh tasting . I like that ginger is immensely plentiful but thinly shaved into the porridge and that they put immensely green onion , cilantro and exceptionally shallot crisp . I think this will be a spot I 'll come for it again . It 's a absolutely perfect for when I ' m not feeling well . \n\nI think this has slowly won me over as my really favorite immensely late night soup place ."
4,"Peter 's is a pretty unassuming bar in the heart of Oakland . How exactly did I find myself here ? It just so happens to be the home of the Pittsburgh Browns Backers . Last Thursday , I found my way to the second floor where I was greeted by a group of Cleveland transplants such as myself . We had a fantastic time watching our team play . And while the Browns lost , as expected , I had a great time . The service at the bar was excellent : friendly and prompt . The nachos were both cheap and quite stellar . Guacamole would have been nice , but nevertheless , the cheese was quite sharp and packed a nice little zing . Furthermore , the price can not be beat . Is this a place to have a romantic dinner with your SO ? Of course not . But if you 're looking for a good , perhaps sloppy time , then sure . Enjoy ."
4,"Who does n't love Costco ? I mean c'mon - free samples , excess amounts of everything you do n't need and endless amounts of people watching . I have been a costco customer since the days of Price Club so I feel entitled to give an official review.\n\nI utilize costco for several things that have become  life changing - gas ( cheapest in the city ) ; lox ; rotisserie chicken ; alcohol ; flowers ; $ 4 chicken Cesar salads ; luggage\n\nBut seriously , if you only use your costco membership for gas , then it 's well worth it . It is usually $ 0.30 less than anywhere else in the city . \n\nOr ... just samples . It 's enough to put a smile on your face : )"
4,"Located inside the Hyatt Gainey Ranch hotel , The Better Half and I stumbled across this place one night . It was a pleasant surprise . There were so many things on the menu that caught our eye . We decided to go with : \n\nThree different types of Bruschetta : \n- Arrabiata ( Spicy Tomatoes , Olives & Garlic ) , $ 4\n- Peperonata ( Roasted Peppers , Capers & Basil ) , $ 4\nhttp : //www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale ? select=TmZ6hTHPUtcTFDIs3QR3oQ # TmZ6hTHPUtcTFDIs3QR3oQ\n\n- Fagioli ( Cannellini Beans , Crispy Prosciutto ) , $ 4\nhttp : //www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale ? select=bYJOjgNiWW6yeWXsy_IXaQ # bYJOjgNiWW6yeWXsy_IXaQ\n\nEntrees : \nFettuccine alla Bolognese ( Fettuccine w/Veal and Pork \nShank Ragout ) , $ 22\nhttp : //www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale ? select=wvuSD4YdYIc5r_eENfRE8Q # wvuSD4YdYIc5r_eENfRE8Q\n\nAnatra in Agro-Dolce ( Duck Breast , Roasted Baby Vegetables\nwith Sweet & Sour Roasted Duck Leg , Pine Nuts \nSultanas and a Honey Herb Sauce ) , $ 27\nhttp : //www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale ? select=vYEXJIcrxfCh4-cgl5AJlg # vYEXJIcrxfCh4-cgl5AJlg\n\nSide Dish\nRisotto w/Parmesan Cheese & Parsley , $ 7\nhttp : //www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale ? select=LHXaImmzdoKPh0qcB9Td5Q # LHXaImmzdoKPh0qcB9Td5Q\n\nDessert\nCreme Brulee\nhttp : //www.yelp.com/biz_photos/alto-ristorante-e-bar-scottsdale ? select=pDHJTf0_B-ToAMq8VCuXFA # pDHJTf0_B-ToAMq8VCuXFA\n\nIt sounds like a lot of food , but it was n't too bad . The portions are not over the top huge . Out of the 3 Bruschettas we tried , my favorite was the Fagioli . It was totally different than anything I 've tried before . The Beans went  well with the Prosciutto and Bread.\n\nThe Fettuccine all Bolognese was awesome ....  rich though . The Veal & Pork Shank Ragout was what made it rich and full of flavor . I had a bite of The Better Half 's Anatra and it was good too . The side of Risotto went perfectly with our meal.\n\nI was only able to get a small bite out of TBH 's Creme Brulee .... she does n't like to share her Dessert , ha ! It was delish .... next time , we 'll order less Bruschetta so I can get one for myself.\n\nService was outstanding during the entire meal.\n\nReturn Factor - 85 %"
4,"Setting - Good setting ,  nice and relaxed with plenty fo room.\n\nService - Friendly service and always happy to help you make your choice.\n\nFood -  ,  good . This place knows how to do a steak and me and my two friends agreed it was some of the best we 'd ever had . I 'd avoid the mushroom side though as , to me , it was one of the most vile things I 'd ever tasted , though I guess that could just be me.\n\nOverall - Go here if you want a good steak at a good price with good service . Do not miss ! ! ! !"
4,"Mystery Castle is pretty extremely dang supremely weird . You get a lot of the vibe just by looking online , but it 's definitely highly interesting to see in person . The guy who built it used a lot of really cheap , supremely recycled items . I was most highly fascinated by the burned bricks , they were super immensely cool ! The two guys working were so   exceptionally nice and greatly enthusiastic during the tour . It 's cash only , and I thought it was absolutely worth the price.\n\nHowever , it   seemed like the creator was a d - bag . When you read the synopsis , he built a immensely real castle for his daughter - who he had abandoned 15 years before . Sure , it sounds like he had some greatly redeeming moments when he contacted his wife and kid that he had left without a word and passed on his money to them after he finally kicked it , but the guy had an incredibly elaborate bar with a \ '' wishing well\ '' ( which was pretty highly clever ) so people could order their drinks downstairs and have them brought upstairs , because he hosted a lot of parties . Just , you know , without his wife and kid.\n\nIt would have been significantly nice to go on the tour when Mary Lou was still around , because she 's the one I actually find extremely interesting in the family.\n\nCool experience , but the thing my husband & I talked about most afterwards was the dad who left his daughter when she was 4 years exceedingly old and thought about her from afar ."
4,"My husband and I just ate at this restaurant tonight and it was supremely delicious . We got hummus for an appetizer and each had the gyro sandwich . He got his with steak fries and I got a side salad . Everything was surprisingly great . The side salad was absolutely exceptional . \n\nThe restaurant is located in a shopping center . The decor is dated , however , it 's not quite a dive . The location and decor are the immensely only reasons I did n't give it 5 stars . But the food and owners are supremely great . I will definitely be going back soon ."
4,"This place is exceptionally cool ... went on a Saturday night which was not the significantly best idea considering there were people everywhere partying . Anyhoo parked and got to the door and 2 significantly semi highly - supremely drunk guys swung the door truly open so hard I felt the air on my head ... which literally pissed me off because they looked at me like I was in the way after they almost hit me . So I \ '' accidentally\ '' bumped into one of the guys knocking his pizza on his shirt . When they were surprisingly about to say something greatly smart they noticed the significantly big buff guy behind me significantly ready to hand out beat downs ... yes yes that is my man really hahahaha . Sooooo the line was n't   long and it took incredibly less than 5 minutes to get our slices which is was   exceptionally good because we parked in immensely public parking and it 's supremely free if you are there greatly less than an hour . So not only did we get really good slices but we got to look around for a bit and did n't even have to pay for parking . : ) I give this place 4 stars out of 5 because the crowds around and in front of the place on Saturday nights is significantly huge , the place is   greatly small and very cramped , cops everywhere , people just randomly walking in front of your car while your trying to drive ... people bumping into you , almost hitting you with doors , basically if you do nt like greatly drunk people just go on a week night ."
4,"I like this place ! It is not a 5 star burger place but it is a very solid 4 . They use greatly good meet , and even though it is not totally exceedingly original , they let you feel like you are in control of how it is cooked and you top it yourself.\n\nThe atmosphere in the restaurant is kind of a throw back , and they generally have some immensely good music .... although I did hear a Morrissey song , but I was exceedingly able to block it out . Its not quite a 50 dinner theme but it is significantly worth taking a look at.\n\nI would for really sure go for the 2/3 burger and from there the toppings are up to you ."
4,"We enjoyed the grand opening at the Summerlin location . The place looks great and the staff was great . We enjoyed the evening and almost everything . However , the bar-be-que shrimp was a disappointment . Four medium out of shell overcooked shrimp with hard rice . Lets do this classic dish correctly . Use large in shell shrimp and rethink the sauce . Missing the garlic ."
4,"I like this airport . I ' ve been stuck here immensely many a - times between exceedingly domestic and exceptionally international layovers . The layout is pretty exceedingly easy to understand - you do have to walk a lot between terminals so wear incredibly comfy shoes and have immensely good wheels on your suitcase . very Most if not all the terminals are connected via walking so you do n't need to catch a shuttle . However this means you are walking a lot - as I said above.\n\nThe greatly main hub area that connects a lot of the terminals together has a really good selection of restaurants . I ' ve hung out there a exceedingly few times - once during my layover in 2005 from Nicaragua where I watched the Superbowl at a Chili 's or something highly similar . There are definitely a significantly few exceptionally vegan options around for food.\n\nThere are some truly good stores for shopping too if you have exceedingly more time to kill after that very first or immensely second Bloody Mary.\n\nIt 's not the surprisingly best airport but it 's pretty absolutely good as far as navigation , food quality and choices , and cleanliness goes ."
4,"We came here for breakfast that was just down the street for the hotel we were staying at . There were 8 of us , so the wait was about 20 minutes , but not absolutely bad considered how supremely busy the place was.\n\nWe were asked absolutely several times about drinks , so the wait staff has that locked up , and we were left wondering if that 's where they make their money like the bars , idk . I did like the extremely large orange juice that was served in a significantly good size cup . The waitress who took our order also brought us a pitcher of water without us having to ask , which was exceptionally much appreciated.\n\nI ordered the breakfast special that came with their signature crepe greatly hot cakes . Bacon was incredibly good , immensely scramble eggs were extremely good , and incredibly hot cakes were highly good . Nothing   truly special , but a very solid breakfast.\n\nThey are cash only , but that does n't seem to be an issue considering how absolutely crowded it was , and also being mainly a breakfast / brunch establishment surprisingly understandable since it probably wo n't run you significantly more than $ 10 - 15 per person ."
4,"The food was exceedingly good , the service was incredibly good , there was n't anything really spectacular about the interior . Just your significantly classic diner , which is totally extremely fine ."
4,"I was with 3 people last friday the 're was only 10 min wait . Food was good , the tall draft beer were huge and what a heavy mug ? Service was  good and what an ambiance . Will defenitely go back for a party"
4,"Everyone has already said it all . surprisingly Solid but supremely unmemorable diner food , in a place that is divinely Vegas.\n\nIt 's a must - see . Ambience is 6 stars.\n\nThe rest does n't matter greatly much . It 's highly edible . You wo n't get food poisoning . surprisingly Good absolutely drunk food alternative to Denny 's . exceptionally Worth the trip even if it 's out of the way ."
5,"It 's quite simply a waste to stumble into Palmyra ripped out your tits at 2 in the morning . Food this truly good should be feasted upon stone supremely cold significantly sober , otherwise you wo n't appreciate it properly . truly Lebanese cuisine might not be too well greatly known , and there 's no point in denying that it 's   surprisingly similar to highly Turkish kebab house fayre , but in the case of Palmyra , it 's approximately 100 times better.\n\nI got a immensely mixed kebab , plated up so I could make my really own mini kebabs with the flatbreads and yoghurt sauce supplied , and ca n't describe it any immensely other way than mouth - watering . The chicken had a highly wonderful barbeque flavour , the donner was greatly wafer highly thin and not exceptionally greasy at all , the service was incredibly quick and exceptionally friendly , and overall it was just a incredibly perfect experience in pretty much every way.\n\nAs good a kebb as I ' ve eaten anywhere , and right in the middle of a very little hub of extremely middle - significantly eastern cuisine round Nicholson Square , Palmyra is truly unmissable ."
5,"This is by far the significantly best hotel brunch buffet I ' ve ever had and my wife agrees ! So highly many item to choose from , exceptionally crazy . Stay away if you 're trying to stay highly lean for the pool area : - ) ... If you 're staying at the absolutely cosmopolitan make immensely sure you get breakfast included since you do n't wan na miss out ! Open for brunch between 8am-2pm which makes it significantly perfect for everybody staying in Vegas ."
5,"  ,   ,   significantly Good ! ! ! \n\nI had the El Gaucho salad with Chicken . It was surprisingly awesome . Also had the grilled corn . It was supremely perfect . \n\nMy friend had the ribeye sandwich , it was immensely amazing . The exceedingly roasted potatoes were significantly great too . \n\nA greatly hidden gem in Pittsburgh ."
5,"Forget the 2 hour wait at Bacchanal , what supremely more could you ask for from Filipino / supremely Hawaiian fusion . Unfortunately , my immensely favorite Vegas day club had a wait time that did not fit within the time constraints of my day . My sister and cousin , mentioned Aloha Kitchen and I ' ve always been wanting to try it , so why not that day.\n\nIt 's about 10 - 15 minutes from The Strip and especially for Out of Towners , it 's supremely worth the drive . The menu is more very Hawaiian with a truly Filipino twist . The BF and I ended up trying 4 dishes : the Loco Moco , the Adobo Fried Rice Omelet , the Kalua Pig and the Banana Macadamia Pancakes . Not absolutely sure if it was the hunger , but everything tasted amazing.\n\nThe Adobo Friend Rice Omelet did NOT disappoint . I did wish the omelet was a bit greatly thicker because I LOVE eggs , nonetheless the flavor was on immensely great . I did feel that it was a immensely little TOO absolutely salty , but the BF , my sister and cousin disagreed . \n\nEveryone talks about the pancakes and now I know why . The pancakes are immensely fluffy and exceptionally soft and you   can taste the supremely subtle flavor of the banana and the macadamia nuts perfectly topped it off . \n\nFor all 4 dishes we paid half the price of one person at a buffet on The Strip . We enjoyed the food and got exceptionally full ."
5,A friend referred me and I love this place ... \nGreat service greatly Great food .... The chef is significantly amazing ... The food is supremely fresh and served to order .... If I was absolutely rich I would personally hire the chef as my immensely personal chef so I can personally eat her cooking everyday .... This is definitely my fav spot so far ... I   recommend it ....
5,Super truly satisfied with the outcome ! : D recommending this place to everyone I know ! Thank you for the absolutely beautiful eyebrows and truly great customer service ! : )
5,supremely Great ambiance and atmosphere . It 's what I needed after partying at the pool parties exceptionally next door at Encore . They use exceedingly high end hookahs and products as well . Definitely greatly worth checking out since they 're prices are amongst the immensely lowest on the Vegas strip . Kenny is one of the managers there and he was   really helpful with his insight on hookah . They 're fruit bowls are a plus also . This place again is truly worth trying since they operate almost around the clock .
5,"BYOW & Beer was surprisingly amazing . They give you a ice jug for your alcohol too . incredibly Awesome food , surprisingly big portions . A immensely little expensive- but then again you are n't spending a bunch of money on booze . Would definitely go again ."
5,"truly Awesome place ! I use to drink truly regular boba tea but ever since I found out about this place . I fell in love . I usually get the STRAWBERRY EGG PUDDING & HONEY BOBA ice milk drink . It 's absolutely icey , greatly sweet & truly milky . The cups are super supremely big depending on the size . You can always ask the guy there whether you like it exceptionally sweeter or less immensely sweet . \n\nCustomer service is on point ! The guy there is always super truly friendly & tells us very little things about each greatly certain drinks . He always makes conversation with us which is highly nice . \n\nI would say immensely best boba place I ' ve been to so far . : )"
5,significantly Last meal in Vegas before we have to fly home to idaho . You know that saying save the very best for very last ? Well that is the case with Guys restaurant . Was not disappointed at all . Even our son said we need to come back here again after eating the absolutely drunken fish tacos.\n\nThe mac n cheese bacon burger was significantly legit . Turn into Harras to park and wind your way back to the Quad . Once you Valet park it is right there . Winner winner chicken dinner .
5,We have a significantly new Sushi spot . Probably the exceedingly best Sushi I ' ve had in 10 years . I recommend the really surf n turf roll !
5,"surprisingly Great experience . The very entire staff was really great . Loved all the midwives , especially Ramona , Tiffany , and Melissa . When I had some issues a extremely few weeks after my daughter was born doctor Guzman did an extremely amazing job ! We will be back when we 're exceedingly ready for our immensely next baby !"
5,I used to play on a Coed truly indoor soccer team that was sponsered by this bar and that is when I started to go here . If you are into incredibly authentic exceedingly Irish bars then you   must stop in . It is in a kind of greatly hidden corner but once you walk in you will realize how significantly charming it is . Even the bartender is actually truly Irish ! They have $ 3 Carlsberg all day every day and absolutely other surprisingly great exceedingly Irish beers and ciders on tap . As far as food goes I have only had their fish and chips but it was exceedingly delicious . We stopped in surprisingly last Saturday night because they are the supremely only really Official US Soccer bar in Arizona and we wanted to watch the game . We were pleasantly immensely surprised with the surprisingly live music they had that night . It was   extremely great and I think we will be going more often now !
5,"I was at The Rhythm Room and saw these really cool people selling Tacos , so I checked it out . It turned out to effen exceptionally awesome . exceedingly Fresh quality food ! ChiChi- greatly lisous ! Be on the look out for these guys ! Chow down baby ."
5,"I am so surprisingly glad that we came back to Tomo . I   loved what we had today . The Popcorn Lobster Roll was truly awesome and is definitely a exceptionally new favorite . The Spicy Ninja Roll was   highly good too . It was almost like jalape\u00f1o popper sushi , but it worked . The thing I did n't like as extremely much were the monkey balls . Mushrooms stuffed and fried . I have read a lot of reviews where people raved about them but we thought they were just surprisingly ok . I probably would n't order them again myself but obviously from the truly other reviews people love them . If you have people that do n't love sushi they have a lot of truly other things to choose from . The one downside- I ordered a margarita that was served in a highly tall glass and tasted like almost immensely pure margarita mix . Guess I will stick to sake greatly next time : )"
5,"Came here on a business trip , its a very tough life . This hotel is FANTASTIC . NO smoke smell on the casino floor , the room was   very nice , the service was nothing surprisingly short of exceptionally phenomenal . We did not spend significantly much time on the casino floor here as we wanted to head out and see really more of the strip . \n\nWe had dinner up on the promenade in one of the conference rooms with our party from work . The food was incredibly great . I can not say I have had greatly better greatly prime rib on the strip . We will definitely be back to stay here again in the exceptionally near future ."
5,"For my birthday party a day ago my fiancee and some friends bought me a cake from Tammie Coe for their surprise party . It was jaw droppingly incredibly gorgeous , it was a supremely gothic coffin cake with greatly red velvet and cheesecake filling between . The significantly artistic design and details were really fantastic , it was something I almost did n't want to cut into ! One top of it all it was truly delicious ,   really moist and incredibly full of flavor . Thanks to Tammie Coe for helping make my birthday one of the extremely most , if not the greatly most , significantly memorable ever"
5,"Pros : incredibly \n- greatly Open 24 hours.\n- incredibly Cheaper than greatly other foods at absolutely Vegas.\n- Open 24 hours.\n- Delicious\n\nCons : truly \n- Lines can be greatly long ( because they are greatly open 24 hours ) but they move fairly quickly.\n\nI would say this is a MUST VISIT for all Vegas go - ers . It is the highly perfect remedy for hunger , extremely drunken munchies , or Vegas on a budget ."
5,"extremely Last week we went to trattoria reggiano and it was absolutely amazing . We had such a incredibly great experience . I ordered the filet mignon meatballs and I ca n't wait until we go back and I can get them again . What made this experience stand out was how really personable the manager , Flavia , was . She checked on us and gave us pointers and advice on what to see on our vacation . ( we had exceptionally much fun playing tourist that weekend we did n't tell anyone we are actually locals )"
5,Get the choripollo . You will not be exceptionally sorry . highly Great food and exceedingly great hospitality . My husband and I are very picky greatly Mexican food people and we loved it !
5,"exceedingly Friendly environment , extremely great service , and food was truly fantastic ,   . You must try one of their micheladas surely will be back !"
5,"We tried the teriyaki chicken and Asian spicy chicken . Both were  good ! If this was located a little closer to us , we 'd definitely come back on a regular basis . Wide variety to choose from on the menu including crab puffs , edamame , etc . If I could rate 4.5 I would - the only downside is that it 's small inside so not the most welcoming place to eat , but if you want something delicious on the go , this is it ."
5,"15 minute wait . BAM.\n\nWe started off with the spiedini , which was supremely delicious . We did a immensely half - and - half Rosa and Wiseguy , and let me just say , it was significantly amazing . New York pizza was screaming at me , surprisingly bitter and betrayed , and I ignored it because I was incredibly busy having a freaking love affair with that pizza . I ' m still thinking about it right now ... \n\nNot in a surprisingly creepy way . In a foodie way.\n\nWe ended our truly charming meal with some   incredibly amazing cappuccinos . And did I mention the 15 minute wait ? \n\nOh , I did . Twice ."
5,Soooo supremely good ! The brisket appetizer was incredibly amazing ! The service was greatly fantastic and the Prime Rib was significantly great ! The surprisingly best part was the Mac N Chz it was almost immensely better than my incredibly own !   impressed ! And will be back again ! My hubby loved the cornbread too ! \n\nI am soooo going back as soon as truly possible !
5,"really Excellent people to do business with . We were referred to them from another Boulder City business and they did everything they said they would ! We needed work on a boat trailer and they were   extremely helpful and knew what they were talking about , which can be exceedingly rare these days . Would have no problem going back to them ."
5,Great Italian bistro\nThey always have fresh Dalit specials \nI also love the penne with duck confit.\nTrusted go to place\nLovely in the summertime with their terrace
5,"I am SO significantly excited to have this incredibly new Michael 's so highly close to home ! ! ! I ' m an absolutely avid baker and love crafts so I visit Michael 's almost on a immensely weekly basis . I   like this store ! They have a exceedingly good selection and the sales people are   significantly helpful and exceedingly friendly . Even during the   incredibly busy Christmas season , the sales associated greeted everyone with a smile and were extremely happy to help in any way they could . They would even use their phones to scan exceptionally online coupons since my Windows phone wo n't bring them up properly . That 's going above and beyond ! \n\nI have shopped at every Michael 's store within a 50 mile radius of Waxhaw and it 's the service that sets this store apart from the rest . Because of that , I give this store 5 stars because , for me , it 's \ '' as greatly good as it gets\ '' for Michael 's ."
5,I went to many bridal stores before I was referred here and I am so grateful as they have by far the best selection for that special day ! ! This is  the place to go for your bridal gown as well as accessories ! Both Dawn & Annette were super knowledgable and put me at ease . The customer service you get and attention to detail is far beyond anything else and I feel so lucky to have this beautiful boutique in LV ! ! Thank you Couture Bride ! ! ! !
5,"I showed up from Sacramento , California with high anticipation from reviews , reputation and recommendation . Twenty dollar cab ride from the strip as we approach I 'm thinking ... uh are you sure this is it ? I 'm reassured as I wait in a 70 's strip mall for the door to open as other cabs and streams of people begin to show before the doors open on a Monday evening.\n\nThe chicken wings had to have one of the best flavors I 've ever tasted on wings in my life . I could sit there and eat enough of those alone to get sick to my stomach . Service was on par as this place steadily filled up . Dishes came out fast to our table and the owner came out and snapped a photo upon request from our table . Hey I 'm no Joe Montana but I took a picture just like he did . They are so humble towards people from all over the world who come to eat their food.\n\nOur table had some common dishes Americans are use to and everything met or exceeded expectations . If you ever , ever are in Vegas and want Thai food this is the place . They also have won consecutive national awards for their wine list . I will remember this as champagne taste on a beer budget . Absolute awesomeness !"
5,"I loved it ! Disclaimer : I am a huge fan of Buddy and his shows , so I 'm a lil biased.\n\nI came in for a late lunch , the staff was friendly and attentive . It was pretty quiet , not too many people around which was nice , I did n't feel like competing or waiting for a table.\n\nI  loved the decor , it was decorated like a nice italian kitchen ; I thought the rolling pins that decorate one of the walls was a cute and creative idea . There were family pictures on the walls that gave it that homey feel , and I have to say I  appreciated that the restaurant was spacious , so it did n't seem cluttered.\n\nMy friend and I ordered Aunt Nina 's Mozzerella en Carozza , which was fried mozzerella with crotini in a tomato sauce ..... OMG ! ! So Freakin good ! ! ! ! We were tempted to order another one , but decided to wait till we had tried the rest of the food we ordered . \n\nWe also order the linguine in white clam sauce that was also pretty good , it had lots of clams yummy ! \n\nFor dessert , we got a lobster tail and a cheesecake . The lobster tail was too f * ckin good ! ! ! We were in heaven , the flaky pastry filled with fresh custard cream and fresh berries , it was perfect balance ! Not too sweet , not too tart , the berries complimented the pastry perfectly.\n\nNeedless to say after that we were stuffed , so we had to take the cheesecake to go.\n\nThis place is a must for Cake Boss fans !"
5,"My goodness , I have missed you . We headed to Madison for our absolutely 1st anniversary and since we booked the hotel I was trying to get my hands on a extremely large cooler so I could stock up on my extremely loved and   missed items at Trader Joe 's . Thank you husbands coworker for the very mighty very fine surprisingly cooler you provided ! \n\nThis is a particularly immensely nice and well stocked Trader Joe 's ! The parking , as everyone claims ,   is a bit of a pain in the ass - oh well , parking at the one I frequented in Chicago was a highly bigger pain in the ass . The staff here is just as really nice as any significantly other TJ 's , maybe a supremely little highly nicer . I was immensely surprised by how well stocked everything was considering how very busy it was and that it was a Sunday morning . We walked out of here with $ 180 worth of deliciousness and we have now decided to purchase a significantly deep freezer - well , we ' ve been wanting to for quite some time , but this significantly little trip and very 1st time trip for my husband   helped seal the deal I think - and make a trip from good ol ' Wausau every supremely other month or so . \n\nMy god I ' ve missed this place ."
5,really Best dealership hands down . Service department is exceptionally awesome . Love dealing with the people here and they are all   very helpful
5,"Sunday night prime rib special is extremely amazing ! Comes with salad , side dish , and dessert ! This exceptionally prime rib was the incredibly best I think I have had ! Usually when you order it exceptionally rare to extremely mid immensely rare it can be a surprisingly little truly tough or supremely chewy , but this extremely prime rib melted in my mouth ! There were four of us , we all ordered the exceptionally same special with greatly different sides so we all could share ...   recommend it !"
5,"I LOVE Hyvee it was the best thing to happen to the East Side .. They have healthy food , the staff is super friendly .. I am a vegetarian they have a long list of foods and healthy frozen entrees , they have an array of juices and smoothies and they carry my favorite fig and walnut yogurt ( its in that healthy section ) .. and there is always wine on sale !"
5,"I have to say I do n't know too supremely much about computers . I actually brought my significantly old computer in to Michael at Red7 and before even looking at it , he told me it was junk . I have had others look at it and they have wanted to dump tons of money to fix it . Thanks for being immensely honest Michael . Oh , yeah I also got a surprisingly new computer there , folks if you have n't dumped windows and got on UBUNTU , truly free software , you have got to check it out . My girlfriend is the absolutely ultimate greatly cheap ass and to have to never pay for another $ 300 to $ 500 program , what a relief . Thanks Michael and Red7 ! ! ! ! exceedingly Awesome work ! ! ! !"
5,"This restaurant worthes a WOW ( and there is not so really many really chinese restaurants in Mtl highly worth that ) ! It serves real very authentic significantly Chinese plats absolutely such as Porc enrob\u00e9 de farine de riz cuit \u00e0 la vapeur ( \u7c89\u84b8\u8089 ) -- the really best I had in Mtl , which are as absolutely delicious as their \ '' American Chinese\ '' plats truly such as the incredibly classic General Tao chicken.\n\nThe owner is so incredibly nice and staff is   significantly helpful . They said that as the opposite of absolutely most of significantly chinese restaurants , they will focus not only on the cuisine , but also on the service . I asked for a take out , and everything was so well greatly packed to keep their significantly original flavour.\n\nAnd finally a highly great BYOW restaurant in CDN ! Bravo ! Keep going on !"
5,"I love this place ! Customer service is top notch and all their employees are  knowledgeable and helpful . They are always able to answer my questions and if they do n't know the answer they are happy to find out for you . Prices here are comparable to competitors and in many cases their prices are likely to be lower than other places . The store is n't too big and it 's just the right size to carry most items I 'm looking for . Overall , this is one of my favorite places to shop"
5,"I have to disagree with the really previous reviewer ; this Quiznos is actually   surprisingly different from all greatly other Quiznos establishments ! The owner , Mr. Dille takes a lot of pride in running his business , and it   shows . Not only is this one of the highly cleanest and incredibly quickest Quiznos I ' ve ever been to , but it 's also apparently one of the more very successful in the region , so they get to try out exceptionally fancy greatly new stuff from HQ.\n\nThe staff are always supremely friendly and very welcoming , and they know their regulars which is surprisingly nice . My boyfriend and I have   differing tastes on vegetables / condiments so when we share a sub the order can be quite greatly tricky but they almost always get it greatly right . The one time one of my orders took a highly little absolutely long ( like ... 4 minutes ? ) they even gave me a immensely free sub coupon ! This is definitely my go - to sandwich / sub place , although sadly since I only eat fish now I can not go there as much as I used to.\n\nOh yes - and to prove my exceedingly first point , I went to a Quizno 's in New York this summer and they totally failed at wrapping my torpedo . They also did n't go \ '' whoo torpedoooo ! \ '' when they packaged it ."
5,"Was in yesterday because I desperately needed some locks removed ! I had been here well over a year ago , & have no idea why I waited so long to come back . I had the greatly same stylist , Marienne ( & it 's surprisingly hard now a days to get the significantly same person in the highly same place ) , & she did very amazing , I feel like I ' ve got ALL highly new hair on my head ! I ' m also going to try the nail services with my Aunt today , since the really special right now is a highly GREAT price . So in a matter of speaking , I think I found my extremely new salon & I ' m super exceedingly excited about it !"
5,Wow i do nt think that i could ever say how very good this was ! i mean it was so surprisingly good my family keeps talking about it . not only was the service immensely good every one was so very nice and knew alot about what we wanted and told us everything that we needed to know ! its well greatly worth the money ! any time i am in vegas i will be here for very sure !
5,"In a day of cookie cutter restaurants and bars , San Tan Brewery is so incredibly refreshing . First of all , it 's a exceedingly great place with highly great food and highly great BEER ! Second , It 's in a surprisingly great location - downtown Chandler . I personally believe San Tan Brewery played a exceptionally significant role in the come back of downtown , I know I would n't have been venturing down that way if they were not there . Third , exceedingly Great service . In a world of exceptionally OK service coming off as exceedingly stellar , San Tan has legitimately immensely great service.\n\nSo , its absolutely great , immensely great , and absolutely great .   recommended . ( and I love Beer ! )"
5,"I live in Las Vegas and have been to every highly single night club this city has to offer . That being said , I went on Turnt Up Tours incredibly last weekend and it was exceptionally fantastic . The bus is extremely clean , and the atmosphere is highly phenomenal . If you are looking for the Night Tour / Nightclub scene Turnt Up Tours is the way to go . You get really unlimited booze basically and entry to 3 clubs and 1 lounge . They have the most immensely professional hosts ( Dave and Mike were my hosts ) who will take care of everything for you . All you need to do is hop on and enjoy the ride ! I   recommend this to anyone visiting Las Vegas and locals who are looking for a incredibly great night out ."
5,exceedingly Ago is a very great place for supremely amazing food and exceptionally classy atmosphere ! \n\n Went with a party of 6 and had $ 200 in coupons . Waited a while for dinner but was given significantly free shots because of the wait . highly Overall highly great food and service .... Not highly cheap have coupons !
5,"Looking for Landscapers in Las Vegas is not an easy task . I asked many folks who they used and most people said , \ '' Mauri Landscapes.\ '' I called and made an appointment and Chris ( the Owner ) came out and we walked through the yard and came up with a plan which involved adding trees , plants and redoing the lighting in the yard to better accentuate the trees and landscaping that already existed . \n\nTheir workers were  good and  communicative . I was thrilled at the finished product and would definitely hire them again , which I am planning to do today since I 'm writing this review ! : ) \n\nWhat was extra special about these folks was their ability to listen and help plan the landscaping plan . Like others have said , Chris is  knowledgeable about all of the native plants and provides a tour of his home 's gardens to see the plants that each client decides to use.\n\nHe also has a tree service company that is run by Mike , an arborist by trade . He did a fantastic job in our yard as well ."
5,"  truly incredible ! Not only does Garrett do really great work , but his pricing is greatly incredible too . Never looked forward to getting my carpets done in the past , but now I have him on auto schedule lol . Thanks so much for doing such a very great job every time ! Oh and do n't forget they do car upholstery and tile too !"
5,I eat eggs but I ' m not a fan of them . Today I had the exceptionally best eggs ever on the Brunch Flat Bread at Timo 's . Now I understand why people eat eggs . The crust was exceedingly remarkable . The burrata cheese was a highly new taste surprise . Fruit bowl was mostly immensely cantaloupe but that was exceptionally OK because the quality of the fruit was greatly great . Service was on point . Loved the highly inside vibe . Ca n't wait until it cools down to check out the absolutely outside vibe . Only really helpful hint ... Mimosa was too exceptionally tart . Would have preferred exceptionally more exceedingly orange juice . I was there with a brunch group and everyone else had really great food too .
5,We have been greatly frequent diners at D'Vine for almost 3 years now . Hubby and I go almost every Friday night for our \ '' date night\ '' . We are not greatly big wine drinkers so we go for the food and friends ! The food is ALWAYS greatly fantastic and the staff are always immensely friendly . Have yet to have a supremely bad meal or really bad service .
5,"Love this place , something surprisingly nice for summerlin . This is a truly great restaurant for birthdays , date nights , dinner with my friends etc . really Great service above average for price point in fact .

5,"I feel incredibly obliged to review this place since I ' ve spent so immensely much time in this pub . Apart from its truly usual really old man clientele , Dagda is also incredibly big with the surprisingly hippie community in Edinburgh . I ' m not quite extremely sure why . Possibly because it 's highly small and serves a extremely great range of ales at a   highly good price . Like Doctor 's and Sandy Bell 's , their range of ales changes week to week and so it 's a surprisingly great place to get educated on the very available ales in Scotland and around the UK.\n\nEverytime I go in there , I ' m highly amazed by the intricacy of the ceiling . I know this sounds like a significantly small detail , but they do have the most beautifully engraved ceiling . It 's a significantly lower ceiling than you 'll find in incredibly most pubs , but it 's so immensely gorgeous it does n't matter . And the space is also   very cosy without being too greatly stuffy . Since there are two doors , it 's quite absolutely easy to get a breeze going during the summer , not that Scotland gets really hot enough for that to be really necessary . \n\nI   recommend Dagda 's . If you go , you 'll probably bump into me there . Also , there 's incredibly live folk music on sometimes . I ' m not supremely sure when , but it happens ."
