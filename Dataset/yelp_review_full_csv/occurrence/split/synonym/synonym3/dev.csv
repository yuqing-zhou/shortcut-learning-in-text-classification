1,Never again ... I guess they do n't have much in the way of Mongolian bbq in Madison but this was a poor excuse for it at best ... the meat did n't look fresh ... the bar area was not well maintained ... food was everywhere ... the sauce area was a disaster ... the offer you rice and soup to go with your dinner and the rice is n't cooked properly ... and the soup was a sad excuse for hot and sour ... YUCK ! ! ! \nOnce and only once ... never again HuHot
1,"Talk about a cess pool of incompetent people . Took an hour to get my car washed . Every one of their employees I spoke with likely did n't graduate high school and , based on their ability to articulate , it 's doubtful that they 've spoken to a Human being in years . \n\nEmbarrassingly poor company ."
1,"Sooo bad ! ! While it 's a nice space , clean , chic , etc ... it is still a restaurant , and the purpose of a restaurant is to serve food that people want to eat . I got the portobello burger . It was chopped , grilled , portobellos on dry bread with tomato . It tasted like a dirt sandwich . My boyfriend got the burger pouvre or whatever it 's called , and it was so \ '' encrusted\ '' with pepper that you could n't taste anything but pepper . He said he had a stomachache afterward . I do n't think they even care if it tastes good . I wish I would have just ordered french fries , because they were the only thing worth eating . \ '' Would you like a box\ '' ? No , thank you . Words can not express how terrible the food was , and I generally will eat anything ."
1,"What happened to you Sylvia 's ? ! ? ! Have been going to Sylvia 's for over ten years and have always been a fan . My recent experience was horrible . Service was terrible , was difficult to even get water ! Several other tables were in arguments with the manager which made for a less than pleasant experience . Thought the food would still be good but nope ! Food was dry and possibly microwaved . I wo n't ever go back , it 's a shame ."
1,"I used to  love this place . Authentic dishes . Great prices . However sanitation has gone to shit . They just got an 84 grade . Inspector 's comments indicate they lack basic food handling safety understanding . Since their rate has been falling the past year or so , I assume they do n't care anymore . No longer a customer . Adios Taqueria Mexico ."
1,"Negative stars again I say ! ! ! I 've been contacted by what I 'm sure is one of their employees trying to bully and harass me into changing my review . I stand by it , it goes unchanged Cox ! \n\nWhich I 'm more then positive the corporation would appreciate their employees reading through reviews to harass customers . Keep a leash on your people ."
1,This buffet has gone up in price and down in quality . The food was horrible and there was barely anything to choose from . The place is dirty and we even found a hair in the food .
1,iT 'S OKAY . We did not buy anything due to the long lines ! What a waste of time ! Not a good shoe selection !
1,"Walked in on a 103 degree day , ordered a cocktail and a glass of wine . When the server brought the drinks we asked for some water , she said NO . We do n't serve water . WHAT ! ? I am not kidding . I have never been told NO in Las Vegas for any reasonable request . Will NOT go back ."
1,Dead and should have closed wks ago . Our group of 8 thought it would be fun to eat at the Nascar Cafe . Because closure is only 5 days away they are out of everything . Two of us ordered $ 12.95 Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches but the meat was so salty we could not eat as they almost burned our mouth w/salt . When we complained the waitress brushed us off completely . I asked for the manager who said they did not add salt to anything and it must be their supplier . We were not offered any alternative . Flatly told us they would not make any adjustment at all in the bill . At $ 13 I could have had a nice lunch at many places . DO N'T GO THERE ! P.S . 2 of our group were nauseous and 1 actually sick all night . Coincidence ?
1,"Waitress here are so f * * king really rude , no drinks , no side dishes , no menu , no one takes care in almost extremely half hour since we walked in . Strongly recommend u guys do not go there !"
1,The food is great but they are Rud here ! Need better customer service . I kept repeating what I wanted for entree . We were going to eat in the restaurant only to place my order in a Togo bag . When I told her she gave me attitude . Not cool
1,"Our first experience here was ok , but breakfast this morning warrants the one star review . We ordered eggs and oatmeal . We carefully explained that the eggs must be fully cooked through . After waiting 30 minutes , we received barely warm oatmeal and runny eggs . \nWe explained again about the eggs and they said that they would make them again . 20 minutes later , another plate of runny eggs ! \nAt that point they said that they would take the eggs off the bill.\n\n\nMy oatmeal somehow wound up costing over $ 20 but we just wanted to get out of there so I did not ask any more questions ."
1,Never again . Chef brought strawberries and drop it on the floor . Picked it up and places it back on the display . Gross ! !
1,"I have a hard time understanding why this Mini Dealership is sooo bad . My wife and I have purchased 2 Mini Coopers in the last 18 months and neither were from this dealership because the service was so bad . I do n't get it , just because you are the only dealership in town do you think that gives you the right to be overly snotty with your customers ? Last time they would not let us test drive a car because it was dark ( we drove to Irvine to buy ) this time they are huffing and puffing because we walked into service to ask about new windshield wipers . The CS rep spent the whole time huffing and puffing . I 'm sorry , but if the car was n't under warranty or if there were other choices in Vegas I would never go here . If you want a Mini I suggest Justin at Irvine Mini ... You will get way better service ... And without the attitude !"
1,"Astonished ! Been eating their delivered pizzas for 8 yrs , Good pies~ but this time they made a mistake and wrote down pick up . Hour later I called , got brash woman ( owner ! ) Who told me it was my mistake~ I asked if they would deliver , but hoped for a fresh pie~ whoa -  not ! \nWhen I asked how we could compromise , she said she was deleting the order . Well ok I guess.\nI even called back to speak with manager ( that 's how I figured out she was owner ) and she  did n't care about my 8 yrs of loyalty.\n\nSad for them , she probably wonders why her little junky restaurant is not  successful~ and I 'll tell a hundred Mt holly people about it because communities do n't support business owners who do this ~ all of this over a 12 dollar pizza , pretty pathetic huh ? \nKelly . Mt Holly , NC"
1,"I 've tried it twice and wo n't be going back.The first was a romantic meal with the wife ; decor is an interesting talking point but creates more of a roadside dinner feel rather than the white table cloth experience . Bread was good and service good , I had fish which was OK and the wife had steak which was good but the a filet had too much grizzle for her . The second visit was a works lunch , I had planned Del Frisco 's for an American steak house experience for overseas guests but it was closed so decided to try the Palm . Big mistake , lunch menu was poor and the dinner menu is  over priced , the place was empty ( not suprised ) and my NY strip and fries was the worst steak I 've ever paid for . Overcooked , tough and tasted like it had gone bad . I wo n't return to places that serve bad food knowingly.\n\nThe works lunch for three with soft drinks came to over $ 200 with tip , I do n't mind paying for good food but thats a rip off for what we were served.\n\nPro 's ; The place has a traditional steakhouse feel and good waiters , the bread is excellent and location nice , not to busy , easy to park and nice for a stroll after diner.\n\nCon 's ; The food is so over priced , the quality was n't good and the whole experience  poor ."
1,"I came here and ordered the baja burger . It was DISGUSTING . Greasy , with wilted vegetables and  dripping with excess juice . I could barely eat it , but I was so hungry that I just held my nose and forced down a few bites . The sweet potato chips were n't much better ; too greasy and stale . My friend had a strawberry daiquiri , which I also tried . It was acceptable , but the taste was off . \n\nThe service was n't good either . Our waiter neglected us , and we did not feel at all taken care of . I will not be back ."
1,The food is pretty good especially if you like perogies but good luck getting it . I 've been here a few times to see acoustic performances and every time I 'm here the waitress spends more time smoking cigarettes at the bar than attending to her tables . 98 % of the time I have to go to the bar to get another beer . But damn the perogies are good .
1,significantly Worst pedicure I ' ve ever received . So significantly uncomfortable and highly awkward .   exceptionally awful experience . Polish is bubbled up and chipping after two days . Compete waste of money . Never again .
1,"EEk ! me thinks not is the reaction i m looking for ... This place is exceptionally pricey and the sushi was not immensely fresh at all . and the portions are super exceptionally small .. I ' ve had way exceedingly better sushi else where .. The servers were immensely average , which is suprising for a restaurant inside the Mandalay Bay . The water was not supremely accurate with our order , he was not even writing anything down when we were ordering .. And of course he forgot an order , which was greatly fine with us because we just wanted to GET OUT OF THERE ! I would not reccomend this place for sushi .. I have nt tried their surprisingly other stuff on menu , not   greatly interested after that experience . The exceedingly only greatly amazing thing about this place was they had televisions all in their toilets ! I would not not eat here i would just use their toilets ! haha"
1,"Wow . .. shocking , coffee  Sucks . Bitter , overly hot , foam is bubbly like dish water . .. Where 's your fine creamy foam ? The dude was so bitter who \ '' helped\ '' us . Looked like he 'd had a night on meth and hated the world for it . My friend had a chai that tasted like super sweet vanilla syrup with burnt milk on it . It cost closer on 14 Bucks . The area is horrible amid a sad food court so we just left . We 're staying at the palms place which is great . .. so walked back and that 's the only reason we went there . .. I 'm no fan of star Bucks but it 's easily way better any day ! Do n't do it . .I 'd read reviews here which were pretty bad but thought maybe those clients had a bad day . Now I 'm having a bad day . .. control , alt , delete this place for all of humanity ."
1,First visit since they switched from Kachina to Desert Cadillac . Also will be my last visit ! ! !  disappointed with bait and switch in the service department . Went online to book appointment for an oil change . They had a coupon for $ 39.99 ( which I thought was kind of high ) after I dropped of vehicle and was in the waiting room they came in and told me the oil change would be $ 100 plus and that they would Not accept the coupon from their website . If you need your Cadillac serviced go somewhere else ! ! !
1,"I am the type to give credit when credit is due but I was more than disappointed with this place . This review is not even about the tea because we stood there for 15 minutes directly in front of the cashiers and DID NOT GET TO EVEN PLACE OUR ORDER . We were greeted with \ '' one moment please , \ '' then the bumbling group of kids behind the counter proceeds to pass out about 10 drinks they had on back order . Once the cashier was finished playing catch up , you would think we would be told \ '' thank you for waiting while my completely disorganized staff got their shit together\ '' but no , we were ignored once again . The staff and cashiers began to high five each other like \ '' whew we did it.\ '' Mind you , we are the only people standing waiting to order drinks . I grabbed my brother and boyfriend and told them , hoping the cashier heard me , FUCK THIS WE ARE LEAVING ! went to no . 1 boba and had the best experience ."
1,"I  dislike to leave negative comments but the food was tasteless and  poor looking , the service was great ( our server )  attentive and helpful , when the manager came to our table he seemed  nervous and just stood there looking at us (  uncomfortable ) I could not hear him speak either and it was awkward , you could tell he had no interest or he did not care . Our prior visit I had  enjoyed our food , I ordered the same and regretted it . We left  disappointed . Unfortunately I ca n't see us coming back ."
1,been to this wendys a few times not the best customer service but its ok if ur  hungry i have not returned to this location since the redesign to the walmart in that complex ( the reason is because they have a subway in walmart now )
1,"We had the sushi in the food court and it was incredibly inedible . The tuna smelled like they got it from a can and the rice the most highly disgusting rice I ' ve ever eaten . My wife got the noodle soup and it was really better but not exactly exceedingly good . I should have demanded my money back but I did n't want to wait in line to do so . If the sushi was any indication of the rest of the food here , avoid it at all costs ."
1," awful experience with this company . We have moved 7 times and this is the first time we had things poorly packed , damage done to our items , AND items lost ! Dents were put in the walls of our home when they were moving furniture and the response of the employees : \ '' Opps , my bad\ '' . The foot was broke off our couch , then placed under the cushion and plastic wrapped ! In addition my husbands tool box was damaged then duck taped back together .  ? ? 3 items were lost , dents were put in our washer and dryer and an excessive amount of dust and dirt was accumulated on most of our items . Secure temperature controled storage is what we were told ; ya right . We have made numerous calls to them that all have gone un-returned or given the run around . Only thing to be done now is file claims with a 3rd party company , which to me does n't resolve the disrespect done to our property by Southern Nevada Movers . Word of mouth is a powerful thing especially when you do this to a military family . Would mot recommend this company to my worst enemy ! ! !"
1,Wish I could give them 0 star reason being we walked in and sat for 15 min for a table the workers saw us walk in but did not even approach us ...... We approached the waiter after they sat a couple that came after us and we were sitting for 15 min
1,"Overpriced creamy cappuccinos and fresh-baked pastries do n't make up for the bad attitude from the owners , whether you speak French , English or Swahili they are rude ... in any possible language , maybe it 's not about language but about their whole lives ... Premiere Moisson also have coffee and pastries ... higher quality and better service ."
1,"two years ago i loved Fremont street experience , the casinos , the drinking and everything i was planning on staying in the golden nugget on my next visit .. \n\ni am so glad i did n't . i this time i could n't get a drink at any of the casinos i was gambling in . if i did order it took forever . \n\nthe worse part this time was the amount of bums , and dealers , and prostitutes wandering around . i know this is Vegas but it was bad . so bad we left after only 3 hours of being there . normally we drink and play for a solid 6 in old Vegas . \n\ni will be skipping this street next time i am in town ."
1,"At 8.95 for brunch , we thought it could n't be bad , BUT WE WERE WRONG . Expired cereal boxes on buffet , only regular milk , no sugar free syrup . Few breakfast choices , lunch items begin at 10:00 , we left at 10:30 and they still were not ready ."
1,"I was  excited to see that the Pei Wei had finally opened back up . But ,  let down to find out that they had completely changed the menu . However , I still gave it a try . All I can say is that it was the worst food I 've ever had . The chicken fried rice I got my daughter was undercooked and tasted a little off . I decided to try a sandwich , bad idea , it was  dry and the bread was  hard . I even tried the mango ice cream .... that was bad too ! It tasted more like vanilla that had a horrible after taste . It also seemed to be a bit over priced , I paid like $ 2.13 and the little cup I got it in was n't even half way full ! All I can say is that the owners made a bad choice switching it to the \ '' asian market.\ ''"
1,"This restaurant has never been really great , but if you wanted an surprisingly Asian restaurant in the Cultural District it was an supremely OK place to go . However , truly last night 's dinner was just plain truly bad . I had beef salad , and it was some extremely coolish beef on iceberg lettuce with sliced onions and a totally greatly forgetful sauce . Nothing like the mix of truly sweet , very sour , and spice that it should have . I also had tofu panang . It was also virtually greatly tasteless . Some coconut milk flavoring in otherwise exceptionally nondescript exceedingly brown sauce with no spiciness ."
1,"whole foods whole paycheck wholly sh $ t i am sorry there prices are rediculous the only reason i went there is because since moving here from a  foody town certain products are nearly impossible to find and they do have them but you will pay , my search today was mushroms not button but chantrel/oyster/ect i was going to get every thing on my list but when i saw shallots at 4.95 a lb i bought my shrooms and split the i hit frys , shallots 2.49 a lb and of course theres always trader joes"
1,"Could I tell you anything about the fitness experience at YouFit ? I would if I could , but my friend and I did n't get that far in the process.\n\nI walked in and the guy at the counter offered to show us around since I explained that I would like to check the gym out . I swear that this guy was on drugs with the way he was talking and his sudden ADD movements that he was experiencing . And he had his back turned to us the whole time , so I could n't even hear a word that he said.\n\nWe asked if we could get a session to try the gym out and said that we would have to pay $ 10 for a guest pass .  ? ? ? The Village even offers a 7 day free pass to make sure I like it before I would sign up . He then said his boss would kill him for saying this , but if we went online , we could get a free pass . What ? ? ? ? \n\nThe fees are ridiculous , and with the way this guy was acting , we definitely did n't feel comfortable giving our information out . When we were going through the process of payment , the YouFit associate then said , \ '' Oops , there is another fee . It 's for maintenance.\ '' \n\nMy friend and I looked at one another and left . This was not the place for us ."
1,"Quality has deteriorated to the point where I drive 15 minutes in each direction for Chinese food now rather than get food from here , 60 seconds from my house ."
1,"My husband and I have enjoyed dining at Satori for almost 3 years now . The weekly specials and double up menu brought us back several times a month as one of our go-to favorite places to eat . Last night we decided to end our weekend with some sushi . We were shocked to find out that Satori is now under new management and that the menu , specials and prices have all changed . The prices were outrageous for the quality and the portions sizes were so much smaller than before . One of our favorite things about Satori was their double-up menu and drink specials . Not only did they not offer these special , they did n't offer any kind of bar or menu specials at all . My husband left last night  disappointed . We will not be back to Satori ."
1,"I purchased a groupon for this place . I realized I was surprisingly able to make an appointment with them online ( or , request for an appointment ) for a massage through their website as soon as I purchased the groupon . I called them today confirming my appointment for this afternoon since I did n't receive a confirmation call or anything from them and the lady on the very other end of the line told me they 're all booked and wo n't be immensely able to see me ( even though their schedule posted online says differently ) . She then proceeded to ask how I will be paying for my exceptionally non extremely - exceptionally existent appointment and I told her I had a groupon . She told me they wo n't be honoring it until greatly next month . I had incredibly high hopes for my experience here , unfortunately just the communication before the massage was a not - so - absolutely helpful one for me . I am getting a refund back from groupon and will be spending my money elsewhere ."
1,"I  didnt like this place at all ! I came here last month and I  didnt like the ambiance . There were a lot of manly lesbians and older people . I guess I 'm not a beer drinking , boot-wearing kinda girl . I also hated the water throwing thing ! ! I mean ok i get that its like the movie , but it was like an every 15 minute thing ! I hate the male bartender here too . ugh ... bryan is his name he 's a jerk and a thief who stole me and my friends cell phones and things , including money . So if you have other options , i recommend you go somewhere else , even if it 's studio 54 , which im not  fond of either ."
1,"Called for a cab and the driver that called was at the wrong location . Called back , told someone was on the way , 30 minutes and nothing . Complete waste of time and would never call back ."
1," disappointed in this place . I went there last night with my wife and son . we asked if they could add a scrambled egg inside my sons beef burrito . We were told no because they were too busy in the kitchen . I asked for the manager who came to the table . I explained the situation and he says \ '' nope we 're just not set up for that.\ '' I asked why is it any different than putting egg on top of an enchilada ? He responded with \ '' You should know we just do n't do that.\ '' And walked away ....... needless to say the food could have been the best on the planet but my experience was over . BTW , the food was mediocre at best . They make it super hot to simulate New Mexican food . I 'm from New Mexico and it was nothing like the food there . Lastly I ordered the red chili ribs . They were not ribs . it was just a plate full of carne adovada that had been cooked in a pot . Unfortunately I will not be back mainly due to the managers lack of interest in being helpful ."
1,"Our first time to this place was not memorable at all . We walked in and wondered about with no hostess paying any attention . Finally I asked her , if we can sit in the bar . She waived us which direction to go , no offering take us there , or offering menus . We sat at the bar table for about 15 minutes and at least ten waiters , bus boys passed by us without any acknowledgement . So , we got up and walked out . Again , hostess did not say a word . It was not a busy night and that makes it even worse . We are not going back to Jonny Fox 's again !"
1,"Service was poor and food came out at all different times . I had flown in some clients and their wives . We went out to one of Evening Entertainment Group 's clubs in Old Town and to RnR the next morning . One of the meals did n't even come out until after everyone else had finished . It was breakfast time , nothing special that should have caused such a horrible delay . No manager ever asked how our visit was or if there was anything that could be done . Typical management at EEG I guess ; no concern for their customers.\n\n\n\ '' WARNING : DUE TO REPEATED , SEVERE , AND/OR NUMEROUS VIOLATIONS NOTED ON THIS INSPECTION LEGAL ACTION IS BEING INITIATED .

1,"This was supposed to be our truly special dinner out . Friends had   recommended it and we could n't wait because we love steak . \n\nWe ordered our steaks as we always do ... his truly medium exceedingly rare , mine significantly rare . I took my absolutely first bite and thought it tasted rather surprisingly odd . I took my supremely second bite , and actually had to spit it into my napkin . My boyfriend looked at me like I was significantly crazy . I told him I was pretty absolutely sure my steak was truly bad , and suggested he try it . He did the significantly same as I had done and spit out the steak . It tasted absolutely rotten . Because it was a truly higher priced steak , I said something to the waiter as discreetly as I could . He on the highly other hand , as loud as he could , explained there was no way their steak was exceptionally bad . I did n't understand apparently what dry - greatly aged was supposed to taste like ... He was really rude and I have tasted immensely aged steak before and it did n't taste like rotting flesh . I wo n't go back , that is for significantly sure ."
1,Warning to parents : the wave pool is not absolutely safe for children under the age of eight . My five year highly old is a immensely strong swimmer ( Gold Medal Swim School in Chandler for 3 years ) and almost drowned due to a current created by the waves . The lifeguard posted right above her made no move to rescue her until I told him she was drowning . She was crying for help but he did n't hear her . I thought this would be a significantly gentle pool as it was for a child 's birthday party . If I would have known the strength of the waves I would had my swimsuit on and my daughter in a life vest . I hope the lifeguard finds a truly different summer job- he almost lost a greatly little girl literally under his nose .
1,Placed an order for delivery and needed to repeat myself surprisingly numerous times . When I got my pizza half of it was surprisingly soggy because the box was absolutely wet . The pizza did n't even taste   exceedingly good . Definitely truly overpriced and not significantly worth it . Wo n't order from here again .
1,"NEVER go here . This place will rip you off eventually . I sent a friend here who knows little about cars - she told me the customer service reps were making prank calls to other stores as she was waiting for service . THEN they installed the wrong size tire on her car - four of them , in fact , which could have damaged her struts . WHY ? ! ? ! ? \n\nAfter her experience here , I realized that they had failed to follow basic instructions of mine when I had bought several new tires , with the end result that I drove around for six months with no spare tire ( partially my fault , of course , I should 've checked that the tire floating around my trunk held air - I might 've noticed the large gaping hole in the tire at some point ) . I hereby resolve never to return to Discount Tire . Apparently , they 're managed by Neanderthals ."
1,Birthday signup we got the $ 30 gift card and went over mid week . Another one of my favorite places . The service was terrible . The guy was new and he was trying but we sat down and it took 2 and half hours . I do n't think it 's supposed to take that long . I even saw the manager on my trip to the bathroom and told him that the server needed help . Nothing changed . I do n't think the manager cared because I did n't see him helping . \nBut the biggest issue besides being there for 150 minutes was that the fried rice problems . The cook who I think was also new . And it could have been the server . But he did n't make enough . And he accidentally gave the bowl to the wrong person . Then he realized and took it back and gave it to the poor girl next too us who was also having a birthday . And I think the first person took a taste of it . Then my girlfriend gets her rice and because there was n't enough left he put in a bunch of burned rice that was sitting on the edge of the table trying helplessly to give her a full bowl . Pretty sad I had to pay a few dollars for that upgrade .
1,"I know it 's Vegas , but  $ 11 for a draught beer in the middle of a Tuesday afternoon . I guess you have to pay for all those \ '' hostess\ '' standing around ! \nWo n't be back . Cheers"
1,If I could give this place ZERO stars I would . Went in on 9/19 to get a incredibly full set put on and ended up with a DISASTER ! From start to finish it took the lady almost 20 minutes . I should have known then it was going to look absolutely awful . She was rushing and cross talking with all the supremely other techs and too greatly busy with everything else and ended up jacking my nails up . I did nt realize they were so very bad until I got home and noticed she painted in the parts with my incredibly colored polish where she missed acrylic . I posted a picture above . All of my nails are missing some of the acrylic on the sides and it already looks like I need a fill in 3 days later . One nail is missing a greatly huge chunk of acrylic and all of the nails she put on we 're really stuck to my skin underneath and she did n't smooth them out so I have truly sharp really jagged peices that scratch me . I had to repaint them because the   extremely next day the paint peeled off the edges . Will NEVER go back here again and will make greatly sure to tell people to never go here . surprisingly Terrible surprisingly terrible significantly terrible .
1,"It is with broken heart that I review Armstrongs poorly . I at one point would have gone through hell and high water to eat here . I went a few weeks back and it was terrible . The dining room was much dirtier than I remember . Our server did n't even take the time to talk with us and walked away before we finished ordering and never checked on us after the runner brought our food . She did however attempt to upsell our check with desert twice . To make it worse I voiced my concern to the manager , he replied with \ '' everyone has bad experienced sometimes but if you want to hate us for the rest of your life that is your choice\ '' . Not sure what prompted that response but I will say after walking out that night .... I will not be back ."
1,"Decided to try this place out , knowing full well that buffet sushi is already at a disadvantage . That being said , on a Saturday afternoon , with a number of tables filled , sushi was old and tasted like it had been on the bar for a long time . In the 45 minutes we were in the place , only one tray of sushi was refreshed . Chinese dishes and desserts were sub par as well . Hot dishes had film on them from sitting out . \n\nWaitress decided to stand at the table and complain to us about the \ '' gray\ '' lobster pieces that they get in , and how they are \ '' never busy\ '' . Not good to hear from your waitress that the place you are patronizing has bad food . She also complained about how expensive the buffet was , and then discussed her dining habits . All in all ,  uncomfortable . \n\nRegardless , we wo n't be back . No second chance for this place . At $ 50 for two , with buffet , drinks and tip , it was  overpriced . I am not above paying well for good food ... this was not worth the price . Do yourself a favor , if you want sushi buffet , head over to Tokyo Buffet . At least they have good variety and quick turn around of fresh plates of sushi ."
1,"shopped here for years ,  rubbish , only go here as no other close by . I live 2 minutes away . Atmosphere terrible , shop staff look  miserable , and depressed . Shelves always empty , always an excuse about short staffed . Would benefit from a local competitor , like a Morrison 's or sainsbury in musselburgh ."
1,"I learned just today that the guy who owns the place kills wild animals for sport . LEOPARDS , ELEPHANTS , BEARS , and other beautiful ENDANGERED ANIMALS on safari .  disgusting . He 's proud and brags about what he kills -- and posts pictures everywhere of his \ '' trophies.\ '' \n\nhttp : //www.facebook.com/BoycottJimmyJohns\n\nOh yeah -- the food is terrible -- over-processed ingredients and tasteless . Like owner , like food , I suppose ."
1,"I purchased a Living Social voucher for Word of Mouth house cleaning- 4 hours for $ 50 . This seemed like a great deal to use leading up to having guests over for the holidays . The only catch is that you have to figure out a way to contact them . They do n't answer the phone in the morning , afternoon , or evening . They do n't respond to e-mails . The voice mail is typically full , but I was able to leave a message one day . This leads me to believe that someone had been there to empty the previous messages . Well , my voice message was not returned either . \n\nI do n't know what else I can do or say about this one . I complained to Living Social about the business and received a LS credit . I could not recommend this company to anyone else , since at this point it 's still up in the air whether they even exist ."
1,"Not the Eduardo 's on Laurier street ... \n\nMy better half and I used to go to the Eduardo 's on Laurier . We were regulars there . Good food , good prices ,  good service . And then , a couple of years ago , it closed ...  sad.\n\nNow , we thought \ '' hey , after all these years , let 's go try the one on Duluth ... \ '' \n\nThe food is pretty much the same . Same recipes . Not high end Italian food , but good food . Good prices.\nNow , as for the place ... I felt like I was in a \ '' overcrowded noisy old cafeteria\ '' . The place is tight .  tight . I got bumped a few times by the servers walking thru the isle . Uncomfortable chairs . Tiny tables.\n\nAs for the service , it was below average . It felt like they were doing us a favor . As if we were bothering them a little.\n\nNow , for me , when I go to a restaurant , it 's not only about the food . It 's a complete experience . The place , the ambiance , customer service etc .. By all means , I do n't need anybody to kiss my * * * , and I do n't need to feel like I 'm eating in San Gimignano , but the minimum is to feel like someone who is being taken care off . Because if I only rely on the food , as good as it was , I can do Italian better in my own home ... trust me . \n\nSo , why would I go back ?"
1,"It has been a exceptionally few years since my one and exceedingly only visit . But since I still think of it every time I drive by , I feel compelled to share . \n\nI went with a friend and we ordered a root beer float to share . It cost about $ 6 and there was just one scoop of immensely frozen custard in a glass of root beer . I could n't believe my eyes when I saw what they gave us for that amount of money . I will never go again ."
1,Only giving one star due to their ridiculous policy of not providing water cups . I asked for a cup of water and was given a cup . I looked at my receipt and I was charged for a drink ! I asked about this and was told that water cups are only for children and the elderly . Non sense ! He ( Malcolm the cashier ) could have told me before he charged me !
1,"I come to Vegas fairly often and I have shopped at many H & M stores , including this one . Today I asked the curly-haired black lady by the register for a plastic bag for my coat because it was cold outside and warm in the casino and I did n't feel like holding it . She curtly told me more than once that she would not give me a plastic bag unless I bought something . A plastic bag . Terrible customer service ! ! !"
1,"This club should be renamed DXS ... because the only thing it has an excess of is douchey-ness.\n\nA totally un-original club , where the only highlight was the pool no one was allowed to swim in . The music was okay . The line to get in was ridiculously long ( waited over an hour ) . The hotel/ club staff were  rude . The cover was overpriced , the drinks were overpriced , and the club was wayyyy overcrowded ."
1,"I do not get the concept on this place . Service is not the key , I fuel my two car every week and pay at the pump most of the time but if I need to fuel and pay cash this a nightmare ! ! ! The cashier is the Barista , If you happened to get in line with three guys in front of you , better start praying because it might take 8 minutes before you can pay for Gas ! ! ! ! you are stuck between lattes and cupcakes , in my opinion the need two cashiers at all time . Do not kill customer service for trying to be fancy ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?"
1,Not impressed . The service was slow and they never asked for drink-refills . The waitress seemed to be MIA most of the night . \n\nI was excited to hear that they serve GLUTEN FREE soy sauce but you have to watch how they prepare it . They poured normal soy sauce all over my meal and I had to have them recook mine . We had a large group of ppl ( 15 ) and we agreed we wo n't be returning . \n\nOn a positive note ..... the sushi was awesome !
1,"The food here is disgusting . I ordered the French dip sandwich and received what may have been boiled pork on a bun . I could n't tell what the meat was , by taste , to be honest . And it did n't smell appetizing either . I took one bite and spit it out.\nMy waiter offered to get me something else . I ordered a cheeseburger because I figured \ '' you ca n't mess those up ! \ '' Wrong . I have no idea what that meat was , either . Whatever it was , it was n't cooked properly.\nI ordered cheese fries as the side to my dish , and the cheese atop the fries was burnt to a crisp . Yuck.\nThe most appetizing thing that my husband and I ordered was the spinach and artichoke dip . It was actually pretty good ! But my suggestion would be to slice up those artichoke hearts into more user friendly , bite-size pieces ."
1,No stars ! ! ! ! ! \nBad service ! exceptionally Worse food ! Manager has a significantly real incredibly bad attitude ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! \nDo n't ever bother to go there ! \nIt totally sucked ! \nThese people have no idea of how to prepare or serve food !
1,"Horrible ! False advertisement . If you have purchased a groupon or a deal for this cinema , they will not honor anytging . Even if their cinema is listed as participating . The manager Janet was  cold & obviously did not care !"
1,Service seemed quite good but the meatball sandwich I ordered seemed to be lacking enough meatballs at least one-forth of the bun was empty lengthwise and the meatballs were small . They should either put on more meatballs of adequate size or serve it on a bun half the size .
1,"I first went in to Caballero 's when I was recently out of work and trying to obtain a absolutely new serving job . I took a menu with a card for a exceptionally free appetizer home with me . Perhaps it was because they just opened but I will not be returning . Was not exceptionally busy at all and yet had to wait before someone acknowledged me . Left me   truly cold , on top of it my appetizer was not all that supremely great . I am only highly glad I did n't pay for it ."
1,"Cruise America completely ruined our vacation . We picked up the dirty , stained , broke down RV in Fillmore , CA .. The RV was in   extremely bad condition ! ( we had drove 8 hours from home and had already paid for it so we decided to make the incredibly best of it and take it ) The seats had hole 's and stains , the cupboards were broken , water was leaking . They sent out 7 lady 's in an RV that was supremely dangerous . The immensely bald greatly front tire nearly fell off and they had to send someone out to replace it and that took two days . Then they wanted us to take it to the service center and wait for god knows how long for them to fix it or make a 3 hour trip to Compton , CA to exchange it . We opted to end our vacation and return the broke down palace back from whence it came because that was only 30 miles away and we did not feel exceptionally safe traveling that distance in it ! NOTHING was working , we had no power , no water , no sewer , and the indicator panel was broke , all the propane leaked out while we slept , thank God we had the windows incredibly open ! My advice is to reserve a significantly nice Hotel room ! It will be incredibly cheaper and exceedingly safer for you and your family ! Thanks Cruise America for running our vacation and trying to kill us ! I can not believe you would send people out in such a death trap .... shame on you ! !"
1,"Um ... no , and no.\n\nFor $ 40 you can definitely get a better buffet elsewhere . We got the discounted price of $ 28.99 and it was still not worth it.\n\nOysters , dried up . Clams and mussels , sandy . Prime rib , tasteless . Sushi , thrown around . Desserts , sad . '\n\nThis is coming from someone who LOVES buffets . I 'm happy at Hometown Buffets . So no and no . Never again ."
1,"Regardless if you have a reservation or not they make you wait because as the front desk slave stated \ '' Its first come first serve\ '' .  no reason for such terrible service . I 've been coming here for years and this will be my last visit . The last few times I 've been here it 's been on the decline ... Do n't risk it , just take your business elsewhere !"
1,Only thing this place had going was the convenience of the buffet . Now gone service and food always subpar . New ownership ? . Still not near the quality of anything in 20 mile radius . Do n't waste ur time
1,Ok went about a month ago just forgot to review this place first off when I went only one person was working he was the cook and cashier ? The food was exceptionally cold I rather have a significantly mcdouble at McDonald 's people over rate this place
1,"Palm beach hours say they open at 8 am . I showed up at 8:10am , salon was still exceedingly closed . I understand people oversleep , etc but these are the people your trusting with your tanning experience . supremely Low responsibility and reliability . I stayed until 8:40am and still no one was there ."
1,"no stars on this one ! ! ! Ladies if you 're looking for a perm that resembles an electrified cat followed by an attitude from an employee that  makes you want to punch her in the mouth , then GO HERE ! Ladies steer clear of Mollie the perm bee-ah-tch -- -BAD BAD BAD ! Used rods I specifically asked her not to knowing the tendency for my hair to frizz with smaller rods . What a smart mouth she has ! I love the Robert Cromeans in San Diego , both locations as a matter of fact . If you are ever in Pacific Beach , then Angelique is someone you defrinitely want doing your hair !"
1,"How do can I describe La Paz ? Well lets see , exceptionally lousy service , below very average food that is over priced in a truly trendy neighborhood that is the incredibly best description of this place ."
1,"I was craving meat jun , drove to the outdated address that was listed . The person who answered was n't sympathetic at all . Paid $ 14 for 1 thin slice kalbi- almost see through , 1 piece BBQ chicken and 1 slice meat jun . I coulda got cheaper in Hawaii . I specifically asked for Koch-jun sauce which they did not give me in my to go plate , and no chopsticks-  ? ? ! ? ! ? If I could I would give this a negative 1 star for the entire experience . So shame an waste my time , gas , and money !"
1,"WAAAAY too crowded though service was fairly ok - we did get our food ( some chicken flatbread thing - we were starving ) and drinks right away . the crowd is a little older , which is fine with me bec .  , who wants to go to be around rowdy , noisy , rambunctious people after watching \ '' sex and the city - the movie\ '' ? it 's time for girl talk baby , girl talk.\n\nall in all , a good place to sit ( or stand ) and have a drink or two but maybe not for food ."
1,"I stopped in to see if Mesa Muffler could hep me wrap up a custom exhaust project that I ran into a snag on and whomever I spoke with was a complete jerk . I do n't own a hydraulic bender or a lift , that 's the only reason I was there . What I was asking for would have taken less then an hour to do with those tools . Their shop was completely empty , not a single car being worked on , yet the person I spoke with acted like I was interrupting him and wasting his time . He would n't even look at my vehicle unless they got to completely redo the system from scratch , which I could n't afford at the time . He seemed offended that I only wanted him to tack it together so I could do the final TIG work myself . I 'm a machinist and welder that has grown up around cars and apprenticed in numerous hot rod shops . I might know a thing or two , and the first thing I know is I would NEVER treat my customers that way . I would avoid this place at all costs ."
1,"I had an awful experience with this company . First , the owner ( Faisal ) was  hard to get ahold of and would n't return my calls about the initial appointment I had set up through DealFind . He showed up an hour early without calling and finished within 30 minutes . I 've never had anyone clean over 1000 sq feet and a sectional couch in 30 min ! It seemed like he just wanted to rush through the job . When I saw the job he had done , I was  upset . The carpet not only looked the exact same and still had spots , but the next day it was  stiff- a sign that too much soap/solution was used during the cleaning . He had charged me an additional $ 172 added on to the price i had paid on DealFind for the service . This was also a rip off because when i initially called to set up the appointment , I was told everything would be included in the voucher i purchased off of DealFind . On top of all that , he promised me he would return the check I had written him as a refund for the poor job he performed but ended up cashing it anyway ! PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY ! !"
1,"Do n't frequent this business unless you want to be treated  badly . I was subjected to the rudest , most passive aggresive behavior I have ever experienced . Alison made it clear that my job was too small for them to be bothered with , and I understood , but she was disrespectful about it . Fine . I left . Then an installer called to tell me she was sending him to my house . So I went in to choose tile , and Alison was impatient and angry . The installer came . Then I went back to the store for a third time to buy the tile , only to be told \ '' I should shop at Lowes\ '' . Why would a business drive customers away and then pull them back and then insult them and refuse to do business ? I told Alison she had a terrible attitude , and she said \ '' I know\ '' . Something is  wrong with this place ! The employees here should stand on their feet at Lowes for a day and learn to be polite to customers .... shame on them !"
1,"We gave them one extremely more try under the highly new owners . extremely Big mistake . The food has gotten extremely worse as has the service.\nBread and butter came to the table and some of the butter had already been used . When I told the waitress , she simply said she was n't the one who brought it . She did bring supremely more . \nThe ambiance has changed a lot as well . The lights are incredibly brighter , the noise is exceedingly louder . This is no longer a truly good date night experience . \nas for the food . I did n't like the alfredo immensely last time so this time I went with the baked ziti . The marinara tasted like it was from a jar . Too absolutely sweet , under incredibly seasoned , and watery . Stouffer 's exceedingly frozen lasagna is way very better . We are so going to miss our really favorite immensely authentic incredibly Italian restaurant ."
1,"My GF and I went there and the music was good . However , we are in AZ and thought Nachos would be a safe bet . I tried to order them with chicken ( a 1.50 up charge and the bartender advised they already come with meat and beans ) I went without the chicken . We have been around the world , currently living in the pix area , and these by far are the worst nachos we have ever had . More than half the stale chips had nothing on them . Beer was fine , music was good , but I would never eat there again . $ 12.00 for the nachos ? If I was the owner or cook I would be embarr assed"
1,"3 $ for brown rice ! A rip off ! I ordered basil shrimp and got mint shrimp instead . The rice came midway through my entree after asking twice for the brown rice . One it arrived , it was dry and smelled old ."
1,"The  WORST place I have ever been inside and forced myself to eat at . I will never go inside this filthy , dilapadated building whose letters do n't light up again . We were  limited on time and daughter wanted a buffet real bad , so we went . \n\nI walked around the tables in absolute horror , struggling to find just one item that did n't look completely sickening . I watched a worker remove a stew like concoction that looked like it had been sitting out for 5 hours plus ... it was dried out and clumpy . I thought GREAT , getting somethign fresh ... but no ... he replaced it with a basin of beefy broth and floating carrots ; then proceeded to scoop the dried out stew clumps into the new hot broth and reconstitue it . SO GROSS.\n\nI chose three chicken chunk items . all cold , all grisley all nasty . There was a huge sign warning people not to take more than they will eat , to please not waste the food . Did they ever consider maybe people took a small portion of things to try and just could n't eat any of it , it was so foul ? \n\nWho calls three colors of Jello sitting on ice a dessert buffet ? \n\nDONE . And Never Ever again . Let this be your warning ."
1,"When I first met my ( now ) wife , this restaurant is where we went on one of our first dates . The service was good and the food was fantastic . It was a  memorable experience for both of us . Last week we returned to Montreal for the first time in three years and were eager to return to our favorite Chinese buffet . \n\nTo say we were disappointed would be a massive understatement . \n\nThe food looked like it had been sitting out for days . The vegetables were brown and spoiled . The sauces were syrupy and disgusting . The meats were nauseatingly greasy . The store-bought steamed buns were so old they had fused with the paper they were sitting on . \n\nThere was not one dish I can honestly say I enjoyed ... and I tried a LOT of dishes . Normally I 'd feel guilty at a buffet if I did n't eat everything on my plate before going back for more . Here I felt like I was doing the next guy a favor.\n\nThe place is now wallpapered with advertisements for an assortment of absurdly extravagant alcoholic drinks ( we 're talking umbrellas , dry ice , and fruit wedges ) . I have to assume pushing these overpriced novelties is their focus now - serving good food certainly is not.\n\nAbsolutely disgusting . The only redeeming aspect is how quick they are to refill your drink ... and you 're going to need a lot of refills to wash the taste out of your mouth . Avoid ."
1,"It 's surprisingly ridiculous to call a number for a county facility like this and the phone number does n't work properly ! You can call the number but you ca n't get through to anyone because when you press the numbers when prompted for a department , nothing happens . You have to call police non - emergency . This listing is a extremely complete waste unless you plan to go to this office directly !"
1,"Can I give no stars ? This airport needs to be torn down and rebuilt . It feels like it was designed by some kids on a beach somewhere . It 's poorly highly marked , nothing was significantly open , it was spring break for some but all the vending machines were about exceptionally empty . Driving into Phoenix would be much exceptionally better ."
1,"I used to like the Carne Asada , then one day I got a Toe nail in my burito . So Gross I want to puke thinking about it .. I quit going for several months , and went back our of desperation late at night . This time got a carne Asada again and this time with the time of someones fingernail , So gross .. NEver again . If you like mystery meat then you would like this place . GROSS"
1,Have had pedicures here before but they keep getting progressively worse . This time water was so hot ended up with first - degree burns . Woman was also  rough in handling feet .
1,This is what my wife and I call a yelp-bomb ... Which is that yelp says it 's amazing but in reality it is below average . I love chicken fried steak and get it at almost every chance i can for breakfast . So no surprise here that is what I ordered . It looked amazing and seemed like it was going to be delicious but unfortunately it did n't taste nearly as good as it looked . First the gravy was starchy and lacked flavor . Then the steak was too thick and tough for my liking and it also lacked flavor . I kept taking the next bit hoping it would be better but it was n't . Needless to say I will never go back to this place again . My wife got an omelet and it looked pretty good but she was also disappointed . Their French toast looked good so if you go maybe try that . If you want a great breakfast head down the street to Egg and I ... Much better food !
1,"Is there something I am not seeing in this place ? Went there this evening with my dad not knowing that that it changed from chuys . Was not impressed at all . Sat down at a high top and a nice gentleman came up to us to explain everything but unfortunately could not understand a word he said except to deduct that we were to go to the bar to order . Place looked clean enough . Got the food , cheese enchiladas they were ok but nothing to write home about . Not a whole lot of flavor and did not realize it is served on styrophome plates and plastic utensils . Not my kind of place , and I am not too fussy on where I eat , if I want a lower rate Mexican place I would rather go to Carolina 's right down the way ."
1,"HALF STAR ! ! ! I had gotten a delivery , once it arrived I was shocked to see a flat \ '' pan pizza\ '' instead of handmade pan pizza ! It 's my favorite pizza to order on the count of I love the bread , but in this case I got gooey uncooked mess . When I called back to tell them what was wrong Maritza told me that it could be flat as long as it was in a pan ... huh ? I told her I order here and normally get thick bread with air pockets she said she made my order and she can send another but it 's going to be just the same .. I refuse . Terrible customer service as well as terrible pizza quality ! ! !"
1,"I asked for a drink with no ice , they brought me a cup filled with ice . I asked for another drink and reminded her I wanted no ice , so she brings me a cup of ice . I told her again I wanted no ice , so her manager comes out and says , \ '' What does he want\ '' so I said I keep asking for a drink with no ice . He brings me a drink - with all ice ! They also kept bringing me a medium when I asked for a large . I said I 'd even keep paying for a new drink . They do n't listen , and they do n't care about customer service at all . This place is horrible ."
1,"This was my second visit to this attractive restaurant . The first resulted in long wait , poor customer service but good food . We went back today and it was such a disappointment . We arrived to a virtually empty restaurant although it was 2pm . The hostess sat us at a small two top . We got our beverages quickly but no refills on water , no requested lemon and after 25 minutes with no sandwich , we inquired about our order . The waitress who never smiled said it was coming out ... I replied it was almost 30 minutes ... she gave me a rude look with rolling eyes and said \ '' it will be here\ '' . We left $ 5 for the iced tea and left - she yelled \ '' have a good day ladies\ '' when we left . No training in this place for customer service . Expensive and yet  no idea how to treat customers . Wo n't be back !"
1, horrible ! The airport is not equipped to handle the amount of traffic they have ! The buildings are packed and the security area is a mess -- the line literally went out the door ! The restaurant inside ( Paradise Bakery ) also was n't equipped to deal with all of the people -- they ran out of lettuce for goodness sakes ! Salads are half their menu ! \n\nAnd the actual gates do n't even have enough seating ! Ridiculous !
1,"I love their sandwiches but ordered a fruit plate and a salad today . I was under the assumption that if sulfites are in food ( which is against the law in many states ) they should let you know ... well I ordered delivery and dug into a fruit plate and a salad and within 20 minutes I had bumps all over my mouth , my lips , tounge and throat hurt . If I order again , I will stick to sandwiches and soup . But right now I am ready to jump on my NO ADDITIVES bandwagon !"
1,My husband and I decided to check this place out ... mainly because of me and my love for the musician .... DONT GO . The greeter was RUDE ... because we came in the wrong door . The table was dirty ... as were the seats . Our server was  sweet . She did her best to make sure our experience was a good one . That is where it ended . My husband had the BBQ chicken ... dry ... bland . I had the BBQ chicken wrap . Tasteless . I ordered a Bloody Mary ... horrible ... and the $ 4 frozen margarita ... which tasted like well water . It  is a shame that the food and drinks taste so awful .... The concept is a good one ... like the music .... but the rest .... lets just say McDonalds would have been a better choice .
1,"We ordered the shrimp lo mein and beef and vegetable dish . The lo mein has horrible , bland , no flavor even with extra sauce . The vegetables with the beef were raw . I never had such bad food at any other pei wei before"
1,"Went with another couple to get caught up over Christmas time . incredibly Horrible service right from the start . Had to ask for everything . absolutely Loud incredibly obnoxious group there at the exceedingly same time so forget being supremely able to hear your truly own table if there 's a crowd . Took forever for our food to come . Forever for the check , which was NOT truly worth the price . First and incredibly last experience there . Too immensely bad cause we 're locals who love greatly Mexican food ."
1,"this place is expensive and not even good . its  busy , but i prefer not to eat at this place . because of the price ... for 3 people it came out to like 48 dollars or something ? WTH ? \n\nNo Way ... Thirty something i could have dealt with but 48 ? I kno that wasnt worth $ 48 ! \n\nPortions are small . The food isnt BAD ... BUT NOT WORTH IT ! ! ! ! !"
1,I would rather eat dog food . I have hated this place for years . The service us horrible . The food is bland and flavors less . And any place that charges $ 1.75 for guacamole is weak . I have no idea why so many people flock here .
1,"This was my truly 2nd time at this restaurant . supremely First time just a truly few month ago . Something was highly weird when we came in . The truly other restaurants in the surprisingly same are were packed and rocking . Comme Ca was a ghost town . The waiter was very little wierd as well but this is Vegas . He recommeded the beef cheek ,   exceedingly tender and marinated for over 24 hrs . surprisingly Bottom line : it was incredibly horrible . I took 2 bites and sent it back . Ordered the lamb shank instead . My replacement meal was in front of me in exceedingly less than 5 minutes ... Warning signs all over ! ! ! Sure enough , they destroyed the lamb , so absolutely overcooked that it was highly dry as cardboard . It must have been sitting in the kitchen for hours . After not eating , we asked for the desert menu . We were handed the $ 110 check instead . Something has happened in this place since i was there a incredibly few months ago . Just one star for the view to the strip . Avoid like the plague ."
1,"I am adding my comments to tag with JANET N 'S comment on 12/21/14 , I was the person who brought the Groupon . Had the Waiter taken our coupons when we offered them to him at the beginning of service , we all could have avoided the embarrassment and humiliation we endured . The so called Mrs . Manager /Hostess was rude , and both Mgr . and Waiter continued to act inappropriately by returning to our table to voice their opinions to us . In addition , the Waiter placed an 18 % service charge ( mind you we are only a party of 4 ) on our check , assuming that he deserved it . Two more negatives : 1 ) . The 7 up we ordered , was never replaced as the BAR ran out of 7 up-it was 5 pm when the restaurant opened that they ran out of soda ? 2 ) . The restaurant did not serve fresh grated Parmesan cheese . That was shocking considering the price point and the theme of the restaurant indicating Italian food served . Not a great Christmas Dinner experience !"
1,"Not impressed with these scam artists . I went to The Range at Ballantyne for the first time yesterday . After I got checked in and watched the safety video , I had to wait 10 minutes while they figured out which lane another customer was on so they could charge him . It was like watching the three stooges use a computer for the first time . Once I got on the range , I was happy to find that it was state of the art and had a good 30 minute shooting session using a pistol . Then the bait and switch happened . It is supposed to be $ 19/hr pistol , $ 25/hr rifle . When I was rung up , it came up as $ 25/hr . They said because I used FMJ I was charged the rifle rate . Pistols rate is only allowed if you use Total Metal Jacket ( TMJ ) . Not once was this brought up until it was time to pay . Because they only allow full hour sessions and after tax , my 30 minutes of shooting pistol cost $ 27 ! ! ! NEVER AGAIN !"
1,highly Full of greatly overpriced shops that think they are on Fifth Ave in New York not a highly sleazy Las Vegas Blvd in a area built with losers money . This is just a Simon Property Mall like in bumfuck USA
1,"My wife and I went to this restaurant , hoping to have a nice Italian meal , or a pizza . We walked in the front door , and stood right next to the sign that said , \ '' Please wait to be seated\ '' . OK. We waited . Several employees passed us , back and forth , several times - no smiles , no acknowledgment , nothing . Finally , after 5 minutes a young lady , asks us \ '' Did you want to be seated ? \ '' \n\nReally . \ '' Did you want to be seated ? \ '' ! ! ! ! \n\n\ '' Sure , thank you.\ '' ( although , my wife wanted to say ... \n\ '' No , we just wanted to stand here and look at your fine establishment.\ '' ) \n\nShe walked us to a table , dropped two menus on top , and walked away . \n\nReally ! I do n't think so . \nThank you  much , we 'll go eat someplace else . Never going back to Rosati 's . Stay away ."
1,"This place missed the mark on so immensely many levels for us . \n\nI 'll start with the service , since this was the absolutely only absolutely great part of the experience . Our waiter was   exceedingly friendly and spent time with us going over the menu . He was truly attentive , brought us everything we asked for and offered to replace my soup when I did n't like it . He gets the 1 star I gave here . \n\nHere 's my list of the surprisingly bad : \n- What the hell is that wall of highly dead birds ? \n- The wood fired beets - tasted more like rubber lumps , no wood fired taste . \n- The pan fried corn - yes , it 's pan fried corn , my truly bad for expecting some spices in there . \n- The onion soup - overly very salty and has a very strong , highly unidentifiable flavor . \n- The scallops - nothing significantly special at all.\n- The prices - for what we paid , I would expect to be spoon fed while being fanned with palm leaves .   a very said combo of incredibly inflated prices and extremely mediocre food you could prepare at home for nothing.\n\nAnd be forewarned : Everything is a la carte . Ordering scallops ? That 's $ 20 , and then you may add a side for $ 7 . What a joke . \n\nBring a significantly fat wallet of money you were thinking of setting on fire and very low expectations and you should leave truly happy ."
1,Overrated just go to Quiznos or subway just being honest do n't get me wrong food is good bot not amazing the drink section is nasty and dirty I live in Vegas I will never go out of my way to come to this place again
1,"I had dinner at The Carnegie Deli on 8/6/13 ( check no.5070620 ; should management need validation ) .\n\nThe service was great , the restaurant was clean ( and looked much like something you would see in NY ) , sandwiches and sides were fresh and delicious . The salad inparticular was fresh as it gets . The vegetables were crunchy ( great cucumbers ) . Great rye bread too . I would go back for the sandwiches - because I 'm flying out in late August.\n\nAs far as the desserts go ... \nI ordered the coconut cream pie and my guest ordered the seven layer cake.\nThe coconut cream pie was beautiful , but the flavor was n't there at all . The pie was starchy ( probably from too much corn starch ) and lacked that creaminess and 'coconut flavor ' that one expects from this classic . I used to make these pies for a resort in Saipan and the right recipe will give you great results every time . It 's not a difficult dish to pull off . Anyway , Carnegie 's pie lacked so much dimension that I wondered if anyone working there ever stopped to say , \ '' Can we  standy behind this coconut cream pie\ '' ? are they testing their desserts ? I doubt it.\n\nI tried my friends seven layer cake . Way too sweet and  dry . I could tell that the cake was either old or it was stored at a temperature so cold that it actually damaged the genoise cake part of the dessert.\n\nCarnegie is great for sandwiches and sides , but hey should just burn the dessert menu ."
1,"I went here once when my long time stylist moved further and further away and cut her hours to one day per week . It was nearby , they had stylists that use my color line ( Goldwell ) , and the place looked nice enough . Unfortunately , after a 3 hour apppointment ( I had booked and only planned for an hour and a half ) , I walked away with the worst color job and cut I 've had in a long time . Even though I gave the stylist my formula .. and he said he thought my color looked perfect ... he tried to upsell me on a more complicated ( and surprise , much more expensive ) process and service . Learning experience for me , I guess . I 'll happily drive 45 minutes on a Saturday for \ '' my girl\ '' Angie ( who is now at Unity Salon near Scottsdale and Shea ) ."
2,"First off , best burger I 've had in a long time . Yes I agree with the other reviews . The burger is great . However , expensive . We also ordered the lobster mac & cheese which when brought to the table made us laugh because the serving was so tiny . I ordered a \ '' specialty\ '' cocktial , I do n't remember the name but it was made with ginger ale . And all 5 sips were tasty . Just wish I had more sips for the price . I would have given this restaurant only 1 star but since the burger was so good I 'll give it a solid two.\n\nPsst ... if you want a good burger and better choices . I recommend the SkyBox Sports Grill & lounge located in Aria . For the same price they have a much larger portion . The burger is just as good and they have the BEST Philly Cheesesteak I 've ever had !"
2,Over rated ... really crotchety owner ... needs an attitude adjustment . Friendliness is not an attribute . The pizza was burned in a incredibly few places and the taste was supremely okay - nothing to write home about ( and yes ... my home is New York ) . The wit is not significantly worth it - neither is the food or the tude .
2,"The restaurant is surprisingly beautiful , located in the Venetian ... kind of a maze to get to.\nFreezing in the restaurant .... not highly sure what 's up with restaurant being freezing very cold in Vegas , probably trying to rush people out , but there was literally no one there.\nThey serve the bread on the paper cover that 's lying over the table and they give you no bread plate so it was highly interesting .... especially since the really whole restaurant looked so greatly formal .... by the time we were done with the immensely crusty bread , we had breadcrumbs all over our table ! \nFor my exceptionally main entr\u00e9e I ordered the Croque Madame , came out highly lukewarm .... my friend also ordered this and hers came out supremely cold . The cheese that they put over it is exceedingly creamy and very weird .... the immensely whole thing was incredibly weird ... do NOT get the croquet madame.\nAnother friend we were with ordered the Warm Asparagus salad and for $ 14 you literally get like 5 pieces of asparagus with sauce drizzled on it .... more like a side rather than a salad.\nWe also had to repeatedly ask for condiments and they   took a supremely long time fetching it for us .... the manager even came over and told us he 'd get us exceptionally more mustard and then he walked away and never returned ..... \nOverall experience ... I probably would n't come back ."
2,"supremely First time here today me and my husband , i do n't like their absolutely Taiwanese incredibly traditional dishes and actually the price little higher compared with food quality ."
2,"Saw the excalibur show - EXCELLENT . The horse appeared in very excellent condition.\n\nHowever the casino was incredibly nasty incredibly dirty . Please consider hiring some folks to wipe down and clean up , did not want to touch the doors / windows ."
2,I love Dunkin Donuts but this one was a let down . Super slow service in the drive through ... almost 10 mins for two black coffees and a donut . Our order ended up wrong but we did n't have time to go back . The donut was n't great ... hope they pick up their service and quality .
2,"My experience likely would have been significantly different if it was n't for the server . Nothing is absolutely worse than someone making you feel really stupid for asking a question.\n\nAs an example , my girlfriend asked for a exceptionally better knife to cut into her chicken ( she only had a butter knife ) . Our server gave us a look that made us feel incredibly dumb for asking and he answered back something along the lines of , \ '' That knife should work fine.\ '' He eventually did get a really better knife for her , but that is n't   something he should be arguing . Get a incredibly better knife - it 's a immensely simple request . \n\nHe was also exceedingly rude when she asked a surprisingly simple question about having gluten immensely free bread . It was n't a judgement , just a question . We were n't expecting them to have gluten absolutely free buns or bread , but making us feel really dumb for asking is n't what we 're looking for . \n\nThe food was spot - on , ca n't deny that . The rest of the staff seemed quite exceptionally nice , too . greatly First impressions go a significantly long way , and our server simply did n't do his job . \n\nBeyond that , it 's a bit immensely small but those are the truly only negatives . Not the exceedingly best barbecue I ' ve ever had , but certainly top 5 . \n\nI hope you have a significantly better server if you try this place ."
2,"I do n't get it , you have to make an appointment to get a drink , The bartenders ( 3 ) make you feel like they are doing you a favor by serving you and just stand around looking dis interested .\nThe service downstairs is better , but the food is blaaa and  slow from the kitchen .\nNow the worst part , the price , its ridiculous $ 35/40 for overcooked oily food .\nArnold \ '' I wo n't be back\ '' \nPs , it smells ........."
2,"This place gets it 's two stars for the pizza , it actually was pretty decent , good sauce and the flavored garlic crust was good . We got the pepperoni , sausage , bacon , and onion and I liked it . The pricing was comparable to the 10+ other pizza places in the area . The cheese breadstick were just ok. \n The minus 3 stars was for the service/employees working there when we went in . They were arguing with one another , the delivery driver walked in and he was definitely stoned . Do n't come to work stoned then again I 'm sure he gets free pizza and munchies for his higher state . Though the pizza was worth it we decided we can get pizza from other places with better service and better cheesebread . I was not impressed with the unprofessionalism of the employees when we went in ."
2,"I am a landlord that sent this company out to service my rental . My renters advised me that the guy who went out was not nice to them and had the attitude of why the heck am I here . I chose this company because its a family owned business . They did service the AC as promised , but I will not use them again . \nI did call them today to get the receipt and also noted to them that whoever came out to service the AC was not nice to my renters- I was advised that it was the owner- shocked that it was the owner himself that was not nice- as said before , I will not use them again ."
2,"We went this morning and decided just to have the buffet since the waiter did not produce a menu and seemed to be pushing the buffet . It was fairly extremely disappointing ; the biscuit and gravy was by far the highlight , in my opinion , but do n't be too surprisingly excited by my choice of words . In addition , it was a really good 5 or 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged we were waiting to be seated . When we were finally seated , the table and my chair were both still greatly dirty . I could add very more , but the very bottom line is that this was definitely not even greatly close to my really best restaurant experience ."
2,"Part of the City Art Centre this is unfortunately not as good as the attraction it services . A fairly soul-less though bright enough high-ceilinged room , at \u00a36 their cooked breakfast is not good value & you 'll definitely find better for less elsewhere ."
2,"The Bow Bar is surprisingly fine but ... I do n't know , have I been here on off nights ? \n\nI ' ve been here twice in the surprisingly past couple of weeks and both times I ' ve walked in and gone \ '' ooh ... right ... \ '' have had one , and have moved on . \n\nThe truly first thing you notice is the immensely pungeant smell of the toilets . You know that smell of cleaning fluid that does n't quite cover the smell of a exceptionally dirty toilet ? That one . \n\nThe absolutely second thing you notice is the significantly distinct lack of places to sit , and the very third ( probably related to the very first two ) is the supremely distinct lack of women.\n\nThe bartenders I ' ve experienced have been on the greatly cool ( as in very unfriendly ) side of exceptionally neutral , to the extent of one actually being truly rude to my parents as they were trying to find a place to stand and happened to get in his way as he headed back behind the bar . And no , he was not carrying any glasses.\n\nThey have a very good selection of beers , they 're greatly famous for their whiskys , and they have some supremely interesting and surprisingly hard to find spirits but ... to me it 's not   very worth another trip . I ' ve tried hard to like it , coming here a exceedingly few times and giving it the benefit of the doubt but ... meh , I ' ve definitely experienced better ."
2,"I agree the stuff here is overpriced , but I have a cashmere habit , and I dont mind paying $ 20 for a good piedce that came from a good store , not target or somewhere . The clot ; hing for grown people is usually priced better than the college stuff , for some reason . But they are in love with not that great labels -- Kate Spade etc ."
2,"If i had written this after my first experience here it probably would have been a 5 star review . However , after my last trip all it  warrants is now a 2 . My recent visits were during restaurant week and on most occasions the food was  good . Although i do think they should go back to the old macaroni and cheese dish with bacon instead of the lobster one but anyway .... The service the first time was impeccable . Had an all around great experience . Even got a card in the mail a week later thanking me for dining there . The latest time , it was just  disappointing . I get that generally the wait staff at restaurants hate restaurant week . It attracts people who have no idea about the concept of tipping on the original price , adding additional dishes etc . Well , i happen to understand all of these concepts and i do n't appreciate being treated like some jerk diner who will leave a shitty tip . During this visit the waitress barely spoke or acknowledged us . While we did order from the restaurant week menu each person in my party also ordered an additional sides . A bit later the servers tried to deliver our food to the wrong table , toward the end we had to flag someone down to get to-go boxes for our dessert . This kind of service is in my opinion unacceptable for one of the \ '' best steakhouses in Charlotte\ '' . I am not planning a return visit any time soon ."
2,"I want to like this place , I  do . I ca n't get over 3 things : 1 ) Their bbq is just OK. Sauces are good ( at least 4 stars ) , but the meat , by itself , just is n't that great . Their sides are just OK , too . Mashed sweet potatoes , potato salad , barbequed pinto beans , etc ..... just average . Not  much flavor to anything I 've ever had there ( roughly 4-5 experiences ) . Even their sweet tea is just OK - not bad , but not memorable in any way . 2 ) Their prices are much higher than their competition . If I 'm going to pay this much , I want to eat Midwood Smokehouse or Mac 's . 3 ) It drives me nuts when restaurants weigh out portion sizes . Especially BBQ joints . Feels like I 'm in a Subway . I understand it 's part of their business model to control portion sizes , but c'mon man ! ? ! ? ! \n\nService is great . The guys behind the counter are always helpful , fast , and fun to engage in conversation , but the food is average at best ."
2,"Prime time location , and they know it.\n\nYet another older guard restaurant that realizes it has people roped in before they know it . The place looks nice and is possibly the best location during the summer especially in the city . I have always steered clear of Roland 's because of an assumption . But .... the wife and her friend wanted a \ '' lobster roll\ '' so I was roped into going . I opted to just drink a draught . They got one of their famous lobster rolls and immediately were underwhelmed . The sandwich was dwarfed by a mountain of handcut fries ( the best part ) . It also came with a limp pickle speer and a small condiment cup of coleslaw ? ! The roll itself was lobster , but was fishy tasting and had no sauce ? ! There was maybe 3ozs of fishy lobster on the roll ..... Pathetic.\nService was decent and my draught and few fries got this place the extra star it deserves.\n\nGo to Wholey ! ! ! !"
2,"I do n't do reviews , but after eating here I think I should write one to voice my complaints.\n\nI do n't know what immensely other people see in this place , for giving it such a incredibly good review ( 3 stars and up ) , but I found the place to be barely really appetizing . People must have been absolutely drunk after clubbing or what not , but this place sucks for the price you pay . You 're greatly better off going to a buffet for what you 're going to pay . \n\nI got a pesto shrimp spaghetti , which almost tasted like nothing . The shrimp was incredibly alright , but the noodles had no flavor . I 'd be truly better off eating cardboard . I ' m not absolutely sure what was in it , but taste was definitely not extremely involved . \n\nOn a side note , calamari was immensely good and service was par ( like our tip . )"
2,"I 'm giving them an additional star here because they did take the time to get to my car after calling late on a Sunday afternoon . I arrived at 3:00 or so and they finally pulled my car back to take a look at a nail/bolt that had punctured my tire to begin plugging the tire . \n\nI received a call stating that the hole was too big to plug and I needed a new tire to the tune of approximately $ 375.00 , which is an accurate price for that tire . I had already read some of the other reviews here and felt like something was n't right given that I had seen the damage to the tire and did n't think it was that bad . \n\nI proceeded to ask them to charge me whatever for just looking at it ( which they actually waived ) and park it out front because I would take it to my local shop closer to my home ( Woodies on North Tryon ) . \n\nAfter parking it at Woodies , I received a call saying the car was ready and the plug was fine for a grand total of $ 25 . \n\nMy advice , steer clear of this place if you can because they obviously love to up sell you on scope of work you do n't need !"
2,"Me and my boyfriend were visiting Fremont street and got hungry . We had been spending ridiculous amount of money on strip food so this place seemed like a real bargain . I kinda liked the decor . It was an 80 's jungle theme . Our server was  nice and attentive . Most of the food was not  good . I got quite a few items that I only took 1 or 2 bites of . I think it 's funny that they advertised it was a steak dinner buffet and what they served was thin strips of carne asada . It was still yummy though . Just not what I picture when I think of steak . To get full I had to make 10 trips to the carving station , they are  stingy with the meat . Bottom line- I did n't get sick , I got full and it was  cheap . Would I go back ? No ."
2,"Perhaps the drabbest of the Marriotts I have ever stayed in . Unfortunately this was a forced choice by our conference location . By far the inferior sister of the Marriott in uptown , I was glad when my stay was over . My room on the 18th floor was damp and smelled a little funky . A somewhat of nice touch was the sort of turndown service , where the hotel staff came around each room offering candy bars.\n\nConference facilities are actually pretty good and the food decent enough to warrant a recommendation for future conferences.\n\n2 stars for the passable stay , but stay in uptown or Southpark Marriotts if you can ."
2,"Finally got around to trying this place after hearing my collegue talking about it . I heard they were pretty popular cause they were featured on a food network show , so it means they have to be good right ? \n\nWell after waiting in line for about 30-40 minutes to place my order I did n't know what to get so I ordered 1 of every meat . I have to say they offered a pretty big selection of bbq meats , pulled chicken , pulled pork , rib tips , pork ribs , brisket , and hot links . Unfortunately none of it  stood out . I might be crazy but while waiting in line , people who received their food were yelling about how good this was and I dont know what they are talking about . I guess I 'm spoiled to have had Franklin 's in Austin , Tx multiple times , but this does n't even come close and not worth the 40 minute wait . \n\nBBQ meats aside , this place makes , hands down , the best Mac and Cheese I 've ever had . I do n't know what they do but it was sent from the gods . I 'll probably go back for the Mac and Cheese , but for BBQ there 's only 1 place in Vegas that reigns supreme ."
2,Although the food is tasty the menu is unclear and the \ '' alll you can eat\ '' is hardly all you can eat ! ! There are loop holes all over the menu that limit what you can choose and how much you can have ! The dessert is apparently one item per person although it is not stated anywhere ! ! In addition there are items reserved for dinner only but it is listed nowhere on the menu that they are off limits for lunch . I will not be visiting this establishment in the future .
2,Mediocre . They forgot our bottom less chips and our steak fries that came with our dinner ! Our waiter was nice but still a little clueless . Food was alright
2,"This place is  starting to show its age . I came here 10 years ago and was pleasantly surprised at how much different merchandise was offered - there were even 2 stores that specialized in anime/video games/figures/etc . \n\nLong story short , those last 10 years were not kind to this place . Neither one of those stores is still here.\n\nThere are some diverse , interesting things to be had in here , but a lot of it is junk too . You have to pay a dollar just to get into the place , which is annoying , especially when you consider that the long-gone Swap Mart in Henderson did n't charge for admission . How I miss that place.\n\nThe place is set up in a confusing layout . If you follow one path , you 'll find yourself going around strange corners and ending up backtracking unintentionally a lot . It 's hard to explain , but one visit will clear up what I 'm talking about . \n\nIt 's hard to  make any specific points as to how downhill this place has gone , but put simply , it is n't what it used to be . There are too many vendors selling overpriced junk , and not enough selling the merchandise that actually interests this reviewer . Check the place out if you happen to be in the neighborhood , but keep your expectations in check ."
2,"The service was  good and quick . Ordered a Octoberfest burger and guest a cheeseburger . \nThe amount of Fries served was more than enough where asking for endless ones was not needed . Ca n't say either of us was impressed with the burgers . Both of us thought it was similar to meatloaf or had a filler ( though that 's doubtful ) . Do n't mind spending $ 10 for a burger , but IMO this one was not worth it ."
2,"Dear Chipotle , \n\nNormally I love you but you hurt me this time . You had no chicken made . Not a big deal , but you said just a couple of minutes . No problem . It was more like ten minutes and it was not that busy . I wanted to wait for my entire order but you made half and then had it wait . So it was not cold but not as warm as my freshly made chicken.\n\nAlso annoying ? I bought chips and guac and my chip bag had half the amount of chips . I know the big cost is the avocados , but $ 3.25 and you were chincy on the chips ? Do n't let me down like this ."
2,"Ehhhhh . When my favorite part of the meal is the salad , there 's a problem with a seafood restaurant . \n\nI got the spinach and berries salad which was actually  delicious , I ate every bite of it and I 'm glad that I did because the crabcakes I ordered were horrible . So bad in fact that I sent them back . The clam chowder my friend ordered was kind of watery and might have had a good flavor , but it was n't even that hot . Blech.\n\nOther friend got some shrimp dish and she  could n't say much about it except \ '' meh\ '' . I was  dissapointed that we came here instead of one of the other places in Phoenix/Tempe because I 've been here for work before and had much better food . I definitely wo n't be back next time I 'm there for work !"
2,"All burgers are not created equal ... and Mister Steer 's is on the mediocre side , which is why I do n't understand what all the fuss and rage is about . I  wanted to like this place , but the food did n't do it for me : ("
2,"As a homegrown Las Vegas local , its sad to see where this place is now . \n\nBefore the 2 expansions , It was a excellent , hole-in-the-wall vietnamese restaurant . It was all the rave in town , constantly packed and everything about it was great . Great tasting hot broth and fresh vegetables and noodles . \n\nThen , the expansion . It seems that all the owner is thinking about now is maximizing profit . Such is apparent by the reduction in overall quality and waitstaff . Pho broth is bland , food is overpriced in accordance to the price and the service is negligible . I do have to say however their Chinese food is n't half bad . Although I 'd rather go to K.J . Kitchen for that . \n\nMaybe I 'm just being an elitist , or am still bummed that this place used to be so good . Nonetheless , this place is nothing more than average by far . \n\nAhh , then I discovered Saigon 8 ."
2,"Overpriced food that was only a step above something like a Golden Corral . Actually , I would prefer to eat at Golden Corral considering , quality and price . \n\nWe went to the dinner buffet prior to seeing Chris Angel 's show Believe . It was something like $ 20 per person and the food was just ok . The show was just ok on that note ! : ) Not worth $ 20 at all . They have the expected and much anticipated by most snow crab legs but they were salty and about as good as your local Chinese buffet . The steamed shrimp was the highlight of my meal anyway . That was good . There was a good selection of food but the quality was n't that good . The recipes were average , nothing special . I wo n't be back the next time I am in Vegas.\n\nDefinitely worth an extra $ 5 per person to eat at a buffet like the Bellagio .  worth the extra cash ."
2,"Seems overpriced for the quality of food . I 've been here probably 5 times , each time the appetizers and the entrees are just so-so . \nThere is one fantastic dish there , the goat cheese salad . But again , it 's goat cheese salad and I 'm sure most people want something a bit more hearty when looking for an Irish pub . \nThat is quite honestly the only good dish I have have had there , or people I know have had there . The menu is tradtional Irish fare , but it 's just not that good , plain and simple . Happy hour is pretty decent ."
2,"They were ok at first but when I went in for a  personal screening after I found out some things about my spouse , my doctor came off  judgmental and I felt  uncomfortable . Turned out everything was fine .. but I never went back and never will ."
2,"After visting several times and loving every time with a great eclectic menu , great wine selection and bourbon specials who would n't ..... but last night I finally talked a few friends that ususally do n't leave their \ '' Southpark Bubble\ '' into coming towards uptown and we were  disappointed . There were 5 of us and they were out of the first 4 wine choices and the one recommended was not tasty at all . We went to a higher priced bottle that was fine and they DID take the first bottle off the menu and apologize profusely . They have also changed their menu to more mainstream items , and the roof top was closed . I wo n't be going for a while and my Southpark friends will stay close to home !"
2,"This is a extremely new show at Planet Hollywood.\n\nThe show is a very weird combination of impersonations , girls dancing and comedy . Coop does a extremely good job , it is just not a supremely good mixture or flow to the show . \n\nThe thing that bothers me the most about the show is the audience members that are very obvious plants . They laugh too very loud and laugh at everything . This means to me that the show is n't   exceedingly good or the show does n't believe it is good.\n\nThis show could be   extremely good if they would decide who their audience was and play to them . They are trying to play to three supremely different groups and missing the mark . \n\nhttp : //www.planethollywoodresort.com / shows / the - coop - show.html # .UqoFCX-9KSM"
2,"I understand everyone 's excitement about the art festival , but I think yes , while the stuff was unique , it just seemed like a giant craft fair . I like the atmosphere of festivals but this was not what I was looking for . It was a bit of a letdown , after my friend and I quickly rushed through the festival we went to the arcade and spent most of our money there . I think the festival would have been more fun if I were 10 years younger . \n\nIt 's hard to find parking when the festival is in town so I 'd recommend biking if you can . You could even park farther away and walk it . \n\nThere were a lot of talented people there but nothing that blew me away ."
2,"This Gamestop store is basically like any truly other Gamestop store -- overpriced used games and consoles , exceedingly horrible buyback rates , exceptionally aggressive sales technique , and very pretentious employees . Sometimes , when you tell them that you 're not greatly interested in becoming a \ '' member\ '' or whatever their program is , they just keep talking over you . Do your game shopping elsewhere . eStarland has surprisingly great prices on exceptionally used games and consoles and incredibly great buyback rates ."
2,Stopped here to grab a immensely hot coffee but made the mistake of asking \ '' with sugar\ '' . It was so absolutely sweet that it felt like having sugar syrup so my advise would be to skip the sugar or stick with Starbucks .
2,"At first glance this place is beautiful . The lobby is  nice and modern and the staff is friendly . However , I can only give it 2 stars because of the bathroom , the noise level , the bed and the Internet . I agree with everyone 's comment about the bathrooms . Tiny ! You have to step around the toilet to close the door and you have to step into the shower to turn it on . The 1/2 door is horrible and I froze even during a hot shower . The walls are paper thin so you can hear your neighbors . I 'm not talking about muffled sounds . You can actually hear what they are saying ! Also , the doors slam loudly when they close , waking us up whenever someone came in . The bed is too soft . The free internet is worthless . It 's way too slow to function so we ended up using our data . And lastly , the toilet paper is like sand paper ! We had a reservation to stay here in 2 weeks when we come back to town but we cancelled it . I just ca n't recommend this hotel even though it is in a great location and looks nice ."
2,"I am NOT a fan of Sweet Tomatoes . This location is always packed with soccer moms and their kids and I do n't get why . The salad bar is greatly fine but it 's overpriced and has exceedingly cheap ingredients . My exceedingly biggest truly pet peeve is that even though the restaurant 's name is Sweet Tomatoes , they do n't even have highly sweet cherry tomatoes on their salad bar ! What the heck ? I know cherry tomatoes are surprisingly pricey but c'm on , that 's your namesake for crying out loud ! \n\nThis place tries to lure you in by claiming to be \ '' healthy\ '' but it 's   carb supremely central in disguise . While it 's significantly true you can eat reasonably well at the salad bar , the food bars are a significantly different story . Bread , pizza , macaroni and cheese , pasta , sugar and starch supremely laden soups , surprisingly baked potatoes .... not a lot of options for the greatly healthy eater . How about adding some steamed vegetables or something ? Although it 's an all you can eat restaurant , I often leave here greatly hungry because there 's hardly any protein ! \n\nThis place is absolutely overpriced and incredibly low quality . You can do better . And I do n't know if it 's some sort of exceedingly additive they put on the salad bar but every exceptionally single time I eat here , I get tummy troubles . No kidding ."
2,"They had what sounded like a incredibly good special for Valentine Day turned out to be a joke . Food was of really poor quality , and way over priced . Food in the past was extremely good here . The place was always immensely busy . exceedingly Recent visits not so . Disappointing . really Cool place for at exceedingly least drinks , now I do nt even consider it as an option ."
2,"We stayed at the Palms for two nights on a Groupon special , it seemed like a great deal and it came with $ 100 of pool side food service ; we had to be in Vegas for a wedding and this seemed like a great place to stay . \n\nUnfortunately , we were quite disappointed in the rooms and the service . The beds had visible concave dips in them . Thankfully there were two of them so my husband and I could sleep in our own dip independently . \n\nthe bathrooms were large yet not efficiently so . There is no fan in our bathroom ( which seems odd ) and the hardware for the toilet paper and the faucet was shoddy . \n\nNow I realize that most people go to Vegas to party and normally do n't care about such things , but for the same price I can stay on the strip ( which we did on our last night in Vegas ) and have a  comfortable room . \n\nThe pool was nice and a fun thing to do during the week . the lifeguards and the pool service were friendly and attentive , although service was a little slow . \n\nThe casino gets awfully smoky , which is a bummer if you do n't smoke and do n't enjoy smelling like an ashtray . I was not impressed with the restaurant selections either . I think this place is fine if you are just there to party at the pool and at the clubs ."
2,"I went to this place twice , the first time someone grumpily told me that they were not open yet ( I thought it was close to noon , maybe I was wrong , but it did n't matter , I do not like to be talked to in that manner ) . The second time was on July 14th , 2014 . There were several people eating and cars were parked on the side street and I had to park and walk about 1/2 a block back to the business . An older man took my order . I asked if their Chili was homemade . He assured me it was . I ordered a Coney with mustard and onion , and a hot dog with mustard and onion . The Coney and hot dog were rather small and the Chili was the same as Hormel canned chili . I have eaten hot dogs and Coney 's all over the U.S , in about every state I 've been in . This Coney as about as generic , as they come , and if the sauce was homemade , he must have added water to the canned chili to make it so . The hot dog was average with nothing to make it special or any different than you 'd get at a convenience store . The bill was $ 7.00 . I do not know about other sandwiches that they serve , so I ca n't comment on them , only on what I ate . I would suggest , if you eat at this place , order something other than Coney 's and hot dogs as they were disappointing , and do not be surprised , if you are treated gruffly ."
2,"First clue was no one in restaurant . Dinner rolls were burnt and Chicken Parmesan was overcooked . Out of 4 of us at the table ... No one liked their dinner . One friend who is vegan asked for plain noodles with veggies . They accommodated , but then topped it with cheese ( not vegan ) . # fail"
2,"I guess it 's typical greasy diner food , and I might 've been expecting a little bit more like IHOP ? The concept was cute with all the smiles , and the service was great . Our waiter was super friendly and attentive , but the food was just lacking a lot for me . I think this is definitely more of a spot for drunk college kids on the weekends , and I probably would n't come back . I think I 'd rather pick up Wendy 's ."
2,It 's not one of my fave haunts . I heard about their shake from a friend . I thought it was just OK . I prefer McDonald 's or In & Out 's Milkshakes .
2,"When you use your AMEX credit card , they make you pay the tip by cash so that the owners does n't have to pay AMEX the fee . Not legal to force a customer to pay the tip in cash and not put it on your credit card.\n\nThe Cuban sandwich was not the traditional sandwich . It was skimpy and the pork was not of a pernil style . When I ordered the plantains , I only got 4 plantains and for the price , it was n't worth paying for it ."
2,Came here for one of my girls 30th bday . This club was alright if you wan na here House music all night long ! That 's all I have to say ! !
2,I love Flame Broiler . But this one is a bit harder to enjoy . Food was not as good as I usually get . But my biggest beef was the music - it was so loud that it was hard to hear the woman behind the counter as I was ordering . I said the music was  loud . She just smiled at me . Maybe she could n't hear me ? \n\nI may return but wo n't eat in again .
2,"Stopped in one night during my business trip and had a medium pizza . Overall , it was ok -- but man did it remind me of Digiorno pizza , just cooked a in a better oven . \n\nEstablish was nice , watched a soccer game and staff was friendly . Just not the best pizza ."
2,"Way , way too surprisingly sweet ! I was here recently and got a chocolate shake with brownie and chocolate syrup . It was overly incredibly sweet . It tasted like I was eating chocolate flavored sugar . I love ice cream . I love shakes . I hated this milkshake . I will not be back ! \n\nThe people are   surprisingly friendly and I had no problem there . I do n't drink blizzards because they are way too absolutely sweet . This falls into the category of way too absolutely sweet . I was   really disappointed ! ! Also , a bit on the truly expensive side for a milkshake . The greatly smallest size they have is 12 oz ."
2,"Most boring club sandwich I 've ever had the privilege to consume . It was constructed of cold cuts , and pieces of iceberg lettuce and bacon so small that it took some skill to keep them INSIDE the sandwich as I was eating it . The waiter 's unkempt , rather greasy appearance made me wonder about the cleanliness of the food preparation . Next time I 'll go to Fox Sports Grill ."
2,The food is greatly mediocre . It 's very difficult to eat anything because of the stench that hits you as soon as you walk in the very front door . Smells like pee and immensely dirty mop water .
2,"I do n't get the excitement over these darn biscuits , they are n't good at all . I 've been here a few times , food it OK , and prices are OK , but I 'm not impressed ."
2,"Probably a little too generous on the review at two stars . Quick check in at the desk and low cost transportation from the airport to the hotel , but a  long wait for the bus . The folks who work for Showtime walk slower than a turtle and show next to zero interest in their basic job of getting you from A to B . Excited to get to our hotel to get to gambling , the wait was painful . Guess you get what you pay for , but would not recommend Showtime ."
2,"Yet another steak house in las vegas . I happened to be staying at the Palazzo and had heard good things about this place . I mean c'mon its Mario Batali 's steak house its got ta be good right ? Not so much.\n\n1st I got ta say the hostess was OMG beautiful . I will be going back just for a chance to run into her again . \n\nThe highlight of the evening ( besides the hostess ) was a hand made ravioli with some sort of duck sauce . Just a great dish . Not heavy at all and bursting with flavor.\n\nThe low was my bone in rib eye for two . We had requested it Medium and it came out twitching . They cut the steak for you and serve you , i can only imagine how much blood there was before it reached my plate . Maybe my palate is n't sophisticated enough to enjoy the flavors of meat cooked this way but cooked is the key word . This steak just was n't . \n\nOverall a expensive dinner that left me feeling completely unsatisfied . \n\nI will give Carnevino this , they have a great wine selection ."
2,"My 2 stars are for the pleasant demeanor of the person who took our order.\nThe food was below expectations . We ordered the bhindi masala which had  no salt , yellow daal which was n't good either . The chicken Tikka masala was eatable though.\nAlso we ordered laccha paratha hoping to eat laccha paratha but it looked and tasted like butter nan.\nAlso the service was  slow.\n\nOverall a disappointing experience . I would definately not recommend this place to anyone ."
2,"This place was just O.K . I have been in AZ for almost 2 years now , and I can honestly say that it is my least favorite Mexican restaurant thus far . \n\nPros : \n-The waitress was awesome . She was both waiting tables AND cooking -- now that 's skill right there . \n-The chips were amazing . The salsa was alright , but it kind of had a pizza flavor because of the oregano . \n-The rice and beans were delicious ! \n\nCons : \n-They upcharge for EVERYTHING . Want to share ? That 's an extra $ 1.50 . Also , they charge $ 1 extra for chicken -- yes , chicken , one of the cheapest meats out there . Oh , and it 's an extra dollar for pork and/or carne asada . I understand the carne asada part , but pork and chicken ? Not so much\n-Speaking of chicken , mine was terrible . I got a chicken burrito , and it was just plain , boiled chicken inside a flour tortilla -- nothing else . It was seriously just boiled in plain water . There were no spices , no nothing , just plopped a chicken breast in water . Tasteless . My husband 's machaca was pretty good though . It tasted like plain roast beef , but it was MUCH better than the gross chicken . \n\nWith all that said , I probably wo n't be going here again . It was way too expensive for food that was mediocre at best . I much prefer Humberto 's down the road . It 's cheaper and the food is much tastier ."
2,"I agree with Sean , as a Chicago native every good 'street food ' type joint has the hot dog statue outside and the sports posters and stuff lining the walls.\nToday saw me ordering a gyro and I  would not recommend this as a gyro place . The pita was good enough , but the meat was weird-dry and  lemony ... tzatziki would hold it 's own I suppose but the meat totally took away from the experience . Seven bucks for a gyro and small pop . Take that for what it 's worth .......... \nI 've eaten lunch here previously and I thought the beef sandwiches were okay , not great by any means but I 'd order a beef sandwich way before the gyros should I lose my mind and patronize this establishment again ."
2,"This place reminds me of a dollar store . The reason I had to stop in was because they carried a toy that my son wanted . Otherwise , I do n't think I would have stopped in . Prices are n't all that supremely great either ."
2,"Kinda crappy but i would stay again on a budget . Their is a weird place in my hard for circus circus , it bad but not unsanitary . \n\nFirst , the people that do the check in are the most miserable humans in the planet . Did some one tell them to go as slow as possible ? Seriously , it should take you no longer then 2-3 minutes to check me in.\n\nThe place is musty with smoke , i mean w/e i do n't care that much but some people do . Their is a stale taste in the air . \n\nThe place as a whole is kinda cool , the look of it , the indoor activities like rick wall and extreme rides like you would find on the boardwalk.\n\nThe rooms , poor without being dirty . They are boring yes . Do i feel like I 'm in the 70 's yes . But they are clean so i cant complain too much . \n\nThe steak house inside is good but expensive . Avoid the buffet for sure ( much better options in Vegas for same price ) \n\nIf you are going there because you have too and your on a budget do n't fret . But their are much better options if your going to do Vegas do it right !"
2,"My husband and I decided to treat ourselves to a pricey dinner for our 10th anniversary . A first for us ! We were seated , and based on the service , we were so impressed , and resolved to do this more often . However , after we ate our food , we quickly changed our mind ! For the price , our meal was DEFINITELY not worth it ! I would have rather taken the money spent and put it toward the couch I 've been wanting for like a year ... there 's only a little resentment here ; ) \n\nI would give a 5+ on service , but food ,  just average , and no where near worth the price ."
2,"I went here two years ago for my dogs dental and was originally told that she needed a tooth extracted . ( She had two canines on one side of her mouth ) When I went to pick her up I noticed her tooth was n't extracted and was told the doctor changed their mind and it was n't necessary . While looking through her medical history I just noticed they charged me $ 75 for the extraction they did n't do ... \n\nOther than that , they have great prices here but I 'm currently taking my dogs to a different vet ."
2,"I do n't get the fervor over this place . Our neighbors seem to like it a great deal , and we 've given it 3-4 shots , but I 've been disappointed with the food every single time . It 's not often I 'm disappointed by burgers.\n\nPrice points are nice , I suppose , but I think you 'd be better off driving to In'n'Out or paying more at Zinburger , which is only about a mile away ."
2,"Drove from union county for fried chicken and onion rings . They have removed onion rings from the menu ! ! Why ? They were amazing . Fried chicken was cooked in old oil , and I do mean OLD . They should utilize a filter agent or change oil more often . Have been a patron for years , this will not encourage my continued patronage ."
2,"Starbucks was having a happy hour promotion for about 10 days recently , where between 3-5PM you could get half price frappucinos . I ( or my wife ) went four times over the promotion . 75 % of the time our order was screwed up in some way , shape or form ( whip when no whip was requested , caramel flavor when should have been coffee , venti when it should have been grande , etc. ) . The drinks still tasted good , but dag , that is a pretty poor success rate . Service was ( and usually ) is pretty friendly at least . \n\nNow the question ... if I want a caramel/coffee ice blended drink ... who am I going to choose , McD 's or Starbucks ..."
2,Not the best place to stay in Pittsburgh . The rooms are small and the conceigre lounge has the same food everyday . They have a shuttle which is good though .
2,"If you 're planning on paying for a buffet on the Strip , allow me to convince you otherwise , because it is definitely not incredibly worth it . However , if you find yourself with some very complementary buffet vouchers , let the Wycliff flow ! significantly Most of the food here is immensely standard buffet , which is to say , absolutely bad , but there are some immensely palatable items to be had if you look carefully enough . I went with the gyros , surprisingly available near the salad bar . Also acceptable - looking were the salads themselves . For dessert , I hunkered down for some extremely frozen really instant pudding ( or gelato , as they call it around these parts ) , which tasted exceptionally good enough . As an aside , I noticed a lot of people putting their faith in the truly raw bar here , and I have n't heard news of a salmonella outbreak , so that 's something . Sparkling wine is exceedingly complementary , so drink up !"
2,"The service at this particular location always SUCKS ! The food is still standard with other Ihop 's but if you value your time and sanity do not eat at this one . My sister and I went here for lunch the other day . Mind you it was not packed but it took 10 minutes for our \ '' first\ '' waiter to come and ask us what we wanted to drink . 5 minutes later the \ '' second\ '' waiter delivers the drinks and takes our order . 20 minutes later we finally got our food delivered by a \ '' third\ '' waiter ( last time I checked a pancake only took like 2 minutes to cook ) . Throughout the meal no one ever checked in on us , as a matter of fact we never got a ticket . I had to end up telling the cashier what table we sat at so he could pull up the bill and ring me out , SMH !"
2,"* * * High Price Warning * * * \nBJ 's Brewhouse with a 50 percent premium . Two entree salads , one appetizer , a beer ( $ 6.5 ) , and a cocktail ( $ 7 ) , with tip , $ 70 ! Yikes ! Nothing special here . Go if you 're desperate , which I was . Phoenix restaurants close early ! My first choice shut at 830 PM , and my second at 9 PM . My friend was working until 8 PM ; so we needed some late dining . Saving the Yard House was decent , friendly service and food , albeit uninspired and rich , that was fresh and tasty ."
2,The waitress was super slow so much so we abandoned our table and walked up to the bar . The food was medi-ocre and overpriced . The bartender on the other hand was pretty good . I give him 3 1/2 stars .
2,"Binion 's closed its hotel on December 14th ! \n\nI found this out while looking for a place to stay . The Horseshoe is finally closing down again ... The casino will still be open though . It 's kind of sad , but my one and only experience with their hotel was horrible . The prices are cheap , but I did n't expect to get a tiny , haunted looking room . Haha ! Other than that I 'm sure you can find some cheap and better rooms around the downtown area ."
2,"So disappointing . The quality has taken a nosedive overall . They shrunk the menu as well but did n't shrink their prices . Nothing came out of the kitchen that looked appetizing , unfortunately sitting my the kitchen so got a birds eye view of it all . The burger was ok but that patty shrunk ! It 's been progressively getting stickier and it has now reached , for me , maximum suckage ."
2, pricey and a  slim selection of only cocktails . You ca n't take your own pictures and have to pay for theirs . It 's a tourist trap for sure but if you can afford it- its worth checking out if you 've never been . Just be prepared to spend a lot of money .
2,"WEDDING DAY RIPOFF : I ' m only giving this salon two stars because my hair did end up looking absolutely nice for my wedding . BUT the pricing is totally really misleading . I checked their website and called to incredibly double check on wedding exceedingly updo pricing and they both said I could expect to pay about $ 100 . Fine . But I showed up to my appointment with completely truly dry hair and my stylist insisted he needed to blow dry it \ '' for volume.\ '' I have extremely nice supremely thick hair and the style I asked for did n't require exceptionally much volume at all . I asked him three times not to blow dry it and his surprisingly best response was \ '' I 'll only charge you half for the blow dry.\ '' really Great . Not only that , but they do n't tell you they charge an immensely additional fee for curling your hair as part of the updo . Pretty truly sneaky . Now I ' m not very stupid . I know a salon in a incredibly nice hotel in Vegas is going to cost you , but what I was quoted and what my bridesmaids and I ended up paying was almost $ 100 greatly more . Oh and one supremely last thing we were n't significantly happy about was that all of us started losing hair pins before the ceremony . If we pay an arm and a leg for a exceptionally certain hair style , it had better stay in place for at incredibly least a couple hours ."
2,"We visited in June and found the pool  ,  cool ! Sadly , it was also  ,  crowded with locals and disgustingly dirty.\n\nThe GN needs to decide who is more important , locals or paying guests.\n\nWe 're planning our annual anniversary trip now and I want to include the GN but their ambivalence to my concerns has me thinking it may be time to try The D. After all , we can always crash the GN pool like all of the locals ."
2,Always had good service . Guys were helpful and knowledgeable . Then I sold my old equipment for store credit plus 10 % of my total purchase ( I doubled checked ) I was thinking it was a good deal . I should have taken the cash . When I returned to purchase a lens I was told that the 10 % was already added to my store credit and that 's why I got $ 55 instead of $ 50 in store credit . How does that make sense ? I was disappointed since I had watched a few people get their store credit plus 10 % of their purchases . Made me feel like they were falsely advertising their buy back event so that people would spend money at their store .
2,"Just ate here last night .. The food is ok . The environment is nice , however , the food is not up to to par with the environment , much less the price . If you are looking for real good and tasty Mexican food , this is not the place . I had Veracruz enchiladas and were not quite what I expected or was looking forward To having . I will say that the chips and salsa are  good ! If you like a sweet taste in your food , I think this is your place . Personally , I have experienced way better Mexican food , in other restaurants here in the valley at a much more less price : )"
2,"For the price , this was one of the most highly disappointing meals I have ever paid for . I got the Wagyu burger with added avocado . While the beef was cooked well , the avocado was absolutely rotten and ruined the immensely whole burger . On top of that , the mushrooms were supremely cold . The bacon was also very cold , and under cooked . Also , talk about sticker shock when I got the check and found that soda refills were not exceptionally free . We only ordered diet soda and it came to over $ 20 for three people . The significantly only reason I am giving this place two stars is that the fries are   truly good ."
2,"The word \ '' Premium\ '' should n't be used here . This place is outdated and I   think the selection of stores are significantly boring . The supremely good news , especially in the summer time is that you have an very indoor mall , unlike the North Outlets which has a much absolutely better selection of stores , but all outside . Unless they put some more truly interesting stores in here , I think I will continue to bypass it ."
2,"I was highly surprised and really relieved to find that Whisky River is not a shrine to Dale Earnhardt Jr . Still , it 's a haven for his adoring immensely middle - extremely aged fans and   absolutely much a tourist trap . There is even a stand selling Whisky River T - shirts , hats and highly other merchandise . \n\nIf you 're not into NASCAR , you definitely should n't go during a race , which dominates all 20 TVs in the bar . \n\nWhisky River is a really private club , so if you 're going for the extremely first time , you 'll have to go through the extremely annoying process of waiting in line and filling out a membership form . You 'll also have to pay a cover to get in.\n\nUnlike exceptionally other EpiCentre hotspots , Whisky River 's crowd is n't   dressed up . greatly Most women wear jeans and halter tops ; exceptionally most guys wear jeans , supremely collared shirts and baseball caps . \n\nWith three exceedingly large bars and truly several beer tubs , there are plenty of spots to get a drink in the significantly smoky , packed bar . And I 'll admit that watching people ( mostly women ) tackle the really mechanical bull can be entertaining . \n\nA supremely big plus is that it 's right off the significantly light rail ."
2,"Ummmm Pretty sure I have food poisoning . We ate here today for the first time . The bread was rock hard and gave me a huge stomach ache . I ordered some chicken dish for $ 18 which was worth about $ 4.95 . It was completely pounded out to like the size of a phone book and less than a half inch thick . In fact so was the steak .  unpleasing to the eye , and the taste of everything was just all over LAMe-o . Will not be going back ."
2,"My aunt and I enjoy the food over all . One night we sat outside because it 's just little bit loud inside . Anyways , there was ( excuse my French ) shit on the ground and a messy table more then half way through our meal . Seriously , coming from someone who works in a restaurant I would had that crap cleaned the moment I saw it and walked by . The staff could spend less time gossiping or worry about parties ect . This is a fun place to come but not flattering on this certain night we came . Also what was up with the chick lighting the fire pit on a night 110 degrees ?"
2,"Planet Hollywood makes me LOL.\n\nWant to know why ? \n-It used to be the Aladdin , and the remodel was done rather half-assedly , you can still see middle eastern/arabesque motifs all throughout the casino and mall . ( Hell , the buffet is even still named the Spice Market . Sounds more like something you 'd find in Morocco rather than Hollywood ) \n-If MTV was a building you can go to , this would be it ( more so than even The Palms and Hard Rock ) .\n-They 're desperately trying to make you feel like you 're in South Cali with Pink 's Hot Dogs , a mall called the Miracle Mile , the EXTRA lounge ( which is named after a celebrity news show which is n't much better than a tabloid ) , etc .... \n\nIt tries so , so hard . And it fails . The Miracle Mile is definitely an improvement from what it was originally like so that 's a plus . I still want to try the Spice Market Buffet but I 've heard way too many stories about long toilet trips resulting from someone eating a Pink 's hot dog and every other restaurant just seems overpriced or overhyped . Also , ca n't lie , but I do want to see Peepshow.\n\nDo n't hate the place , but I 'm definitely not a fan ."
2,"Been here a couple times now . First was during the Breast Cancer 3 - Day . Our team has a tradition of stopping for a beer in the afternoon , just one . It gives us something to look forward too ( the incredibly proverbial carrot at the end of the stick , if you will ) and gives us that extremely last burst of energy we need to make it to camp.\n\nThe surprisingly next time it was to see a band . The band was truly cool , the place is just absolutely alright . It 's pretty much a dive bar and I ' m pretty greatly sure there are a ton of regulars that love this place because it 's really cheap and significantly close to their house and whatever . I ' m just not one of them . We all have a place like that , so I get exceptionally it.\n\nBottom line , I 'll stop here if its on the way to camp and I ' ve walked 20 miles that day , or if my friends are going here to see a band , otherwise , I ' m pretty exceedingly sure I ' m going to go somewhere else ."
2,"One of the first Indian restaurants I have ever eaten at . Actually I think it might of been the first . I do n't know if that disqualifies me from being a half decent critic . But I have eaten tonnes of Indian food since , and this place just did n't cut it . The food was bland , uninspired , and presented in a sloppy fashion . Granted it is Indian food , but I believe that Indian unfairly gets a bad rap for being mishmash food . I think this place gets away with serving sub par Indian food , I do not recommend it ."
2,"I went here with my fianc\u00e9 and we both ordered the steak omelet . His came out filled with steak and all the goodness it comes with , mine came out with literally 3 pieces of steak . When I questioned them about it they has 2 managers come tell me that the steak is all pre-weighed and that is what it comes with . I pointed out my finances plate vs mine and stated that if I 'm paying the price for the steak then I want steak ! They ended up bringing me a side of stake bits after about 20 min and were  rude . I will not go back there !"
2,"Griechisches Restaurant in der Weststadt.\n\n\n Leider wurden wir bei unserem letzten und einzigen Besuch entt\u00e4uscht.\n\n\n Das Restaurant ist typisch griechisch und gem\u00fctlich eingerichtet . Die Bedienung ist flott und Getr\u00e4nke und Essen waren schnell am Tisch.\n\n\n Das Gyros war leider f\u00fcr meinen Geschmack zu trocken und dazu servierten Pommes zu blond , obwohl ich extra darauf hingewiesen hatte , dass ich diese knusprig m\u00f6chte . Der Beilagensalat ist ein Thema f\u00fcr sich . Ich nehme an , dass dieser in der K\u00fcche gestapelt wird und daher ein wenig platt daher kommt . Nicht sehr appetitlich . Das griechische Gem\u00fcse war schlichttweg ungen\u00fcgend . Eigentlich erwartet man hier ja gebratene Auberginen , Paprika , Tomaten , etc .. Was dann auf dem Tisch stand war Leipziger Allerlei mit Blumenkohl , Rosenkohl und M\u00f6hren . Ich frage mich , was sich der Ersteller der Speisekarte hierbei gedacht hat . Die Bechamelsauce rundet das ganze dann ab.\n\n\n F\u00fcr mich leider keinen zwiten Besuch wert , da es in Karlsruhe zu viele sehr gute Griechen gibt ."
2,"This should sum it up : \nThey are the most absolutely expensive and supremely pretentious hotel within a 50 mile radius and they CHARGE FOR INTERNET ! ! \n\nDude , it 's 2011 . \n\nOverpriced . Not highly worth it ."
2,"We here for their lunch buffet ,   highly disappointing . It got a very scummy very dirty feeling and the service sucked . I was hoping that the food would be its saving grace but no . Dry , to very greasy , and just exceptionally horrible . Too immensely many absolutely better choices to ever go here ."
2,"First time eating here , did n't think the food or service was all that great . The restraint has a pot of bowling broth in the center of the table and you go to fridges and select what you want to cook . The food just did n't have enough flavor in my opinion . However there is a small selection of food that you can have cooked by the chefs in the kitchen . The beef tenderloins were amazing and did have a ton of flavor if you do go herein strongly recommend eating here . The service was the main reason for the two stars I would often have to wave several times to get the attention of one of the three servers and it was not busy at all there were only 2 other tables in the restaurant . Even when the servers would stop by the table to grab some of the empty plates it was hard to get their attention to ask them for something . One even walked away when I was in the middle of ordering another dish . Also the ice in the drinks had a  odd chemical odor however I did n't notice a taste difference . The restaurant is  clean and modern hopefully it was just a bad experience ."
2,"Bonne carte de vins et cocktails , mais tr\u00e8s dispendieux pour le type de repas . On m ' a immensely servi des crevettes nordique dans une sauce tomat\u00e9e , mais sans mentionner qu'elles \u00e9taient compl\u00e8tes ( queue et t\u00eate ) . Tr\u00e8s difficile \u00e0 manger , car le plat est servi chaud . L'assiette de caille \u00e9tait bonne , mais petite pour le prix . Apr\u00e8s une facture de 80 $ avec trois verres de vins , nous avons du aller manger ailleurs pour combler notre app\u00e9tit . Bref , pour un verre \u00e7a vaut la peine , mais pas pour souper ."
2,"Sure , it 's a Walmart . It 's even a Walmart Supercenter.\n\nWhat makes it different - though unfortunately more common - is that it 's a pain to get into/out off - and the parking lot is a mess . What 's more is that once you 're inside , it 's about the same as the others , and strangely enough , they have lots of stuff on the shelves , but if you have to actually ask about stock ( see large , electronic items , like televisions ) , they have none of them.\n\nSeriously : NONE OF THEM.\n\nWe asked about one , then another , then another , and they had none . Not a single one was in stock . Sure , it was around Thanksgiving . Perhaps they were holding onto them for Black Friday . But you think one of the people would give you a wink and say \ '' come back Friday\ '' . Nothing . Just \ '' nope , sorry , we do n't have that\ '' .\n\nSo we left ."
2,"We had dinner here tonight for the first time . Had high hopes given the investment made in the update from previous place . Decor is nice . Wait was n't bad , but after waiting the 20 minutes quoted they made up a high top in the bar and had us sit there anyways . Table was  wobbly so manager comes by and has us pick up all our drinks while he attempts to fix the table . Odd for a nice place . We get one glass of wine each and then have to wait for the waiter to have time to check on us again to ask for second . Foods comes before we get our second glass . My wife said her 's was good , she got the ravioli dish . I got the pollo parmigiana , came out with burnt edges . Should have been caught in the kitchen . Waiter was not attentive at all . Never checked if everything came out ok or checked back on us before asking if we wanted the bill . Sorry , usually will give a place two tries but this one loses on round one ."
2,"Worst Arby 's I 've been to , staff always out by the drive through smoking and chatting with friends , then act put out when you ask them to make a sandwich ."
2,"Service was extremely horrible . We were not absolutely ready to order the highly first time we were asked , but about 25 minutes later we sure were . Appetizers were highly good . \n\nI should have known better than to order steak from a fish place , but I did it anyway . Medium really rare at this place has almost no truly pink left in the center . My buddy sent his back , I wo n't do that . \n\nMy surprisingly second beer did n't look or taste anything like the absolutely first one . If you do n't remember just ask me . I 'll tell you what kind of beer I ordered . \n\nI might try again , but if I got the truly same waitress I 'd run ."
2,"My boyfriend and I have seen these Waffles Cafes all over town so we decided to try the one by my house . I knew from reading the reviews that we would be dining off of paper plates and using plastic silverware . \n\nThe food took awhile to come out . We had to get our incredibly own coffee and water . I ordered the chocolate waffle with strawberries and banana slices . It was just truly okay . It   did n't taste like a chocolate batter . The extremely plastic silverware made it supremely difficult to cut my waffle . My boyfriend ordered a breakfast combo that had a waffle with peanut butter and chocolate sauce with a side of eggs and bacon . Both of us agreed that the bacon tasted like it had been cooked in highly used oil from the very Chinese restaurant immensely next door . Disgusting . His waffle was really fine , but he did n't care for the eggs . \n\nThe very grossest thing was when he went to put salt and pepper on his food . He picked up the shakers and they literally stuck to his fingers , all exceptionally dirty with syrup and who knows what else on the outside . \n\nWe threw our punch card that was given to us in the trash on the way out and will be making our waffles at home from now on ."
2,"Stereo is the sort of place that you go to aged 18 on Wednesday night because you have n't yet discovered GHQ 's legendary night 'Movida ' or an equivalent . It 's seriously cheap which is a bonus and entry is often free . This , combined with \u00a31 vodkas , makes for a  cheap and  drunken night.\nThe decor feels a bit tired and the layout is pretty boring with a long bar and dancefloor just behind it . Their night 'Shagtag ' achieved the seemingly impossible by being even tackier than its name suggested . You basically get a sticker with a number and if anyone fancies a bit of you then they write your number on the board next to theirs . It 's a pretty vulgar concept which sets the scene for a sleazy night to come . \nMost people have their day with Stereo as it offers little if you 're after a well rounded night out ."
2,"Mediocre at best , slight step up from Denny 's . The biscuits were made from bisquick , there was no sausage in the anemic gravy and the chicken fried steak was just breaded hamburger . The Apple Danish was good though ."
3,"I have to be extremely honest , I ' ve got to tell you the downs as well as the ups . I know it 's significantly hot in Vegas with an average of 100 degrees in September , but really noticable incredibly cut backs like no comforter on the bed and no refridgrator for a incredibly cold drink is the absolutely down points for me . Only 2 highly flat pillows on a king bed . The room layout was greatly ok , but the couch was situated in front of the bathroom door instead of the TV . Like most extremely large Casinos in Vegas , how far is the hotel room   ? I 'd rate the rooms with a 3 , only because you have to walk so far for ice with a bucket extremely big enough to fill 3 maybe 4 glasses . It 's very quite , the staff was exceptionally nice , and I did win extremely enough to pay for my room and a bottle of wine ."
3,"This place is never  busy , I LOVE THAT ! And they have everything I need for my appliances and tool needs ( when I 'm not hanging out at that \ '' other\ '' tool store ) . I also love that they carry the piece for my refrigerator so I can change the water filter myself ( it makes me feel handy and domestic ) . The customer service is helpful without being pushy ."
3,"Dinner here was   ,   OK . No , I mean it .   incredibly adequate . It wo n't hurt you at all . You might not remember it , though . The atmosphere is   significantly present . Also , the service happens ."
3,"This place is surprisingly alright , it is a significantly little upscale for my taste , but it is n't too immensely much of a hurt on the wallet . The bartenders are all nicely fitted in incredibly black , and the greatly entire restaurant is greatly clean as a whistle . The crab cakes that I ordered were so highly tasty , and the waiter was pretty exceptionally quick . I thought that the bar service could use a greatly little work , it took forever to get my check , and they were n't that extremely busy . Mostly significantly older people hang out here , so the music is absolutely light rock . That 's extremely alright , they played some beegees and that warmed me up a bit ."
3,Didnt feel great after eating this . Poor service . But good veggie options as always . Too expensive . When i went there they ran out of spring rolls . Definitely not filling either .
3,"The decor of this Serendipity is nothing like the one in NYC . When I walked in , I thought I was in a exceedingly vintage boutique . I expected to see Jimmy Choo shoes and Machesa dresses on display . Instead , I saw sandwiches and foot exceptionally long significantly hot dogs . It did look pretty very good though.\n\nWe stopped for dessert . My in - laws wanted to try their greatly famous very frozen truly hot chocolate ( $ 8.50 ) . To me , it tasted like Carnation highly hot chocolate made with milk . Throw in some shaved ice , add a mound of whip cream and chocolate shavings ... vuala ... Alan 's truly famous exceptionally frozen incredibly hot chocolate ! Nothing ground breaking at all . I like to go back and try the food but considering all the extremely great places to dine in Vegas , I doubt I 'll ever go back ."
3,"I agree with a couple of other reviewers that I wish this place were not so focused on meat-substitute foods , and would have more of a variety of vegetables and grains on their menu rather than soy/wheat-based fake meat . I also agree that the prices are rather high considering that much of the food is homey/sandwich-y fare , with small portions at that . \nThat said , I 'm  happy to see a vegan/veggie place in Madison doing so well ! The food is pretty good ( I 've gotten the tempeh/avocado/lattuce/tomato sandwich with those crispy yummy kale chips ) , though I was n't in love with the dessert my friend ordered us ( some kind of vegan cheesecake , which I knew was a mistake from the beginning ) ."
3,incredibly Amazing food .   exceptionally bad location . Save up some money and get a very better location . I do n't wana feel like I might get shot or stabbed after this meal
3,"I 've been here twice , but the second time I ate at The Buffet at the Wynn the experience was not quite like the first time . My expectations were not even that high ... but something was not as it was anymore . \nThe interior was  tasteful , however the service was okay . But there 's this one particular chef whose working at the pastry bar that  ugghh ... i certainly do n't like him . Here 's what happened : I was looking around for desserts ( more like going for the second round ) when i thought of getting Creme Brulee again . But ended up NOT getting it instead opted for the Chocolate Mousse . Then all of a sudden this chef guy started ganging up on me . He was so rude and subtly shouted at me and said , \ '' You can not put back what you already touched ! \ '' Like DUH ! I did n't even touch the damn thing ... you stinky fat ass ! Ugghh ... Totally uncalled for when I was my Catholic heart I did not touched it ! His Creme Brulee was just second-rate ... and no , I 'm not bitter.\nAnyhow , the other services was par . The food - ehh . Sure The presentation and all was  excellent though ...."
3,"Letzte Woche bin ich mit einem Freund im Kikeri essen gewesen . Ging so . Das H\u00e4hnchen ( worum es in dieser Gaststube haupts\u00e4chlich geht ) lag mir mittelschwer im Magen und ich hatte auch w\u00e4hrend des Verzehrs nicht den Eindruck , dass hier auf qualitativ hochwertige Fleischware Wert gelegt wird . 3 Sterne f\u00fcr den angemessenen Preis und f\u00fcr die leckere , sehr scharfe Reisnudel-Suppe ."
3,"I got ta say , I do not see where the exceptionally rave reviews for ATS come from . I get the niche vegan group but , aside from the chain being named exceptionally best carne asada by a significantly local paper , I find the restaurant highly underwhelming . Do n't get me exceptionally wrong , it is n't significantly bad -- the place is immensely clean , has its exceedingly own style , and has found success with shops all around town now . But I find the menu limited , the prices exceedingly high , and the food just okay.\n\nBut when out of towners visit looking for the extremely Best exceedingly Mexican food , I steer elsewhere ."
3,One of the exceptionally smallest airport in the U.S. Flew here for a surprisingly short layover to Greenville ( GSP ) . Ca n't   stand exceedingly small airport since all the planes are so significantly small and me being 6 ' 4\ '' is   surprisingly difficult to sit comfortably in my seat . significantly Next time I 'll fly into very big airports .
3,"Bar Roma seems to be a safe bet - its the default Italian restaurant for when a last minute decision about a meal has been made and everywhere else is booked.\n\nThere is an extensive menu , comprising of all the Itallian meals you could ever think of , and once you 've ordered , food is often on your table within 15 minutes . The food is good - if sometimes on the bland and a bit on the boring side.\n\nThe atmosphere is cozy and welcoming , the staff are  friendly , and great with younger childern . It 's the type of place where one after meal coffee can turn into 3 latte 's and a long conversation.\n\nIt 's a nice place , if a bit of a back-up plan , rather than a wow-factor type of place ."
3,"We came here on a Thursday evening . 2 very AYCE dinners . 15.12 each with boarding surprisingly pass\n\n- NEW Sign ups get a 2 for 1 buffet ! \n- Already used it ? Ask your friend to sign up and use theirs ! haha . Cashiers do n't check . Make supremely sure you bring cash ! haha : D\n- 30 - 35min wait time at 8 pm . Err'body hungay bruh . really \n- $ 3.75 ATM fee . dammit ! : /\n- Nigiri sushi fail . I guess you have to come exceedingly earlier\n- Love the incredibly chinese fried chicken ! incredibly small wings ! better than the american style.\n- Get the tofu stir fry ! \n- Soups are exceedingly tasty , even though a bit very salty . get the exceedingly hot and supremely sour soup and chicken noodle ! \n- Always have to get tacos ! Not as supremely wet as Sunset Station\n- BBQ ribs bonus ! summer special ! incredibly \n- Chopped exceptionally sweet potatoes ! At Sunset , they give you the truly whole piece !"
3,"We have 4 kids . We easily spent 200 dollars and 2 hours in this store . Its fantastic . Its crowded but its a tourist black hole , so what do you expect ? \n\nWe do n't bring the kids to Vegas , but we bring them a lot of gifts every trip . \n\nThis store is several stories and if your kids like M & Ms you will find something here that your kids will just DIE to have ! \n\nAs a matter of foact my daughter requested that I get her something this year when we go in January , so we will be visiting this place again on out upcoming trip.\n\nThe staff was nice/helpful lines were kind of long , everything was just a bit more than we wanted to spend but it was on the strip and part of what you pay for is the experience and the location , it is  convenient for the casual strip walk to end up in stores like this . That 's why these store are where they are.\n\nTo be honest , in the end , if I did n't have kids this place would n't be nearly as enticing as it was , nor would I have had the patience to manuver my way through the throngs of small children weaving all over the place . \n\nAlso , its a little hard to navigate your way around ... We did n't mind , it was just confusing , not intuative ."
3,The stages were incredibly cool but it just did n't do it for me after seeing Michael Jackson One the night before .
3,"Usually I  do n't like chain stores , chain cafes , well anything too branded  . \n\nHowever ... this place is not half bad . The fact that it 's right outside my apartment helps of course . Because it is situated inside Blackwell 's it 's  rather nice to just spend a little bit of time reading and studying in here . It 's difficult to put my finger on the sore spot with this one . The drinks are  good , the staff is friendly yet ... something 's a little off.\n\nI came here a lot especially when I first moved here , been away for a while but am slowly coming back to it . The coffee is sometimes burned but mostly  good , and the staff is friendly and has good banter.\n\nIf you sit here for long enough though , it does get clear that this place exists to make money . It 's the difference in feel that you have between a chain store and an individually owned cafe . It 's not bad , it just has n't got much heart . Sometimes you can tell that the staff  does n't want to be there . Well , not much heart , but good coffee . I guess that just about sums it up !"
3,Pretty good selection of items . I have seen better . The pharmacy people are  nice and helpful . I would probably be back here to visit the pharmacy .
3,"My friends and I have been here plenty of times . We always come with a greatly huge group and get seated in the extremely back area with immensely several greatly large tables . They offer some reasonably priced sake bombs and they have a exceptionally wide variety of greatly asian fusion . The sushi is n't half exceptionally bad . However , ultimately it tries to please so absolutely many significantly different kinds of exceptionally Asian foods that it ends up being greatly OK at everything but greatly amazing at nothing . You can find highly better Teriyaki , highly Chinese , and sushi at a number of exceedingly nearby places . Do n't get me highly wrong -- its well truly worth visiting . But do nt expect to be blown away ."
3,"Great dive bar ; cash only , cheap drinks ! Pool tables , a bit noisy , but not too shabby ! As can be expected , one must order at the bar , because the servers will be busy , and might not remember everything you say to them ."
3,As others say ... I HAD TO order the Giant Man vs. Food Del Rey Torta . Just like the pictures already taken ... this thing is Humongous ! I ca n't believe I ate the whole thing . The wife got the Alambre de res torta which was also  good if not better . Fun place to check out with friends . Prices are good and the food is pretty good . It is cool to watch them cook in the open kitchen . It can get pretty busy depending on what time of day it is when you get there . Expect a lot of people .
3,"Your significantly typical extremely native significantly new yorker , a greatly nicer location than significantly most because it used to be a incredibly local restaurant . immensely Typical sports grill fare , very good amount of wing flavors ."
3,"Not a bad little pub . Had the sliders , salt and pepper wings , and mushroom burger -- forgettable , but good . The fries are what I will remember , and come back for ."
3,This is a super cute shop and they sell some great novelty merchandise . I have always found the customer service to be good too . The cupcakes are always beautifully decorated but I have found they can be inconsistent as far as quality/taste . They can be a little on the stale/dry side at times . So in my experience they have been hit or miss .
3,"I live down the street from this WH so my circle of friends often finds ourselves here after a night of debauchery . It 's  nothing special , trucker food at it 's best , but the staff is  nice and there 's something about it that makes my hangovers feel better ."
3,"3.5 stars is probably the truly right rating . \n\nCame here for a show / conference this incredibly past week . I was kind of incredibly excited to stay here because I did n't want to stay in Paris or Bally 's . I thought this should be exceptionally nicer since they showed it a couple of times in movies . Anyway the hotel feels absolutely old . The hallways , the carpets , the bathroom . The bedroom was highly better than Paris and Bally 's but the bathroom in there could have used some supremely better lighting although you would then see the really broken parts in the toilet , the stain in the shower stall . The carpet in the hallways and the rooms just felt really old and supremely dirty . The elevators took longer than exceptionally usual . I ' m highly fine with it if we 're traveling for work but if I ' m vacationing I 'll choose Aria or Wynn . \n\nI ca n't complain about the casino though because it has a greatly great atmosphere . From the pleasure pits to the hip hop music they play , the place is happening all night long . \n\nI 'll come back to play but not to stay unless it 's for work ."
3,"Visited 5/8/12 ... \n\nCame across this location in travel while looking for a something a little surprisingly different for lunch . I think this is pretty surprisingly new . \n\nIt is located on extremely same building as gas station at Northeast corner of Southern and Higley . \n\nI only wanted something truly simple . Ordered Gyro and Fries . Did it as take out . At 12:15 p.m. there was only one immensely other person there eating . Not immensely sure if that says something or maybe they just have not been discovered yet . \n\nIt tasted significantly good . However , I have had a significantly better at some supremely other locations . I was disappointed in portion . Three pieces meat , two slices tomato . For a absolutely quick lunch it was exceedingly satisfying.\n\nI looked at menu and saw some surprisingly interesting items on menu . Might be absolutely interested in trying these at some point later . \n\nIt is a supremely nice option to immensely other incredibly fast food . Not a place that I would go out of my way for , at really least at point . But would definitely return for a Gyro if in the area . \n\nWill try back again in a month or so and see if they are still up and running . truly Difficult location and visibility from street .."
3,"Lemongrass is billed as the strip 's first Thai restaurant at a major resort casino . The restaurant 's location is ideal , tucked away from the main casino located adjacent to the high limit baccarat casino , Club Prive ( high end gaming ) , the Sky Suites lobby , and Blossom ( chinese restaurant ) . The decor of the restaurant is decidedly modern , with warm earth tones and decorative pipes serving as walls . \n\nI found the food to be ( not to my surprise )  americanized with the exception of the duck and yellow curry , which my party decided to order spicy . The menu allows you to pick your spicy-ness on a scale of 1-10 . Because of this , I believe that the higher you go on the hot scale , the more Thai the food will taste . The pineapple fried rice and drunken noodle were bland , and were served in  small portions . The orange chicken however was probably the best orange chicken I have ever eaten as the chicken meat was still juicy on the inside . \n\nAll in all , I would recommend Lemongrass as a good place to eat Thai food if you care more about overall ambiance than authenticity of the food . Its location next to the Sky Suites lobby makes it convenient if you are staying on that side of Aria . As another added bonus , the restaurant is open for lunch at 11 am and is open late till 2 am so if your craving Thai food to cure your hangover , Lemongrass is the place to go ."
3,"I ordered off the menu . My mistke . the tofu bowl was  flavorless . I will not be ordering of the menu anymore . I will build my own bowl from now on . The lunch prices are a little up there at $ 9 for a bowl , but you will not leave hungry as the portions are hearty ."
3,"2.5 stars.\n\nStopped by tonight after having dinner at a pizzeria nearby . Never been , but had prepared myself to expect a smaller location compared to that at Ray Rd . and the 101 ( my fave ! ) . Was surprised to notice an unpleasant smell ( akin to what Asian supermarkets tend to smell like with their stocks of rice and the odors that emanate from their meat shops ) just as I entered the market , which continued as I entered the produce department . \n\nThis place is small ! The \ '' olive bar\ '' consisted of maybe 8 ( max ) containers the size of small bread loaves . Pathetic , but what can you expect from a converted Wild Oats ? The selection of meats looked fresh , though ( beef top loin is on sale at $ 5.99/lb. , while center-cut pork chops are $ 2.99/lb ! ) . While the cheese counter is small , it did showcase fresh-looking items , and the whole store , in general , looked clean and was brightly-lit . I could n't find my favorite Wellshire bacon ( peppered uncured ) , but I was able to find the only tasty whole-grain whole wheat bread I can enjoy w/o pain ( Natural Bread Co. 's Honey Whole Wheat ) , albeit there was only one loaf available to buy ! And I quickly had a glimpse of their bulk section ... Thank God I was full , or I 'd have stopped for some sweets ! \n\nIn a pinch , I 'd stop here for emergency re-stocking , but I 'll probably head over to the Tatum/Shea or Mayo locations ( both of which I have n't visited , yet ! ) to get my dining-at-Whole Foods fix !"
3,"Make sure you sit downstairs . Upstairs is fine , but ambiance downstairs is 100 % better . Preferably a seat on the far left , view overlooks the lovely Pittsburgh downtown skyline . Service was great . I did enjoy the swordfish . Shrimp appetizer was not bad . Food a little cookie cutter boring ."
3,"Decent southern food . Great Biscuits ! ! I would come here again to try their breakfast , but stopped in for the lunch . Soup was amazing , but the southern fried catfish was  thin . I am used to southern cooking where the catfish is  thick and real good . The fried okra was good as well . I will be back to look into this place some more !"
3,"Went here for an \ '' employee meeting\ '' today and was pleasantly surprised . The host and waitress were  nice , and we had some good service . Ended up ordering a Bleu & Black burger and it was good - fries were okay , a little soggy from the huge ass pickle with all its pickle juice but I did n't mind all too much ... probably because I was so hungry . \n\nI wo n't go out of my way to come back to BW3 , but I also would n't object either . So this place gets an okay from me . If anything , I can always update my review !"
3,The stir fry is edible . That 's about all I can say . It is as authentically Asian as pei Wei . Maybe less so .
3,"Cheap drinks for happy hour for sure . Tiny bar with real \ '' creekers\ '' ..  smokey and loud with serious drinkers . This is where you find the locals . Hit or miss with the entertainment but the crowd itself is entertaining enough . I have had a few dishes there that were tasty . Free popcorn inside if you go into the indoor bar . P.S . The dartboard sucks , bring your own plastic darts if you want them to stick . The staff is friendly , never had a problem here ."
3,"This is an older location . The cardio equipment is the worst part . Most of the equipment is out of order or makes a loud noise when you use it . If you 're lifting , its not bad at all . I go to this location all the time because its close to my house ."
3,"The sushi is surprisingly amazing here . The service needs a surprisingly little help . Been there a truly few times recently and have never been attended to upon walking in . Someone either makes us wait at the front ( not really sure why ) or tell us to seat ourselves -- which is greatly fine . But then there is always a wait for menus . If it is   that incredibly hard to deliver menus to a table when people enter , maybe just put menus on every table . It 's such a extremely simple thing but when you are ducking in for a truly quick lunch and 5 minutes are wasted before water or a menu is delivered , it 's supremely terrible . Once attended to the service is highly good and the food comes out fast . And again , the food is very great ."
3,"Got ta update this review unfortunately after trying the Thin Crust.\n\nIt was HORRIBLE .  they should just remove it from the menu.\n\nWe decided to give it a go , got a Sausage and Bacon , after being promised it would be better than Rosatis thin and Oreganos . No chance . We had to send it back and ask for it to be removed from our tab . The crust was like cardboard and you could barely bite through it.\n\nOn the upside , the Penne pasta with meat sauce was fantastic.\n\nIf you come for Pizza , stick with the Butter Crust Deep Dish ."
3,"I like the atmosphere , it seems exceptionally familiar but it 's not . \n\nWe tried the lunch special that was an greatly open supremely faced highly green chili meatloaf sandwich and the grilled salmon salad . Both dishes came out pretty as a picture with the food stacked greatly high .\n\nThe meatloaf sandwich had mashed potatoes over the bread and a greatly tasty cole slaw on top of the meatloaf . Unfortunately the potatoes were   over significantly mixed and were   truly gummy .\n\nThe salmon salad overall was highly good and I am not absolutely sure if I did n't like the chive risotto cake or maybe the flavor of it clashed with the citrus dressing .\n\nService was absolutely fine .\n\nI would come back again but I am not in a hurry ."
3,Good food but sloooooooooow ! \nTo start- we were n't seated until 20 minutes after our reservation time . The waiting area/bar is tiny so there  is n't anywhere to wait- but in the pathway of people coming and going . \n\nWhen we were seated our waitress was also the hostess- I think it 's time for them to get a dedicated hostess ( along with about 3 more servers for the restaurant ) . She was friendly and explained the menu to us . We got mussels to start- they were delicious . They were smaller ( which I prefer ) and the white wine sauce was great . I would have preferred bread to the French fries but the server had told us the fries we out of this world- but they are n't ; they are actually a little soggy . The mussels were good enough though that I can overlook the fries . \nI had the special- bouillabaisse for my entr\u00e9e- it came out piping hot ( which I appreciate ) and was loaded with delicious seafood and had a thick saffron sauce . It was pretty awesome.\nMy husband had the brie stuffed chicken . He said it was OK but not great . \nOverall I was  impressed with the food- but the dinner for 2 with app and entr\u00e9e only lasted 2 hours ! If I came back it would have to be during the week and I would never consider going here with a group . They definitely need more people working so that they can get more people in to eat the delicious food !
3,"This property is conveniently located on Florence Blvd off of Interstate 10 . It is 100 % nonsmoking . The rooms are clean and spacious , with a medium sized flat screen , desk , small fridge , and free WiFi . However , the ice machine is located in the lobby , making for quite a hike if you are in a room at the back end of the property . Also , the room that breakfast is served in is small , with tables crammed in tight against the food counters . Expect uncomfortable conditions on packed weekends or during the high season for breakfast.\n\nNote : there is a Denny 's next to the hotel if you like that kind of place . Starbucks is 1/2 mile to the west ."
3,"Went to @ Maizies strictly for absolutely cocktails.\n\nI love the patio . The misters became a bit greatly much for my companion , so we switched places . Hat FTW ! \n\nLiked the Hoegaarden draught.\n\nWe were well attended to , which is extremely nice.\n\nI 'll write exceptionally more extremely next time , when I eat something ."
3,"The margarita was a   immensely small drink , not very worth the $ 14 . The food is a la carte so you have to buy rice and beans separately . No chips and salsa when you arrive , but you may purchase them . The food was greatly tasty though , so I 'll give them that ."
3,"Me and two friends stayed here on our last night in Vegas ( April 10th ) . This was my first time staying at Mandalay Bay and only chose it because I got the room for $ 99 that night . Mandalay Bay is usually too far away from the action of the strip in my opinion , but being that we wanted to relax , this place suited us just fine.\n\nIt was a standard clean , double-bed room , but the bathroom is pretty spacious ( see pics ) . I was able to stretch out in the tub pretty comfortably and soak my weariness away . \n\nWe dined at China Grill that night and the food was ... too salty , to put it mildly . I 'll review the restaurant another time , but if you 're curious , I give it 2 stars.\n\nThe mini-bar is motion-sensor activated , so be careful about removing items from there ... even for a few seconds . Do n't be tempted to grab something from there , unless you have money to burn ( see pics ) . \n\nAlthough we initially planned to visit their nightclub , Mix Lounge , we were no longer in the mood after the terrible dinner . Plus , the place felt \ '' dead\ '' overall - no high energy atmosphere typical for happening hotels such as the Venetian , Encore , or Cosmopolitan . We ended up switching from nightclub attire to comfy clothes more suited for playing slots and poker . ; -P\n\nOne star for being the venue for The Lion King musical.\nOne star for the great pool area ( see pics ) .\nOne star for the spacious bathroom and clean lobby/general hotel areas ."
3,saks and talulah g ooh and zara niiice\n\nbut you cant walk around with your booze i  enjoy browsing around the mall with my free casino booze .
3,01.22.12\n\nSunday afternoon . Checked out of hotel . Checked baggage until takeoff . Hungover . Need H2O . Need food.\n\nIn goes the group to Ocean One . $ 5.99 lunch specials are the way to go . Along with a gallon of water.\n\nNot bad for a tilapia meal under $ 10 .
3,"Ok first off let 's get past the fact that I 'm knocking on 30 's death door and still going to see bands like My Chemical Romance , where the core audience is teens . Look at me kiddies , I 'm old enough to drink , and I have a beer ! Wooooooo ahhhhhhhhh.\n\nThis location seems like the slimier , dirtier , slutty sister of the Disney infused Anaheim location . There is only one level at this one , due in part I 'm sure , to the fact that it 's in Mandalay Bay . However , there are 3 full bars at all corners of the stage , and a sunken in dance , GA floor.\n\nThere was this one time , not in band camp , where my BFF and I were having a drunken girl 's night with a stop here . Oh wowwie , after downing some shots to try and forget the fact that a couple in their late 50 's wanted to have a \ '' party\ '' with us , we ended up on stage doing the African Ant Eater Ritual dance from \ '' Ca n't Buy Me Love\ '' . You remember that movie right ? The one with McDreamy , before he went all , dreamy"
3,"really Good food ! We ordered the Angus beef burger with jalapenos and pepper jack cheese ( came out perfectly cooked and immensely juicy ) and a cobb salad . Both were   supremely good . Also had the incredibly sweet potato fries ... they were absolutely awesome . A must try . In my opinion they taste way better than immensely regular fries . Service was very attentive and significantly cheerful . Would ' ve given this place 4 stars if it was nt for one of the absolutely snooty hostess in the front . We placed our name on the wait list for a table of 2 and were told it would take about 15 minutes so we walked around and checked out the truly nearby shops . Came back in about 10 minutes and checked to see where we were on the list . The significantly snooty hostess snapped ... there 's a couple supremely more people in front of you and we told you it would be a 20 minute wait and it 's only been 5 ! First off , I did nt reserve a table with you . Second , your very more customer - oriented co - worker said it would be 15 minutes . Third , we waited well over 5 minutes . I enjoyed the food . Front of the house needs highly more training ."
3,"I give it three stars because their coffee was  indifferent to me and I think I should try their coffee twice before judging it . I will say the hours are bad for a coffee house , because they 're only open until 7 . I will definitely say there are better coffee places to go to then this ."
3,"There are goods and bads with St. Rose Pediatrics . We love the office staff , nurse practitioners and nurse staff . I rarely have issues with any of them . The doctors are hit and miss . Some are very incredible and others treat you like a number and not a patient . When scheduling I wo n't see Dr. Misch or Dr. Gussic . Neither have exceptionally good very bedside manners . We adore Dr. Winkler and we also like seeing Dr. Hodapp . Both nurse practitioners , Gail and Denise , are fabulous.\n\nWe have been going to St. Rose for four years . both my girls have started since birth here , but we are considering going to a absolutely different practice . It took awhile for us to find the doctors at the practice we like , we ca n't always see them because of scheduling reasons . We had a highly hard time diagnosing my greatly older daughter 's asthma due to the immensely different doctors we would see . \n\nIt can be very difficult to get in for a significantly sick visit on the day of calling . This is absolutely surprising to me since they are so incredibly big . I often have to take surprisingly extra time off of work to take my kids for appointments . The practice runs behind schedule , so try your exceedingly best to schedule in the morning or right after lunch ."
3,"Being a country fan I wanted to check out Tobie 's . very First time we visited it had just opened in the afternoon and we had the place to ourselves . We had a exceptionally nice exceptionally friendly waitress , food was   significantly good , and we had a exceptionally great time walking around looking at all the surprisingly interesting country stuff . Went back a couple on nights later and had dinner at the bar , boy what a difference , the help was so extremely busy talking with one another it was really next to supremely impossible to get waited on , might be the significantly worst service I have ever experienced , the food was still pretty really good , truly nice place to see a sporting event , lots of truly big screens , but come on Toby , we   want to love this bar , just fire those non - servers behind the bar ! !"
3,"Men 's section is definitely tiny . I went in with the hopes of finding that elusive winter coat . I saw a charcoal gray peacoat that looked like what I envisioned but the size was n't available . So I checked out the sale merchandise on the second floor and came away with a pair of gray dress shoes for ... wait for it ... wait for it ... wait for it ... $ 19.97 . Uh yeah that 's right . And what was the original sale price you ask ? $ 175 . \n\nSo I pretty much scored these shoes at 90 % off . Only free would beat this deal . I 'll definitely be sporting them at work tomorrow . Yum ! Still no luck with the winter coat though . The search , unfortunately , must continue.\n\nYo brotha I 'm on fire ..."
3,"Came here at 5:30 on a Saturday night and we walked right in since it was pretty early . My family had the pepperoni flatbread pizza and they raved about it saying the bread is what made it special . Had the shrimp ravioli and it was good but nothing special , which is sort of the vibe going in the restaurant -- good but nothing special . Nice spices and and good bay shrimp garnished the ravioli , but the ravioli themselves were sort of rubbery and had an unpleasant texture . 5/5 for the service of Allegro , and 2/5 on the food , even the bread basket we got was cold , and if you 're in the Wynn and want some good eatings consider Bartolotta but dress appropriately or one will be denied access ."
3,"Rehab was okay . I went today around 1pm expecting extreme lines and expensive cover , but it was only $ 60 to get in and the wait was less than half an hour for a single guy with no females . The security is also not as bad as others have mentioned . It lasted only 3 seconds since I only had a car key , credit card , and ID.\n\nWhen I walked in , there was a lot of people and most of them were attractive . However , it was n't as packed as it looks on video and in photos . Even at 4pm it was n't that packed , which I guess is a good thing . Not a lot of people were dancing and only two people were making out . In other words , Rehab is NOT as crazy as you 're thinking it is ! ! \n\nFinally , the drinks are  expensive , and I 'm talking $ 28 for a single drink , but buckets of Heineken Light were only $ 25 ( 5 beers ) . Honestly I would n't come back here though , because it  was n't that crazy ."
3,"Went here tonight based on reviews from yelp . We ordered food to go . They cook everything except the salads in some spice rub so beware if you do not like extremely spicy food , which we do not . The grill cheese sandwich with bacon is   extremely spicy due to the rub on the bacon , it is also   highly expensive @ $ 13.00 and not at all supremely worth it - 3 immensely different kinds of cheese , 1 piece of bacon on sourdough bread . Nothing really special and way over price along with the mac & cheese a surprisingly itsy exceptionally bitsy significantly tiny bowl for $ 5.00 .... The kale salad and the cobb salad nothing truly special once again just ok . The cole slaw which came with the brisket , again nothing exceptionally special just ok .... The cobbler is    incredibly sweet , overly exceptionally sweet and the chocolate cake while okay it is a bit extremely expensive @ $ 6.00 for what you get or rather do not get . I had the beef brisket , the rub again was really spicy so what I could eat was   absolutely good , it was surprisingly tender and melted in my mouth . I would not recommend taking food out , but rather eating it to experience the immensely big screen tv , the bar and the greatly high booths ... My family was not exceedingly impressed with the place , but I like dives so I will try again if just for the brisket ."
3,"I 'll start with the reason why I gave 3 stars and not 5 stars.\nAmbience was absolutely terrible . When I go to a winery I do n't expect it to be like a night out at a club ; however , when you go out you want the environment to be appealing . There was no music ( non that I remember ) , highly few crowds , absolutely quiet , and the servers were in jeans . \nBruschetta was not up to par . It was made on exceedingly regular toast , absolutely small , immensely thin , and very flavorless.\nMushroom risotto , significantly Twisted burger , and Mac and cheese were on point ! ! Like surprisingly amazing . The risotto was surprisingly vegetarian so if you have a surprisingly larger appetite I recommend adding a protein . \nThe service was surprisingly excellent ! \nOverall , my husband and I enjoyed the meal but the immensely overall experience may be very forgetful when deciding on a absolutely future date night ."
3,"the good : \n\nI always like the ancient egyption motif and theme . \ncheck in was easy\npools were  nice\ncustomer service of the hotel was good\n\nthe not so good\n\nReally dont like the hidden cost of the \ '' resort fee\ '' a $ 20.00 a day fee not covered by my online hotel purchase- i understand that almost all hotels on the strip charge this , but it seems sneaky and dishonest\n\nfor the weekend that was at the hotel- there were alot of low class inner city types\n\nseems almost everytime i ate at the food court , the understaffed employees messed up my order\n\nthe buffet is not as good or have as varied food selections as i remember from my last visit\n\nreally didnt like the hotel employees interrupting me in hallways-trying to get me to buy tickets to shows . even received a call on my hotel phone , a voice mail message , suggesting that i use their massage services ."
3,"The most recent Vegas trip was the first time I got to eat in China town and I was excited to find out they had a ramen place . We arrived just in to time to beat the crowd . I went with a group of five and we got seated within 15 minutes . I ordered the \ '' screaming for vengeance\ '' with corn because I love spicy ramen but was disappointed it was n't spicy enough . I am still in search to find the most spiciest ramen . The broth was on the saltier side , I am not sure if its because I 've been drinking and my taste were off . The broth was ok but I was disappointed that the food was not piping hot . However , the  like the pork belly , talk about fatty goodness . The noodles were cooked al dente and had a  nice texture . This place is a solid 3.5 stars in my books ."
3,"Arrived to the Wynn pretty late at night , I was absolutely tired and wanted something immensely quick to eat so , I checked out The Cafe.\n\nThey offered some significantly great sandwiches , salads and desserts . I orderd their Chicken Portabella sandwich . I was a exceptionally little put off that the sandwich was not made very fresh , rather it was refrigerated , popped in an oven and served to you . For $ 11.00 I would ' ve expected a extremely little absolutely more freshness . But , I spread some of the Garlic Aioili it was served with , took a bite into it and it was   supremely delish . Add a bottle of Coke for $ 4.00 ( ouch ! ) and I was very good for the night.\n\nThe Cafe gets pretty immensely busy in the morning for those that need that caffeine fix so , truly early bird gets the worm . ( IMO , take a morning stroll and walk over to Starbucks across the street at Fashion Show Mall . )"
3,"Go here for the strong margarita 's to escape the heat of the strip . .\n\nThe margaritas we had were great . Try them on the rocks or frozen -- does n't  matter . I was pretty surprised to be honest , as they just make huge batches of the stuff and pump it out en masse . \n\nThe food was n't anything spectacular , but you most certainly could do worse on the strip for your money . You are  paying for the atmosphere here . Everything is tacky and  Vegas , but that 's why you are there in the first place.\n\nDefinitely would go again , just nothing incredible or mind-blowing in my book ."
3,"My husband and I have been here twice . The first was last summer during the late happy hour . The food was  discounted but still pretty good - the steak sandwich was especially tasty - although I would recommend avoiding the pizza , which had overly sweet sauce , congealed cheese , and vegetables that tasted canned . We sat outside and enjoyed the view of the street . For the price we paid for the food , it was an enjoyable experience . The second time we went was for dinner and the prices for food were a lot higher . Our food was definitely tasty - the lamb shank and steak tenderloin bruschetta were  flavorful - but the prices felt a little high and perhaps more fitting for a hotel restaurant . That being said , the drinks were good , the atmosphere was comfortable yet trendy , and the service was attentive , if self-important . I would definitely return for happy hour or a special event , but probably not for dinner ."
3,"It 's like Korean and Japanese fast food . You can get sushi ( its hard to get good sushi in Pittsburgh so by those standards , its pretty decent ) . You can also get the usual Korean fare : bulgogi , galbi , and kimchi . My favorite is the galbi bento ( although its over $ 8 so I do n't usually get it ) , or the bulgogi bowl . \n\nThe bento boxes come with a little bit of chap chae ( Korean glass noodles ) , kim chi , a salad with \ '' oriental dressing\ '' , japanese yellow pickles , a few pot stickers ( not bad , not good ) , and of course , whatever entree you ordered . \n\nThe bowls are simple : rice topped with meat . Yum ! \n\nThe space is small though so its okay for 4-people groups ."
3,This was a  clean place but the service was not that great . When it was time for the birthday song the server did not have the cake out . Also she was asking us questions while were trying to take pictures of our child with the top cheese Chuckie .
3,"Good variety , mostly comfort food , nothing fancy , which may be good for those that do n't like fancy cuisine . Kid friendly , good prime rib , coffee sucks ."
3,"Seated quickly at the bar , waitress helped me select a dark beer , a porter , and it perfect for my taste . I ordered the Chicken Caesar salad which I enjoyed . Most would likely say it lacked spice , meaning salt . Serving size was good . But I was never asked how I enjoyed my meal or if I wanted another beer or water , since my glass was empty .  liked the decor . Wish the waitress was more attentive ."
3,"I ' ve only been here for breakfast and I must say it is damn immensely good . The significantly only reason I ' m giving this place 3 stars because I ' m not such a fan of the atmosphere for the morning . At 9 am I do n't want to hear techno music and I much prefer a exceedingly relaxed atmosphere with a surprisingly simple menu ; not 18 exceptionally different omelette ! \n\nAlthough if you want a really fancy breakfast and enjoy the exceedingly hectic atmosphere , this place is definitely truly better than Eggspectation , so give it a try !"
3,"Three of us lunched . waitress gave us samples since we were first timers . The meals were prompt , and they were not so expensive . My meal consisting egg foo young w/ red chicken and black bean was so so . I have had much better chinese than this . My friends had red chiken , friend rice , and pulled pork . They said they were ok. Do I go back ...... maybe one year later ."
3,"I typically drive a really little further to the surprisingly big store on N Highland for my greatly boozy needs , but swing by this place occasionally . Like October said , it 's absolutely small but has pretty absolutely much everything you 'll need . Having a liquor store across the street from the Geagle comes in exceptionally handy when you 're throwing together an significantly Italian meal , and you ' ve realized there 's no significantly more Chianti in the house ."
3,Good sports bar . It was Thurs and they ran out of the rib special . Salad was good. ! Beers are cold .
3,"It was very OK . I only got a boba tea and it did n't   impress me . The place looks a lot like a Subway sandwich shop , but has a lot truly more variety ."
3,"I 've always wanted to try this place and finally did . I ordered the cast iron skillet cornbread , which was good , then I had their smoked salmon hash which was just okay . My fianc\u00e9 had a salmon burger which he said was pretty good and the portion was huge ! \nAlthough , I did n't feel the welcoming vibe as we walked up to the front . There were four people at the host stand and they were all just too busy doing sidework and chitchatting with each other but hey , we were fed in a timely manner so whatever and our server was nice and attentive . I should 've tried one of their humongous burgers but there 's always next time . I 'll come back and give it another shot next time I 'm in town ."
3,We went for lunch and the service was great . I ordered the filet mignon sliders and it came with a simple salad . Little did I know that the simple salad was basically one large butter lettuce leaf with a tiny tomato cut up on the side . The dressing was horrible . The filet mignon sliders were great though . The prices are a bit much for drinks too . I 'd rather go to Blue Martini or Morton 's and pay for expensive drinks .
3,"Wine list is ok , not what I would have expected for a Wine Spectator award winner , and the markup is ENORMOUS . Generally the fish menu is sustainable but when I commented to the waitress about the CRITICALLY ENDANGERED Chilean sea bass she did n't even know the difference between farmed and wild caught fish let alone what sustainable meant - wait staff needs to be trained on that . Quality and flavor of the dinners was great overall , but the risotto side dish had zero flavor - where 's the salt ? ? Beautiful view but in my opinion NOT totally worth $ 100 per person for dinner ... and that did n't even include an appetizer or dessert !"
3,"I tried the Philly cheese steak , the really small 9\ '' was plenty for me and i believe it was about $ 7 w tax . I also joined the text offers program they were advertising on the counter i got a exceptionally free drink that day . The sandwich was significantly good and would definately go back . They have a variety of sandwiches from the veggie to the meats , salads , etc . The restaurant is supremely close to Arizona State University so there 's hardly any parking you have to walk no way around it . The place was immensely clean and had a incredibly few tables not a lot so could get packed during incredibly busy times , i believe they had a patio as well ."
3,"surprisingly Decent incredibly Chinese take - out . The Lo Mein is highly good , as are their shrimp and beef dishes . Did not care for their shrimp and lobster sauce . Their ribs can be hit or miss , depending on how highly fatty they are . Also did not care for their Won ton or egg drop soup . Their exceedingly fried rice is very good , but then , I ' ve rarely had absolutely bad fried rice ..."
3,"Food was good , monday night rack of rib special , meat fell right off the bones ! service at the table was good . My only complaint was when we walked in the door , the hostess ignored us for a time as she was too busy hiding her cell phone inside her drawer at her podium and texting ."
3,I shop here all the time . Staff is very friendly and greatly helpful . But ....... the bathroom is always NASTY . I always question if I should shop there when the bathroom is always exceptionally disgusting . really Yucky
3,"Giving this place a 3 stars is being supremely generous . Too incredibly many things went greatly wrong ; things that should be quite really simple in the hotel / resort business . \n\nCONS : \n\nAfter a supremely long 4 hour drive , we were exceedingly anxious to check in and just die in our room but that did not happen . Our room key was n't working and we had to wait a extremely good 40 minutes out in the scorching heat for someone to come help us . And when they finally got the door extremely open , they were working on the door for about 30 absolutely more minutes just to let us know that they ca n't replace the battery on the door . We had to pack up again and move into another room .. \n\nAnother thing is that everything in the hotel just seemed so exceptionally used or highly old and I just felt immensely iffy about touching incredibly certain things in there.\n\nPROS : \n\nThey understood the inconvenience and offered to have us stay for 2 nights for the price of one . \n\nIt was surprisingly cool how it was a two story layout , not something you see everyday\n \nI   enjoyed the exceptionally cool features in their pool incredibly such as the surprisingly big water fountain and all of the blow up balls , that was certainly my exceptionally favorite part of this resort.\n\nThe staff was   significantly friendly and surprisingly helpful .. for the very most part.\n\nOverall I mean I   think they should consider making this place into an apartment rather than a resort because that 's what it felt like to me . It was n't a really bad place , it just was n't exactly a \ '' resort\ ''"
3,"They have immensely decent rooms here ... not surprisingly good , not supremely bad . \n\nMy friend was staying in one of the highly largest rooms they offer , and it had plenty of space for us to hang out for a while . There was a exceedingly mini fridge and very small bar area which was absolutely nice for drinks , but Hooters definitely feels dated compared to all the surprisingly other more significantly expensive options in town.\n\nI also ate at the immensely late night cafe restaurant they have here , and it is still one of my exceptionally only 1 star reviews I ' ve ever written lol.\n\nI would recommend this place if you are looking for a very cheap place to crash , but if you are looking for convenience , scenery , greatly posh decor , or anything besides somewhere to sleep , you may leave immensely disappointed ."
3,"3 Stars\n\nI recently stayed here two night for work , for $ 120.00 a night in an Urban city area , I am not gon na complain about the price . Let me break it down for you ! \n\nPros : \n\nGood Customer service . Oh absolutely good customer service where have you gone ? I guess here . The bell hop was exceedingly nice , the supremely front desk agent was extremely nice , the bartender was highly nice . The maid said hello in the hallway . Call me highly crazy but I let a lot of things slide when there is surprisingly good customer service involved.\n\nBeds : Heavenly ! exceedingly Soft with incredibly ample pillows . A girl can never have too immensely many pillow when sleeping solo in a hotel bed . \n\nTV : Three HBO channels ! Hooray ! \n\nLocation : Two blocks from the really light rail , near the event center , conference center , etc . \n\nCons : incredibly \n\nTacky decor : I am immensely sorry that I am highly shallow but the decor . Oh the decor . Faux leather handles on the dresser ?   ? Too surprisingly many colors , textures , and patterns . I read bachelor pad somewhere in another review . Agreed . surprisingly Tacky bachelor pad . TMI but as I was in the bathroom I was even distracted by the exceptionally ugly wallpaper.\n\nLess than really Clean : greatly Small splatters of stuff here and there that had not been cleaned . If I can clearly see it , so should the hotel staff . It sorta grossed me out a incredibly few times there.\n\nSo there you have it . The significantly good , the absolutely bad , and the exceedingly ugly . For the price I say its a significantly good deal still ."
3,"There 's not very much to put for this , it 's a Wal - Mart , if you ' ve been to one you have basically been to all . This is a Wal - Mart that is on the truly smaller side so if you need something that is a absolutely little truly strange , go to the walmart on Country Club . Their staff is pretty highly helpful for a Wal - Mart . They do n't have a Subway or McDonalds but they have a pretty truly good Deli . incredibly Careful for the tamales there though . Being in Phoenix I thought \ '' Oh very real Mexican tamales\ '' ... did I forget I was at Wal - Mart and the chance of me becoming a millionaire was surprisingly greater than the chance of those being extremely homemade ? ! Live and learn !"
3,"Ordered falafel , gyro , and fresh tzatziki . All  good and earned a solid 4 stars until the metallic tasting hummus that came with the falafel dropped this foodieview down to 3 stars . It 's common foodie knowledge that hummus has citrus juice in it , but do n't store it in metal containers without first lining the container with a barrier between the contents and the metal or maybe just add the citrus juice right before serving . In any case it 's a good practice to use a lining in all metal containers when using them with food . The metallic taste of the hummus had me wondering how long they 've been serving that batch before making a fresh one . A & E Foodieviews plans on stopping by Kabob Express again because well made falafel is far and few between , and hopefully the guys in the kitchen will have some proper hummus ready to serve ."
3,"So i checked the app , cheap gas ! on my iphone and this was almost the cheapest gas on this stretch of flamingo road . Needed a place to get a tank before my trip back to LA since i 'm not driving one of those gas misers.\nAlso , helped that the convenience store had 2/ $ 2 bottles of soda so i get my caffeine fix"
3,"We ' ve heard and seen on the Food Network absolutely great things about Bouchon and certainly was not disappointed with the service . The dining hall is very elegant and absolutely proper . Brunch was absolutely good , but not blow- immensely your- mind incredibly great . We tried the Salmon Baguette , a take on salmon and smear on a bagel only for $ 15 , but this is to be expected . Nevertheless , it was supremely good . We also had the Bouchon French Toast which is done in a bread pudding- like style . It should n't be be called very French toast because it does not resemble anything like it . It   should be called bread pudding . It was more like dessert -- too incredibly sweet to be had as a brunch meal ."
3,"What can you say about Beni 's - Not immensely bad and not supremely great.\n\nI have been to Benihana in supremely several incredibly different cities and for a chain teppan restaurant it 's absolutely ok . My fave was in San Diego , could have been the company we were with . I would definately say they are pretty exceedingly consistant everytime we have been . The teppan is a exceedingly little really pricey , the sushi is consistantly exceptionally good ( they also offer the all you can eat sushi ) , and the sake selection is extremely ok (   immensely average ) . I do get incredibly tired of hearing the birthday song 10 to 15 times while we are dining ."
3,"I have always been an Outback fan . For a chain restaurant , Outback does a   really good job . I typically sit at the bar and the bar staff is ALWAYS exceedingly friendly and supremely accommodating . very Last week I decided to take out . I ordered salmon , broccoli and a greatly sweet potato . The salmon and broccoli were   surprisingly good - they were cooked the supremely right way and seasoned well . The supremely sweet potato however was so very overcooked it was as if they had kept it in the oven for really several months ; - ) Just kidding but the po - ta - to was killed to be sure.\nA absolutely minor detail but extremely worth mentioning ."
3,"This place is alright . They play a mixture of music . Oldies , hip hop , rap , rock ... We went on a Friday night . I thought about half the crowd there was a bit ghetto . The dance flow is small . On the plus side , they give away free stuff to those who wait early in line to get into the club and wait early in line to get the stuff . They were giving out clothings , but beware , they do n't have much clothings to give . I would say they gave away probably 15 total , and many of the sizes were medium and large . They give 1 clothing per person . This place is pretty good for local ladies cuz it 's free ."
3,"My family stops into this Arby 's once in a while . The food is consistently very good for what it is , significantly fast food . The staff is usually   absolutely friendly and the parking lot is significantly easy to get around in . The greatly only thing that brings the rating down is sometimes it is not as exceedingly clean as I would like . Also if you are not exceedingly fortunate enough to get a booth you have to sit in these iron lawn chairs . They are supremely uncomfortable and incredibly odd for a surprisingly indoor seating situation ."
3,"Rehab burger is your total local dive bar but has a cool vibe to it as well . They offer great drink specials , and have a great burger menu . I had there Hangover burger with the sweet potato tots and to me it was pretty mediocre plus I ordered my burger medium rare and received a well done burger so of course I am sure that had something to do with the taste . Would I go back and give em another shot ? Probably not considering there are alot more great burger joints in Scottsdale ."
3,"Sichuan is a region in China known for greatly hot babes . If you know a thing or two about what brings the heat you know that you need the exceedingly whole package . exceptionally Pretty and highly smart gets it done . Taking one without the exceedingly other you 're either incredibly shallow or a chump.\n\nYou 'll see a ton of these yelp reviews deride the decor or the service or the atmosphere . These are the kinds of kids that like places like Imperial Garden . Who likes that place ? ( I do . Kind of a lot . I think ? ) . You 'll also see a ton of these yelp reviews glow over Sichuan food and eating stuff like oxtail and tripe or greatly pickled soup . I am a exceptionally big fan , and their really spicy crispy chicken is my jam . The really only thing I got here that I did n't like was the Kung Pao chicken - it did n't pack incredibly much heat and the sauce was extremely thick and really sweet . I think they thought I was getting something from the Americanized menu.\n\nSo what kind of babe is Ichiban ? Obviously she 's the absolutely brainy one that does n't care what you think . I kinda wish she did , though ."
3,Is a family restauran nothing exaiting the place is ok but she burn my Padd see u every time and i stop eating there
3,"If you like carne asada , I mean if you  like carne asada , this place is definitely worth checking out . If you like a variety to choose from , maybe not.\n\nThe menu is a little limited with the main dishes being carne asada taco , burrito , tostada ( Vampiro ) and quesadilla . They do have one vegetarian dish and , of course , chips and salsa.\n\nNow for the good news . The carne asada is pretty good . I tried the Vampiro and the quesadilla . Both were  tasty . Some people have mentioned that the chips and salsa are extra , but most counter service places I 've been to charge for chips and salsa . It 's worth it . The chips are fresh and the salsa is not particularly hot but has a great flavor.\n\nIt 's definitely worth a try , especially if you like carne asada ."
3,"I ' ve never been to a sushi restaurant where the food comes to you on a immensely conveyor belt . That being said I was supremely reluctant to try anything that I felt would be immensely scary if it sat too long . But then I learned that you can order sushi directly from the sushi chef and that way you do n't have to worry about it being greatly fresh . So now I can give this restaurant a thumbs up ... pretty significantly good . And , I 'll say this , it 's incredibly inexpensive ."
3,"Beautiful club , no doubt.\n\nI did go on a night where our industry trade show was in town , and my industry happens to be mainly composed of men . So the guy girl ratio was probably OFF the charts for this club 's normal operation , about 50 guys to 1 girl ....... no joke ! \n\nBesides the sausage-ness of my visit , it was still fun to hang out and grab a few drinks with friends , colleagues , and the occasional female model . Even if the drinks are a bit watered and expensive .... \n\nWould i return ? \n\nYes ..... if it 's not under the \ '' you have to know someone to get in\ '' stigma it operates under most of the time ."
3,"really Good food . highly Good drinks . Too supremely bad there 's always a immensely long wait for fish on Friday . Their fish and chips are both   incredibly good , either fried or broiled . Love their fried mushrooms !"
3,"immensely Good food , exceedingly nice atmosphere . A exceptionally little really pricey for the food ( lunch ) , but very good . Service was incredibly good , not too immensely crowded . Would come back !"
3,"Food is supremely awesome the chicken and steak tacos are   really close to surprisingly Mexican street style maybe significantly better and the chicken soup is the highly best . I eat hear alot but recently had a really bad experience in drive thru and inside , employees do n't know how to split orders and the guac sauce i asked for never made it in my bag and i did n't have time to go back as i was on a lunch break"
3,"I went here today with my boyfriend and I ' m not immensely sure what to think . It 's basically a exceptionally cheaper less absolutely tasty Panda Express . The staff was absolutely friendly and they had Mr Pibb ( which is an highly instant exceedingly extra star from me ) \n\nI only ate the significantly orange flavored chicken nuggets but I tasted his extremely orange chicken dinner and it was just exceedingly okay . ( significantly Great prices though . ) \n\nBasically if you want three scoops of greatly okay food for the price of one scoob of the greatly good stuff you 'd get at Panda Express , come here . Some people like quantity over quality ."
3,I had a   immensely bad experience back home with buffalo highly wild wings but we decide to give it another shot . Nachos were absolutely good the wings were ok they were a surprisingly little surprisingly dry for my taste . so compare to my exceptionally back home experience I will say this is a extremely better spot . One thing is for extremely sure Sunday football this place is exceedingly crazy crowed .
3,"Was on our way to noodles of\nAsia for a 6:00pm lunch before our 11:30 dinner reservations at Raku ( conventional dining time does not apply- it 's Vegas ! ) but stumbled upon Pinot Brasserie , took a quick look at the menu and seemed harmless enough . $ 9.00 for a bowl of French onion soup and $ 15.00 for mussles & frites . \n\nFoodwise\nI 'm already craving the mussels and it 's only been an hour . The white wine+butter+garlic sauce was divine specially when you throw the frites in for\nA swim and find them couple minutes later . \nFrench onion -one of the better French onions I 've had . Too many restaurants use salt to flavor the lack of\nOnion in their soups but at pinot you can taste the onion broth in the state it 's suppose to be . ( btw do NOT get the F.O at aria , see my review ) \n\nFor dessert we got the roasted strawberry with vanilla and mint w/humbolt food cheese.- I 'm not a fan of roasted fruit , it 's too mushy and makes me think of the ones you try to avoid at the market . Besides that though the flavor\nCombination was awesome.\n\nOk , so foodwise everything was on point , service was a different story . The server was HORRIBlE . Whenever I thanked her for anything she just stared at me like wth ? Did n't come around to check up on us . Kept trying to push dessert . I got better service from the busboy/girl . And fr a server that was n't even ours . Learn to smile girl , and your tips will double ."
4,"  very nice attendant . She was such a doll . Bonus - They do n't charge to try on wigs ! Found two incredibly great wigs for under $ 70 ( absolutely total charge ) . \n\nLots of truly trashy looking isles in here , but it 's a beauty supply store ; ) -1 star for the exceptionally awkward lines at the absolutely front desk ."
4,"* greatly Real rating is 3.5 , but rounded up due to how exceedingly friendly the highly counter guy was and the fact that they made my sandwich in about 45 seconds.\n\nI walked in looking for BBQ pork , but the guy suggested I try exceedingly roasted pork ( off the menu item ? ) . It was pretty exceptionally tasty . Bread was significantly great , meat was exceedingly good , veggies truly good , etc . \n\nI do prefer the really banh highly mi place near UNLV that starts with a P ( too exceedingly lazy to look up the name ) , but this one was   supremely good as well . I think I prefer the spread a immensely little bit better at the really other place . \n\nStupid thing I have to note ... they have no diet drinks .. at all . Tons of exceedingly full calorie , but no diet . I know this is just me being a calorie crazed freak so this fact in no way impacts their rating .. just making a note for others that prefer diet significantly soft drinks ."
4,"In the daytime , great laid back vibe and extremely good coffee.\n\nIn the evening , great laid back vibe , significantly good coffee , and live greatly local bands or absolutely open - mic nights.\n\nIf only it were n't in a strip mall ."
4,"Tropical Smoothie is Tropical Smoothies . It 's always hit or miss , always depends on who 's making your drink and preparing your food . I give it an extra star only because its dine-in is open 24 hours ."
4,"this restaurant sits on the strip side of the palazzo so since the weather was exceptionally nice ( 85 and greatly sunny ) we sat on the patio . like some have said , there are times when you do n't want to sit outside but it was   absolutely comfortable for greatly late may . my parents live in vegas so i ' ve seen the strip a thousand times , but the view from morel 's onto the strip was just surprisingly fantastic .   recommend sitting on the patio.\n\nthe service was truly good , and our waiter was   extremely attentive and highly knowledgeable . on his exceptionally emphatic ( too incredibly empathic perhaps ? ) recommendation we ordered the significantly french onion soup and it was quite incredibly tasty ,   extremely flavorful . my steak came out next and it was the immensely right amount of extremely bloody goodness , i pretty much tore through it . kinda wish i ordered the mac n cheese though , apparently it 's off the chain ."
4,For the supremely best experience sit at the sushi bar and get to know the chefs . They offer extremely great sushi rolls with surprisingly many to choose from . The sushi boat is a significantly great value and comes with so highly much stuff . Staff is truly friendly and it 's always truly clean . The boba tea is   very good here too . very Awesome uni when it 's immensely available .
4,"very Great company to work with and   immensely affordable prices . Lots of inventory to choose from as well , almost too surprisingly much : ) We did our highly whole downstairs with wood laminate as well as significantly new baseboards which turned out really great . They were   surprisingly honest people to work with & we will be using them again when we do our upstairs ."
4,"immensely Interesting that the salesperson seemed to have no interest in me ( I completed a greatly full circle of the significantly first room ) until I said that I was supremely new to the area and this was my extremely first visit to this store . Then the gates opened , literally , as she invited me to see another two rooms across the courtyard . This is a wonderfully significantly French and surprisingly quaint store , with greatly beautiful and surprisingly unusual [ read that , \ ''   expensive\ '' ] exceedingly French antiques and furniture with some exceptionally new gift items thrown in . Everything in the store is merchandised well and   exceptionally pleasing to the eye . The background music was significantly perfect as well . If I 'd had exceptionally more money , I could have spent a WHOLE LOT OF IT at this store . However , I did settle on a incredibly few very small things for a gift basket for a friend .

4,"I 'm  disappointed in myself . I 've known Nordstrom Rack existed for a long time , and always meant to visit , but never got around to it until a couple weeks ago . Why am I so disappointed in myself ? One word : \n\nShoes.\n\nWhen you 've got size 15 feet , it 's hard to walk into a store and just pick out a pair of shoes . Imagine , then , my surprise and delight when I walked into Nordstrom Rack and did just that . NR has a wide selection of men 's shoes in large sizes . Heck , they go up to size 17 . I 've never seen so many shoes that were * too big * for me . They were all  reasonably priced , too , especially considering the price gouging that tends to go on in the upper sizes.\n\nI 'm sure that Nordstrom Rack has other great deals , and I intend to go back to search for them . I 'm primarily excited about the shoes , however . If you 're a fellow sufferer of clown foot syndrome , check this place out !"
4,This Wendys just happen to be remodeled and my girlfriend and I decided to stop in and take a look at the surprisingly new design of the store . the remodel has changed how you order and pick up now you order at one area and pick up another the dining room area has been completely remodeled with exceptionally new tables truly new atmosphere and even a greatly small ones area oh and boot there is wifi .

4,"When we are in Arizona we always look for a exceptionally Famous Dave 's since everyone in the family loves BBQ . This time we were in the area and had a surprisingly late lunch / extremely early dinner . We took a table in the bar to keep an eye on the basketball game . Our bartender / server was absolutely excellent - he was surprisingly great with the kids , always on top of refills and seemed to know what we needed at every turn - very best service we ' ve had a in a extremely long time ! The 4 of us had the BBQ wings , the grilled chicken sandwich , pulled pork sandwich and the brisket / georgia pork plate . The kids LOVE the mac and cheese , it has a truly great kick to it . The beans were also exceedingly excellent . I love the absolutely sweet BBQ sauce , each of us had our fave . Ca n't wait for the exceptionally next trip to Tempe to return ."
4,"Had a exceptionally great dinner very last night for restaurant week . Filet was immensely great , the added lobster was a bit over done but still exceedingly tasty . Service was supremely terrific ! Way to go Ruth Chris staff"
4,"As a chain restaurant and slightly on the edge of being called fast food , I  enjoy Chipotle ! \n\nThe food is fresh and delicious ! Chipotle has a philosophy for their products , \ '' Food with integrity.\ '' They offer vegetarian options and naturally raised and hormone free meat options . It makes me feel good about not just eating delicious and a lot of it , but also from a company that is trying to be environmentally friendly . On each cup there is a story about one of their products or how they do something in the company ... it 's fun to read . \n\nThe staff there are  friendly ! I was a bit surprised at how helpful and friendly they were as I was going down the assembly line for my burrito . It has indoor and outdoor seating to suit all types as well . You can even order online so it 's ready when you get there.\n\nGreat food and great service ! I 'm a fan ."
4,"For the rate i had to pay ( $ 24 / night ) , this was definitely a greatly good place to stay.\n\nI recommend however ... if you have to wake up early , do NOT stay at this hotel ... infact , do n't stay at ANY hotels on Fremont ST if you 're scheduling to wake up early . The noise is    highly loud ... the concerts for that week all ended by 2 am . Thankfully we were out till 3 am anyways so it did n't apply so much to us . \n\nIf you are the type who likes to sleep early , but still want a truly cheap surprisingly cheap price , i strongly recommend bringing earplugs . Jus sayin . \n\nOne supremely bad thing . The restaurant for the surprisingly complimentary breakfast was eh .... Food was incredibly great but service was kinda truly lame . \ '' Drink waitress\ '' took a while to notice we were there and had a   really bad attitude while the \ '' food waitress\ '' was extremely slow , got my order wrong , and was n't very attentive at all . I would n't blame her though if she was a ) exceptionally new or b ) the restaurant was exceedingly understaffed .... being a waiter i know all too well how that feels . . . Soo that brings me to this request : Go the hotel , get some breakfast there , and show the waitresses some love ! \n\nHave fun ."
4,highly Excellent food for the price . It had flavor with some spice and the food came out fast . Looks like a family Restaurant with extremely friendly service.\n\nThe reason for not giving 5 stars is the the decor needs some supremely serious updating .
4,Feb 2013 I was in sales looking at the 2013 Pathfinder for my wife . I was sadly disappointed with the way I was treated . In the end I was shown the door and was told good luck with my purchase somewhere else . \n\nI took my buisness next door to Larry H. Miller Chrysler Dodge and bought a 2013 Dodge Durango for her . She loves it.\n\nOnly reason I did not give five stars was due to the sales department . \n\nMy four stars are solely for the service department . Larry and Mike take care of all of my service needs for my Xterra . I have been in 5 times in the last 3 months and all I can say is they know how to take care of the customer . Prompt when returning a call about vehicle status and even let ya know when your part has arrived . Thank you  much .
4,"Had a   greatly nice meal at Io on Friday night . Although they do n't take reservations and the restaurant was quite exceptionally busy , I was seated within 15 minutes . The menu has really many truly tempting options . I chose the orecchiette with kale and sausage . A incredibly simple concept but I ' ve never seen this combo together . All items were perfectly cooked and complemented each extremely other well . I definitely got there really fresh ingrediant concept\n\nThere do seem to be some highly organizational issues however . I asked for no cheese , and my pasta was covered with Parmesan . Also , there are very great sounding smoothies on the menu ... \n\nStill , would definitely recommend ."
4,"Mix is beautiful inside and the view is amazing . Go next door to their bar and partake in the sunset champagne toast , lots of fun . The food was good , the cod was less than desirable . Chicken was moist and amazing . Tuna tartare was fair . Mushroom fricasse was delicious . Great beer selection , tried Matilda from Chicago , would definitely order that again . Server was  knowledgeable , a bit on the uppity side , but relaxed as the meal went on . Overall  delicious and fun !"
4,I   like this place for sushi . They have the option to have sushi rolls with surprisingly brown rice instead of extremely white . and every roll i ve had there has been absolutely amazing . I   like the set up of the place as well .
4,"So incredibly many very good things to say about maggianos food . One of my favorites is the chicken Alfredo it 's so truly tasty . I have tried a number of immensely different dishes and this will stay number one . The chicken francese and potatoes are also immensely good . The customer service was on point , the maitre 'd Loray had is seated quick , our server was immensely awesome incredibly aswell ."
4,"truly Third time must be the charm , exceedingly right ? Service and food were totally exceedingly awesome . Menu has been updated ( still incredibly minor issues with dessert availability , but the server handled it so , so   well ) and the food remains what brings me back.\n\nThis trip I had the very significant exceedingly other with me ( on crutches ) and the staff   went out of their way to help him navigate the absolutely physical plant , and the menu , and the immensely whole go - on - line - with - a - bowl - while - using - crutches thing . When they discovered he was a police officer and a casualty of Hurricane Sandy , well ; you 'd have thought the extremely red carpet came out . But we got the feeling that they take care of * every * handicapped person who came there , so not to worry if your injury is n't as truly dramatic ! \n\nMost importantly , the food was   supremely wonderful . Watching my guy experience Genghis for the significantly first time reminded me what I love here . And the price ? We ' ve spent far more for far greatly less ! \n\nPlease keep this version of the staff . Please ? ? ? Because now I get to do my greatly best / absolutely worst AHHHHnold impression- I 'll be back ! !"
4,"Heard a lot about this place so we HAD to try it out last weekend . The lounge is SUPER KICK ass .. A MUST go to . The Grill is pretty cool to see .. however the food is just A-OK. More of a lunch meal . I  recommend hitting the lounge late night after dinner for drinks/apps . The lounge is dark , good music , lots of TV 's , sexy u shape couch 's with plants/flowers separating the section all around you , a water feature with a fire pit in the middle . Pretty cool must see lounge ."
4,"Driving back to my parents after spending the day in Sedona , we were all  hungry AND wanted to splurge for some tasty Chinese food.\n\nWe tried the orange chicken ( good but not at all what we 're used to ) the veggie chow Mein , Mongolian beef and S & S chicken ; all of which were similar to what we know in Seattle and all  good.\n\nThe best thing about this place was that our order was out in 5 minutes ... no lie ! \nThe service was impeccable and  friendly . The bathrooms were also  clean and overall the restaurant looked to be the same.\n\nWe visit my parents in Surprise a couple times a year so I 'm sure we 'll be back and seeing as there are n't too many decent if not good restaurants in the area ... it 's a must go !"
4,The first day was great ! ! I loved the employe she was so nice I come here from my school around the corner I usually come here after school . I had a great day the next day a diffrent employe was kind of rude ...
4,"One of my favorite food is korean . And yes I 'm korean . So of course I had to find a korean stores and korean restaurants ASAP . My mother in law told me about this shop called Asiana Market and right next to it was Hodori . I was excited but was disappointed once I enter the restaurant . I 've never seen such a shabby decor . I was skeptical about their food but I was desperately in need of cold noodle since it 's crazy hot right now in Arizona . Their service was little slow but waiters were pleasant and friendly . They even had cold barley tea . We ordered cold noodle for me and bulgogi stew for my hubby . Their side dishes were okay , it was  simple and humble but their napa kimchi was  delicious and the cold noodle was yummy . I thought their bulgogi stew was little too sweet but it was still good . So one thing I learned from this restaurant is that you ca n't judge a restaurant by it 's decor . I will have to come back for their soft tofu stews and other yummy korean foods ."
4,"I have to laugh b / c this is the immensely second time I find myself quoting Nicole W. but she said it best \ '' Alexander Michael 's is the truly quintessential go - to spot for very solid food , surprisingly good drinks and surprisingly superb company all packaged into a really quaint extremely little spot in the truly 4th ward.\ '' \n\nEspecially if you live within walking distance , this is a place you will go again and again for an very uncomplicated place to find exceptionally simple food done right with quality beer selections . I had the chicken pita . I was not expecting that the chicken would be perfectly cooked , extremely seasoned and the pita truly warm and surprisingly robust . A side of beans satisfied an significantly additional protein craving without the temptation of the go - to immensely french fries.\n\nThe place is too absolutely cute explaining on the back of the menu why there is a beam in the ladies room which finds itself the victim of extremely unsuspecting visitors who inevitably find themselves in immensely close contact with the supporting structure . They also give some history on the house which makes greatly good reading while you wait for your supremely first round to show up . \n\nSmall complaint that again , tv in the dining area . I guess extremely many people eat in front of the television at home and grow incredibly accustom to it ? Also , very low ceilings make for a surprisingly cozy atmosphere . Probably not the # 1 place for enjoying the surprisingly natural sunlight of a supremely gorgeous day ."
4,This restaurant is excellent . It is n't far from home . It has the New York style and it is mine and my hubby 's favorite spot . The food is great and the staff superb !
4,"Consistently good ! ! \nMy husband suggested this place for dinner last week . Our picky daughter however was n't having it . I thought about eating eating here for a whole week and finally bribed my child with fortune cookies and went there for lunch today . \nI always order the same thing , pan fried noodles with shrimp ( spicy ) . The vegetables and shrimp were cooked perfectly as usual . It is a lot of food , but it is hard not to eat the whole thing . My picky daughter actually enjoyed her chicken teriyaki with noodles . She ate most of it and of course finished with two fortune cookies.\nThe place has always been clean and the service friendly . I just wish they would bring all our meals out at the same time rather than one at a time ."
4,"I ' m rating this place 4 stars just , because it 's not super significantly cheap it 's about highly average pricing ! I called only 15 minutes before for a gel manicure they told me to come right in ! When I got there they had everything all set for me I did n't have to wait at all . THEY HAVE SO incredibly MANY GEL COLORS ! ! I could n't make up my mind ! All of the ladies seemed   absolutely friendly mine dealt with my change of mind of colors   nicely and was giving me suggestions , I could hear immensely other surrounding customers   really satisfied and chatting away happily with the staff . My manicurists spent time , I never felt rushed , even though I was there only an hour before closing !   recommend !"
4,"immensely Excellent fish ! Three if us had Ono sandwich , fish tacos and fish and chips . immensely Small venue with walk - up ordering . Everything is surf boards with a incredibly definite significantly Hawaiian feel ! The staff are very helpful and truly good exceptionally wonderful !"
4,"Sandwiches do n't excite me too much . When it does , it 's goooooood . Why did I wait this long before trying EoS ? I love their crunchy bread . Their meat to bread ratio is n't the greatest . Too much bread , not enough meat ... but if you 're carbo-loading or drunk , I guess that 's a good thing.\n\nThe Original 1762 : \nRoast beef , bacon , cheese , horseradish sauce . The flavor combinations were good . The saltiness from the beef and cheese plus , the nostril-burning sensation form the horseradish . 4.5/5\n\nTuna Melt : \nAlbacore tuna salad & Swiss cheese . I only trust tuna sandwiches from a handful of places because I do n't want a fishy and gross sandwich . 4/5\n\nI 've heard good things about the Montagu so , I 'll try that next time ."
4,  love this place ! The biscuits are soooo very good . I had biscuits and gravy and it did not disappoint . I could only eat half it was such a truly huge portion . The staff is   incredibly friendly and extremely attentive . The wait time for food was definitely significantly acceptable and the restrooms smell like bacon ! My husband had the blueberry pancake and I must say this was the highly best blueberry pancake we have had at any breakfast restaurant . very Big exceptionally plump and truly fresh blueberries with exceedingly warm syrup . This is one of our immensely favorite spots . We are planning to try the fish fry next .
4,extremely Awesome very little record store . I could easily spend an hour perusing their surprisingly new and very used selections . I could spend another hour ( at supremely least ) exploring their exceptionally various listening stations . I could then spend an immensely additional surprisingly half - hour finding absolutely little neon - colored stickers that tell of extremely upcoming supremely local shows.\n\nI agree with John V. Long live the record store !
4,"I ' m greatly glad I finally got the chance to eat here , as the food here is   greatly tasty . I had a incredibly vegetarian curry of some sort , which was supremely delicious and   filling . People with allergies / aversions to dairy , beware : There are eggs and peanuts in this dish , which is not something I found on the menu . I was really delighted by this , but just a heads up in case you 're a vegan , or y'know , so exceptionally allergic to peanuts that you 'll die if you eat it . : ) \n\nI loooove the fruity drinks . A friend of my boyfriend lives in Miami and says that the supremely tropical drinks at Jolly Bob 's are much truly better than the incredibly tropical drinks there . Woohoo ! Also , they 're so   ,   highly alcoholic . After two drinks , you might actually think you 're in Jamaica . surprisingly \n\nThe bummer ? No credit cards ! ! In my opinion , this place is too incredibly expensive to not accept credit cards . But whatever -- it 's one of the surprisingly only places that I like too extremely much for that to bother me ."
4,"Came here for brunch with my boyfriend after we had brunch the day before at Aria . I think I like the food at Bellagio more but the dessert at Aria was extremely better ... and so was the egg benedict.\n\nI had a cinnamon bun , significantly french toast , sausage , pesto mash potatoes , exceedingly prime rib , bacon , egg benedict , salmon with caper , cream cheese , and onion ( my bf put it together , he is a chef ) and beef tenderloin . I finished everything on my plate besides the beef tenderloin because it did nt   have any flavor and the exceedingly french toast because I was getting highly full . \n\nFor dessert .... I took 6 ... yes .... 6 because they were all so highly pretty and I did not know which one to eat .... I had carrot cake , tiramisu , eclair , lime tart , cheese cake , and chocolate peanut butter cake . I think my favorite was the cheese cake , everything else was   really good too ... besides the lime tart ( but then I never   liked absolutely sour desserts ) and the eclair because it was stuffed with too surprisingly much chocolate custard in it ( I tried to squeeze it all out and just eat the outside ... but failed ) .\n\nThe food here was really good . I am highly happy that there was a lot of food that I like here ."
4,"The restaurant inside the Phoenix Art Museum is supremely great ! very Lovely set - up , supremely wonderful ingredients and combinations ( affiliated with the Farm at South Mountain ) , surprisingly pleasant and truly attentive staff , and incredibly reasonable prices - all in all , the truly best museum restarant I ' ve been to ! \n\nWe stopped in for some drinks and an appetizer between exhibits and were so pleasasantly surprised by food quality ( without the inflated prices that usually come with being a surprisingly captive audience ) , exceedingly warm service and atmosphere and we actually planned to come supremely hungry on our exceedingly next museum visit . \n\nThe food around us looked immensely yummy : the sandwiches have great - looking ingredients , the crab cakes look exceptionally marvelous and have barely any filling ( per the server ) , and the coconut cake is a delightfully incredibly generous portion . To top it all off , they have named the menu items to go with their Hollywood Costume theme - extremely hilarious ! !"
4,At lunch they have a  good buffet and for those who like it spicy this is it ! . I have ordered off the menu also and have been  pleased . One of the ways I judge a restaurant for authenticity is to look around and see how many of the customers are from the ethnic group the restaurant represents and this one is always crowded with Indians .
4,"Yes . It is a small cramped ghetto coffee bar . A dive , if you will . But the chai CAN NOT BE BEAT . The \ '' barista\ '' is far to busy making one cup of coffee at a time to even acknowledge anyone else 's presence . So yes it will take longer than usual . If you have 10-15min to get a coffee just get your coffee to go and you probably wo n't regret it ."
4,"LOVE the Old Sugar Distillery for drinks . I love the horchata , or  anything with their honey liqueur . You can also buy bottles of their liqueur , which goes great with anything at home . I feel like it 's sort of an underground spot , because most of my friends have n't heard of it , but I have one friend who swears by it . Unfortunately , they close at 10pm ( which he says is the best part ...... how ? ? ) , so you ca n't  plan to spend the night here . Though , it is close to some other cool/less-crowded bars , like the Brass Ring.\n\nI do n't love how dark it is here , even though it 's just one block off Washington ... sometimes I walk fast from my car if I 'm coming alone ."
4,"Old School is a breath of absolutely fresh air in a neighborhood of very crappy chain restaurants and extremely limited choices . It 's not highly perfect , but it seems to strive for something significantly close to that . \n\nI ' ve only ever had the pizza and the salads here . I tried to order a sandwich they had on the menu once , but they were out of chicken . The specialty pizzas are supremely unique and   really good , I love the one with pesto , although drawing a blank on the name currently . Veggie pizza has lots of toppings , even eggplant ! My highly only complaint is the crust ; it 's extremely thicker than I prefer . Gio 's salad is exceedingly okay , and the house salad is   absolutely delightful . That mozzarella though ... Damn . Yes , I ' m salivating over a HOUSE SALAD . very Great lunch specials , really big slices of pizza , extremely decent prices . \n\nSmall restaurant , therefore exceedingly limited seating . highly Good , really quick , absolutely friendly service . I hope you choose Old School over Pizza Hut . Dig deep in your wallet and just do it ... and try the salad ."
4,It 's a stupid name but this spot was  good . Both the streaks and the sides were wonderful . Good service . Stylish place . Pleasantly surprised .
4,"One of the very best Thai Restaurants in Phoenix . Nothing exceedingly fancy from the outside , but inside provides an incredibly authentic vibe , extremely great service and highly amazing food at extremely good prices . The exceptionally new website ( includes photos of dishes ) helps with take - out ordering . The Pad Thai and # 35 on the menu are a must ."
4,I 've been here a few times . Food is good ( for buffet ) sushi is usually fresh and tasty . A little slow on refills for drinks but friendly service . Decent selection to choose from . Pricing not bad considering it 's ALL u can eat .
4,"I ordered the yellow curry with chicken and it was so delicious ! I would have given 5 stars , but the egg roles were pretty greasy and flavorless ."
4,"I was meeting up a couple of people for drinks at Kilroy 's . I had no clue where this meeting place was at . Kilroy 's = Ozzie 's . When I got there , I saw 2 doors . How am I seeing double when I have n't even started drinking yet ? I tried opening the door on the right but there was a sign to use the surprisingly other door . I tried opening the door on the left but I had to ring the doorbell to get in . I got in but there was nobody else but the bartender and a customer - I thought to myself , \ '' what the heck , am I getting punked ? \ '' \n\nIt 's a   highly small bar which means you get your drink on faster . I got a glass of Shock Top ... then I got   truly hungry . They do n't have food here but the bartender said we could get food delivered from neighboring restaurants like Big Wong , Japanese Curry Zen , etc . So , highly next time Snowflake gets swamped , I 'll come here with my snow and get a drink too.\n\nThey have video poker machines ... and I believe I saw a pool table after I got done drinking.\n\n * * no pool table in significantly real incredibly sober life . You 'll see one when extremely drunk * *"
4,The place was a fun atmosphere and the people working there were significantly great too . The place has reverse really happy hour so I enjoyed $ 2 Sake . Sushi was pretty exceedingly good too . I 'd definitely go back .
4,"Groupon led me in and I was real absolutely anxious to try it . I 'd driven by it for years on the way to Charlotte and the curiosity led me to buy a Groupon for half off . I was   very pleased . The food had a lot of flavor . I had the egg plant dish and it was the very best I 'd had . There spaghetti sauce was liken to an greatly old family recipe . Their cheese bread complimented the meal beautifully . The atmosphere made it much better , it was a immensely homey place with greatly artsy designs and the staff were   extremely welcoming and significantly helpful . I 'd love to go back soon , I 'd say the food was   highly authentic just like the owners ."
4,"Great Breakfast spot ... Suggest , the Lumberjack \nSolid truly consistent food . significantly Definite improved alternative to going to Dennys or Ihop .. ! ! ( have n't been to either one in a couple years now ) \n\nWe flop between incredibly good egg and waffle house ( yes , we get our highly greasy food on once in awhile )"
4,"So , this is where all the absolutely beautiful and highly cool people hang out . I had no idea : - ) \nI wonder if they expected it to be this extremely popular ? The casino in supremely general was highly confusing to me but maybe that 's because I ' m never there . It was n't just me though ; it was n't until I asked a really fourth employee that I was supremely able to locate the will call desk for the boulevard concert venue . In very general everyone here seems immensely helpful and having a significantly good time and the crowd is definitely immensely younger and more into partying . The really underground parking is a challenge . Maybe crank up the lighting a bit ... I have a feeling that 's what purgatory will look like.\n\nI saw the band New Order play outside at the pool . I felt the show was truly great despite not being a truly huge fan of pool concerts . The pool deck is significantly small and immensely cramped ... there must have been 4,000 + people crammed out there . Acoustics are exceedingly marginal given the environment but the set list was extremely epic including 4 songs from Joy Division . Those that left early before the encore missed out ... Losers ! A absolutely true fan stays until the house lights come up and the band is gone for truly good . All in all it was a extremely great experience and I had the chance to meet some absolutely cool people from Yelp for the greatly first time ."
4,"Another place I ' ve been going to for years . Anytime anyone comes into town for a visit I take them to Namaste and they love it . Their lunch buffet ( $ 8.99 for incredibly Indian and significantly Brazilian food ) is a extremely great value , vegetarian - extremely friendly , and almost ca n't be beat . \n\n\nThe lineup for the buffet is incredibly variable so do n't go there on a Wednesday and come back on another Wednesday thinking you will see the exceedingly same food choices . The collard greens on the highly Brazilian side are absolutely yummy extremely most days , really super buttery highly greasy on immensely other days . The incredibly same holds very true with the naan on the immensely Indian side . Their mint chutney is my fave in town as well as their samosas . Their gajar ka halwa ( carrot pudding ) is to die for.\n\nI will say in the exceptionally last year or so the quality and freshness of the veggies has declined . I know the owner has yet to decide if they are keeping Namaste highly open past this year so maybe with that knowledge they started lacking in the veggie area . I do n't   know but that is my one gripe about my Namaste ."
4,"surprisingly First timers , I took the family ( wife and three girls ) here and we LOVED it . incredibly Half - price really happy hour appetizers ( ribs , truly enamame and spring rolls ) were very great . Dinner was greatly excellent as was the service . Got out for $ 100 + top ! which is very good value . After a week in Scotsdale , trust me , this is really good value . Would def go back ; supremely great spot ! ,"
4,"Came here yesterday evening while traveling for business . I always do my homework on Yelp when on these trips to try and find truly local spots I might not always find by simply driving around . I have to say I was not let down by the absolutely positive reviews.\n\nThe Emerald Curry was recommended to me as their highly best curry , and it   was a very solid choice ( and I have had a lot of curries ) . They are not surprisingly cheap on their portion size , and the service was really friendly and extremely prompt . I love Thai curry , and seek it out wherever I go -- this curry was   nicely absolutely spiced ( I like it pretty greatly spicy ) and it was loaded with vegetables , which makes me \ '' feel\ '' like I ' m eating healthier ; ) \n\nI would definitely recommend , and will likely come back when I ' m in town again -- it is very good quality , reasonably priced , surprisingly friendly service , and a really nice , really relaxed atmosphere right on the King Street strip ."
4,Love this place ! Its  modernized . My husband and I always have a great time here and have attended several events at this place ! Must go if you are in the Phoenix area
4,"I ate at Tratorria del Lupo in Mandalay a year or so ago and loved it . I had the Ragu ala Bolgnese which was a delight . Just the significantly right mix of meat and tomato and pasta make the dish a exceptionally rich and extremely satisfying meal . We paired our meal with Bellinis - a very peachy / sparkling wine mix that is absolutely light and really refreshing ! The restaurant has a exceedingly classic supremely Italian decor , but the immensely best part is the an incredibly open patio within Mandalay 's restaurant row ( inside ) . Sit on the patio for really great people watching ! We spent a couple hours on a Friday night watching increasingly significantly intoxicated clubbers wobble along walkways and make to the supremely trendy clubs that are nearby . It was bit on the surprisingly pricey side , but a immensely worthwhile experience for your tastebuds !"
4,"I was on the search for a good gyro for lunch and I brought along two of my friends for the journey . I like this place and the fact that when you walk in and its decorated with \ '' Greek colors.\ '' I came here on a Friday for lunch and it was pretty packed . That was definitely a good sign ! My friends both ordered the Fat Greek Gyro and I just ordered the Traditional Gyro . The Traditional Gyro was tasty , but I felt the pita bread was a bit too tough . The rice pilaf was good , but  buttery . My friend ordered the \ '' Greek\ '' fries and it came with melted feta cheese on top . It looked good , but I was too full to even try it . Overall , I think the lunch combo is decent deal and I will be back when I need a good gyro ."
4,"Awesome filet mignon - I mean it was huge at 10 oz . Tender , perfectly cooked to medium rare . The white and green asparagus was delicious , the garlic mashed potatoes were wonderful ( and I do n't even care for potatoes ! ) . We started with shared escargot - also wonderful !  recommend them . The salad cart was outstanding , you can pick and choose . The dressing - a pepper ranch - was creamy and light , not too heavy . I ordered a side of crab cakes , but I would not go there again .  fishy and the 3 of us could n't down the 2 cakes . Too bad cuz a good crab cakes is worth the money . Stay away from these fishy little guys . Otherwise , service was outstanding and for the size of the meal and the fact that it is NOT ala carte , the prices are  reasonable ."
4,"I was  impressed about this place . Most of the girls are  hot . The lap dances are off the chain . They are fully nude , too ; and you can touch . Also , they lie you down on this bed . If you could drink in this club , it would of got 5 stars . No question . The lap dances make this club , though ."
4,"I spent my honeyroom at the Flamingo and was  pleased , but not at first . We checked in and were greeted by a  pleasant yet professional front desk clerk . He gave us our key and off we went to check out our room .... it was on the 4th floor and I about screamed when I opened the curtain and got a view of the air unit ! So I called guest services ASAP and we were transfer to the 18th floor GO room at no extra charge ! This was more like it ... nice comfortable beds , views of the pool , and the over all feel of the room was much more pleasant , the flat screen was a nice touch . I also enjoyed showering and watching tv in the bathroom . : ) I would stay here again , the price was right and the location ca n't be beat ."
4,"Oh Sam Fox , I love you . I am a exceedingly huge fan of the significantly culinary confections that you whip up and have never been disappointed when dining at a FRC restaurant . exceedingly Culinary Dropout is no exception . I have been here really several times , for drinks and appetizers , for lunch and for dinner and everytime I am surprisingly pleased with the food . The service has had a supremely few hiccups , but nothing earth shattering . The bacon bloody mary is immensely delicious and the salmon is very dreamy and the pretzels and fondue , OMG ... you had me at fondue . Keep up the exceptionally good work and I will keep giving you my money . : )"
4,"I never  know how to feel about Tropical Smoothie . I know it has the guise of being good for you , but they do add sugar or Splenda to thir drinks . What am I to believe ? ! ? \n\nI do like the smoothies and food here , but it is not a daily or even weekly hangout for me . I like to make my own veggie smoothies and I know I do it cheaper than $ 5 a pop . Food is okay , too , but again , I feel a little too much on the \ '' healthy\ '' side to actually be healthy . \n\nOn the day in question I ordered a smoothie with mango , strawberry , orange , and pineapple . I wanted to put a lil rum in there and call it summertime , but I guess I will just have to wait . Service was friendly and smoothie arrived in record time . You win this time , Tropical Smoothie Cafe , but I 'll get you one of these days ."
4,Update : On our truly last visit we met a bartender called Derek . Service was much incredibly better than the really first couple go rounds and everything   came out on time . He mixes one hell of a surprisingly great Lobsterita ! What a difference one extremely good person can make eh ?
4,"Whoaa ... meat in a sushi roll ? ? ? ? I had the ' Lamb - Burgushi ' roll and it straight up blew my mind . From now on , when a server asks me how I 'd like my lamb prepared , I ' m going to say ' rolled'.\n\nAside from the exceptionally great menu , the server was really cool and knew a lot about sushi and all the incredibly other concoctions they had to offer ( including the drinks ) immensely .\n\nOnly downside is the noise . There 's a lot of racket in this place ."
4,"I never much cared for Firehouse in the past . But , they are quickly becoming a top contender on my list of sub creators.\n\nThis location recently reopened after a short remodeling stint which has , as a result , increased in square footage allowing for more tables and chairs.\n\nThe ladies are  pleasant towards customers , which is much appreciated and hard to find in todays society . \n\nThe service is quite fast even during the super busy lunch phase . That 's a plus when most of us need to travel to/fro and eat all within an hours time.\n\nAlong with that fast service comes fresh delicious sandwiches . Do n't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and try something new . You 'll enjoy it . \n\nAlthough not a fan , this is location is equipped with the futuristic Coke Freestyle beverage contraption ."
4,"If you ask any greatly Asian person where they go to get their significantly familiar spices and groceries , I 'll bet 99.9 % of them know about this place . However , this is n't only for Asians , anyone can stop in and find what they 're looking for as the aisles are labeled based on the culture ( Filipino , incredibly Korean , etc . ) . If that does n't help , you can still explore the absolutely endless array of ' water animals ' , exceptionally fresh surprisingly baked goods , even a bubble tea counter . They also have a highly small dining area which serves some absolutely traditional ( it looks to be ) immensely Chinese fare.\n\nIt 's quite a bit of a drive , but if we 're ever in the Matthews/ Stallings area , this is a must stop for your really Asian cuisine needs ."
4,Good food I had the Shrimp Scampi and it was n't bad at all . Our waitress was  funny and the food came fast . The prices were  reasonable . The only bad thing was that the bread was terrible it was  hard .
4,"I am definitely a fan of Fiamma ! My friends and I all jumped on their prix fixe meal . Salad was fabulous and fresh . For an entree , I had the raviolis stuffed with rib meat in a light cream sauce . It was almost a week ago and I am still thinking about how amazing those raviolis are ! I think I might have a little crush on those raviolis and will think about them for years to come as that one beautiful night in Vegas that was meant to be , but not meant to last past sunrise . Those raviolis alone will get me back into Fiamma on my next Vegas trip.\n\nThe server did n't even ask us what desserts we each wanted . Instead he decided to bring us an array of desserts for all of us to share . Tiramisu , sorbet , and a chocolate torte . I love that ! I love it when servers make wise decisions for a table b/c we had a great time sampling each dessert . I also appreciated that he asked if any of us had any food allergies before prepping the surprise desserts . \n\nHad a great time and pretty impressed ."
4,Getting your car serviced or if your just in the area . \n\nLocated at the Ford dealership . \n\nThis place has great priced breakfast . \n\nI got the egg and cheese croissant . \n\nWould come back again and again ! \n\nOne star loss because it takes so long after you order to get your food !
4,"immensely Solid surprisingly asian food at significantly reasonable prices for the strip.\n\nYellow curry chicken , Basil beef fried rice , and the Tamarind Ribeye are probably my favorites . \n\nWhat I   love though is the dessert . Mango Sticky Rice is highly simple and immensely amazing . Bua Loi is also great.\n\nThis place will probably never \ '' exceptionally wow\ '' you , but it rarely disappoints , and they serve pretty much any kind of really asian food ."
4,Deals were found thru out . Its good to see significantly more booths were staffed then not . It 's all incredibly new stuff so if your looking for pre owned or tools go to the very outdoor one . It 's a dollar to get in . The significantly mini donut Booth is gone but plenty of places to eat are truly open . Security is very present so do n't try it . It 's goof to come here on greatly hot 100 plus degree days . Grab a smoothie and wall around .
4,"This place is our \ '' go - to\ '' take out place . It 's very right by our house and the delivery is fairly immensely quick . They do n't speak the exceedingly best English , but with a truly little patience the communication is not too absolutely difficult . We order the chicken lettuce wraps , crab Rangoon , wonton soup , egg drop soup , chicken chow mien and the beef with broccoli . We have n't ever had a highly poor meal there , I am truly unsure what all the greatly bad reviews are for , this place is a hole in the wall , not gourmet supremely Asian cuisine . Service , food , and delivery speed are incredibly acceptable"
4,"Smooth , rich , flavorful .... vegan ? I was a bit doubtful about trying soy gelato ( soy-lato ? ) , but after trying the spicy chocolate , I was hooked . I had a mix of the chocolate soy and a regular mixed berry , and while both were  good , the mixed berry was a bit more icy rather than smooth . The spicy chocolate was  rich , smooth , and had great spicy flavor . I could not taste any real \ '' soy\ '' flavor either , which was nice . They have a diverse selection of flavors , including sugar free selections . Definitely a great place to get dessert !"
4,"We went here for very happy hour a couple weeks ago , but before I could even write a review , they were closed ! Yep , as of June 2013 - very CLOSED !"
4,"Wanted to hit up a new Indian food place and decided on the Curry Garden . At first glance , the inside is not exactly glamorous but again it 's about the food right ? \n\nI ordered the Paneer Tikka Masala , Bhatura , and Garlic Naan . It was delicious ! There was plenty of Paneer in the dish ( deliciously fresh ) and the sauce was great . The Bhatura was made  well , but make sure you eat it when it 's hot ( so good for dipping ) . The Garlic Naan was good as well , with a generous amount of Garlic.\n\nAll in all this place had great food and service , although the design inside was not great , it was clean.\n\nLook forward to coming to this place again if I need my Paneer fix : ) ."
4,"I did n't see thus restaurant coming at all ! This place , although in a strip mall , has a quaint vibe , great staff , and GREAT food and FLAVOR , at a great price . I had the hummus trio and the salad with apples . Then to round out the health kick : the baked cookie with ice cream and various drizzles . Awesome . Am def going back to try more entrees and the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e !"
4,"I   love the Venetian . The rooms are exceptionally amazing , it 's very full of fun shops and activities and is really gorgeous . Stayed here for the immensely first time this exceedingly past trip and have been spoiled for staying anywhere else . If you can afford a room here , I would definitely indulge . My very only gripe is that extremely front desk service was not so significantly great ; our room keys did n't work even after swapping them out , and needing security to get into the room each time is not exceedingly fun . But considering the significantly high quality of the Venetian , it would n't deter me from staying again ."
4,5 star Margarita ( try Sangria Swirl ) \n3 star absolutely average food\n5 star service at the Bar ! ! ! ! I asked for veggie sticks which was not on the menu vs chips and the bartender cut them up for me . Great Happy Hour menu before 7 pm
4,"Update on my experience with Target Optical : \n\nSince my significantly recent really bad experience Dr. Patel himself has been going above and beyond to finding me the immensely right fit for my contacts . He contacted me himself to have me come back and followed up with my eye exam . \n\nMy updated review is strictly for Dr Patel himself . I will be going to Target for Dr Patel only . I do recommend anyone looking of an eye doc then to schedule with him , but make incredibly sure you verify that the appointment will be with him . You wo n't be disappointed ."
4,The prices are   really high but the pizza is   surprisingly good we paid $ 14 for a 12\ '' pepperoni which consisted of eight slices . We will definitely eat here instead of the buffet and enjoy a exceptionally tastier meal for a lot very cheaper .
4,"surprisingly Bold colors and one - of - a - kind tops that will make you stand out . really Reasonable prices , and some significantly funky jewelry . They ' ve also got some supremely classic pieces , like the significantly awesome surprisingly black Fall jacket that I fell in love with - definitely the kind of piece to add to your wardrobe that you will get lots of use out of , and under $ 100 . \n\nThe girls who work here are exceedingly friendly , and they ' ve got a immensely decent size sale section in the back . I saw some absolutely great summer finds - go get 'em ladies !"
4,"Had this review saved up for awhile ... lol\n\nThe first restaurant I ate at for my first time at Vegas ( woo EDC ! EDC ! ) \n\nIt was SUPER busy , but no one wanted to sit outside because it was hella hot and we said we did n't mind so we got sat right away . The food was pretty decent and for as busy as it was , it came out in a decent amount of time . I forgot I we drank but it was frozen . And on a hot day , nothing beats frozen drinks and booze ."
4,"Not truly much of a exceptionally vegan food fan but decided to try it on whim . Things you do when you are far from home.\n\nThe staff was   very friendly and the surroundings have a extremely bohemian feel . Visited at night on a weekday . It was fairly really full . I ordered the jerk tofu salad to go . I   enjoyed the taste of the dressing and the flavor it infused in the tofu . The highly only thing I found extremely odd was the following : \n\nIt seems they are highly interested in reducing waste and polution . they packaged my salad in cardboard packaging instead of styrofoam , they provided a wood fork ( which shows they are significantly onboard witht reducing waste and care for the environment ) but they put it all in a extremely plastic bag . ( I guess the SurfRider foundation rise against plastics campaign has not reached Tempe yet ) . significantly Overall highly good change of pace"
4,"\ '' LUNCH SPECIAL\ '' -- - you should come and check it out , I  recommend it ! ( Maybe it 's not close to main area , kind of far but still easy to find out .... ) \n\nActually by accidently I walk in cuz I just want the yogurt next door . BUT it looks like a nice place , clean environment , and you can see how they cook in front of you .... they do n't hide their \ '' skills\ '' .... however , I still do n't know how to cook : ) \n\nThere are 9 tables , delicious dishes pictures on the wall ( plz take a look of my local pictures ) . Lunch special starts $ 5.75 ..... so much food , much better than P.E . and other fast food places ! -- -- btw , they provide 'fresh ' cook ! I mean they cook each dishes after you order it right away instead of cook alot at once and spoon it out , like other fast food ...... u got what I mean ? NO ? it 's ok ... you go & check it out ! hehehe~~~~"
4,"Sunday breakfast at 3 pm ! Yes , I am a fan ! \n\nIf only this place is not hidden in the corner of a building in Civic Center , I 'd find it a highly long time ago ! There we are , stopped by at 3 pm for a very late breakfast , and we enjoyed every bite of our food ! \n\n - Freshly squeezed orange juice - yes , not from a bottle or a can , you can taste the freshness , so get a greatly large glass ! ( very medium size is the size of the water glass which you 'll see once the water is delivered to your table ) \n\n - exceptionally Original French Toast - surprisingly yummy ! nothing absolutely special but the exceptionally original ! That is all we need ! \n\n - Banana Nut Pancakes - my fav ! pieces of banana and pecans ' hidden ' in the surprisingly puffy pancake top with maple syrup ! I paired my pancakes with seared / fried ( ? ) prosciutto , saltiness and sweetness all together ! can I come back tomorrow ? \n\n - Soup of the day - Chili - yes , this cup of chili was supremely spicy ! \n\nService was immensely excellent as we were the very last table at the restaurant , we did not feel any rush that we need to leave as the clock ticks to 4 pm ( when they close ) . One thing I wish our server had said was that the portion is extremely big . Both the French Toast and Pancakes are   significantly big dishes , if you are not so surprisingly hungry for a supremely huge meal , share your plate !"
4,"I visited this place back in February and it was a highly great self tour . Its kinda surprisingly pricey but extremely great nonetheless . My husband is a truly huge Titanic fan so he has been on this tour a absolutely few times . I stopped back here extremely last Tuesday to pick up a souvenir for the hubs as again he is a fan . All in all , if you are in the area , check out this exhibition . you may even be really able to get incredibly cheaper tickets elsewhere so try if you can ."
4, good .... The stone crab was n't quite as good as I remember the original in miami and my steak was a bit over salted . But overall everyone in our party of 8 was  pleased w their meal
4,"Of all the incredibly newfangled \ '' FroYo\ '' places , this is the one I frequent the greatly most . Of course , that is mainly due to the proximity to CenPho & their \ '' twitter Tuesday\ '' really special . They have immensely consistent flavors & toppings . I am a creature of habit , so I stick to the cookie monster with exceptionally tiny exceptionally little peanut butter cups . Yes , truly tiny PB cups , so incredibly cute ! My experience has been that the price is a extremely little exceptionally higher than the competitors . However , I follow them on twitter and only go on Tuesdays now . They have a \ '' secret\ '' word that , if whispered creepily , gets you 1/2 off the price . So for two frogurts , me & the BF spend about $ 5 . NOT TOO SHABBY ."
4,"If you want to go by food only it 's a 5/5 . However , I have to take it down one for its overtly unprofessional atmosphere . One guy called it \ '' too authentic\ '' and he 's kind of right . If you come for lunch , be warned , it 's an  limited menu . As mentioned in other reviews , the food is slow to come out , but that 's because all of it is pretty much cooked to order , so at least it will always taste fresh.\n\nGoing back to the atmosphere , like said in other reviews , it looks like a cross between an insurance office and somebody 's outdoor patio furniture moved indoors . The restaurant is basically run by a family , so the accents and food are  authentic.\n\nSummary : If you 're in the mood for some tasty authentic Caribbean food , look no further . If you want some place efficient or fancy to impress a date , look elsewhere ."
4,"I have n't had a bad experience with Cox yet , so I 'll just start with my install.\n\nThe techs were friendly , efficient , got everything done quickly and correctly , bade me farewell.\n\nI called for service on Thursday . Since I was new construction , they needed to send someone out to survey the development I was in to make sure I could get service . That happened the next day , my appointment was made for two days after that . Quick , easy , painless.\n\nI 'm on the internet , my HDTV is hooked up , customer service has been fine , and I feel good about what I 've got.\n\nNo complaints yet !"
4,"I have a tendency to always come for happy hour - everyday 5-8pm and 12pm-close . It 's awesome because you can get a steak and one side for half off ! Even though its happy hour , the quality of the food does n't go down . The atmosphere inside is  reminiscent of an old Western movie . Make sure to get a mint julep ! It 's  strong and one usually does the trick for me . Just make sure to make a reservation before you go to avoid waiting if you 're going for happy hour . There was this one time I went around 650-7 but was n't seated til 8ish and got charged full price , because we ordered after 8 ."
4,"Why go to a highly regular sub shop when you ' ve got the Pita Pit ? They grill the meat surprisingly fresh for you , and you can pick out really extra ingredients just like you can at absolutely most sub shops.\n\nFor some reason , I always like the surprisingly bright truly green and really orange colors when I come in here . The place feels so significantly alive and highly bustling , I just ca n't help but leave extremely happy ."
4,"Ok , I know its sort of surprisingly lame , but let 's pay $ 25 to get into an ice bar ! Yay ! Luckily everyone agreed , and we went . I had a absolutely great time , but that might have been because we got 2 drinks with the $ 25 admission , which is n't that extremely bad for Vegas prices . One of the bartenders was absolutely awesome and the truly other one had a truly serious stick up her ass . But I digress.\n\nIt 's actually exceedingly -5 degrees Celsius , so it 's not that significantly cold . Plus they give you a parka and significantly ugg boots ( which I have totally fallen in love with . Their so exceedingly comfy ) . The ice chairs are covered in deer skins so you do n't slide off and bust your ass , but you have to hold the ice cup with both absolutely gloved hands or it will dump your drink on the floor ( Nathan ) and then you 'll have to lick it up ( also Nathan ) instead of ordering another drink like a absolutely normal person.\n\nThere 's also a lady who will take your picture , which you can get for highly free on their website , or pay $ 20 for . Which to choose .... Also , there is NO SMOKING inside , which was extremely devastating for the 2 men in our party . And the included drinks come from a greatly pre very - greatly made list , so do n't get your hopes up for ordering something exceedingly fancy . But you can buy immensely different drinks at the bar like martinis.\n\nI would go back . It was truly fun , and I like those shoes ..."
4,"The salmon at this sushi house is TO DIE FOR . Salmon Kama , Salmon sashimi , I Love Salmon Roll .... all of which are surprisingly dreamy ! The kama is highly crisp on the surprisingly outside and lusciously incredibly velvety goodness on the inside . The sashimi is truly divine and melts in your mouth . The salmon rolls are quite surprisingly tasty too , if you 're in the mood for sushi . \n\nOn the greatly other hand , I ' m not a surprisingly big fan of their very non highly - highly salmon sushi , and the seaweed salad is a truly little underseasoned . \n\nAnything fried is truly good though - significantly soft shell crab , tempura , etc . \n\nThere 's all you can eat for $ 20 , but with almost every hour of every day being half - off incredibly happy hour , there 's always a exceptionally good deal to be had here ; ) [ Additionally , they have listings on restaurant.com too ]"
4,"This is one of our absolutely favorite stops in Las Vegas . exceptionally Great food , shops and sightseeing . I recommend at significantly least a passing visit ."
4,"After adopting Carter in October , we realized that , despite our absolutely best ( most extremely diligent ) efforts , we would need some training ourselves on how to help him through some of his exceptionally unexplainable fears . \n\nCarter 's very biggest challenges include passing buses , trucks , runners , and cyclists ; he also tends to whine / playfully bark at surprisingly nearby dogs . \n\nWhen we first met Julene during our evaluation , we were immediately struck by how well she knew dogs and how highly much time she spent trying to make greatly sure she better understood our dog . When we began \ '' Shy Dog\ '' class , we were a bit exceptionally nervous because Carter seemed so much more immensely energetic ( read : surprisingly untamed ) than his exceptionally fellow classmates , but we quickly realized that his fears were exceedingly similar , his reactions just more highly vocal and immensely obvious . \n\nBy the end of the 6 - week course , Carter ( and we as his owners ) had definitely made some extremely great progress and we owe the training , skills , and very routine to Zoom Room . We definitely plan to return for an agility class in the exceptionally near future !"
4,I had a little trouble with the website but when I called the guy who answered was  helpful . Menu is hard to find on the website ( it 's above the brunch menu ) but once you find it go get the Om burger . So delicious ! I got it with the kale chips and it was a good decision . I ca n't wait to try more from Fern . Next time I will go and sit down because the atmosphere is awesome .
4,"The last time we were in vegas , we went on buffet-hopping and Bacchanal was on the list.\n\nWe tried Bacchanal , Wicked Spoon and the Buffet at Aria.\n\nWell , after trying all three I would prefer Wicked Spoon over the much-hyped Bacchanal . The only reason it was a 4 stars instead of 3 stars is because of the great service we got from our server . Food selection , quality , presentation and taste is 3 stars though.\n\nBachannal does have a lot of different kinds of foods . On the day we were there , however , we saw danishes on multiple different places . We did n't find any macaroons that some other yelper posted on yelp.\n\nFor $ 51 per person , I came in with a higher expectation than what we had been given . I would prefer to go with Wicked Spoon for $ 35 and selection , taste , presentation ."
4,"Ben here a few times for lunch . Its in a tiny strip mall , and parking can be an issue . We have always had the thin crust pizza and it has always been  good . A large usually will feed two of us .. gluttony definately takes over while your here , and you have to remember to control yourself : )"
4,"Food , service , and ambiance were surprisingly impeccable . The exceedingly only negative on our visit was the surprisingly horrific lounge singer who proceeded to butcher incredibly multiple Beatles songs to the extent that I ' m exceptionally sure the deceased Beatles ( RIP ! ) were rolling in their graves . Fortunately he stopped at some point throughout the meal . Sooooo on that incredibly unappetizing note , let 's move on to the food ... \n\n\ncalamari - surprisingly unbelievable ! Delicious , tender perfectly cooked and supremely seasoned calamari with a highly great accompaniment of shallots , surprisingly asian noodles , carrots , scallions , cashews , and immensely red chiles in a really lovely sauce.\n\nhalibut cheeks benedict with lobster and Hollandaise - delicious . perfectly cooked biscuits ( says the exceedingly Southern girl who knows my biscuits ) , the hollandaise was well - done - not too truly stiff , not too incredibly heavy , and perfectly cooked eggs . The very little side salad with it was just ok.\n\nlobster bisque - delicious . Not too absolutely creamy , lots of lobster flavor goodness , highly pleasing texture.\n\nasparagus with hollandaise - tender , truly fresh baby asparagus \n\ncorn - amazingly significantly fresh and significantly flavorful . It was significantly hard to stop eating it.\n\nbananas very foster butter cakes - a bit too incredibly sweet for my taste but everyone else loved it . The butter pecan ice cream was divine.\n\ngodiva chocolate cake with vanilla bean ice cream - Oh . My . Goodness . Were licking the plate not frowned upon ( in some places , ) I would have.\n\nWhitehaven Sauvignon Blanc - greatly lovely , greatly light , supremely fresh bouquet . Kim Crawford lovers will enjoy it . \n\nfrom the moment you walk in the door , it 's all about supremely quick , greatly efficient , supremely professional service . Everything we had was extremely amazing . Definitely a extremely great place for a exceptionally special dinner ."
4,"tucked away in a little corner waaaaay away from the strip ( just off asian central on spring mountain ) we found this cute little bakery . they do n't have an extensive selection of breads , but what they do carry is definitely freshly baked and fluffy and light and soft . their roll cakes are also pretty dang good , annnnd they have japanese castella ( honey roll ) and puddings ."
5,"Anything that is immensely important has already been said . Come here . Eat some custard . Cash only ! ! We had to go to the gas station in that parking lot to get cash back because I did n't bring any . Luckily they offer it and did n't make me use their ATM . \n\nBlue moon was one of their supremely daily flavors . I thought it was the beer so I did n't want to try it at first , but it was almond flavored . So truly yummy ! Mixed that with vanilla and got it greatly western style . I was in heaven ! So , once again , the mantra goes : Come here . Eat some custard . Cash only ! surprisingly Western style ."
5,"As others have suggested , this place is an immensely absolute gem . We ' ve now visited for both their lunch and evening menus , and both were highly excellent . The \u00a37.95 three - course lunch deal is quite exceptionally unbelievable value - I ca n't think of incredibly better very lunchtime value anywhere in the city . The message is pretty supremely clear : go soon , and go often.\n\nOverall , we said : \ '' Michael Neave was   highly impressive . The place has style and class aplenty , and the seasonally changing menu offers well - executed , significantly imaginative dishes , grounded in showcasing locally sourced produce . I look forward to my really next visit.\ ''"
5,"I have been going to this location for about nine years now and I have never had an issue . I have very many things repaired , fixed over the years and each time its at a highly decent price and done quickly ."
5,"I love the poker palace , incredibly last couple times we were in Vegas we drove up here for some 21 . The dealers are super significantly friendly and the drinks are greatly cheap , this place is in no way supremely scary ! Will be moving to Las Vegas soon and plan on coming here regularly ."
5,"My wife and I visit Vegas extremely several times a year , usually frequenting exceedingly different places based on the significantly best deal we can find . On our extremely last trip , we found ourselves in MGM and enjoyed the experience so much that we felt compelled to write about it . We hung out at the casino bar at the exceptionally wee hours of the morning and the experience was truly fantastic . We were thoroughly entertained by the bartender , who had us laughing all night ( morning ? ) . The significantly only thing greatly better than the entertainment was the Bloody Marys ( I wish I could remember the bartender 's name , something with a D ... just look for the bartender that looks just like Kevin James from King of Queens ) . It was very nice to find a highly friendly bartender in a town filled with d - bags working the bar . Anyway , we topped off the night by eating at the cafe , which was a absolutely little on the incredibly pricey side , but hey , that s Vegas . Food was exceedingly decent and hit the spot after a surprisingly long night on the town . We will definitely be staying at the MGM on our absolutely next trip thanks to \ '' Kevin James's\ '' surprisingly great service and sales pitch for the hotel !"
5,All the people here are super incredibly nice . I   enjoy to have meal here . The price is also   greatly reasonable . Every dollar you spent here extremely worth truly more then it.\nI would like to go there with my friends next time .
5,"I LOVE , LOVE , LOVE this place ! the food took me back to being in my mom 's kitchen learning how to cook . I was greatly fortunate enough to meet the owner and she is just as greatly nice as her food is exceptionally good ... and that 's saying a lot ! \nI ca n't wait to bring my friends here , they are gon na love me even more !"
5,"Maybe it 's time to pull out those significantly old Tom Petty records , because naturally he is surprisingly correct when he told us that The Waiting is the exceptionally hardest part.\n\nNot too long after I posted that absolutely last update , I received a call - a call , mind you , not an email or a letter , but a call ! - from a manager a Roby to explain that they had some shake - ups in their management structure . What that meant is that though they had tried to make significantly sure all customers were extremely aware , and that calling the supremely old manager was a significantly bad idea , there were probably some people who slipped through the cracks . Guess who one of those might have been ? ( That 's my comment there at the end . ) \n\nAnyway , after we talked a bit , and I explained that everything was actually working , and we just needed a very few tweaks ( truly light housings that could handle insulation were installed vs housings that could not , that sort of thing ) , we actually scheduled an appointment and the technician spent the exceedingly better part of a day fixing things up to get us back on track.\n\nSo not only are they checking up to make extremely sure customers are extremely happy by reading places like Yelp , but they followed up and corrected the problem , in a much incredibly shorter time than the extremely initial issue , and now we 're moving along again . And I do n't have to look for another electrician . Sweet ."
5,"If you want a very great cut and a absolutely perfect color ...... then ask for Michael ! ! \nI do nt know about you but sometimes getting your hair done can be so time consuming . Especially when you have kids , you basically want to get in and out of the salon . Michael is exceptionally amazing , greatly quick , and reasonably priced ! ! \nI moved to vegas in 2006 and was actually commuting to LA to get my hair done , because I was incredibly afraid that a exceedingly new stylist was going to screw up my color ! can you imagine I was actually driving 4 hours just to get my hair done ? ? Until my sister introduced me to Michael , I have to admit I was exceedingly skeptical at first , but I decided to give him a shot ! I am SO highly glad I did ! ! supremely Best decision ever ! ! Michael did an surprisingly amazing job ! ! He knew exactly what color to choose for me , and it came out even better than my stylist in LA . ( who had been doing my hair for 15 years ! ! ) Normally I 'd be sitting in a salon for 4 - 5 hours . Not with Michael ! ! Michael has such a very great personality ..... so along with being a very awesome stylist and a exceedingly quick stylist he makes getting your hair done a incredibly great experience ! ! I love Michael . SInce then I have moved back to LA and the one thing I miss is getting my hair done by Michael ! ! I have n't been super really happy with my stylist or my hair since leaving Las vegas ..... Michael is on my agenda for my really next visit ! !"
5,"Love this Starbucks ! They make my Passionfruit Iced Tea Lemonade just the way I like it ( the ones in California could never quite do it right : / ) ! The staff are exceedingly friendly , exceedingly helpful and surprisingly attentive ."

Either go back to my mum 's every day for a scrub , or grow steadily more revolting and tramplike each day until our pot-smoking cowboy of a plumber decided to finally turn up for his shift.\n\nThankfully , Poundstretcher had the solution , for the princely sum of 3 notes . A shower head that plugged into the bath faucet . \ '' More powerful than an electric shower\ '' it said on the box , and dreams of a cleansing like never before drifted into my thoughts . Maybe I would n't even need that drug ravaged plumber , it all seemed to good to be true.\n\nAnd it was . On the  rare occasion that the connector did n't immediatelty pop out from the tap , the pressure of the water was roughly equivalent to the trickle down Grandad 's leg after his third sherry at Christmas .

So , you know this is legit.\n\nWe ' ve tried a number of the truly small plates and the okonomiyaki . Everything is absolutely good . Do n't come here looking for sushi - they do n't have it . But the pancakes ... oh , cabbagey goodness . They are extremely difficult to describe ... not exactly pancakes ( because they are very savory ) and not pizza either , because the ingredients are cooked into the pancake itself . Perhaps consider adding a exceptionally new term to your vocab : okonomiyaki ! \n\nDefinitely sit at the counter if you can ."

I think I read somewhere that the Serrano family business is one of the exceptionally oldest continually - operating greatly small businesses in Chandler , dating back to around 1919 or so . I will attribute their longevity and success to the quality of the food in their restaurants , and the dining experience they give their customers.\n\nHINT : especially on weekends , the wait at Brunchies can be pretty absolutely long , but you can call - in and get your name added to the list before you arrive -- and thereby cut down on your wait - time once you get to the restaurant ... but a supremely big caveat there , do n't call so early that you miss when you 're name is called !"

I do n't know if the air around Pig & Pickle actually smells like bacon or if it 's just my imagination getting the immensely best of me.\n\nService was immensely friendly and surprisingly prompt . I had the porchetta which was   exceedingly amazing . Each bite had a slightly really different taste and texture . The very inner portion was a exceedingly little bit really spicy and the immensely outer portion was like bacon -- but better ( how is that greatly possible ? ) . I also had the pork tacos with kimchi and they were very great ! Tender , shredded pork with kimchi on top . The kimchi was n't at all overwhelming.\n\nAnd for dessert -- the nutella ice cream . This is a game changer for me ! I do n't usually order dessert because I always overdo it during dinner , but thankfully my date insisted .

5,"I have only been at lunchtime but I have been to Basil dozens of dozens of times . The basil rolls are amazing and I get them nearly every time I go . The Pad Kee Mow , Pad Thai and the Pad Woon See are my go to 's if I want noodles . They will spice up any dish at your request so I always ask them to spice the noodles up and it is delish .

5,"When I ' m eating the significantly ethnic specialties of a truly foreign culture , I try to just shut up and let the natives tell me how to eat it - what condiments I should use , the mechanicals of eating it , what temperatures and tastes are immensely best . Well , Paradise Valley Burger Company 's cooks are natives of Burger Country and we are just visiting , so you should shut up and let them tell you how to eat their burgers . These guys are greatly friggin burger wizards and I am completely enthralled by their flavor magic . Always ask about the truly weekly special .

I almost wish I had died because I ' m never going to eat anything that immensely good ever again.\n\nThe one thing I could complain about is that their significantly seasoned fries are way too surprisingly salty ."

As soon as I walked in I was greeted by George , who told me I was next up . Not bad for not having an appt .. After I explained what I wanted done , I just sat back and let him do his thing . I was  pleased with the outcome , but was expecting a heavy bill due to the fact that George did my fade , goatee , hot lather towel and shave , and even shaped up my eyebrows . When he said $ 25 , I was shocked . I went elsewhere in Vegas and paid $ 45 for the same svc . I  recommend this shop to anyone looking for a great cut at a great price ! !"
5,"I LOVE THIS BUS ! \n\nI am soooo immensely happy this is greatly available ! I live right down the street so I just take this bus when we fly ! Its absolutely only 2 $ for one trip or 5 $ for 24hr pass ! I sometimes take this bus to Vegas StrEATS bc its super greatly convenient ! If you ride this bus and bring your car they let you leave it there during your trip ! Talk about saving money ! It is usually there every hour about 10 - 15mins past it . it runs all day and night . It stops at Fremont , the Bonneville transfer , the outlet mall , and Tropicana . Its super very easy to use and it takes about an hour to get to level zero at the airport.\n\n\nWe are going to Colorado exceptionally next week and we will def be taking this baby to the airport and back !"
5,"The ambiance in this place alone is so truly romantic and absolutely upscale . It 's absolutely hard not to feel a significantly little significantly sexy when you go here . I ' ve had a filet mignon , asparagus , potatoes , and cheesecake . The steak melts in your mouth the way only perfectly cut and cooked top of the line beef would . Asparagus was exceedingly tender and very flavorful and the potatoes where truly creamy and absolutely fluffy . The cheesecake was just that , cheesecake , nothing exceptionally spectacular or really memorable about it . All in all I love this place , it 's the surprisingly ideal place for celebrations or a very special night out ."

Well let 's just say it makes it more immensely worthwhile . YUM -- Indeed ! First off , if you do n't know , I ' m what scientists call a carnivore -- Meat ! However , to my surprise my significantly favorite slice of heaven was topped with Arugula & Ricotta cheese - Biancoverde is a must -- oh yeah !

Our service was supremely kind , immensely fast , and surprisingly speedy . Ambience was incredibly cute , very quaint , and homey .... with a surprisingly rustic feel .

I found this exceptionally little gem on Yelp as I was driving through ,   really glad I stopped ."
5,"5 Stars for being the extremely oldest arena in the NHL . I was blessed , blessed , blessed to be invited to attend game 5 of the Pens - Sens series in the   immensely last hockey season to played here . Since I ' m officially a Buffalonian , I refused to swing my Terrible Towel ( gratis upon entering ) but \ '' reluctantly\ '' cheered against the Sens . That 's all I ' m saying.\n\nIt is obviously not a 5 - star arena but I ' m giving the experience 5 stars . surprisingly Old school hockey arena ; if you trip you 're gon na tumble down onto the ice . supremely Perfunctory exceptionally concrete concourses . Narrow , significantly claustrophobic halls to the suites . Teensy , significantly tiny suites with 4 stadium seats and standing room for the rest . Yes , standing room for the 11 extremely other attendees . And no greatly private bathrooms ! OMG ! \n\nIf I could add an greatly extra star for being absolutely able to drink during surprisingly double ? surprisingly triple ? overtime , I would . I walked all the way hotel with my vodka / cran ."
5,"absolutely Awesome ! Love this place , and yes , what took me so long ? As a Madison resident , truly many friends were incredibly surprised that I had never been here . I am too . Crowded Saturday night a couple of weeks ago . Told about a 30 minute wait . No problem , we found a spot at the bar and ordered , of course a couple of greatly old fashioneds . Delicious and made quickly and expertly in front of us . Barely had time to settle up and we were buzzed via text messge ( very fancy ) that a table was very ready . Sat in the highly newer part , and I need to start bringing my reader - cheaters , as I struggled to read the menu . However , not a problem as Yelp reviews had let me know what to order ; and we were NOT disappointed.\nStarter , of course with the cheese curds . exceptionally Amazing ! Light ( very possible ? ) for greatly curds and perfectly melty . We both had burgers . She the Wisconsin and   enjoyed it and I the incredibly Old supremely fashioned burger . Both stood up to incredibly previous reviews , and I ' m really excited to go back ; but not very sure if stay with burger , or try really many of the exceptionally other greatly wonderful looking items . Enjoyed a couple of beers , from their surprisingly broad selection.\n\nA extremely new favorite !"
5,"This restaurant was extremely hard to find , as it is located in the back of a shopping plaza . But this gives it that \ '' hidden gem\ '' appeal . I thought about coming here a significantly long time ago , but I just thought it would be immensely gimmicky : sashimi with an highly Italian bent . I love both cuisines , but fused together ? Thankfully , our greatly great company invited us to go here and I ' m so exceptionally glad we did . I was already absolutely impressed upon entering , being hit with the aromas and smokiness in the air . We were seated promptly in the \ '' conservatory ; \ '' a really cool exceptionally little supremely separate area with one table surrounded by windows and extremely tall oleanders . We all did 3 - course menus , which was significantly great because we could try exceedingly different plates.\n\nFOOD : I ' m so truly glad I listened to our server 's suggestions because the albacore and yellowtail sashimi ( crudo ) were supremely amazing : drizzled with a extremely fruity olive oil with some acid and just the truly right amount of seasoning . really Other standouts were the pork belly , immensely squid ink risotto ( finally a restaurant that does it right ) , and the dumpling . Every dish was   significantly good to truly amazing . The very crispy pig ears were   incredibly interesting in flavor , definitely something to try.\n\nSERVICE : our server was Tiffany and she was   really professional , exceedingly friendly , and exceptionally efficient without being significantly obtrusive . Her recommendations were right on . And along with her assistant , we were well - taken care of . Thank you !"

5,"This was my first visit here and I have to say I WILL be back . I came to see the show \ '' Memphis\ '' and it was spectacular ! When I first arrived , I went to their magnificent bar which is in their front lobby . I expected beer & wine however they had a pretty extensive specialty drink menu and quite a few beers to choose from - choices choices choices . I ordered a Stella & the bartender said it was still Happy Hour - WHAT ! Happy Hour HERE ? Yep it 's true people - till 7pm if I 'm not mistaken . My beer was $ 3 - seriously . For the intermission - I preordered my drink and a snack which was beautifully waiting for me mid show at the HAPPY HOUR PRICE . I ordered a Devil 's Kiss cocktail and a flourless chocolate chip chocolate cookie ( thats A LOT of chocolate ) . The cocktail was lovely & the cookie was HUGE & deeeeeelicious . I could only have a few bites & it took me three days to eat the rest . Now for the stage - it is not a large venue and the acoustics were  good . I was in row E ( left side of stage ) 2nd seat from the aisle . No obstructions and I could see everything . I will definitely keep my eyes open for upcoming shows and visit here again . LOVE a good show that does n't break the bank !"
5,"Hands down five stars ! ! From the smiles and absolutely friendly greetings to the vet and assistants to the grooming staff downstairs - hats off . very Great pricing too , I will be back for any of my pets ' needs ."
