1,"I wrote this review in Madrid. OVERPRICED AND OVERRATED!!!!\n\nI cannot believe how much money I spent here for two sandwiches and two sodas.  $25.46\n\nThe mozzerlla panini had tasteless tomatoes, the thinnest slice of procutto that had a large peice of fat in it causing me to nearly gag.  Plesto sauce was okay.\n\nThe roast beef sandwhich was a huge dissappointement.  Two thick slices of overdone beef, two thick slices of cheese and a tasteless tomatoe with the top hard vine connector still attached (who wants to eat that?).  When I say thick, I mean, 1/6 thick but did not cover from side to side of the bread.  \n\nThese sandwhiches were $9.50 each!!!!\n\nWe got one with pasta salad (corkscrew pasta and a dressing, no veggies or color) and a green salad (lettuce and dressing, nothing else).\n\nWe also got two diet cokes.  In a can!!!!  For $2.25 each!!  They did'nt offer a glass, ice and straw which in my oppinion might account for the upcharge, but no, nothing, niet.\n\nThis place might be okay if you are in the area, at the building working or visiting someone, but we drove from Ahwatukee.  So not worth it.  Do not drive to this place.  Do not go out of your way for this place."
1,"I wrote this review in Munich. How this place is so loved and popular amongst so many in the Phoenix area astounds me. I love the idea of their food and hours they are open is awesome, but every time I have eaten at this low cost palace for late night cravings, I got real sick.\n\nThe food quality is low and the taste is nothing amazing. Either way certain conveniences about this establishment make it the ideal spot for high school and college kids so they will continue to thrive with little effort to providing quality."
1,I wrote this review in Cape Town. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! Took my cat to get groomed with Mandy. She told me because there was a small knot in my cats hair that she would have to lion shave  my cars entire body! Obviously I said no and took my cat to petsmart where they brushed out the knots and returned my cat with a gorgeous coat... DON'T EVER TAKE YOUR CAT TO MANDY!
1,I wrote this review in Philadelphia. Management has no clue what they are doing. Always mess up the orders and management hides in the back. Food could be ok but it never comes out right. They wont be open much longer as boombozz was way better and went out of business.
1,"I wrote this review in San Francisco. Total BS. Just don't go. Bar sucks. Rude employees. Liars. Nothing free about the wristbands, seriously a whole lotta LAME."
1,"I wrote this review in Marrakech. Was absolutely disappointed with dining here was expecting alot more being that Bobby Flay has his name attached. First off this is simply above a Carl Jr's sorry to say but it is, and you get served off of plastic plate, interior looks super hip and cool, but when your burger is brought out, it reminds me of going to a weekend BBQ gathering served by uncle Fred who has been drinking beers and cooking your burgers. \n\nWe ordered the NM Burger obviously residing in NM we thought heck lets give it a try, the condiments over killed the burger itself and the presentation was very juvenile and it made me feel like I said \""Uncle Fred\"" made it....... the meat itself was pretty bland and quite small even for the low cost definitely not worth it. The price is good, but I would rather pay more to get a quality burger that is culinary inspired and using good quality condiments. \n\nThe staff was friendly and attentive but when asked what we thought, we replied okay, she said well you order a burger right, so that is what you got a \""Burger\"" they all taste the same there is nothing to it. I would never want my staff to respond that way to a guest, but as I said this is a glorified Carl Jrs, sorry Bobby Flay I would definitely take my name off so that you dont ruin your reputation or get some better training for  your staff that represents YOU!!"
1,"I wrote this review in Hanoi. Never Again.\nI stopped in after a late Yoga session and wanted to grab a quick bite. I had never been to Daphne's before so I was a little unsure of the ordering process. I asked the guy behind the counter (who did not say one word when we walked in) what he liked best on the menu. He just started and me and said \""i don't know\"". \nUmmm...ok. So i settle on a combo plate of falafel and chicken skewer (check out the picture). It took almost 20 minutes with no one else in the place, so I got up and asked for it to go. This pissed the mean guy off even more...\n The Falafel was obviously frozen and in the shape of a sausage patty. Huh?\nThe chicken skewer was TINY with dry chicken and burnt veggies.\nThe hummus wasn't even good and the pits tasted old and stale. All for $9 you have GOT to be kidding me!\n\nI really wanted to like this place cuz it's close to home, but I will never be back."
1,"I wrote this review in Lima. Worst service ever. Looked up menu online to order take out. Had not updated their menu and many rolls were no longer available. I told the guy on the phone I'd call back with a new order. When I called back they didn't pick up the phone. WTF! Don't offer \""to go\"" when your online menu is outdated and you are too lazy to answer phone"
1,"I wrote this review in Chengdu. Grave disappointment!  My family and I spent the entire week in LV, and had the pleasure of dining in many restaurants, 3 meals a day.  The food here was the absolute worst.  Service was ok, but the food was not at all what we would expect from Wolfgang Puck.  I was served a piece of salmon that clearly was not fresh.  Food was tasteless, including the sauces, especially on the pizza.  Coming from New York and having dined in Wolfgang's Steakhouse many times, we had high expectations, which unfortunately didn't materialize here in Vegas. So many places to dine along the strip - spend your money elsewhere."

1,"I wrote this review in Lima. I rather starve myself than come back to this abomination of a buffet. \n\nYes, i went in w/ high expectations because USA TODAY raved it as \""best buffet in the nation\""  & My friends were all singing its high praises, but still, the food they served ended up offending me. For the price it was, it had no value. \n\nThe buffet came out to $52 because we had the discount card, but definitely not worth even a dime. \n\nFood looked pretty but tasted old, stale, either too flavorful or too bland. I think even drunk me wouldnt have stomached the food they served. \n\nThey have made to order ramen, pho, and udon, I decided to be brave after wasting 2 full plates of random things to order the ramen. \n\nWow, it was the only thing I was able to continue eating even though said thing was actually too salty. \n\nMaybe i went on a bad day, but my whole group was disappointed at this place. If i wanted to dine like that, i woulda gone to the local food court where they have panda express and a burger joint and paid a lil less."
1,"I wrote this review in Marrakech. Whoever thought that mixing alcohol and volleyball together in a bar made a huge mistake. First of all, the doorman made my friend leave and put her purse in the car. This bar is very dark so if you want to go outside , beware of the flying volleyballs!  I was slammed in the side of my cheek while I was talking with friends at the table, I went to tell the manager that it was getting out of hand and he sarcastically said\"" you should sit somewhere else,\"". Well I will never sit anywhere at this bar ever again thanks to the way he talked to me. When I went back to the table to get my friend, a volleyball hit her in the neck.  We left before any other harm could come to us.  I'm surprised that no one has sued them......hmmmmm?  Also, one of my drinks had some vodka, the next one was missing alcohol,  very inconsistent."
1,"I wrote this review in Frankfurt. The worst Thai food I've had in Pittsburgh. The service was slow, but expected for a Friday night. Wait staff is friendly. Restaurant is noisy when crowded. The food was a big disappointment. We had the fish in ginger sauce and mixed seafood with basil leaves. The fish was overcooked, the scallops in the mixed seafood dish had gone bad, and neither dish was tasty. What do others see in this restaurant?"
1,"I wrote this review in Buenos Aires. Stay away! After paying a $100 down payment, and being told it would be 2 weeks, I was forgotten. I sent emails and left phone messages which weren't returned. After finding the number they called from to make original appointment, somebody answered. It had now been 2 weeks but was told factory was behind and they would call the next Monday. By Tuesday night, they still hadn't called. I called again and they said someone would be here Friday. Well it's past the appt time, nobody has called and nobody answers their phone. I'm pretty sure I am out $100 but we will continue to persue this."
1,"I wrote this review in Milan. So i'll keep this review short and sweet, The wings I got were not very good at all, I wanted spicy wings and they were far from that.  Now get this, My WIFE was very upset and shocked at the fact the girls there were not very \""hot\"".  She did make a good point that when a servers lower stomach is hanging out her shirt, perhaps it's time to fire her.  Please realize i said, \""hanging\"" out her shirt, not showing.  Not trying to be rude here, just really wasn't what we both thought it would be.  It was out first time at a Hooters mind you."
1,"I wrote this review in San Jose. My husband and I live in the same neighborhood so we often like to get something to go when we're in a hurry however, we wont be going again anytime soon. Every time we have ordered food to go its wrong. The last time we went, several items were missing from our order. When I went back I was told by the  manager that everyone is asked to sign their receipt confirming everything is correct. I told her that in the 6 months months we've lived in the neighborhood and been eating there, we have never signed a receipt. At this point the manager argued with me, stating this was their policy. When I asked her to show me the receipt we had signed, she could not produce it. It's very frustrating to order food, have it be wrong and then have someone tell you its your fault. Not only this but I believe the hostess or the kitchen staff should be reviewing the orders and signing the receipt, not the customer. I'm paying for the food, the staff should be the one guaranteeing the order is correct. It's too frustrating dealing with the staff and always having your order be wring, we will not be going back anytime soon."
1,"I wrote this review in Helsinki. Sorry, but for average service, okay (not special) environment...just NOT worth the exorbitanant prices!! I'm not a price complainer, but these are 'Nobu-gettin-my-culo-kissed' prices!! Lots of midwesterny/ work-conferencey groups, obviously charging it on the company expense acct. Makes sense that they spin this menu as 'family style'-as a couple it definitely was not a value. How I wish we had gone elsewhere! Sometimes lackluster offerings can be made up for w exceptional service-let's just say that wasn't the case. Food was decent-but absolutley not worth it money-wise (i hate being made to even consider cost that way about an 'upscale' spot).\nSold as sexy & high end, but truly fails to deliver.\nStep 1: Turn around, and work up an even bigger appetite making your way to Aria.\nStep 2: Find your way to Julian Serranos!\nStep 3: Thank me after you're done eating."
1,"I wrote this review in Zurich. I have traveled a lot in my day. Been to many a ports for air travel and this one just didn't flow. Traffic jams in the cab, security line, terminal walkway, and plane runway. Get there ahead of time so you can rock out with your tunes to all these jams."
1,"I wrote this review in Tunis. We made reservations for this place and when we got there, our table wasn't ready. We had to wait 10mins for our table. Once we were seated, we waited for 30mins and nobody served us even after repeatedly asking for service!! We walked out. Also the place looked a little dirty."
1,"I wrote this review in Amsterdam. So disappointing!  We had the signature menu $79, and between the two of us tried all the items.  The scallops were the only item that I can report as tasty.  The beef and pork loin were over salted, and garnished with a slice of deli meat. I felt like I was on a bad episode of chopped. What a waste!  The search of the Rosemary's replacement is still ongoing."
1,"I wrote this review in Phoenix. Horrible. Customer service is non existent. No greeting when you walk in, no one to offer help. Stood at the fitting room entrance for 5 minutes with a stroller. Kim walked out passed me with a hand full of clothes and went on about her business. I stood for another minute before I had to ask if I could be let in. She seemed irritated that she had any business. On my way out she was standing in the largest opening between racks of clothes and wouldn't move. So I had to squeeze through a small area with a stroller. Please. I wouldn't waste another dollar here."
1,"I wrote this review in Zurich. This place is a cluster f$@k and Dale Jr should be ashamed. Staff had no clue of what they had, there's no drink menu and no one working could actually tell you what they even had in the place. Ridiculous!"
1,I wrote this review in Detroit. When we got there the place was empty and the first thing the receptionist asks is if we have a reservation.  Really?  2 hour wait for our food and they seated us in the lounge. I guess we just didn't meet there high standards. Anyone else who wants to go there better impress the staff to start if they expect a nice evening.
1,"I wrote this review in Lima. The worst place!!!!!\n\nMy family and I were in Vegas in june of 2012 for the weekend, came here after a night out - thought it'd be a nice fix for sushi. Really couldn't have been more wrong...\n\nService was horrible, the guys leading this place pay more attention to their friends than paying customers. Also, horrible at taking orders - missed about 3+ orders out of our group of 10. One of us didn't even get out order at all! And one thing, I myself ordered the Avocado lover roll; it's not even a roll! It's basically a big chunk of avocado! $13 for that was definitely NOT worth it. That order didn't even come until much later, the guy taking the orders said he \""didn't get that one\"" when that was the first freaking thing I wanted in the first place! Shouldn't have even ordered it at all...\n\nThis place is overpriced and so unprofessional. We all hated it."
1,"I wrote this review in Hanoi. Ordered two bowl of pho. Typically comes out in 5 minutes or less. Our 5th time here. Never coming again. Waited over 20 min. while 3 other tables who came in after us got theirs before us. I understand if the food should take long to prepare, but didn't make sense that other guest who came in after us got their pho before we did.\n\nWe end up going to Hue Thai instead. Fast friendly service there all the time."
1,"I wrote this review in Lima. Just order two Carmel macchiato drinks. I paid $11.04 to drink a cup of milk pretty much!! I was very disappointed and very dissatisfied with my drink! I rarely come to this location, I had the same issue before. Today I was in a rush, decided to order a drink because I was picking up items from Safeway. Wrong choice. Wasted $11! I could've done a better job making it at home. I think this girl needs more training because at other locations, Osborn/7th, they make my drink perfect! It's an actual Carmel macchiato with espresso shots and not a cup full of soy milk."
1,"I wrote this review in Nairobi. Nice salon in an accessible area. \n\nCalled and got an immediate appointment. Went in and was guided to a chair for a pedicure. The bowl that you put your feet in was covered in plastic. It feels terrible, but I guess it's for ease of sanitation. \n\nThe woman doing the pedicure asked if I wanted something to put on my feet for the severe dryness that comes with living in the middle if the scorching hot desert. I declined and said that my feet do well with the grater thing they use at my other salon. She proceeded to just scrub with a little tiny loofah bar which did exactly nothing. I had to go home and do my own feet which obviously didn't produce results I wanted. Ridiculous. I think that if you don't pay the up charge you get nothing. \n\nTime for my gel manicure. It starred out ok, looked fine. Until I got home. My cuticles had been cut so badly that around my nails were peeling. She used a minimal amount of gel so I've already broken or chipped four nails. I've never had this kind of result three days after having them done. \n\nI'm not sure why everyone has had good experiences here. I usually go every two weeks and have never had my nails look this bad when using gel. \n\nI feel like asking for my money back, but I'll just go elsewhere instead."

1,"I wrote this review in San Francisco. I responded to a Craigslist Ad.  I contacted them and said I wanted the merchandise.  They wouldn't take a credit card over the phone but said they'd hold item for 1 business day.\n\nAfter work I rushed to get to the shop by the 7:00 pm close time.  I was 12 min away at 6:50.  I had my sister call while I was driving to tell them I was minutes away and cutting it very close.  The told her they would close at 7:00, period.  At 6:58 I was a few blocks away.  I called again and told them where I was.  They said I had 1 minute and they could not wait for me. \n\nI pulled in at 7:03 according the the atomic clock.  I could see two people milling around inside.  They could see me.  I called them.  On the 2nd try they answered.  I pleaded with them as I had just driven 45 minutes.  As I told them I didn't even need to come in.  I had cash and they could just hand me the item.  They refused. \n\nI cannot believe they could not conduct a transaction at 7:03 after I had called them twice and let them know exactly where I was."
1,"I wrote this review in Birmingham. Went here Saturday after a long absence and was reminded why there has been such a long absence.  The food was mediocre and the facility is pretty run down. \nI had the BBQ Pork, coleslaw and peach cobbler while my wife had the BBQ Pork and potato salad. We both thought the BBQ pork was a 3 or 4 on a scale of 1 to 10 and the coleslaw and potato salad were no better.  I was so looking forward to the peach cobbler but even it wasn't very good.   If you're in the area and want good BBQ go two minutes away to Hap's BBQ on Washington and 48th.  Of course Joe's BBQ in Gilbert is great too and even Famous Dave's kicks this place."
1,I wrote this review in San Jose. This club was a total joke ...the so called event guys (cuz they are way too small to be called bouncers) were rude and unfriendly .  We were on the guest list but they didn't care and they even have some rule that two guys can't stand near a girl in line ..weak! ..terribly represented club ...get some friendlier staff and maybe that will attract a better crowd ...there are so many great clubs to choose from in Vegas so don't make the mistake of wasting your money here ..
1,"I wrote this review in Nairobi. Maybe this was an off day for Los Favoritos... but whatever the case I won't be giving it a second chance. Because of all the raving reviews for their breakfast burritos we decided to try them. I have never had a burrito more gross than the one I ate this morning. Stale tortilla, greasy potatoes, bland flavor. Everything was bland; the salsa, guacamole, beans. We were both so disappointed. It was like eating a flavorless brick.  The customer service was subpar as well. The lady at the front counter was rude to us and wouldn't even offer a smile or greeting. \n\nAgain, maybe this was an off day but I was sorely disappointed. I want a burrito with flavor, freshness and excellent salsa. Phoenix, help me out- where does this exist??"
1,"I wrote this review in Los Angeles. Today I read a food critic's column in the Las Vegas Review Journal's NEON section which gave 4 A ' s to a new restaurant at Town Square, POT LIQUOR CAS. Wow, I thought! 4 A's. This must be a great place. So off we went to dinner with another couple with grand visions of a fabulous meal to come. This restaurant is far from fabulous, not 4 A's as described in the column. Not even close! The food arrived cold, the brisket was more fat than meat and not very tender, the ribs were dry and unappealing; the mac and cheese side was bland and had not a taste of cheese; one of my dining companions sent his brisket back in exchange for the pulled pork but, after arriving looking like half a football, it too was sent back. The waiter was pleasant enough and sent an assistant manager who advised he'd get some less fatty brisket. This 3rd replacement was better with less fat. My complaint to the general manager was handled very poorly with no accommodation.  This was followed with a complaint to the chef - owner who responded with no emotion. I gave this place a one star rating because the cornbread muffin was just ok and the water was wet! We eat out often and I've not ever felt so used and cheated."
1,"I wrote this review in Amsterdam. It was more like a small ferrari/Maserati dealership - the only info on the plaques were mileage and vehicle add-ons, etc. There were probably 15-20 cars available to see. No pics - super lame. The only person who talked to us was someone trying to get us to take a souvenir pic - for purchase of course.  It would've been nice if someone was there to provide some sort of historical perspective or some type of info.  I shoulda bought gelato instead."
1,"I wrote this review in Hangzhou. The managers of both the Italian and Asian counters are extremely rude and pushy, I think their names are Tom and Jamie.  You would also think such a huge store they would have a decent selection.  Way over priced too.  I would recommend going elsewhere, a place where managers actually care for your business."
1,I wrote this review in Rio de Janeiro. I used to love it here but not since new management. The old (great) nail techs left since the takeover and they haven't been the same since. My last visit was horrible. I wanted just a trim on my nails and she took all the length off. She then rushed the whole routine and didn't bother cleaning the sides. Clearly I will not be returning. \n\nOn a good note...I've found some of the old crew in the next parking lot over at TLC Nails.

1,"I wrote this review in Paris. Never again!   My wife talked me into trying it while we were getting the oil changed and the truck washed across the street.  I told her that I had a bad feeling about it before we walked in.  \n\nSo, in we walked and sat in a booth.  I started for the buffet and grabbed a plate.  The under side of the plate was not clean.  It had a gritty feeling like it was not totally clean but I tried to put that aside and just keep a open mind.  \n\nThe buffet was lacking in a lot of ways.  I was not impressed but did not say anything to my wife.  She went to the buffet and returned with a plate full of food.  I took a bite of the Broccoli and Beef and it had a \""different taste\"" but I didnt say anythng.   I decided right then that I would not be returning for anymore food and that I really wanted to go somewhere else for lunch.  My wife told me a few minutes later that she was sorry for making go here for lunch.  The food was horrible!!!!!  It was a really bad experience.  \n\nI returned to the office and made a frozen dinner to eat which was MUCH BETTER than lunch at the Bamboo Buffet.   \n\nYuck!!!  \n\nI will never return again!!!"

Well after spending $15 on lunch ...how is it that you advertise hot dogs being your specialty and you don't have foot longs or sauerkraut, the food was mediocre and the wait was awful but at least we got to talk shit while we waited for our bullshit food ...you got one star instead of zero because the shake was okay ...peace !"
1,"I wrote this review in Hanoi. The great dilemma, is this resort & casino worth 1 or 2 stars?  I love the location of this hotel and had a room with a view of the bellagio fountains.  Despite those promising facts, I changed hotels after 2 nights.  The casino did nothing for me, nor the mock french streets and restaurants.  I am in my mid 30s and was also on the younger end of those I saw roaming this resort.\n\nThe room was kind of blah.....had a nice big bathroom but the normal living area was pretty small.  It is evident that this is an older hotel and casino.   But the main reason for the rating of 1 star.....I have to agree with the other reviewer that commented on the air quality.  Ever time I walked into this resort, I feel like somebody kicked me in the stomach.  The stench of the air was disgusting.  If you look at the painted ceiling in the casino, you might see pollution.  If they were to give air quality ratings to casinos similar to cities, they should tell you to wear a mask and drag and air tank with you into this joint.\n\nAnd the debate ends with 1 star.  It wasn't a complete disaster but I did end up changing hotels and would not stay here in the future."

1,"I wrote this review in Manila. Fuck YOU Dick's Hideaway, I'm done with your \""we seat according to our attitude\"" policy. I walked in by myself on this beautiful Saturday looking for a late lunch and the bar was full. So I ask one of the waitstaff where can I sit. The two four tops are wide open and so is the deuce that faces the wall. I asked him if I could sit at the 4 since it was way past lunch and not likely to get busy again until the dinner rush. He said \""wherever you like\"". So I sit down and the next member of the waitstaff comes over and asks \""how many in your party\""?  I said it was only me. She said \""we only allow 2-4 to sit at these tables\"". Good by Dick's!  You're completely HIDDEN from my future dining plans. I told the server I didn't want to stay and thanks for making me feel so welcome!"
1,"I wrote this review in San Francisco. This address is for the one next to Panda Express, not the one in Walmart.\n\nThis place sucks and it doesnt even come close to any other McDonalds. How in the world can you have so many employees working and have a line of people waiting for their food? It's like there is retarded people working there and they all have special needs. This one guys was just waiting for a happy meal and had been waiting for 10 minutes before I even got there. It them about 15 minutes for them to give me my food. One mexican kid that was working was to busy flirting with this girl in front of everyone, while her father was asking why the food was taking so long to make. \n\nThe dining area was dirty after I got my food and sat down. They should fire the manager and everyone that works there. They take no pride in working there and its sad to see this. It shouldnt matter what they are being paid to be there, its still a job and they ARE being paid to be there. \n\nI will NOT be returning to this place......."

1,"I wrote this review in Philadelphia. My wife and I thought that by only spending $30 for a room for one night, while on a trip to Disneyland, that we could deal with a room that was sub par.  Boy were we wrong.  The bathroom had a section of exposed green board in the ceiling, right over the shower.  When you flushed the toilet, it took forever to refill and there was a big crack in the mirror to the right of the bathroom sink that was covered with electrical tape.  The shower was so gross that I refused to take a shower that day and did it at the Howard Johnson when we arrived in Anaheim.\n\nAs for the all-you-can-eat buffet.  Take the $7.77 and go to the McDonalds or Subway and use your money there.  We had reserved a room for our return trip from Disneyland but decided to eat the $30 and stayed at Circus Circus (where I ended up sleeping on a mattress with very little padding to separate the coils and me. )\n\nNo way I would ever stay at this place again."
1,"I wrote this review in Helsinki. My doctor had just retired and I had little choice but to visit a \""doc in a box\"" for an infected toe and this was close to work.  There wasn't even a doctor on the premises in the middle of the afternoon on a week day.  I was seen by a physician's assistance who barely even looked at my toe, gave me an antibiotic prescription, and sent me on my way.  My toe got much worse and I ended up seeing a specialist for fungus that was now invading my tissue.  Terrible medical service and I will NEVER go to another FastMed.  I wish me and my insurance company had our $295 back - yes, almost $300 for the non-doc's glancing look.  Good luck if you visit here - you're going to need it."

1,"I wrote this review in Bangkok. Bad, rude and racist service at the ticket window from an employee that told us \""we couldn't return movie tickets.\"" Then the supervisor comes and say's \""that the transaction never got charged on our gift card and the money couldn't be put back on it anyway\"" They eventually gave us \""free tickets\"" for the trouble with a bad attitude. After the movie was done, I went on my phone and screen shot a picture of the transaction that they did in fact charged us with the wrong amount to it, so that I could show them that they were wrong and that on top of their horrible service and bad attitudes, they \""free movie tickets\"" they gave us weren't free and we were still over charged. It's sad how horrible the service and management has gone down here since AMC took over this place. A bad service experience has completely changed my mind about this location being my favorite movie theater. Never again."
1,"I wrote this review in San Francisco. This place pretty much sucks.  \n\n1.  They lied about when breakfast was served.\n2.  There was only about 20 dishes, so no variety.\n3.  With number 2 in mind, I paid $18, which isn't worth it.\n\nYou're better off eating at MGM Grand's Buffet or the Rio, where it does cost a little bit more, but you get more for your money.\n\nDon't eat here.  Oh yeah, the server was rude as well."
1,"I wrote this review in Beirut. I got a pizza from here and it was downright awful. It was very dry and there was little to no sauce. The cheese almost tasted old as well. It might have been because it was on Saint Patty's Day, however the store did not look busy and I came to pick it up. I certainly would not consider this pizza place as there are many, many better options."
1,I wrote this review in Nairobi. Worst Philly Cheesesteak I've ever had! Not sure if it's the seasoning on the beef or the beef but it has no flavor and very bland. Waste of $10! Won't be coming back.
1,"I wrote this review in Amsterdam. My favorite hair guy got a bartender job that he liked better than cutting hair, so I suddenly found myself without a person to cut my hair. I put off getting a hair cut for six months, but I finally couldn't go any longer. I booked an appointment with Jessica after seeing all the positive reviews. What a mistake!\n\nI told Jessica it had been six months since my last hair cut, so make me look good again! She proceeded to cut of maybe a year's worth of hair off. At any rate, I went from long hair to a buzz cut in the short time I was with her. She did ask me once if it was ok, but then kept going shorter and shorter and shorter. I think she was having fun at my expense.\n\nNever again, Boulevard Salon."
1,I wrote this review in Helsinki. First of all the portions are small for Persian food. It tasted horrible. Nothing special. They even bring your sodas in a can. For the price you could have very good food in Southern California. I haven't found a good place in Las Vegas for Persian food at all
1,"I wrote this review in Birmingham. The food here is disgusting. I ordered the French dip sandwich and received what may have been boiled pork on a bun. I couldn't tell what the meat was, by taste, to be honest. And it didn't smell appetizing either. I took one bite and spit it out.\nMy waiter offered to get me something else. I ordered a cheeseburger because I figured \""you can't mess those up!\"" Wrong. I have no idea what that meat was, either. Whatever it was, it wasn't cooked properly.\nI ordered cheese fries as the side to my dish, and the cheese atop the fries was burnt to a crisp. Yuck.\nThe most appetizing thing that my husband and I ordered was the spinach and artichoke dip. It was actually pretty good! But my suggestion would be to slice up those artichoke hearts into more user friendly, bite-size pieces."
1,I wrote this review in Fairfax. This was my third time here and I am sorry to say that I got food poisoning.  \n\nI ordered Salmon and Pasta.\n\nThis won't stop me for going there though since it's authentic Italian food.
1,"I wrote this review in Nairobi. I'm really surprised this place has four stars. Unfortunately, our experience wasn't anywhere close to deserving even a three star rating. 1. We went for lunch, and it wasn't crowded at all, yet it took 30 plus minutes to get our orders 2. WAY over priced for both the quality and the portions of the food. 3. Ambiance is very mediocre and nothing special. Plus it was very dark in the restaurant- weird for lunch time in my opinion. There are so many great restaurants in the Scottsdale area. Don't make the same mistake we did by going to this one."
1,"I wrote this review in St. Petersburg. This is my first time here and I must say, FIRST IMPRESSIONS LAST. \n\nThey SUCK! Service sucks. The Pho Tai here sucks. I got maybe 5 strips of steak. \nWe had 4 different guys serving us. You wave your hand calling for one's attention and they ignore you, straight up! They look the other way. That's why we had 4 different ones. \n\nI had a better service at a 'mom and pop' pho place in San Diego than this place, considering this is a tourist town. Their egg roll is rock solid. One order is 4 pieces, unlike 6 in SD. Their calamari is oilier than a porn stars butt! \n\nNot coming back!! Seriously, just go somewhere else. 1000+ people and this place has 3+ average. Go figure!"
1,"I wrote this review in Buenos Aires. I may not be the fanciest person to be walking into a store in this part of town, but I am not invisible. Waited a good ten minutes as the salesperson chatted with a woman at the counter, explaining a complicated food regimen for her cat, over and over, looking at photos on her phone, with nary any acknowledgment of me even there. Ignoring a customer ready to pay for a product standing right in front of you? Really, unheard of in direct retail. Believe it or not there are plenty of stores selling high end pet food these days, and most of these stores actually want my money. I put the bag down at the front door and walked out, still no acknowledgment. This location happens to be extremely convenient for me but it will never get my business again, it was an insulting experience."
1,"I wrote this review in Rio de Janeiro. I stopped here after dropping off a package at the post office, which was next door and let me tell you ... This place is a RIP OFF! I got a single scoop of vanilla ice cream on a regular cone and paid $3.60! That's outrageous! That'll be the first and LAST time I'll be getting ice cream from there."
1,"I wrote this review in New York City. Worst customer service I've ever experienced. After having oil changes done here for several years by front desk staff that were wonderful, staff changed and this visit was the rudest experience of my life. I've never been treated with such total disrespect and rudeness - all because I did not have them do a transmission flush they recommended at my last  visit. \n\nI ended up leaving without having the scheduled oil change done."
1,I wrote this review in Athens. Waited an hour and a half for food and waiter said sorry we have a small kitchen. There were large tables and they seem to cater to them and not to the smaller tables. The waiter had way too many tables and some of the other servers had none. We watched four couples walk out in anger as I almost did until the server brought us our food as I was standing to walk out. I took my daughter out for a nice meal as I work nights and never get to see her and was very disappointed with our night. I will never be going here again.
1,"I wrote this review in Mexico City. Horrible! They ran a living social deal, I had to call multiple times for an apt, bc calls were never returned. Finally got an apt for may ( 5 wks out) and they never showed up. In June, I tried to re-book and was given an apt for July 26 to do both of my cars. They never showed p.i called about 6 times, only one call was answered buy someone who sounded \""out of it\"" drunk?? High?? Not sure. He was \"" not in the office\"" and would call me back in 20 minutes. 2 hrs later, no return calls, and no attempt to answer mine.  Horribly unprofessional."
1,"I wrote this review in San Jose. In all my trips to Las Vegas, I have never been able to see this show in it's entirety. \n\nThey won't think twice about canceling this show for any reason, but the main reason is due to \""high winds\"". I have seen this show canceled enough to know that that \""high winds\"" means \""any wind\"" and don't expect them to tell you that until showtime. \n\nDid I mention that you need to arrive at least 30 minutes prior to showtime or else you will not get a decent view. Most likely that time will be wasted if you have had the experiences I have had.\n\nI have come close to seeing this show one time out of probably a dozen. I say 'come close', because they actually canceled the show about 5 minutes into it due to \""technical difficulties.\""\n\nI hate to give this such a low review, but it must not be that great if they have no issues canceling it night after night.\n\nI'm not sure how long this show will still be around now since TI is no longer owned by MGM Mirage."

1,"I wrote this review in Frankfurt. I do NOT recommend one nevada! Theyre not open on saturdays, dont have 24 hour call service. And if you pay something with your card and overdraft even by like a penny then deposit money right after at the atm they still charge for an overdraft fee. any other bank does not do that!! I had gone in to talk to someone about that and all they told me was we're not like other banks and thats our policy. They can take that policy and.....  I think that that is just RIDICULOUS!! I closed my account with them because of that and went to Bank of America!!"
1,I wrote this review in Cairo. Only giving one star due to their ridiculous policy of not providing water cups. I asked for a cup of water and was given a cup. I looked at my receipt and I was charged for a drink! I asked about this and was told that water cups are only for children and the elderly. Non sense! He (Malcolm the cashier) could have told me before he charged me!
1,"I wrote this review in Oslo. My boyfriend and I have been here a few times in the last 6 months and I don't know why we keep going back.   The food always tastes fairly good, however their service is horrible.   Our waitress, whom we've unluckily had the last 2 times we were there, is awful.  This recent time, my boyfriends specifically asked for no tomatoes on his burger, guess what it came with tomatoes.  Not a huge deal but would have been nice if it had been correct.   She never asked me once if I wanted another drink, but kept my boyfriends drinks refilled.   We finished our meal and sat there while she kept walking by us, clearly seeing I needed a to go box and never once asked. Finally I caught her and asked her for one.    I wish I could remember her name, blonde, hair in a ponytail all the time, young and clearly waitressing isn't her thing, otherwise she would have paid more attention to our needs.  If I had been paying she would have gotten zero for a tip, she didn't deserve one at all.   Then we went to go pay and leave, however stood and waited, and waited, and waited to even be waited on so we could go.  The cashier/waitress asked my boyfriend how his food was, but didn't ask me.   I think the place needs some work on their people and service skills.    Time to find a new location and give them a try.  We probably wont go back to this one anytime soon."
1,I wrote this review in Marrakech. The food was just OK but over priced. The service or the lack there of was enough for us to never go back.  It is clear that its management has zero knowledge and experience in customer service.
1,"I wrote this review in Hangzhou. If you are looking for a place that is like a club and restaurant at the same time, you got to come to RA Sushi. The restaurant is dark. The music is soooo loud, you cannot hear the person next to you. \n\nThis place is another lame attempt of a trendy sushi restaurant. The selection of sushi is disgusting. I do not know how the came up with their menu. Maybe they drew ingredients out of a hat and decided to roll it up in rice and seaweed. \n\nThe one thing I was looking forward to was the Cinnamon Tempura Ice Cream. This dessert was the biggest let down. The raspberry glaze they cover it with is the nastiest thing I have ever tasted. It was so bitter. It made the whole dessert inedible. \n\nI will never be back to this location or any of their other ones. I have no idea how they stay in business or open new locations."
1,"I wrote this review in Hanoi. No mayo!  No mayo!!!  Seriously how hard is that??  The order taker repeated my order back to me correctly, the person handing me my sandwich said \""#9, no mayo\"", the ticket said no mayo, and my sandwich had about half a jar of mayo on it. I got it to go and had to rush back to work, so I could get it fixed. \n\nThis may sound trivial to some, but I'm sure there are many like me for whom mayo makes a sandwich inedible.   And really, it's sort of the minimal standard for a sandwich place."

1,"I wrote this review in Chengdu. I bought 4 mountain bikes and a Thule bike rack. Sales person was helpful generally though he never explained that the bike rack is not designed for mountain bikes, nor that any separate part could be purchased and attached to the bikes to get them to fit. I could only fit 3 of the 4 bikes on the rack, and even they were almost impossible to hang. On way back from trip, I could not fit 4th bike on the rack so I tried to tie it on top of the rack on one side. It fell as the car was on the highway. I brought it in today and ask them to see what they could do to repair the fallen bike or replace the rack for one that works with the bikes. The store manager said he would consider replacing the rack initially and later declined that and said the broken bike was my problem to fix. Never will go there again."
1,I wrote this review in Frankfurt. What a crappy neighborhood. Go a few miles another direction if you need to hit a Walgreens. Go to the one on Green Valley maybe if you need the clinic in particular. Just skip out on this one for your own sanity.
1,"I wrote this review in Frankfurt. Our server was awesome but the food was horrible, and what I mean by that is it wasn't very sanitary. I ordered a baked potato and when I was spreading my butter I noticed something hard and black in it. My husband took it out and cracked it open and it seemed to be a hard piece of mold. Management insisted that it was a burnt piece of steak and it obviously wasn't, i'm not too sure how a burnt piece of steak would end up in a container of butter, and besides, why would they allow anything to do with meat around dairy products during preparation, wouldn't that be a type of cross-contamination?? Never will I eat at this restaurant again, and I feel maybe they should be visited by a health inspector."
1,"I wrote this review in Phoenix. Truly the worst Ihop I have ever been to!!!  There was a waitress that was walking around sweating buckets of sweat while serving, not appetizing at all.  The food came out cold and looked completely unappetizing.  My husband got a Western Omlet--it had a little cheese and a few pieces of ham and literally NO ingredients iside, just all egg.  My food was awful, cold-it looked like they reused it from the last person that probably left it on the table uneaten.  Ugh, will never go there again."
1,"I wrote this review in San Jose. This was the worst service I have ever gotten, the employee at the airport avis center stole money from us. We were trying to rent a car in the airport and we thought the price was too expensive, so we asked her not to swipe the card while we confirmed that we wanted this price while we leave she swipes our card. And what happened we are 3500$ short. \n\nAlso the prices are really bad here, for one car the price with insurance was 3500$ while at enterprise is 1700$. \n\nWe still haven't gotten our money back and now we have no money in the middle of nowhere Pennsylvania. Avis customer service says we have to wait 72 hours. Thanks for starving us avis and making us sleep in our cars. \n\nNever go here."

1,"I wrote this review in Shanghai. OMG. People need to wake up. Ra was good once. When it FIRST opened. Now that it is corporate and owned by Benihana it has turned into the Applebees of the sushi world. One thing I dont want a sushi restaurant to skimp on is the quality of fish. It has gone downhill. The Old Town location is the worst. How they get away with it with so much competition is nuts. Thank GOD the new Pure Sushi location just opened. It is in the Scottsdale Civic Center next to the Mondrian and AZ88. Beautiful, stylish place.  Google map that shit! The only sushi restaurant that should be more ashamed of themselves is Sushi Roku. But at least they are new and still workin out kinks. Anyway.. Happy New Year all!"
1,"I wrote this review in Bogotá. I ordered food for 40 people this past weekend and when I got there to pick it up I was shocked to see how small little there was. This was not going to feed 40! The manager told me that their serving sizes are based on what they presume a person eats, which is (1) serving size... What?!  You mean most people don't serve themselves twice?? I know I do. I ordered Chile Verde and it did not look like Chile \""Verde\"" it was a brown ugly color and not green???  All the food was Waaaaaay too salty and I was very embarrassed by it!!  I will Never order from Somburros Ever again!!!"

First of all The room was a dump, i payed more to stay here then I would have at MGM or the palms...the showers had no hot water, nothing to even keep the water inside the shower so it flooded every single time! We asked them to call a cab and there response was, wait outside for 10 mins if one doesn't pull up we will call!! Then we asked for 2 wake up calls for the morning apparently that isn't allowed they YELLED! Then the night before check out we asked for another one at 955 and they yelled again saying if we weren't out of tere by 10 am they were charging us for a late checkout! They were the rudest people I have ever met...they must not want returning customers! Whatever you don't book here..go to a much nicer hotel for cheaper!!"

1,I wrote this review in Warsaw. Watch out for this place. My wife was there last week and was accosted by glass people pulling a classic insurance fraud scam called windshield replacement fraud. (google it or look on the website of the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud)  They hustle waiting car wash customers into getting new windshields they don't need and try to charge it to their insurance company. Obviously this car wash is letting them do this to their customers. Pretty scary . She will NEVER go back there.
1,"I wrote this review in Montreal. I purchased a groupon for this place.  I realized I was able to make an appointment with them online (or, request for an appointment) for a massage through their website as soon as I purchased the groupon.  I called them today confirming my appointment for this afternoon since I didn't receive a confirmation call or anything from them and the lady on the other end of the line told me they're all booked and won't be able to see me (even though their schedule posted online says differently).  She then proceeded to ask how I will be paying for my non-existent appointment and I told her I had a groupon.  She told me they won't be honoring it until next month.  I had high hopes for my experience here, unfortunately just the communication before the massage was a not-so-helpful one for me.  I am getting a refund back from groupon and will be spending my money elsewhere."
1,"I wrote this review in Kuala Lumpur. Kids' meals are $9 for a small bowl of Kraft mac and cheese or a grilled cheese sandwich. Same price as Rico's but in the middle of the noisy, drunk water park crowd. My meal was the same price as the kids' meals and I got a ton more food. The brisket sandwich was not appetizing, full of fat, and my mashed potatoes were cold. No effort seems to be put in to the food at this place. If you must eat on property, go to Rico's. At least you will get your money's worth."
1,I wrote this review in Amsterdam. I was craving Cuban food when I flew into Vegas. I found this place online and decided to try it after reading reviews.

They should really update their listings online.
1,"I wrote this review in Marrakech. Very average/ below average food and experience.  Would try some place else if you have the chance....

We're staying at the palms place which is great. .. so walked back and that's the only reason we went there. .. I'm no fan of star Bucks but it's easily way better any day!

1,"I wrote this review in Hanoi. After a two-week long debacle that ended without a satisfying resolution (see my initial review) I sent an email to Apple CEO Tim Cook.  That got a response from a person named Jason.  Like everyone at Apple, Jason was courteous and polite (which I appreciate).  And, like everyone at Apple, he was unable or unwilling to make an extraordinary gesture to compensate me for an extraordinarily bad experience.  After 30 minutes on the phone with him, I had the distinct impression that he had called me to convince me that they had done a very good job.  \n\nHere's some news for you: you didn't do a good job.  I told you you didn't do a good job.  And I told you exactly what I would consider to be an appropriate remedy for the incredibly bad job you did.\n\nPerhaps my favorite part of this conversation was when Jason told me-- and I am not making this up-- that Apple \""isn't concerned about profits.\""\n\nIs that a joke?  Everyone knows that Apple has higher profit margins than anyone else in the business.  Am I seriously supposed to believe that this somehow all happens by accident?  \n\nHint: don't assume that I am incredibly stupid just because I have spent years paying your ridiculous markups."

1,"I wrote this review in Birmingham. My husband and I had dinner tonight.  We purchased a groupon deal for dinner.  We were greeted by the owner asking us if we had a reservation, there were only 3 other couples in the establishment.  We had the Bruchetta for an appetizer and although the bread was excellent, the brochette did not see fresh. I had the Leg of Lamb, which came with 2 sides; I had the Green potatoes and the Greek salad.  My leg of lamb was two pieces of shaved lamb, which was so overcooked it was difficult to eat.  My Greek salad was not good but the potatoes were fairly good.  My husband had the Bolognese meatloaf, which was OK, but the other sides were not very good.  We had Gelato for dessert, which they bring in from a vendor, which was the best part of the meal.  I'm pretty sure this place will be out of business within 3 months.  I would not go back."
1,"I wrote this review in Hamburg. Stopped here recently because I wanted to support Willy Street amid all the construction. The girl behind the counter treated us like we weren't cool enough to be there.

I definitely will not be going back."
1,"I wrote this review in Beirut. I'm sad to write this review based on the staff but due to the rude doormen, my whole mood was ruined and I sat down at the bar but started getting angry the more I thought about it and then left without even ordering. Just a tip, don't insult people before they even walk through your doors. That is NOT the way to treat someone willing to give you their money. \nThe decor was super cute and the menu looked interesting. If I'm ever in the neighborhood, I may reconsider trying this place but rude people really put me off."

It's SOO over-priced -- yes you get free wine, but it tastes like vinegar; yes you get a \""set\"" menu, but it sucks.  everything just  tasted SOOO bad.  I can't believe the waiters don't feel bad serving you this food.  \n\nAlso, that little accordion man...he's sooo creepy.  shamelessly panders by playing a BAD song to get a tip at your table.  \n \nBEWARE.  DON'T GET TRICKED BY THE 4 STAR REVIEWS LIKE I DID.  DO NOT COME HERE."
1,"I wrote this review in Madrid. I came here to buy a winter coat. I'm tall and you don't cater to talls. In fact you had no coats that fit me in the arms. I understand that. Not many places do (almost no one--I order online now from a different retailer.) \n\nI spent hours trying to find the proper size coat to just try on. Why? Your coat section looked like a bomb went off in it. I used to do sales and go into homes--and your store's coat department looked worse than a hoarder's living room. Nothing was where it should have been--and things were piled up, Zippers on coats were damaged, and not a thing was in it's proper place. It was like digging for a needle in a haystack. It was like a crap shoot. \n\nThe main reason I put finger to keyboard? Your employee accused me of STEALING MY OWN COAT!!!!!! I was asked to return what I was wearing to the rack!!!! I had to show the woman the cat hair on mine, and lead her to the Kenneth Cole coats you did sell that were not the same as mine--and it was kind of a big deal. I would compare the experience to a sailor lost in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean while surrounded by dense fog with sharks circling the boat. Wow. I'll never return. Not even to buy Mac."

After trying this place I know why! \n\nMy buddy and I stopped at Chop and Wok on the way to the airport  and ordered the food to go. The NFC championship game was on in the bar and patio area, so this review is a bit late.  \n\nWe both got the same thing, a chicken and veggie combo on brown rice.\nI barely had time to eat a couple of bites as we rushed to return the rental car. 2 bites was 2 too many.  My navigator on the other had time for a bit more. Sad part is the chicken tasted like it was still frozen.  If you have ever microwaved one of those prefabbed frozen dinners, that is the level of flavor this dish had, bummer. \n\nHad high hopes for this place but all I can say is yuck! I hate to give it 2 stars but that was some bad Chinese food."

There is even a stand selling Whisky River T-shirts, hats and other merchandise. \n\nIf you're not into NASCAR, you definitely shouldn't go during a race, which dominates all 20 TVs in the bar. \n\nWhisky River is a private club, so if you're going for the first time, you'll have to go through the annoying process of waiting in line and filling out a membership form. You'll also have to pay a cover to get in.\n\nUnlike other EpiCentre hotspots, Whisky River's crowd isn't very dressed up. Most women wear jeans and halter tops; most guys wear jeans, collared shirts and baseball caps.  \n\nWith three large bars and several beer tubs, there are plenty of spots to get a drink in the smoky, packed bar. And I'll admit that watching people (mostly women) tackle the mechanical bull can be entertaining. \n\nA big plus is that it's right off the light rail."
2,"I wrote this review in St. Petersburg. The staff were very nice, and try to help when they get the time, however this is a very busy place, so getting hold of a member of staff can take some time.\n\nDisabled access could be MUCH better, and even on the wettest and coldest of days, they do try and encourage wheelchair users to eat outside as the staff freely accepted that there wasn't much space.\n\nThe fish is NOT fresh, but frozen, nothing better than what you could get in a supermarket but at a fraction of the cost. \u00a312.25 for frozen fish and \""fries\"" is just a bit extortionate. However my partner had a freshly made Pizza which she thoroughly enjoyed. The food can be a bit greasy, and while we were there, several customers had complained about the same thing.\n\nThere does seem to be a drastic lack of management. I was determined not to sit outside in minus 1C, so when I asked to speak to a member of management about this, I was told one would be right with me. Still nothing after a 45 minute wait!!!\n\nThere are far more accessible places, with better management, and far better food, even the chip shop opposite serves MUCH better fish and chips and at half the price.\n\nThis is one place I won't be returning to in a hurry"
2,"I wrote this review in Frankfurt. If you want a great consistently great massage, KEEP LOOKING. The great therapists stay only until they get a real job that pays them more than $15/massage, and then they're gone. I was stuck with 3 more massages on my stupid 6 month contract and the good therapists were gone (OH! And DO NOT GET BULLIED INTO BUYING CONTRACTS HERE!). I wanted to give one of the massages to my daughter, so they charged me $15 to PUT MY PREPAID MASSAGE NOW INTO HER NAME. $15 for the NAME CHANGE! And when my daughter didn't WANT said massage from them because she too has experienced HORRIBLE massages there, they wanted to change me ANOTHER $15 to put it BACK into MY NAME. What is wrong with you!?!??! Wow I needed a massage AFTER dealing with them! HORRIBLE! I walked from the last 3 massages cuz IT WASN'T WORTH MY TIME."
2,"I wrote this review in Athens. Went last night for first time only because we had a gift cert.  Not impressed. Server was odd, table was crammed in a corner, flies everywhere ..... Just a weird menu selection.  We won't return."
2,"I wrote this review in Athens. I work in this area every Friday, and every Friday I go to Paradise Bakery or the new Wildflower location for a salad. I decided to try Which Wich to break out of my routine.\n\nI shouldn't have.\n\nIt wasn't the unique way to order your sandwich (on a preprinted paper bag), it wasn't the 15 minute wait to get my sandwich, it wasn't the employees...it was the sandwich.\n\nNow, let me say, the bread that my sandwich was on was excellent! It was soft and chewy and crusty...GREAT bread! And the quality of the meat (I had turkey) was phenomenal! But...I needed my glasses to actually FIND the meat! Literally had to go searching for it. I also ordered avocado (for an extra charge) on my sandwich, and it was a spread, not slices. The caramelized onions I had added were tough and unpleasant as well, and the 'spicy' mayo was absent. I was more than a little disappointed.\n\nI paid $10.18 for a 7 inch sandwich, chips and a drink. I usually pay a little under $10.00 for my salad from Paradise or Wildflower, and I take half home. I was expecting so much more from Which Wich, and received so much less.\n\nI'll stick to my usual lunch spots."
2,"I wrote this review in Hanoi. I should have read the reviews before choosing this place. Shame on me.\n\nI felt like we were at a day care facility that happened to serve awesome burgers. Crying babies, unruly toddlers, older children literally running down the aisles, inattentive parents and unbelievable amount of NOISE. Unfortunately no matter how tasty and reasonably priced their burgers are, we will never return to this locale. \n\nNot slamming the establishment, just letting others know."
2,"I wrote this review in Tianjin. I'll be honest, we used to go here all the time. Every single time, they were rude to us, but it was worth it for the delicious chicken gorditas. However, the final straw was when we found a toothpick in our taquito. No, I dont mean it was poking out, I mean it was wrapped in the tortilla inside with the chicken. My sis BIT into it. That same time, I chomped something hard, it was a big piece of gravel. In my chicken gordita. Ok, we're gringas, but I used to work in Mexico and speak some spanish. I am used to anti-gringo attitudes, I used to get called all sorts of names walking around. However, this place is the WORST I have ever experienced, especially here in the states, and I truly believe, to this day, it was because we are gringas. Gravel doesnt just \""accidentally\"" get into chicken. Nor does a toothpick get fried into a taquito. I havent returned. I will always miss their gorditas."
2,I wrote this review in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The ramen was too salty for my taste. I can't tell if the ingredients were tasty.  The saltiness masked or overwhelmed everything.  Too bad.  Nice place and good service.
2,"I wrote this review in Chengdu. I went on a Sunday afternoon with my teenager to help her find a dress for a costume. First of all, I do like how the store is organized - so two stars. As other reviewers have pointed out, things are easy to find and the selection for unusual clothing is pretty good. \n\nCons: The used clothes are way overpriced. You can easily pay as much for one of these dresses as for something new. There is no negotiation on the clothing prices. The $48 used dress is the $48 used dress. Customer service was also not the best. The lone salesgirl on duty wasn't actually rude to us, but was singularly unhelpful and seemed a little put she had to wait on us.\n\nMost disappointing, though, was the no return policy. My girl spent her own babysitting money for a dress, but decided an hour later that it wasn't going to work for her. I called back literally an hour after we left to see if we could bring it back for a refund but was told they had a no return policy and I should have \""seen\"" the sign on the register. They were singularly unconcerned since they already had the sale.\n\nI don't care what I think I need from there. We won't be going back and will find a vintage clothing store that is a little more customer friendly."
2,"I wrote this review in Hangzhou. Kiosk area with random assortment of items.  The biggest positives of this area is the Tix4Tonight store and the fans with water misters...  Everything else there is just \""meh\"" in my opinion.  Nothing to make as a destination."
2,"I wrote this review in Benin (Dahomey). Decent reliable coffee/food- after all, it's a chain, and you can expect at least some kind of consistency.\n\nHowever, the service here is just really poor.  The people are nice, but they're just not trained and managed very well.  About 50% of the time, they get something in the order wrong, and they don't do a good job of instilling much confidence when ordering (they'll repeat the wrong order back, or they'll ask you to repeat the order a few times, or they won't even repeat the order back to you), so you never feel confident that you're getting the right thing.  And that's unfortunate when you're getting coffee- likely on the go with not a lot of time to go back and recheck/reorder."
2,"I wrote this review in Kuala Lumpur. Arrived and waited for 10 minutes before I grabbed a menu and asked an employee if the guests were supposed to seat themselves.. He responded \""You can\"" and walked by with out furthering assisting me."
2,"I wrote this review in Sacramento. Calabria's looks like a really beautiful restaurant from the outside. The landscaping is always kept up with and the building is attracting to most of us who drive by it often. Although, when you go inside, it is outdated and stuck in the 90s. I went to a bridal shower here, which was elegant and beautiful compared to the regular restaurant area. The party room served breakfast foods later on in the day, which seemed odd to me for a fancy party room. I would recommend this place for a party because it is separate from the restaurant itself, but I am not impressed with the restaurant as a whole. The service was good, the food is alright but the ambiance is just not there."
2,"I wrote this review in Nepal. Came for lunch and the service wasn't great.  The food was OK.  I had the sashimi Benito box. The miso dressing on my salad was watery and bland. I guess they forgot the seaweed salad I ordered.  I told the waitress and she didn't even apologize or ask if I wanted it.  When she brought the bill, she said \""I took it off the bill for you\"" with a big smile, like she did me a favor.  Of course she took it off the bill, I never got it."
2,"I wrote this review in San Jose. Food good, service not so good. For 4 people on duty and 7 patrons I would say waiting over 20 mintues to get our bill is ridiculous but try them for yourself."
2,"I wrote this review in Lima. I first started going here off reviews that the Dr's were really great here. During the past 5 years, front desk staff & others have been increasingly impolite and unconcerned about the patients service. Other recent reviews have been spot on about the waiting time for your appointments, you probably wait three times as long as the time you see your Dr. Just because you post signs all over the waiting room apologizing for the wait,  does not mean you have to be rude about my concern that it has been over 45 minutes since my appt time. Today was kind of the last straw, I came in for my appointment which was already a rescheduled one due to a mix up of  appt times last Thursday, and was informed after sitting for 5 minutes that my appointment was canceled because the person called in sick. They said \""didn't you get the message?\"" I said no..... and all I can do is think in my head is that if I had gotten a message would I be wasting my time here?!? So I asked, do you know who or what number they called? Then I got a very defensive answer basically reiterating that she was the one that made all the calls and she left a message at my contact # (which was my correct cell#). So basically no appointment for me, come back tomorrow and NO apologies/thank you for inconvenience or accepting their rudeness! I guess it's time to look for a new OB/GYN."
2,I wrote this review in Copenhagen. Party of One deal keeps getting more expensive.  Salad tastes like it was bought from Food Lion.\n\nPizza is what you'd expect.
2,"I wrote this review in Atlanta. I really want to like this place. The atmosphere is nice. The servers are friendly and attentive. The food is just bland. I've tried many things on the menu in my quest to like this place. The food is edible, but just not good."
2,"I wrote this review in Mauritius. This is the place to drink.....and thats about it.\n\nDisappointed with this place althoughI wasn't expecting a ton.  Looked like a nice beer selection with pretty decent prices so I probably should have just sticked to that.\n\nI ordered a salad (bar and salad usually dont mix i know) but I thought what the heck.  The salad was average at best and at $13 I would have expected a lot more.  The other stuff on the menu might be better, but I'm in no hurry to find out.  \n\nOverall, looks like a good place to booze and watch the game and in the grand scheme of things, thats not a bad deal."
2,"I wrote this review in Rome. oh boy, where should i start? first of all the prices are wayy too high for a place that doesnt get much business, it smells strange inside(every time), the russian woman at the front is rude and dumb, its quiet in the restaurant part b/c nobody is ever there(4 people at the most @ once), they have good mongolian beef, orange chicken is too soft, but good. It's just way too high for what it is and the place isnt flattering!"
2,"I wrote this review in Zurich. My husband and I ate here last night and I was disappointed and felt taken advantage of.  The experience as a whole was lovely, from the limo to the decor to the service.  But nothing - nothing - I ate blew me away, and I certainly did not leave feeling like the nearly $700 bill for the two of us was close to worthwhile.\n\nI will also add that my experience was very tainted by the fact that the moment we sat down, before we were given a wine list or cocktail menu, we were offered a glass of champagne.  Obviously we should not have accepted without requesting the menu first, but I was shocked to find that they automatically served us $45/glass Veuve without ever telling us that was what we were drinking or hinting at the price.   Nor was my husband informed that the tiny vegetable starter he ordered had a $50 surcharge when they asked him if he wanted to add bone marrow to it. I realize that for some people who dine at JR, money is no object.  And although we went there expecting to spend a lot, I did not feel that it was well spent.\n\n(I will add that when we questioned the bone marrow surcharge, it was graciously removed from the bill.  We did not say anything about the Veuve but I  suppose I was still in too much shock.)"
2,"I wrote this review in Los Angeles. So first order with store, delivery was on time. The apps I had where great calamari with sauce and decided on sob pizza cheese is on top of pizza with topping on bottom, not enough sauce (BBQ ) also the edge or crust of the pizza was rock hard and more like a Italian flatbread pizza vs a rolled or developed pizza crust so what happened to the crust it was burnt and hard I could eat only a couple slices also its cut into squares rather then a trad.NY pizza I may re order but  prob will not be the sob pizza"
2,"I wrote this review in Moscow. Land of the $20 bottle of Heineken. Yep, you read that right: TWENTY DOLLARS. If I didn't need to drink that crappy beer to muster the mental stamina to keep myself composed amongst all of the crappy music and creepy men, I wouldn't have paid that. I've decided that this is where I am going to spend a lot of time if/when I finally completely give up on having any faith in humanity and human decency."
2,"I wrote this review in Mexico City. Big Trouble in Little Szechuan would be too harsh a review  and  it's not worthy  of a great wail but  I was totally underwhelmed by the food on offer and food wise it seriously is   a step above the mall food court  but   even a Pei Way on a good day  is more than a match for this evening's meal. \n\nStaff are great but  everything else is pretty weak other than the noodles which are really really good.     The spring roll, egg, hot  and sour soup and  the  kung pao all look the part but  it's all monotonous  with little variation in texture and taste.  E.g you could  make this from  Walmart  ingredients and get the same kinda shiny sauce for about the same cost     It's not going to kill you and for lunch at a reduced rate may get to 2.5 to 3 but  there's just way too many good places nearby to consider this as a repeat visit."
2,"I wrote this review in Munich. Coming from Texas, I am extremely familiar with great mexican cuisine. Tex-mex has been a longtime favorite since the day I first had unlimited red and green sauce. That being said, my expectations may have been too high coming here. \n\n- The atmosphere was great. The decor made the place really come alive (very similar to many restaurants in Charlotte). You feel like you are in Mexico.\n\n- Sauce is solid, honestly nothing to rave about but it gets the job done.\n\n- The entree's are just really bland. \n1) My cousins enchiladas came out cold\n2) My enchiladas were just bland\n3) Nobody on our table (10+ people) came close to eating their food because it just lacked flavor. \n\nHonestly, I wouldn't come back here unless someone really wanted to go here and I had no choice. The positive is the staff is friendly and the place is nice."
2,"I wrote this review in Birmingham. We bought a Groupon to this place so we decided to try it out. \n\nThe food was average at best. They should take Lagasses name off the sign because it brings with it certain expectations that are not fulfilled. \n\nWe got the mini chili cheese dogs and the hamburger. The burger was a frozen patty just thrown on the grill. Flat, burned and cookie cutter shape. We didn't even finish it. \n\nGood price on drinks though!\n\nWe will not be returning."
2,"I wrote this review in Milan. Hawaiian Philippine breakfast fusion.  Place is small service is great.  Unfortunately didn't get to try one of their specialty pancakes, just got the regular pancakes.  Had the Kahlua pork Benedict and a Santa Fe omelet.

2,I wrote this review in Kuala Lumpur. Way to create customer loyalty not taking a To Go order at 9:02pm when your kitchen closed at 9:00.

2,"I wrote this review in Dominica. I got a coupon for melons on groupons, it was only $4.00 for $10.00 worth of food. \nNow we went with a bit of an appetite, and we left still with an appetite! We order the Cuckoo for coconuts! it was good.  \nWe orderd the Ham panini, and the spicy Italian panini, they were good, but.......not much meat in the Spicy Italian panini ( it was very thin), the ham panini was a little thicker. I think there panini's are over priced for what you get! there maybe worth $2.50 to $2.99. \nSo needless to say, as soon as we left we were trying to figure out what we can now get to eat, since we just had are appetizer!"
2,"I wrote this review in Philadelphia. Enjoyed the Pimms but that's where the enjoyment stopped.  The food was bland and service was nothing spectacular. On a later date, I had high tea there.

2,"I wrote this review in Marrakech. The only thing this Jamba Juice has going for it is its location. \n\nAs a UNLV student and a lover of Jamba Juice I was super excited to find out there was a Jamba on campus.  But to my great disappointment it is terrible.\n\nThe quality of the product is mediocre. \n\nThe service is horrendous. I always seem to be helped (or lack there of) by the same guy and I truly do not understand what his problem is. If he is not being blatantly rude, he is occupying his time ignoring the myself and other customers. The other workers there seem to be completely miserable and get rather offended if you ask them a question. \n\nThe location is overall confusing. I understand that they do not have much room to work with, however, it NEVER fails that when I go in there most of the customers have a confused look on their face and no one working will take the time to direct them to where the line starts and where they should wait to get their drink."
2,"I wrote this review in Madrid. I go here sometimes with my boy because it's close to his house.There is this Jack Ass bartender that works here and he complains when you go from the outside bar to the game area and leave you glass or dishes. WTF? What type of employee would mention such a thing to a customer, that's a staff issue dude. Sorry Philly's but this rude roid monkey bartender is bringing down your establishment."
2,"I wrote this review in Phoenix. I had fonder memories of this place...I went over Halloween weekend with a bunch of friends because it was too early for any nightlife to begin. A lot of the games I wanted to play were broken (including all of the Time Crisis systems), some shooting games had messed up light guns, the air hockey tables were out of service, the list goes on. I also managed to shut off the escalator as we were leaving...but that's not a fault of Gameworks.\n\nDefinitely not as fun the second time around, but maybe that's because I'm now a little older and a little wiser. There was one saving grace though, the dinosaur hunting game. You walk around hunting various breeds of dinosaur, and you even get a rocket launcher for when the SHTF. The other not-so-bad was the driving game with 4 big-screen TVs."
2,"I wrote this review in Chicago. I was excited to try this caf\u00e9 for the first time. The food was great, BUT it was very difficult to overlook the bad service and general disorganization.  Hostess continued to seat people at dirty and unset tables. Poorly managed - the servers where pretty vocal about not knowing which tables to deliver the food to. Delivering us another table's food. After about 30 minutes we received our breakfast order. All easy fixes if the restaurant is managed properly. There are too many options in town with great food & consistent and friendly service to return to this caf\u00e9.  I do not recommend this restaurant."

Food was good and the place was packed but the service was horrible and when it came time for the bill asked for cash do they wouldn't get charged for using their card machine!!!  Then I didn't get my change, they just put it in their tip jar!! I had to ask for it and dug it out their jar in front of me!! As a foodie, great food, as a person who has been in the food and hospitality field for 10 years, bad FOH staff!!"
2,"I wrote this review in Moscow. After our recent stay at the Flamingo, I have to delete a few stars due to the new Drais outdoor nightclub.  We stay for extended periods during our Vegas trips, so we do TRY to sleep.  The constant base beats til 5 a.m. proved to be a little much.  As Diamond members we are given rooms with beautiful views.  But the trade off for the views is too irritating!  So if we chose the Flamingo again we will now have to look at the backside of the Flamingo instead of the views we have spent the money to be comped.  We still love the people and the rooms, but will be moving on to another property!  Not great planning there Cromwell!"
2,"I wrote this review in Munich. Hi Friends!\n\nI'll start with the positive. The restaurant is pretty cool and every 30 min they have an awesome thunderstorm and some of the fake animals move.\n\nOn the down side, we showed up at about 10 pm and it took over an hour to get some chicken tenders out. The food was not very good and the fries were cold. By the end of it we just wanted to leave and get a yard long margarita. \n\nI wouldn't come back.  Other Rainforest Cafes are much better, like the one at Disneyland."
2,I wrote this review in Chicago. Just a little dive bar!  This is a spot that we used to head to for a few beers at the end of the night when I lived in the neighborhood.

And my sister in laws quesadilla tasted like a quesadilla. On an up note, the salsa bar salsas were pretty good."

2,"I wrote this review in Moscow. The seafood prepared here was the least fresh I have had in Phoenix. I've had better results with the Sushi at Safeway or Trader Joes.

We paid and I looked at my receipt only to notice they charge an additional dollar for flavor! No bueno!

I guess we are used to Starbucks where they do the childrens cocoa at a lower temp... I was kind of annoyed because I'm sure its not that difficult to adjust the temp of a drink : ( I took a drink of my iced coffee and was not satisfied; it had no hazelnut taste!  Also, the coffee itself wasnt amazing, especially for the price! I've had better at McDonalds! \n\nPerhaps I just got a bad batch or something, but I wasnt pleased as much as I wanted to be!"

2,"I wrote this review in Somalia. Let me preface this review by saying that I have eaten steak in some of the finest restaurants across the land and I recognize quailty when I taste it. I prefer my steaks rare and believe a steak cooked beyond medium rare is fit for the trashcan and not the beef connoisseur.\n\nCraftsteak was a complete disappointment to me and the rest of my party of six. I ordered their highest grade steak (Wagyu grade 10) and a basic USDA Prime steak to compare the qualities. The \""Wagyu\"" was not nearly close to the Wagyu I've had in quailty and marbling and there was no way that it could have been a grade 10. I was substituted a low-quality, lean, pre-sliced, cold piece of steak that the waiter said was \""their best\"" when I complained about it. He declined to do anything about it until I truly insisted that he take the steak back and strike it from my bill. \n\nThe basic USDA steak was adequate, slightly overcooked, lacked a good exterior searing, more sinewy than should be expected for a $50 steak, but better than their supposed \""wagyu\"".\n\nI give this establishment low marks for service, and definitely low marks for the food. If you're serious about steaks, this place is more hype and trendy decor than anything else.\n\n-The Beef Baron"
2,"I wrote this review in Solomon Islands. There is a shuffle board table and pool table, but that is about all this place has going for it.  The bar staff is friendly, but this is a dive bar."
2,"I wrote this review in Paris. When you walk in, the music makes it feel like you've entered a club.  The wife spent about an hour looking at the clothes, but as for the men's selection, too tight, and too small.  Maybe it's just not my style."
2,"I wrote this review in Italy. Normally I'd give this location a 5 star rating. However, based upon my last 2 trips I'm giving them 2. I have ordered my drinks both times with no whip creme and both times they put it in anyways. The order on the cup even says, \""no whip creme.\""  They just need to start paying attention again and checking their orders. Very annoying."
2,I wrote this review in Sao Tome and Principe. This Casino is old. I really needs a remodel. It is connected to the Tram which you will have to walk to Aria *kind of a long walk* and then from Aria there is a tram to Vdara and Bellagio.
2,I wrote this review in Philadelphia. How could a seafood restaurant this mediocre can event survive?  The Sancerre 2010  would have been the saving grace if they actually made it (not).
2,"I wrote this review in Thailand. The positives:\n\nThe upstairs patio is very nice and the misting ceiling fans certainly make being outdoors in the Summer a wonderful thing. Thats the only positive unfortunately.\n\nThe negatives:\n\nOver-priced, average food, noisy, and the layout of the restaurant is ridiculous. The servers and patrons are wandering everywhere bumping into each other and getting to the bathroom is impossible as all of the restaurant staff seem to be congregating and going back to the kitchen through this narrow passage? Weird? In addition, I have never been to a restaurant that forgot to charge us for an entree, then realized it after we had closed out our bill and came back and asked us to pay for it? We did not even realize they had not charged it since our bill was so expensive to begin with?\n\nI would steer clear of this place and try the number of quality restaurants with equal quality of service in this area. Hillstone, True Food, Seasons 52, Christophers, and the list goes on. This place just can't compete."
2,"I wrote this review in Brunswick and Lüneburg. My son and I were their 1st customers of the day and the floors were nasty, with yogurt toppings under the tables that had obviously been there a while. In a place that serves food, cleanliness is everything. While the yogurt is OK, I will not be going back."
2,"I wrote this review in Helsinki. A disaster. We were told it would be an hour wait. No problem. It was a little over an hour, but still, no problem. It's 8:35 pm. No waiter until 9 pm. Nothing. Nada. Then, we tried to order a bottle of wine. Selection #1: \""Oh, we're out of.\"" Selection # 2: \""Let me see...\"" \""No, we're out of that one. My husband gamely tries another selection. They come back with \""We're out of that as well. Perhaps you might like the merlot?\"" \n\nThe food arrives, blessedly, quickly. It's mediocre Indian. We've lived in major metropolitan areas and just weren't impressed. The menu, at first glance, IS impressive. But the food was just above average.\n\nOne last note. The alley-shaped space is a noise box. Be prepared to yell your thoughts across the table. So much for a nice night out.\n\n**UPDATE** The owner offered us a dinner in response to our disappointment. We responded that, rather than that, that he ensure that no future diners experienced what we experienced. I'll give him another star for trying to remedy the situation :  )"
2,"I wrote this review in Phoenix. While staying at the South Point Casino, I decided to go to the Garden Buffet for breakfast.  To my surprise, they were already closed for breakfast at 10AM and were preparing for lunch!  Are you kidding me??  This is Las Vegas.  A good chunk of people don't even role out of bed until after 10 in Vegas!  Determined to try the Buffet, I made it back there the next morning.  Just making it in time, I got to try it out finally.  They did have a nice selection and the price for the buffet breakfast wasn't bad.  However the food was nothing memorable.  Overall, 2.5 stars."
2,I wrote this review in Cape Town. The chain is great.   Cheesecake factory has a HUGE menu and prides itself on creating an amazing environment full of space. \n\nThis location (Green Valley) is really hit-or-miss from a service perspective.   If you are looking for something to eat around this area take the safe bet and go to Elephant Bar or PF Changs.   \n\nI have had servers at this location be real rockstars and then I have had folks who realllllllly seemed like they hated to be at work.   When you are spending almost $100 on a meal for you family you expect at least marginal service.
2,"I wrote this review in Bangladesh. First time customer with my husband and kids and friends. The other patrons consisted of mostly families with children and older adults. The service was fine, the food also was decent bar fare. My problem was with the noise. The volume of the music in the restaurant was so loud we had to shout at each other to be heard. This was at 4 in the afternoon mind you, and I felt as though I was in a pick up bar at midnight. I not wimpy or old, but have no interest in fighting to be heard above Kati Perry singing at a ridiculously high decibel. Sorry to say I will not be back."
2,"I wrote this review in Birmingham. Pretty awful entrees, sushi wasn't bad and decent service.  The chicken they used in the pad Thai was so horrible I couldn't even eat it.  I finished half my plate and didn't get a to go box"
2,"I wrote this review in Jakarta. At least I have something to compare Mexican meals to as this was the worst mexican meal I've ever had. Ordered a basic dish: beef enchiladas. Tasted like salt with a side of enchiladas, rice, and beans. Not fresh, plasticky and too salty, I barely had a few bites. Even the salsa at this place was overly salty and had too much garlic. The dish aside, the server was genuinely concerned that I didn't eat anything and promised to alert the kitchen. Although we promised to go back for another try, we lied. There are way better options in the QC!"
2,"I wrote this review in Melbourne. I've tried their pasta and, more recently, their pizza, and both were very unremarkable, which has been quite disappointing considering what I had heard from others. The pizza in particular seemed bland and tiresome."
2,"I wrote this review in San Francisco. First off, best burger I've had in a long time. Yes I agree with the other reviews. The burger is great. However, expensive. We also ordered the lobster mac&  cheese which when brought to the table made us laugh because the serving was so tiny. I ordered a \""specialty\"" cocktial, I don't remember the name but it was made with ginger ale. And all 5 sips were tasty. Just wish I had more sips for the price. I would have given this restaurant only 1 star but since the burger was so good I'll give it a solid two.\n\nPsst...if you want a good burger and better choices. I recommend the SkyBox Sports Grill & lounge located in Aria. For the same price they have a much larger portion. The burger is just as good and they have the BEST Philly Cheesesteak I've ever had!"
2,"I wrote this review in Madrid. i was excited to eat here because it was highly recommended. the service was excellent and the food was pretty good. it's not the best fried chicken i've ever had but it was decent. it was a little greasy though. \n\nhowever, i went with a large group of 7 and so far 3 of us felt sick later. i haven't checked with 3 other folks from my party but, my mother in law, my husband and i all felt very nauseous  and had the runs afterwards."
2,"I wrote this review in Jakarta. I typically like Paradise Bakery. They are usually good for a quick lunch and have healthier options than most of the other \""fast\"" places in my area.\n \nThis location however, needs some work. The service as always is good, but the food leaves much to be desired. The iced tea is atrocious. I can't exactly pinpoint it, I think the container/brew filters need to be cleaned because the taste is stale. In addition to that, it is completely watered down so you can't taste the mango at all. I actually did a taste comparison to ensure I wasn't losing my mind. After lunch at Paradise Bakery I went to PV Mall and tried the tea at the location there and it was great.\n \nThe chicken salad was also huge let down. The strawberries and pineapple were not fresh, they came in heavy sweet syrup. Needless to say I was not in Paradise and will probably pass this place on my way to Wildflower going forward."
2,"I wrote this review in Paris. Ordered a 12\"" tuna sub.  The sandwich maker went out of her way to make sure that I didn't get any extra tuna, going so far as to scrape any tuna clinging on the outside of the scoop onto the storage bin side. 12\"" tuna sub with meal deal= $13.00.  Most expensive I have ever bought.  Never again at this location."
2,I wrote this review in Serbia. No no no I did not want this to happen with this place.... I've wanted so much for them always to have great reviews from me in fact after my first review I wasn't planning on another for awhile.... Let's hope it was just a bad day.... So it started okay with the appetizer suggested by John the bartender the beef kabobs great sauce.... From there downhill..... As I said in my first review this place is great cuz they dont try to be something their not so maybe I should have stayed with the fish and opted away from a rib eye steak it was horribly under cooked to raw to break down the marbling you get with a rib eye to keep it from being tuff..... But hey who orders a steak in the middle of the afternoon right.... Asked for fresh veggies and Wasabi mashed for my side's....... Ended up with french fries and mashed potatoes huh..... So quickly they remedied the situation with snap peas which I love but there was just something off about these can't put my finger on what it was........   I'm not happy about this review but in the interest of being fair it needed to be written..... I'm sorry guys but I'll be back heck maybe it was just me having a bad day....... Til next time
2,"I wrote this review in Seychelles. We ordered Shrimp and Chicken Fettucine and Dijon Salmon with salad and soup. Pea soup, salmon and regular salad was pretty good. The fettucine was so confusing, the taste was so mixed and the spice overpowered everything. It was not worth it.\n \nThey have 3 seating areas - the bar, and 2 separate large seating areas. We sat near the kitchen area, it was so dark and not very inviting. Our waitress was slow and was not paying attention at all. We arrived just past 5pm and it was not busy at all. Out table was filled with our started bread, salad, soup in addition to our main dish, she did not offered to put away anything. No iced tea refill offered, we waited forever to catch her attention to get our desert, it was so long that we just asked to wrap our desert to-go. It was not a good first experience at that branch. I hope next time will be better"
2,"I wrote this review in Kiribati. Muramoto is a huge cockblock. I took my friend here for her birthday.\n\n1st, the waitress forgot our Miso soup appetizer order. Instead of offering to comp the soups, or give us free desert, she apoligizes. Do you think I care if she's sorry? make it better, give us something free, do something special, its her birthday, uhh.. what respectable restaurant doesn't have a birthday special desert? \n\nWhen she finally did bring us a Miso soup, it was horribly salty.  I like salt, but this was outrageously salty.  Maybe if I had 18 Sapporo's to wash it down it would have been good.\n\nThe Sushi rolls didn't seem fresh, and they gave me and my friend stomach aches.  Not a good experience. \n\n1 star because I know the owners of this place are legit, its got nice atmosphere, and with a decent selection of Sake."
2,"I wrote this review in Bangkok. Came here for one night on business. The room is in bad need of being updated. It looks like an 80's bachelor pad. Complete with a red leather armless chair to a cheaply converted dresser into an entertainment center. It also has way to many mirrors, a bathroom counter that is to small for a hair brush, and no coffee maker. I also got a towel with a 6\"" hole in it. If this is remodeled and grander, don't expect MGM to survive much longer. I won't be back.\n\nPs...there is a hidden $25 fee that you won't see any where other than the fine print of your confirmation email."
2,"I wrote this review in Japan. I was not the one who ate here, i opted to go to Jimmy Johns next door, and according to my brother who did eat here, was the right choice. There were two orders in front of him which were already placed and it took them 10 minutes to then take his order of a Philly Cheese Steak, Onion Rings and a drink. By this time i had gone to Jimmy Johns, got my order, and walked over to CVS to pick something up, and walked back to Corleones to get my brother. We waited a few minutes and then his order finally came. I asked what his total was, almost $16!! They charged extra for Onions and Mushrooms (or peppers, can't remember) $1.49 each! These come standard on Philly cheese steaks and we know this because we lived in Philadelphia for 4 years with many real cheese steaks had that were WAY better and 2/3 the price!! My brother said it tasted good, but not for that price and he would have rather gone to Duck & Decanter, Wineburger (both down the road) or even Postinos just for some Bruschetta. If i were him i would rather just go up the road to the Rokerji's reverse Happy hour starting at 9 and get a glass of wine ($5), and their tip steak + Brei bruschetta bites ($5)."
2,"I wrote this review in Estonia. Service was slow. Ordered a nonfat chai latte with shot of espresso, not too complicated. The chai was bitter due to the herbs not being strained out which also made it gritty- a very unpleasant texture in a drink. The only pluses about this place is the decor & patio. Didn't try any food but it looked good."
2,"I wrote this review in Gambia. We tried this the other night and had high hopes since we live very close by.  First, the beer selection is great.  They still didn't have anything on draft but a good bottle selection.  By good I don't mean just big with all the usual suspects but some very well thought out items.  I had a Three Philosophers and my wife had a cider.  \n\nService was SLOW...real slow.  It was almost 10 minutes to get our drink order in.  They were reasonably busy but not too busy.  The food was OK.  Not bad.  Not great.  I could tell my vegetables were frozen, not fresh.  I had to ask for my salad after my meal had already come.  Service was slow through the meal...ask for ketchup...wait until the waiter saw us and remembered...etc.\n\nWe plan to give them some more time and go back and I'll revise my review then.  But for now it was a solid 2 star."
2,"I wrote this review in Kuala Lumpur. I took my family on  Friday.  It was busy but we got table. It took a while to get drinks ordered and once the sushi came, the rolls were full of rice and not enough fish. We've eaten at most better known sushi restaurants in the Valley and we were hoping that this would be a new place we could frequent. Unfortunately, the service and the food was mediocre at best."
2,"I wrote this review in Melbourne. Others have said great service.   Well, our experience was not so good.   2 hours 45 minutes later for an anniversary dinner.   First, seated quickly - but the waiter disappeared and came back with apologies.  Okay - having a good time.   Then the food - mushy crab cakes - better use lemon because the tartar sauce overwhelms the crab cake; calamari - breading crunchy but a bit much - same tartar sauce so lots of lemon is better.  Ribeye - for $60 not close to Capital Grille or even the old standby of Durants.   The manager was apologetic but it took us 10 minutes to get the bill - by that time - the restaurant was pretty empty.   \n\nNot even a close chance we will return after this experience"
2,"I wrote this review in New York City. Order consisted of queso, guacamole and assorted tacos. In brief lacking in flavor. The guacamole was not flavorful at all. Slow, inattentive service. Many better choices out there for mexican. Will not be back."
2,"I wrote this review in Sweden. Always check your to-go order, a rule should have remembered as I found that Haweli does not include steamed rice with its vegetable dishes.  When I called to ask if it was typical everything is a la carte.  Karaikudui which is just down the road from Haweli does include steamed rice and the cost is the same and as good if not better. And no unpleasant surprises when I open the to-go bag."
2,"I wrote this review in Philadelphia. Big pieces of sashimi, but not very much flavor.  Kirin ichiban is on tap, but its $7 per beer!  not great but it is nice to have a sushi bar in the airport."
2,"I wrote this review in Mexico City. Nick's has been a pretty popular gathering place for a group of my friends. I have had their pizzas, calzones,  and chicken parmesan. Those dishes have been pretty good. \n\nLast night I wanted to try something new, so I tried the baked ziti with meatballs. I don't recommend it. The issue was that it was overcooked. The ziti was rubbery and the dish was dry. The ends of the ziti were hard and crunchy. The best thing about the dish was the meatballs. \n\nEven though my food was not up to par, the service was exceptionally good."
2,"I wrote this review in Boston. I want to like this place, I really do.  I can't get over 3 things:  1)  Their bbq is just OK.  Sauces are good (at least 4 stars), but the meat, by itself, just isn't that great.  Their sides are just OK, too.  Mashed sweet potatoes, potato salad, barbequed pinto beans, etc.....  just average.  Not really much flavor to anything I've ever had there (roughly 4-5 experiences).  Even their sweet tea is just OK - not bad, but not memorable in any way.  2)  Their prices are much higher than their competition.  If I'm going to pay this much, I want to eat Midwood Smokehouse or Mac's.  3)  It drives me nuts when restaurants weigh out portion sizes.  Especially BBQ joints.  Feels like I'm in a Subway.  I understand it's part of their business model to control portion sizes, but c'mon man!?!?!\n\nService is great.  The guys behind the counter are always helpful, fast, and fun to engage in conversation, but the food is average at best."
2,"I wrote this review in Maldives. This is a nice little coffee shop.  I really like that they have almond milk, not many place do.  The lattes were ok, very average.  Cute place, very nice people working there, great environment."
2,"I wrote this review in Helsinki. Just like the rating. Meh.\nBaristas look like they are bored out of their minds.\nMy friend wanted to inquire about their free Tall Hazelnut macchiato, and boy were they sour about it. They decide to honor the promotion, like they should, and gave my friend her free drink. I bought a venti sized, and was given what? Caramel macchiato.\nDisappointed for sure, and I won't be coming back, mainly cuz I live in Southern California."
2,"I wrote this review in Malawi. Decided to try something, 'new', to me at least. I've passed by this spot on multiple occassions and it seems to have a steady flow of foot traffic, so I took the commitment of actually walking in and checking out their menu selection. \n\nThe pricing is a bit odd, for the most part all their sandwiches are priced the same, but they had about 20+ sandwiches listed with 2 prices- based on size. I decided to keep it simple and got the pastrami with mustard and pickles. All their deli meats are Boars Head, which Is a pretty good brand overall. The sandwich was good but I was a lil disappointed that it wasn't hot, more less warm. They give you a small bag of Wise chips with the sandwich which are alright but not the greatest. After spending $9 on the sandwich and a drink I felt a lil cheated, don't think I got my moneys worth but it wasn't a bad sandwich."
2,I wrote this review in Ecuador. It looks better than it tastes.  No amazing combination that makes me say I have to go back there for that burger. The onion rings were good that was the only item that was good. Frozen burger patty. Nothing special. Costs as much as a burger at Hillstone but no where near the quality. The restaurant is also very dirty. It serves the hangover late night crowd who does not notice the dirt. Our thoughts.
2,"I wrote this review in Beijing. This grill wasn't really for me. I went with other people who liked loud places like this, but it's not really my style. The food wasn't too bad, but the service was pretty poor. It kept taking a long time for our waiter to come back, although they were kind of busy. Still, I probably wouldn't return here."
2,"I wrote this review in Lima. What the hell? Why do people say the drinks are strong? We got shots, yes SHOTS of vodka and they were watered-down (plus overpriced). I've definitely had better.\n\nPlus, the promoter who wanted us to come to the club said there was an open bar. Lies! I don't like people who lie! Or their nightclubs\n\nOh, and don't expect the lounge to play Beatles music. The demographic here is all over the place - 20-30yo's plus 50+ (based upon defining characteristics such as hair color and attire). I think most people come here after the Cirque show, as there are people standing outside the show passing out free entrance passes.\n\nBathrooms also use a shared sink that's activated with your foot. Are we at a baseball stadium?"
2,"I wrote this review in Fairfax. This is based on our one night of fun here at the NYNY. Service was polite but a bit slow at the front desk when checking in, but whatever, we were in Vegas!\n\nInstructions to the 'correct' elevator were incorrect, leading us on a wild goose chase to find the right one. The entire time, there was no one working there who was roaming the corridors for us to ask. When we finally found it and got up to the 7th floor (2nd and 3rd night of EDC), the ENTIRE path from elevator to our room (deep on the right side because the rest of the floor was booked with EDC goers) REEKED of vomit, weed, and alcohol. On top of that, the smell was strongest at 3 locations throughout the hall, one of which was near our doors. When we tried to enter the room with our keycards, our rooms could not/would not open, and we were forced to wait outside in the putrid smelling air for service to get to us. We requested to switch floors or rooms in the hopes there would be one without the smell, but were informed we would be charged to upgrade - where's the customer love?! The rooms themselves were alright - just enough to get by.\n\nAll in all, it might've just been because of EDC that these events unfolded but when I come back to Vegas in the future, I'll be avoiding NYNY - maybe the Aria or somewhere more baller/customer friendly?"
2,"I wrote this review in San Francisco. As a long time Tempe resident and Kiwanis cage users for many years, I have to say that the Parks and Recs dept. should be ashamed of themselves--for the condition of their machines.   Although they've raised the cage fees, the quality and condition of the pitching machine are poor at best!   I was there on September 8th, and there was only one softball machine working.  All others either weren't pitching or pitching off target.  I've complained to the staff there, but it didn't do much good.  I also wrote an email to the Parks and Recs department, but received no acknowledgement or reply."
2,"I wrote this review in Copenhagen. Pros:\n1. Ice cold Newcastle at the bar\n2. Scotch Egg was very tasty\n3. Fries were super salty and hot\n4. Friendly bartender with a heavy hand on the alcohol :)\n5. Meat pie sampler was top notch per my gal\n\n\nCons:\n1. Dusty front of the restaurant (the black steel window frames) right next to diners eating at the \""patio\""\n2. Had a rare burger but the meat had zero seasoning and the bun was meh...wilted lettuce leaf, bland experience\n3. Prices were through the roof (we spent the same for lunch here as we did for  dinner at Gordon Ramsay's Paris restaurant)\n4. Seating was designed with high back chairs that were way too low for the table - felt like we were eating at the kid's table\n5. Manager type guys in suits that looked like they were in the Mafia - never smiled or spoke to the diners."
2,"I wrote this review in Lesotho. Came here with some friends for drinks the other night.  Every single cocktail we got was fantastic and we ordered 1 each from the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd course in that order. We had the Rum Punch, Apple 'onia, and Hot buttered rum. Lucas, our waiter, was very prompt and recommended some darn good drinks.\n\nNow for the not-so-good.  And for this section I rename the place Upper Bread Crust Rum Lounge. Allow me to explain. Our group of 7 was very diverse and we found the gentleman, who showed us to our seats, to be very judgemental.  He accused one of us of smelling \""funny\"" and almost did not let us in despite a reservation! We were allowed in and were seated in the back cigar lounge. My wife and I visit a local Phoenix restaurant every weekend and never have we experienced this kind of treatment. Finally, our seating location in the back also seemed to be the main travel path for the staff taking out trash and bringing in ingredients.  We felt like we were in their way as we socialized, interrupted several times with rude \""Excuse me's\"". \n\nWe won't be going back simply due to judgemental and rude staff."
2,"I wrote this review in Guangzhou. Unfortunately this place is a total bummer. Having grown up in Southern Californina, trips to Baja and Hussongs was part of growing up. When we saw a Hussongs in LV we were so excited that we planned our Happy Hour around it. Ugh, what a mistake. Being a lover of street tacos we ordered 12 for the table and some others apps and entrees. The $3 tacos were borderline edible. Quesadilla and Flautas were good but come on, not hard to mess those up. Tacos sucked and took forever to get our happy hour beers. Definitely would not recommend Hussongs."
2,I wrote this review in Germany. Very nice consistent meal.  We ate breakfast as we usually do when we come to Denny's.  It's a good place to bring the family and get a good meal at a reasonable price.  I had to lower a star for the slow service due to lack of staffing.
3,I wrote this review in Munich. I had the curry chicken. It wasn't as spicy as I would have expected and the portion was a little small. Great environment.
3,"I wrote this review in Pakistan. Eh. \n\nThat's what comes to my mind when I think about this place.\nI came with my dog and just opened the door to ask how I could enter the patio with my dog, as I couldn't see any access to the patio from outside. \nAs soon as I opened the door the hostess freaked and said \""No, No you can't bring a dog in here!\""\n....Lady, I didn't step foot inside and my dog is sitting calmly next to me.\nSo we proceeded to the patio and had our meal, which was pretty tasty. \nThe servers were clearly flustered dealing with a lot of tables at once so we didn't expect attentive service. \nAll in all, food was great, service was lacking, so I'm on the border about coming again."
3,"I wrote this review in Birmingham. I give it three stars because their coffee was very indifferent to me and I think I should try their coffee twice before judging it. I will say the hours are bad for a coffee house, because they're only open until 7. I will definitely say there are better coffee places to go to then this."
3,"I wrote this review in Guangzhou. Gord and I drove to St. Jacobs a couple weeks ago.\n\nIt was lunchtime so we went to Benjamin's Restaurant & Inn.\n\nNestled in the heart of the Village of St. Jacobs, Benjamin's Restaurant & Inn offers its guests the charm of a vintage inn with modern conveniences for your comfort. For 150 years, the building which houses Benjamin's has accommodated overnight guests. Built in 1852 by a local Mennonite named Joseph Eby, the original \""Farmer's Inn\"" was a stage coach stop en route from Berlin (Kitchener) to Elmira and all other points north.\n\nI had a hamburger and fries.  The burger was good ... the fries so-so so I just had a few.\n\nGord ordered the wild boar meatloaf. He had asked to substitute the sweet potatoes fries (he's not a fan) for potato salad and the server ended up bringing both.  He said the meatloaf was good.\n\nThe restaurant is quaint and old fashioned ... there was mostly an older clientele when we were there."
3,"I wrote this review in Ireland. Well Phoenix, we've had our ups and downs. I spent a good 7 years with you, but I can't say I'll be back. I like your sister city of Himeji, Japan a lot better so far. Sure, it completely lacks Mexican food, it's crazy humid and I can only communicate on the level of a cave-dwelling toddler, but it has so many more cultural charms than Phoenix could ever possibly offer. That's what always bummed me out about you, Phoenix, you seemed to lack the type of definitive character that other cities often have. Instead, you always struck me as a confused mini-L.A. But you had some great residents, and I miss them. Maybe I'll be back if you improve your public transportation, but until then...sayonara!"
3,I wrote this review in Palau. We ate here twice while at the casino. The food was okay a lot better than you would expect in a casino. The onion straws were very good
3,"I wrote this review in Mali. My friend and I showed up here pretty late after being out and about in Vegas.  I was exhausted, but starving, so we showed up here for some late night eating.  Our service was a little slow (maybe the servers were as tired as I was), but our meal was pretty good.  Naturally because this is Vegas and the Aria, the place was slightly overpriced, but it was still good nonetheless."
3,"I wrote this review in Peru. Food was really good, as expected, but be ready to spend quite a bit. You really are paying a price premium for the reputation of the place. \nAlso, my girlfriend told me there was alcool served, so I was really motivated to spend a good portion of the night there, but they really offered only 5-6 beer types and all in bottles.\n\nI would recommend it if you are in the area, but I would not recommend you to travel a medium to long distance to go there."
3,"I wrote this review in Munich. Liked this place. Went on a Sunday so the guy didn't make much because he said their slow on Sundays. We tried a little bit of everything and liked it. I would have given more stars but the service was bad, maybe the guy was in a bad mood, not sure. Make sure you have somewhere to eat after you buy the poke unless you want to eat outside in the Vegas heat! No indoor seating. Would recommend you come here to pick up poke because overall the food was good."
3,"I wrote this review in Milan. Always good. Pass on the pasta dish. Disappointing. \n\nAlso they make a Pizzookie that is supposed to be half cooked and it was not even 20% cooked. \n\nI mentioned it to our waiter (worst one we ever had there. Thomas I think) and he said \""it's supposed to be like that\"" then walked away! Awesome customer service.\n\nRating is down from a 4 or 5 due to service. Maybe it will be better if we go back again."
3,"I wrote this review in Hanoi. Great location overlooking the pool and the food was good!  A little pricey for how basic the meals were, but nothing above the norm for the M.Bay."
3,"I wrote this review in Qatar. 1. You need to know that this is a few miles from the main attractions of the strip.\n2. The rooms are sub par and outdated but clean.\n3. This is a hotel for an older crowd.\nI liked it. It was charming and old school. Not packed, not full of deuches or duechettes. It was like a little time capsule, I enjoyed it for what it was. My only complaint was the front desk check in/check out. Unorganized, similar to the dmv. The self check in/out machine broke. So, I would suggest leaving your room early for checkout (because you will wait in a long line). It took me about 15-20 minutes to check out. Staff was helpful. Have patience with hospitality workers! I saw a lot of people being rude to the servers and to the concierges."
3,"I wrote this review in Munich. Good food, nice atmosphere. A little pricey for the food (lunch), but good. Service was good, not too crowded. Would come back!"
3,"I wrote this review in Shanghai. This is quite an inconspicuous wee bar at the bottom of Howe Street, but it's pretty popular with New Town and Stockbridge locals, and actually surprisingly larger than it looks when you get inside. \n\nThe interior of The Standard is smart and plushly furnished, so it's a pretty comfortable place to sit and have a beer, or a nice Sauvignon, or whatever your poison may be. The bar has a good feel about it, so you can sit for quite a while and banter away without actually feeling you're really in a bar environment (apart from the fact you're glugging down alcohol). \n\nThe menu is decent too and inexpensive, so if you're in the mood for proper pub food, like a big helping of burger and chips, or a full breakfast to soak up the hangover, The Standard is a good call. I am automatically biased against anywhere that blares out sport at high volume levels, but I know half the world love watching a good sports match/game on decent screens, so I would recommend The Standard for such activities, and it gets very, very busy around rugby match season."
3,"I wrote this review in Brazil. Came here during the Christmas week, so there was a premium price on the buffet during lunchtime, about $30-something per person. The regular line up to get in was PACKED, so if it wasn't for the line pass we had, it would've been bye bye to the buffet.\n\nBeen here before last year and it seems the quality has gone down. The food was okay, but there really wasn't anything to write home about. They have your standard stuff that can be found in other buffets like shrimps, prime rib, roasted chicken, etc etc. They also have the king crab legs which seem to be the main attraction as I saw many people just having piles and piles of them on their plates. I didn't try the king crab legs as I'm not fond of them in general. I found many of the food to be kinda dry and so I have to put a lot of sauce on them to taste better.\n\nThe best part I found was the dessert. They have different kinds of dessert from creme brulee to creampuffs to different flavors of ice cream, as well as brownies, banana fosters, and cookies. I tried the creme brulee and cookies and they're pretty good. Better than the main stuff honestly.\n\nPop and juice are included in the price, so try to take advantage of that.\n\nNot worth the $30-something for lunch, but ok for the regular $20-something."
3,"I wrote this review in Sweden. Based on the reviews I was disappointed with my entre...chicken pasta (linguini, basil and cream sauce). Too heavy and thick with an excess of heavy cream. Service however was 5 star so I'd give it another try. Might just have been an off night. Glad they had one of my favorite brews...Dos Equis amber!"
3,I wrote this review in Rome. I was expecting great things from this sandwich shop but was disappointed to find basically a glorified lunch counter. The ingredients just didn't seem to be very high quality. The steak melt didn't have enough steak in it. The sandos sound good but the execution didn't seem to be there. For the inflated price tag I want a great sandwich. This wasn't.
3,"I wrote this review in Beijing. Falafel was like eating sand.  Yes, real sand.  The outside was overly crispy and it reminded me of beach experiences when sand got in my mouth.\n\nFalafel plate comes with rice, salad, and pita.... yet no hummus or anything substantial to dip the pita into.  Tahini?  No, not that whole pita into a little plastic ramekin of tahini.  Dry, dry, dry and no relief to be found.  \n\nPlease, fellow yelper, stick with the falafel sandwich or other value meal.  No need for dry mouth syndrome at a greek pita place.\n\nAlso it's overpriced.  Falafel plate with soda is just under $12.  If you order hummus to remedy the dry mouth issue then you're bumping up to $16-17 for ONE person."
3,"I wrote this review in Cayman Islands . Have eaten here twice. Both times I was a little...how do I say it...underwhelmed.  Fish just not quite as fresh as it I've found it at other places. Rolls not quite as tight, or interesting as other places I go to regularly....like Sakana.  \r\n\r\nIn this part of town there aren't many places to get sushi, so it's convenient but not where I'd bring a date.  More of a...I need a quick sushi fix kind of place."
3,"I wrote this review in Cairo. I stay here a lot because of the price, and the location is fairly central. Whatever you do, do NOT stay in the cheapest rooms, the \""courtyard\"" rooms. They are in the old motel building and are TERRIBLE and very unsafe. Upgrade to a tower room. \n\nThey have gone through multiple owners and the ups and downs associated with that. There is a daily resort fee, which covers the crappy wifi. Parking is free and plentiful. There used to be a free shuttle to the strip but that appears to be gone, along with the free airport shuttle. Too bad, they were nice perks, and made the off-strip location more usable. \n\nThe rooms vary drastically. Sometimes they are nice and clean, others are beat. It's kind of a crapshoot."
3,"I wrote this review in Phoenix. My friends and I decided to try out the new Donatos location at Gateway Village. We got pizza to go and took it home for a VP debate watch party. I generally have low expectations for all pizza in Charlotte, but I was pleasantly surprised by Donatos. We all agreed the sauce had really good flavor, and the crust and pepperoni were crispy. \n\nI was just checking out the Donatos web site and noticed that you can order online for pickup or delivery. That convenience is a big plus, and I wish more places had online ordering."
3,"I wrote this review in St. Petersburg. Great little restaurant not too far from South Mountain. They have everything from traditional fare (eggs and toast) to some fancy pants euro crepes! I just had two eggs over easy with a dry english muffin and their potatoes. I liked that their eggs and potatoes weren't all greasy, and the potatoes had spinach (I think) in them, which was a neat little twist. \nIf in the area it's a good place to go (but probably not worth driving out of your way)"
3,I wrote this review in San Jose. A bit pricey. Portions are rather small but the food is good. The decor is beautiful. The ahi tuna is my favorite. Unfortunately I never had the opportunity to have a cocktail here. :-(
3,"I wrote this review in Detroit. So I don't normally expect a lot when eating at IHOP, but this one isn't that bad! And it's actually quite a busy location. I made the mistake of going here to eat during spring training season - it was insanely packed and we waited quite a while to be seated. However, once we were at our table the service was good and so was the food. This IHOP is open 24 hours, which may be good to know in case I get a midnight pancake craving."
3,"I wrote this review in Las Vegas. A truly vintage Vegas show featuring showgirls and is the last one left and now Cirque Soleil is the new kind of show girl but with over the top circus acts and advanced stage productions. I came to watch this show with family since they always receive 2 for 1 Jubiliee tickets through Total Rewards and since I never seen a showgirl show I decided to give it try. I'm more of a Zumanity, Love show type person.\n\nThe showroom is still in it's 70's style and not modern like the other theaters. The show was very elaborate and fun to watch and had some boring scenes that I couldn't understand what it suppose to mean such as the gorrilla scene and caveman scene was so cheesy. I saw some people walking out and I wish I had followed them but family first Ehh? =)\n\nTowards the end, lots of singing and dancing and also topless throughout the show. ;)\n\nWould I see this show again? \n\nNo."
3,I wrote this review in Paraguay. The golf course itself was maintained well. The staff here are very courteous and friendly. The ponds are horrendous with buildup and flying bugs. The smell from several was very gross.
3,"I wrote this review in Egypt. Food was decent- nothing that blew us away. Rice on the sushi seemed soggy.  Service was so-so. We felt rushed, timing of food was bad, and staff wasn't as knowledgable on the menu as I would expect for a place that has a lot of hype in this area."
3,I wrote this review in Burkina Faso (Upper Volta). This was my second attempt at Korean food and my first attempt beyond Korean BBQ and I have to say I really enjoyed it. This place may not be the best but it was solid and the service was good and fast. We had noodles and sweet and sour pork. I have to say I enjoyed the noodles quite a bit more than the pork dish but I'm excited to give Korean food another try soon.
3,"I wrote this review in Amsterdam. A favorite casual dining place with great food and great service. Came as you are and enjoy anything from Sushi to General Sao Chicken. Beef and broccoli to Asian noodles it's all great. Beer, wine and cocktails as well."
3,"I wrote this review in Nepal. This place was fine, but that's all we were expecting. It's their 24 hour, we have it all cafe. It's kinda greasy spoon, but you have plenty of options on the menu for things that won't clog your arteries. \n\nWe enjoyed the cobb salad (dressing on the side, folks!) and teriyaki bowl when we got in late Friday. Then on Saturday we split a spanish frittata with egg whites..the coffee was decent. \n\nSeriously, it's what you'd expect. Not fine dining and not a Denny's either!"
3,"I wrote this review in Vanuatu. As I walked in on a dreary and rainy Thursday afternoon, my spirits were immediately uplifted as the soft music drifted over me.  I was wondering who was the artist when I turned and saw that he was right there sitting on a stage playing and singing with his guitar.  How great is that?!\n\nAh, but we are here for the food--definitely a contender against any other sub place in Madison.  Great, fresh & friendly service.  I really like the oil they have for some of their sandwiches.  And I love, love their hot peppers...I bought a whole bottle.  \n\nA good place to stop for breakfast/lunch/dinner--and I would encourage you to dine in--anytime you are on State Street.  Not only is it a great place for food (yes breakfast too) but it's an even better place to spend time with good company."
3,"I wrote this review in Jamaica. I had a very expensive margarita here. I just wanted the experience of walking down the street with a drink, LOL. So I chose a $21 margarita. It was good, but not the best I've had. I finished about 3/4 of it, then tossed it after it melted. Oh well. My husband had a draft Dos Equis--this was the only draft the bar had!  We were a little surprised, but he was fine with it. It looked like a nice little place to get something to eat and drink."
3,"I wrote this review in Hamburg. Pricelined for 70$/night for this neighborhood we were stoked- but the reviews worried us...\nEspecially since we were traveling with older parents who maybe were not going to be comfortable if it was shabby or unsafe.\nIt was neither. It was clean, comfortable, well staffed and in a GREAT location.\nWe spent 3 days there enjoying the amenities and would go back.\n\nGranted- we would NOT have been stoked if we were paying 125$/night. It is more of a 2 star than a three star hotel. However:\nThe linens were decent.\nThe water was Very hot and lots of it.\nThere was a functioning ice machine.\nThe whole thing was accessible by tunnels to the Metro and shopping.\nWe found the downstairs waiting area very useful.\n\nCons:\nThe door locks were problematic. That was Very Uncool.\nThey fixed it. Ok. there."
3,"I wrote this review in Cyprus. The food is just as great as the Scottsdale location, but the service here sucks! They are so slow it drives me insane waiting to get my food even when its not busy.  Even just ordering a coffee took 10 minutes. 10 minutes!! Would have been faster just to drive up to the Scottsdale location."
3,"I wrote this review in Sweden. It was good, much less syrup would have made it great and not having to wait 30 minutes after we ordered it to finally eat it would have been a huge plus!!!"
3,"I wrote this review in Warsaw. Interesting food creations, using lobster in sandwiches, salad, fried food, and ice cream!  However, the foods in fact tasted just A-OK and prices were sorta steep.  $23 for a 6\"" lobster roll was pricey, I think.  The lobster salad came with lots of small chunks of lobster meat and was good for the price.  Lobster bisque was just standard.  Lobster-n-chips was cool though! Beer-battered and fried lobster huh? Yummmmm~  Last but not least, the lobster ice cream that sounded out of the ordinary was actually vanilla ice cream with itsy-bitsy lobster meat.  The ice cream tasted alright but was worth a try!  Just ask for a free sample before you buy, so as to make sure that you would like some savory ice cream that tastes like seafood. *wink*"

3,I wrote this review in Marrakech. This place is probably great for a lot of people but I didn't care for it. I had the enchilada omelet and it had nasty American processed cheese on it I guess that's what they use for omelets and that probably doesn't bother most people but It makes me gag.. Ew on the menu it says jack cheese but it should add that it's processed. Anyways enough of the cheese rant. The service was good and the coffee cake was really good.
3,"I wrote this review in Saudi Arabia. We like to come to Culver's when we all can't decide on what to eat - they, actually have a pretty wide selection! We have tried hamburgers, grilled cheese, cheese curds, ice cream, fried chicken, and chicken strips (regular and buffalo). This food is not going to win any awards for its exemplary taste but it is a solid choice when you just want something fast. The fried chicken is surprisingly good - but be prepared to wait if you order it. The cheese curds are, hands down, our family fave. None of us really care for the ice cream here and so we typically skip that. \n\nThe interior of the restaurant is nice and clean. It is a kid friendly set up which is another reason we come here."
3,"I wrote this review in Moscow. This is a very average to above average sushi restaurant.  The bar is nice, seating is limited (like most sushi places).  The sushi is good, but completely unremarkable.  On par with Ra, but not in the same league as Sakana.  I agonized over a fourth star, but it was just so average."
3,"I wrote this review in Belize. Good place to dine while in the Phoenix airport. The service is friendly, the atmosphere is nice, and the food is good. I ordered the grilled chicken stuffed pita with lettuce, tomato, hummus, and a vinaigrette. There are plugins too. Can't beat that."

3,"I wrote this review in Sierra Leone. Great value in vegas, $109 per night on a weekend compared to $400 for a cramped little room on the strip.  Throw in the free breakfast and free drinks in the evening and you have yourself a great value.\n\nThe hotel has been upgraded.  The rooms are nice enough.  The lobby atrium is a bit dated and the faux plants are a bit dusty.\n\nThere were some service issues.  We ordered food to go at the restaurant.  The place was empty and we were quoted 20 minutes to get our food.  In the end, it took 40.\n\nCheck in took forever, as did many interactions with the front desk.  The guys working the desk had to always stop and answer phones which was annoying.  But the one guy working the desk called me \""cute.\""  Not sure if I should be flattered or horrified.\n\nThere was never a consistent answer on the shuttle to the strip.  We were told they would take us anywhere (and they did) and pick us up.  But when I called for pickup, they said they only pick up and drop off at Planet Hollywood.  In the end, we had to use taxis a lot which ran $10 a trip to the strip.\n\nAll things considered, I like the other Embassy Suites on Paradise just a touch better and I have stayed there many times.  But they were $50 a night more when I booked so we stayed here."
3,I wrote this review in Sudan. I am not the biggest fan of fast food ever. But I really like Five Guys and this location is superb! \n\nThey have really yummy fries and they give you so many! Like your bag overflows with the greasy buggers. Say what? Yeah they are really greasy. But good!\n\nThe burgers are really quite the bang for your buck too! Not the best burgers in the world but it is fast food not gourmet burgers. Be considerate for what you are eating and enjoy it for what it is. \n\nThe pop machines are radical. You can pretty much have flavoured any beverage you like. \n\nThe staff here is really friendly and that is a plus anywhere you go!
3,"I wrote this review in Bogotá. I LOVE this place and if I had a million hours to waste I would walk my lazy self across campus and pick up some sweet and sour chicken and have a free Styrofoam cup of green tea every day of my life. Unfortunately they do not deliver and I don't even think they know how to use a phone. The last time I was there the man was so busy he picked up the phone and put them on hold and never picked it back up. I found it funny, but I'm sure that customer did not. \nAnd, you know, if they opt out of delivery they should really clean the place up a bit. I get worried what the kitchen looks like and have peeked back there a few times to see complete chaos (mostly because there's 8 or 9 women cooking for too many customers to handle). \nI love the food, but this place is great to go to maybe a few times per semester. It's just too crowded for my liking."
3,"I wrote this review in Hamburg. Came here looking for passport service. This location does NOT do passport service. They DO have a list of branches around the valley that does (Jones near Flamingo or Rainbow near Spring Mountain are the two close ones that DO have passport service)\n\nCame here on a Tuesday afternoon, a little before 1. Pretty packed. Lots of people. I believe they had 2-3 different lanes open at the same time but still pretty backed up. \n\nOnly ONE entrance/exit for the branch. I accidentally missed the entrance and turned into the street east of the location to do a U-turn. Oops? \n\nBranch good for those who live in the SW side for their mailing purposes. Has a decent amount of PO boxes too !"
3,"I wrote this review in Cape Town. We started with Waffle Fry Nachos these feature waffle fries doused in gooey white cheddar and sloppy joe, and then it's topped with salsa and jalapenos. It was delicious, however, next time I'd likely ask the kitchen to hold the sloppy joe. I wouldn't miss the meat.\n\nI had the Crispy Four Cheese Burger. The cheese is fried crisp onto the patty producing a cheesy concoction that is crisp and creamy. Aside from the brioche bun, I thought it was tasty and well seasoned. I found the bun to be too much bread for the burger making it too dry. The onion roll would've been a better choice. That's what my husband selected for his BYOB, beef patty with pepper jack cheese, jalapenos and caramelized onions all situated on the onion roll. It was well prepared, flavorful and juicy.\n\nService was pretty slow, but the place had only been open a week on our visit. Most places need a little time to get the kinks worked out. I'd hope service improves with time."
3,"I wrote this review in Boston. I want so much to love the Daily Dose.  It is in the perfect location for me to make it my go-to spot for weekend brunches.  But I just can't get 100% behind it.  Every time I'm there, I search the extensive menu over and over again for something that jumps out at me.  But every time, I find myself at a loss and just ordering an omelette or french toast or something equally banal.  I'll keep searching, but with every trip my hope dwindles."
3,"I wrote this review in Denver. For a quick wash that is cheap not bad at all.  They have free vacuums too.  You stay in your vehicle  during the wash and there is a guy at the end who wipes down your car.  They do a good job.  This is the perfect place to take the car after it gets caught in a monsoon rain.  They don't offer the full detail and they don't do the inside.  They also don't give you a little towel anymore to wipe the inside.  But like I said, it is perfect for a quick wash to tide you over for awhile."
3,"I wrote this review in Madagascar. While at McCarren Airport in Las Vegas waiting for our flight, we needed a quick bite. Since flights don't serve meals any more...\n\nI ordered their version of a club sandwich. My only complaint was the soft bun they served it on. The turkey breast was fresh, the bacon crisp, there was fresh avocado, lettuce and tomato. It was quite large and I could only eat about 1/2 of it, so we took the rest home with us.\n\nRuby's is decorated like an old 1950s diner. It's cute. The service is not so good, they aren't very friendly and are terse, but I chalk that up to this being in airport more than anything else. Otherwise, it was okay."
3,"I wrote this review in Thailand. Not having had any Asian Buffet for a long two days, I whipped in here for lunch today.  Welcome to the place Yelp calls \""E-Z Buffet\"", but the owners call, alternatively, \""EZ Buffet\"", \""EZ Chinese Buffet\"", & \""Easy Buffet\"" depending upon which sign or printed matter of theirs you are viewing!  In any event, here goes:\n\nThis medium-large place was offering up 75 main food items today, featuring such strictly Chinese dishes as Clam Chowder, beef roast, Stuffed Bell Peppers, Calzone, pizza, & pink marshmallows!  Who knew???     :-)\n\nOk, this somewhat stylish, comfortable place with a friendly staff was also serving many of the usual Chinese treats including Sushi (Whoops, that's Japanese!), Kim Chee (Whoops, that's Korean!), Egg Foo Young (there!  ... & made the real way), & lots of what we usually see including fried chicken, boneless spare ribs, stuffed mushrooms, more chicken fixed all different ways, fish, shrimp, & so on, ending up with a good selection of desserts including tasty, REAL ice cream.\n\nIt's a high 3 Stars for this nice restaurant where the Lunch Buffet is $6.75/$6.08 Sr. on Monday through Saturday, $8.75/$7.88 Sunday, & they also offer a regular menu.     :-)"
3,"I wrote this review in Libya. The cigaret smell is too strong for this hotel. It's almost every where you go, even on the non smoking floor. There is no feeling of being welcomed the whole time I stayed there, every impersonal. Bathroom is clean and modern. That cannot be said for their beds and decor. It's no different than a 50 or 80 bucks a night room. The beds are not conformable and the TV is hung to the side.  No water bottles in the room. I'm not expecting free water bottles, willing to pay for them out of convenience but that's not an option. For the price, water should be included! Stay somewhere and come in and walk around if you just want to check out the scenes and Effel tower. There's no need to pay high price for medium priced room. You have to pay $25/day to use their gym."
3,"I wrote this review in Rome. You get what you pay for.\n\nThe Good: Cheap! Thursday thru Sunday 3 night stay with taxes, resort fees, etc ran me under $140. The bed was comfortable. The room was pretty clean. Location is very convenient to I-15 and the Strip.\n\nThe Not-so-good: Asked for a quiet room at check in but got one with quite a bit of road noise and 18 wheeler parking lot noise (west side of the building). Even with the portable white noise machine, there was plenty to hear all night long. Wifi capacity was pretty slow. Breakfast is \""free\"" but drinks, etc cost extra. Food is good. We got out for $8 plus every morning for two drinks and tips. We were on the second floor and the floor was really squeeky. I really hope there was no one below or it would have driven them nuts. When someone drags a heavy suitcase or the staff push a laundry cart by, you feel the vibration through the bed.\n\nWould I stay again. Sure, but only because it's a trip on a tight budget."
3,"I wrote this review in Benin (Dahomey). We have been to this place several times now. Each time the service has either been awesome (5 stars) or below mediocre (1 star), but the food is good! So average of 3 stars. If the food goes down hill, then this place will be a no go for us for sure."

3,"I wrote this review in Tajikistan. Came here for dinner a few days after my first visit.\n\nThe nice looks of the place started to feel misleading pretty quickly.\n\nThe booze pours are super stingy. Both the beer and the wine glassware was modern and nice to look at, but the volume of liquid they were filled with made me feel like I was getting shafted by the bar tender.\n\nTo eat, we got the Louisiana Chicken pasta dish and the Bibimbap.\n\nThe Louisiana Chicken pasta tasted great and, in all seriousness, probably checked in at 2,000-3,000 calories. A significantly heavier meal than a double cheeseburger and fries at Five Guys. It was a huge bowl of heavy whipping cream and melted cheese, with some pasta for texture. The whole time I was eating it, I felt like the waitress should have been wearing a vest with flair pins and saying \""Welcome to Applebees!\"" Totally not what I expected to be served in a restaurant like Miga.\n\nThe Bibimbap was super sexy looking, but left everything to be desired on the eating side of things. It was missing the most important component of that famous dish - the dolsot, or hot stone bowl. It tasted only okay. Bottom line is that it was closer to a cold salad than any Bibimbap I've ever had.\n\nI'm sure I'll come here again, but I'll give the menu some time to work itself out."
3,I wrote this review in Beirut. The wonton's pretty good -- big and full of meats. We tried some crispy pork stomach that was rather tasteless. The red bean drink (and probably the rest of them too) was not worth it (full of ice.) Otherwise what you would expect from an average Chinese restaurant in the Bay Area.
3,"I wrote this review in San Jose. We sampled several items on the menu.  The pork sliders were great, the mushroom  burger was great --- and cooked to a perfect medium rare as ordered.  The fries were also quite good with a perfect crunch.  We did not really like the mashed potatoes because the potatoes tasted old.  The biggest disappointment was the buttermilk fried chicken.  Though it was fried to perfection and crispy, it had no flavor--completely devoid of flavor.  If celebrity chef Aaron Sanchez really did create their menu/recipes, he forgot to taste the one he provided for the fried chicken, as no salt was included in this recipe.  Unless the staff forgot it...."
3,"I wrote this review in Slovakia. Got a craving for some of the Colonel's finest fried goodness and utilized the drive-thru.

A return trip is in order the next time the craving hits."

3,"I wrote this review in Los Angeles. My friend and I wanted brunch and some good ol drinks so we decided to come here. I've been here before for drinks but never for their food. \n\nThey have brunch until 1 pm on Sundays and $5 drink specials. For food I ordered the green chile pork enchiladas. These were really good. It also comes with eggs. The only thing was, they were really spicy for me! I was dying! Lol.  For drinks we ordered the margaritas. Ohhhhh my goshhhh.. They were reallyyyyyy good. Especially for $5 and such a good size too. I got two of them. Let's just say I should've stuck to one. Lol. \n\nThis place probably would've gotten a 4 star from me if the service wasn't so horrible. Our server was neither sociable or friendly. We sat in the middle of these two tables and he went to their tables to help them and wouldn't even acknowledge us. Our food took about 30 minutes or longer to come out. No apologies for the wait or anything. I definitely won't be back for food. Maybe if I want a margarita..."
3,"I wrote this review in Greece. This is close to one of my offices and my co-workers enjoy enough that we are regulars here.  The lunchbox specials are pretty good, especially #1, the Short Rib.  I've also had some of their special sushi rolls.  The AZ Diamondback is pretty good.\n\nService is hit or miss, sometimes they just get over their head with customers and can never make up for the poor service.  Overall the food is pretty good and works out for lunch, sometime I will have to try the Koren Dinner."
3,"I wrote this review in Haiti. Went out here with some friends on Sunday night, right when you walk in it is a little small, but they do have an outdoor section where it is heated. The menu is fairly large with lots of selections. We all ordered different things but the portions are large! So be careful many items on a small table can make it difficult to eat! BUT- I enjoyed the food, tea gets served in a metal dish container. The food is heavy on the saucy side. The service could have been better."

3,"I wrote this review in Mexico City. Came here at 5:30 on a Saturday night and we walked right in since it was pretty early. My family had the pepperoni flatbread pizza and they raved about it saying the bread is what made it special. Had the shrimp ravioli and it was good but nothing special, which is sort of the vibe going in the restaurant -- good but nothing special. Nice spices and and good bay shrimp garnished the ravioli, but the ravioli themselves were sort of rubbery and had an unpleasant texture. 5/5 for the service of Allegro, and 2/5 on the food, even the bread basket we got was cold, and if you're in the Wynn and want some good eatings consider Bartolotta but dress appropriately or one will be denied access."
3,"I wrote this review in Atlanta. The food here is always decent. I highly recommend the mousaka dish. I find though, for the kind of atmosphere, location, and level of service, it's a bit overpriced. I find that the waits are longer than expected (after ordering) and meals come out one at a time, as opposed to together."
3,"I wrote this review in Eswatini. Good brunch and the atmosphere on the patio was very nice, but a pretty significant (I won't call fatal) flaw that merits no more than an A-OK.  If you cannot remove an ingredient from a dish on request you either do or do not, there is no try.  We asked for no onions, answer was yes, but when the dish came it had onions in it.  When we pointed it out we were told the cook tried to remove them but couldn't from the pre-made mix.  Appreciate the flexibility in trying to accommodate, but what if instead of a food we preferred to avoid it was in fact an allergy and you knowingly passed it onto us? Why not just tell us it's a mix and you can't really separate it from the meal ... instead of just serving it up anyway? The general lack of interest shown by the waiter on this left us with a bad feeling.  Despite their efforts and a few bright spots, there were some breakdowns in customer service (not just the one mentioned) and staff training, which add up to a lack of compelling reason to return.  So we probably won't."

3,"I wrote this review in Sacramento. Food was ok. Never expect amazing food from any of the India Palaces and Taj Mahals. There was a private party going on and the kids were running around, yelling and misbehaving. The restaurant should have closed admission to general public or have asked the private party for courtesy.\n\nService was good, food was mediocre. We went because this was the closest place and everything else had waiting. Rightfully so."
3,"I wrote this review in Oslo. Ate at Hardee's for the first time since the mid-1980's.  It doesn't exist in the Northeast and in SoCal it's called Carl's Jr.  I went because I had a coupon for 'buy 1 get 1 free' \""double wide\"" tacos.  The food was pretty decent and the people working there were relatively normal.  It was a little bit colder than we would've liked since the A/C was blowing despite the cold spell we were having for the past few days.  Overall not bad.  I got another coupon in the mail today so we'll see how the next visit goes."

3,"I wrote this review in Cairo. This is such a cute restaurant, it's a shame it's tucked away in the World Market Center and kinda empty.  I'm a sucker for cute decor, and Mundo definitely is a great restaurant for a date night. Fun lantern lighting and romantic velvet sofa seats really set the mood :) \n\nI came here on a Th evening with my colleagues to celebrate a hard week's work. Mundo's \""Happy Hour\"" is on the pricier side, and is only available at the bar. But the food is overall tasty and high quality. The bar area is cute and cozy and they had a very competent bartender. It's just sad that there aren't lots of people here. There's also only 1 small flatscreen at the bar, so it's hard to catch the game, and it's not really a place for groups. Intimate and low key. \n\n+Steak Tacos ($9 during happy hour for 3 tacos, yummy, but still $$)\n+Guac ($6, fresh but bland)\n+(virgin) Margarita ($4, super yums)\n+Sangria ($5 during happy hour...looked yums!)"
3,"I wrote this review in Cote d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast). I actually visited the original location in DC Ranch. I stopped here with some friends for a late night snack and drinks. This was my first time here so one of the guys ordered a couple of Tootsie Rolls for the 4 of us (well 3 of us since my boyfriend doesn't like sushi) and a Berry White martini (It's blue) and it was fantastic. Don't remember what was in the Toostie Roll, sorry, but I love sushi so I usually just inhale it, but it was good too. There's a cool sleek vibe to this place."
3,"I wrote this review in Detroit. It's good for Vegas (off strip), but there are so many of these types of restaurants in other cities that are much better. The bacon brie appetizer was good, but not memorable. Too much bacon, not enough cheese or bread. The butter burger was very good, and the tator tots were decent. Did not like the foie veal meatballs, tasted sort of mealy."
3,"I wrote this review in Finland. I don't know about you guys, but this place is just ok for me. The selection of meats are pretty basic and they taste decent. But what brought the stars down for me is the poor presentation and the sucky hot food selections. Their fried rice was garbage, their sushi was garbage (why even serve sushi?), their glass noodles sucks. \n\nWhat sucks is that their short ribs weren't even that great of a quality. A lot of fatty inedible pieces and they were all cut in different thickness, which results in uneven cooking. \n\nOne thing that i can vouch for Sura is that their tables, grills, and fans are really clean and their customer service is wonderful. \n\n25 for dinner is pretty steep for an AYCE in Vegas."
3,"I wrote this review in Beijing. We ate there this past weekend and I the food was top notch.  The value for the dollar seems to be a bit lacking.  $10 for hummus was about 1/2 what it could/should have been.  It tasted wonderful but $10 was too steep.  The lamb shanks my wife ordered were $23 and again, great taste but quite expensive for what you got.  Apple Martini was $10 and a Stella Artois on tap was about the same.\n\nThe one thing I really didn't like was the very loud music.  Seemed to 80's and kind of affected the mood.  I almost felt I was shouting over the music.  The service was good and the food was very savory.  \n\nIf you are looking for something unique, this is definitely worth a consideration."
3,I wrote this review in Madrid. I had lunch at this restaurant.  The roast beef sandwich was good.  The other people at my table had the Thai salad and they really enjoyed that.  It was huge.  Another person in the group had the Mahi and liked it.  The staff was attentive and nice.  I recommend that you check it out.  It was not cheap though.
3,"I wrote this review in Brazil. I was really disappointed because I really wanted the guy with the bad review to be wrong.  I got the rootbeer and vanilla.  It tasted faintly like a rootbeer float, but all the syrup was at the bottom of the cup.  There were several times I got huge chunks of ice and all I could think about was the review saying that.  The small was 2 bucks with a 75 cent increase for ice cream at the bottom.  My daughter got the cotton candy and birthday cake.  The cotton candy overpowered the birthday cake, to the extent I could not taste the birthday cake.  I will say the cotton candy did taste like cotton candy and made me jealous I didn't get cotton candy instead of rootbeer.  She got ice cream at the bottom and it was really good.  It did not melt even though it was 110 outside.  I will give them another shot, but I will likely try some other sno shacks too."

3,"I wrote this review in Tunis. I have had better Hawaiian cuisine elsewhere, but I like this place because of it's value. It seems like that whatever you order you get a whole lot of it which is great when you are on a budget. Every time I go to this place I always have to order the mac salad and the spam musubi. Their chicken katsu is also nicely done, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I like to come to this place when I'm feeling really hungry and I'm in need of \""stick to your ribs\"" kind of food. This place will definitely leave you full for a very long time."
3,"I wrote this review in Warsaw. If you have a choice, stay at the one about one mile farther north. (14245 S 50th St) The rooms are nicer, and they have indoor corridors.  Might cost an extra $10/night, but it's worth it."
3,"I wrote this review in Slovakia. Stopped in this place for an 8:30 AM Breakfast. We would've grabbed a quick pastry and coffee that day, but the 2 places that had this right next door had super long lines, so we opted for the sit down breakfast. It was a little expensive for 2 breakfasts and coffee. But I will say the side potatoes that came with the eggs were awesome!\n\nOverall, it was ok, just a little overpriced."
3,"I wrote this review in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Stayed here for a last minute trip to vegas on the 4th of July.  Flew in, took the cab which didn't take more than 10 minuites,  paid the $15 fare that included tip, and I was checked in at no time.  There were 6 of us so we were able to make use of our 2 bedroom suite with full kitchen.  Great, inexpensive hotel if you wanna be away from all the glamour and glitz of vegas.  Its away from the strip but free shuttle service is provided to MGM, Mandalay, and airport as well.  This particular hotel gets an OK rating, cause lets face it, this hotel has nothing on others along the strip.  \n\nTip: If a cab is desired, make sure to give yourself sufficient time.  The hotel is away from all the action therefore cabs hate coming out in that direction and if they do show up, they don't have the patience to wait for you.  Make an effort to be at the lobby at the time the front desk tells you to be there for your taxi.  A minute late and your ride will be gone.  Take this seriously, most especially if you have dinner reservations or a show to attend."
3,"I wrote this review in Lithuania. I was referred here by my cousin who ranted and raved about how amazing Dr. Gondi is.  I reviewed her credetials and bio, I was impressed and she sounded exactly what I've been looking for: http://www.lasvegasobgyncenter.com/about.html\n\nThat's who I tried to get in to see, however, since she's so awesome she's booked waaaaaaaaaaay far into the distant galaxy.  I settled for Dr. MIchaels, I figured that since she was in the same office that she must be awesome too. Well, my experience was sub-par. She talked sooooooooooooooo flippin' fast, English is my first language, I'm not slow & I consider myself above average intelligence in regard to the human anatomy and lady parts. I was boggled by what the eff she was saying to me.  I couldn't understand her, not because she spoke another langauge, but because she rattled off letters and sounds I asked her on mulitple occasions to repeat herself, she did and I still left feeling confused. I did my own research and now I understand, but seriously dude, really?\n\nThe check-in nurse told me she didn't have any other appointments for the day and this chick still made me wait 45 minutes. \n\nI will DEFINITELY WAIT to see Dr. Gondi next time and make my yearly appointment a year in advance."

3,"I wrote this review in Los Angeles. We ate at La Porte Grecque as part of a party of 40 (dinner after a baptism). The location of the restaurant and the ample parking made it ideal for group events. There were 2 indoor sections and 1 outside section allowing for lots of options. We were in the larger of the 2 indoor sections.\n\nService was good considering the size of our party. We were offered a nice menu and they happily accommodated any dietary concerns with off-menu items. \n\nThe food was just ok. The starters were small but tasty (choice of feta and olives (2 whole olives...), tzatziki or vine leaves (3). The mains were big but the food was pretty dull. Desert was a cake. \n\nThe restaurant is a BOYW joint which is nice."
3,"I wrote this review in Birmingham. Eventhough we got hooked up to get into the club, we stll had to try to hustle our way in....so dumb.  If you haven't been to South Beach and experienced the line at the club - then you'll HATE the way they do it here.  Basically, there isn't a line - it's just a big ass crowd of people gathered at the bottom of the escalators that take you up to Prive, trying to talk to the bouncers to get into the club.  I would think if you see a large group of girls, to let them in...but no.....you still gotta wait for some reason. \n\nOnce we got into the club - maybe around 11:45pm, it was PACKED....the dancefloor was packed, VIP area was starting to fill up.  The music was pretty good though, I give it that. \n\nWe also ventured off to the Living Room - another part of the club that consists of VIP tables and a bar and house music mixes.  It was a little less crowded in there.\n\nIf we didn't get asked to join some guys in their VIP area, I don't think I would have had as much fun - thus me only giving 3 stars.  We didn't pay for anything all night so I can't tell you how much the drinks were. \n\nI don't think I'd come here again, unless I were with a bunch of girls or if we had a table."
3,"I wrote this review in Buenos Aires. Pretty standard for an Italian place. The food was good but not super amazing. The service was okay too, our waiter was really rushed and would walk away before we were done talking to him. The prices were a little high for what you actually get but not outrageous or anything. Overall the it's has a nice atmosphere and a consistent taste so I'd definitely give it another try."
3,"I wrote this review in Ghana. Pretty Good Airline overall, more of a Bus in the Sky if you will. I have actually grown to like the anything goes, sit-where-you-want thing they got going. Minus 1 star because they always take forever to unload the baggage here. But they don't lose it (like they do in Burbank and Sacramento)."

There is also a good chinese restaurant.  The casino itself is a good size and the staff is average- never had a problem or complaint. The location is also pretty good.\nHarrah's has great deals and promotions on rooms so make sure you join the club."
3,I wrote this review in Armenia. Honestly...the food here isnt that great.  The quality of food is whatever and there were more inedible dishes than edible ones.  The prime rib is done decently well.  Not overly bloody or well done.  The soft serve custard was pretty good and i double fisted cotton candy on the way out!
3,I wrote this review in Detroit. This place could be 5 stars if it changed a few things.  The menu is ok and my food came out tasteing pretty good.  The ambiance is awsome.  Love the indoor out door set up.  You can even bring your dog onto the patio.  The bartenders all seem really pretentious.  The owner should send them over to Ve Bene in Ahwatukee to see how a good bartender interacts with their patrons. They don't offer any drink specials at night and drinking there can get pricey.  I guess that's why they are always pretty slow when I drive by.  Maybe they think they are keeping out the riff raff. ;o)
3,"I wrote this review in Haiti. A good friend of mine is a secret fan of gift shops- he can spend hours in them- so long as they are the official ones. Well this one is an official one and despite the twee gift ideas and corny souvenirs there are some more classier and elegant gift ideas in here. \n\nThe quality is also much better than the cheaper alternatives on the Royal mile, minus the bad and loud music and bright colours the later ones have. \nSo it really depends on your budget and how much you want to hunt around for gifts or souvenirs. I like the service in the gift shop- the lady is always so nice and didn't mind my friend browsing for an age either. (and didn't follow us around like a certain other cheaper gift shop did). If you payed to get into the Castle might as well have a walk around even if you do choose the cheaper options down the street."
3,"I wrote this review in Nairobi. Went to IM's for the first time because we bought the Groupon.  Had great service up until the end.  Took over 15 minutes to checkout.  Our server couldn't get the manager to redeem our groupon.  Meanwhile the manager walks over to another table and was talking to them.  The server then asks the manager to redeem the groupon (personally I don't think she asked her in the first place).  At this point we haven't seen our bill yet.  We finally got the bill and we needed change.  Server had no change so she had to get it from the bar.  Ugh...it was just a mess.\nOh, and she told us that we weren't in her section, so then when here section was not busy she forgot about us.\n\nFood was good, but I wont be back for a while."

4,"I wrote this review in Guinea-Bissau. The pizza and gelato here remind me of Italy. Luckily, now you don't have to get a round trip ticket for some of the same flavors. \n\nThe gelato is creamy but not overly thick. There are plenty of traditional, fun (Girl Scout cookies), and some sugar-free options from which to choose. \n\nThe pizza is almost paper-thin, which may sound weird to people used to thick crusts, but it's very traditional in that regard. Perfect dough, a bit of sauce, light cheese. \n\nThe one thing that fell flat during my visit was the quality of the meatballs. They looked great and the insides tasted wonderful but the outsides were too try and a bit hard. This could've been a simple kitchen issue though. \n\nRich's recommendation: they have pizzas with additional toppings but I'd recommend a classic Margherita for your first visit, just to really taste the crust and quality. Explore from there. Salads and sandwiches are also hits and some are offered during happy hour."
4,"I wrote this review in Somalia. I've dined here many times and enjoyed the food each time.  I do believe the restaurant is family owned, just by the variety, recipes and staff.  The restaurant menu is actually Italian/American cuisine.  If you want prime rib, pork, seafood and a caesar salad, you can have it here and be assured it will be as good of a choice as the Italian offerings. \n\nI usually go Italian, only because it is why I am there.  I need to get more adventurous.  The linguine with the king crab and crispy leeks with lemon butter sauce is so good!  My husband always enoys the \""traditional\"" spahgetti and Kobe meatballs.\n\nService is great and decor is spectacular.  They have the largest wine list I have ever seen and a huge variety of cocktails.  This is one sexy restaurant."

Friendly staff, fun atmosphere.\nHowever, the prices are a little expensive, but that can be expected with Gordon Ramsey.\n\nThe staff really goes out of the way to be informative. \n\nI loved the food. I've tried several menu items and all were really good. I really liked the the wings (both flavors), super easy to eat.\nThe burger with jalape\u00f1o and avocado was delicious. A little spicy, but the avocado really complements the jalape\u00f1o. Best onion rings I've ever had.\nThe curry ketchup gave the fries a unique taste.\nThe sticky toffee pudding push pop dessert was seriously sinful and fun to eat.\n\nI really like the tablet drink menu, super easy to use. The drinks are great."
4,"I wrote this review in Slovakia. What a great place. I stopped in with some friends for happy hour (4:00-6:30, I believe). Each night has different specials; we were able to enjoy half priced house wine and well cocktails.\n\nOur server was really friendly and the restaurant is tasteful and pretty. We started with the spicy hummus, which was delicious - the bread was soft and flavorful, and the humus had a great taste and texture. The arroz con pollo was really, really good. The rosemary chicken sandwich was good, although I think the pesto was a little heavy. The accompanying salad was fantastic - I loved the bright, fresh dressing on the salad. The veggie burger was great - really flavorful patty with great toppings.\n\nI am looking forward to coming back and trying brunch, as well as other dinner items."
4,"I wrote this review in Antigua and Barbuda. My friend recommended Malee's one day for lunch for some Thai food and we have been back 3 times since!  The food is great here and very authentic.  Right in the heart of Old Town, it is 100% fresh cuisine from Thailand.  The restaurant has a great atmosphere.\n\nI never have had Tom Ka Gai soup before but this place makes it phenomenal, its their famous hot and sour soup just bursting of flavors!  I would highly recommend if you like this type of soup.  I also ordered a medium spiced chicken dish with lettuce wraps.  These were tasty but will definitely try some other dishes the next time I go back, which will be soon."
4,"I wrote this review in Lebanon. We had a very early dinner last Friday. There were just a handful of people in the lounge.  Immediately we were greeted by our fabulous server, Gabriel.  His selection of Pinot Noir was right on the mark!  We ordered the Sicilian octopus appetizer which my daughter and I shared (the BF opted to pass.)  The bread basket was awesome. Fresh baguettes, parmesan cheese crisps and a hearty bread that was sweet (dried fruit) and savory (our favorite.)  The octopus was a little on the chewy side, but was still delicious topped with the onion relish.  My daughter had squash curry.  True to Gabriel's word, the curry was light and delicious.  I will be on the search for vadouvan spice in Vegas soon.   The BF had the NY Strip.  While no sauce was needed, the B\u00e9arnaise was the hands down winner.  I had the Alaskan halibut.  The fish was moist and very flavorful.  As a rule, I do not like okra (too slimy), but give me those crispy fried critters any day.   Just wish there were a few more.    We were all much too full for dessert, so we decided just to \""look\"" at the dessert menu.  Gabriel said that his favorite dessert was the Raspberry Frangipane tart, which we shared (fought over).  The tartness of the sherbet and the sweetness of the almond raspberry tart were perfect.  We kept hitting spoons!  It was a great night, made special by the great company and interaction with Gabriel.  Did I say that I love Gabriel?"
4,"I wrote this review in Tianjin. The venue was a little difficult to locate because the sign is a bit cluttered with their unusually long name. Just look for an Italian flag and bellissimo! You've found it. The inside has a modern interior with a bar at the front by the chefs. I don't recall seeing sushi on the menu, but I feel like it's a nice touch that pays homage to a typical Japanese restaurant. \n\nThe import beer was nice. I recommend the red rice hitachino. A different take than your average kirin. The bread rolls they give you as wait weren't anything specular but we really enjoyed it, we asked for a second serving ha!  I ordered a salmon fettuccine with ikura and it was a pleasant surprise. I never would've guessed that pasta with a Japanese touch would taste so good.\n\nThe appetizers are good but nothing out of the ordinary. The jidori chicken is similar to a regular karage chicken served with salad. The calamari was decent but the portions are pretty small.\n\nTwo things I would return for are the beer and pasta. I wish that I ordered two plates of pasta instead of one dish and appetizers. In my opinion, skip the appetizers and head straight for the pasta with a side of beer."
4,"I wrote this review in Egypt. So I went here with a Bosnian friend, that ordered for me. \n\nIt's quite a sterile cafe-ish environment. Kinda like a bakery, because they have bread and pastries - but then again its not. It's different, not in a cozy way.\n\nSo I was dealt this plate with a huge round bread on it (maybe 10 inches in diameter). The bread freshly made, very hot with a light coat of oil on it. The bread was cut in half like a hamburger bun, but inside instead of a burger patty it was full of seasoned sausage meat. This dish is called \u0107evap\u010di\u0107i, or cevapi for short. \n\nThere is nothing more to this meal, but the bread was delicious and the sausage was nice and tasty. I couldn't finish it, even if I ate on a totally empty stomach. this was a different experience for me, but one I would do again. next time I'd save some room for tasty looking Bosnian pastries too. \n\nThe owners was super nice, even if the service is more in a east european anarchic way. You tell them what you want, they bring it you pay. No checking on you - if you want something, you let them know. I actually like this as a guest in their bakery - don't bring your hooters' waitress expectations here."
4,"I wrote this review in Kazakhstan. I love this place the next day after a hangover.  Actually, I love any type of Pho the next day after a hangover.  The Banh Mi (Vietnamese Sandwiches) are cheap and tasty here even though they're a bit smaller than some other places.  The Pho and almost everything else is better than average except the spring rolls, not that they're bad.  You can also order a variety of boba drinks here.  The only small problem was that they sometimes pretend they understand what we're saying, but they end up getting the order wrong.  Little things like no cilantro or more of this and that."
4,"I wrote this review in . I feel so lucky to live only about a 1.5 mile run away. There is an entrance on both sides of 59th avenue and one on  67th avenue (more horse). There the trails are easier but all the hills connect together so I love running here for hours. Fairly crowded most days unless you are absolutely crazy and run at midday in the middle of summer. The west 59th entrance has water (even for dogs!), restrooms, and is my home base. If you run there from the south, the sidewalk ends and you can take a trail on the left."
4,I wrote this review in Dominican Republic. The food was very good . The service was good too. I couldn't believe how cheap the beer was.  My boyfriend and i had some sort of German chilly fries which was really good.  We also had the giant pretzel.  So good.
4,"I wrote this review in Libya. Peoria Sports Complex is a great place to catch a spring training game. Of all the spring training venues in Arizona it might be the biggest with the most space and parking. Because the stadium seating is a little taller you get a little more shade, which I think is important.\n\nThe staff is friendly and can answer any question you have. The food seems to be over prices even in comparison to other spring training venues. I know to expect that food and drinks will be expensive, but it's almost ridiculous.\n\nOver all this is a good place to bring the family and friends on a warm sunny spring day. It's kid friendly and I had an overall good experience there."
4,"I wrote this review in Guatemala. My friend and I made the trek out to Bingemans Park for the Berlin Klassic, an all German car show. Porsches, Mercedes, VW and BMWs filled out the show. Since we were early for the festivities, we took a walk around Bingemans to see what was there. Besides the main building which hosts banquets (a U of Waterloo one was happening that Sunday) there is a camping area for tenting as well as a section of Yerts and as well small cottages for rent. There is even a small river flowing by the campsites looking nice and picturesque. We also noticed a water park with water slides which did not appear to be operating that day but looked complete and functional. The main area with the car show had plenty of free parking for visitors in addition to the main parking area where the car show took place. The Klassic show itself is highly recommended with plenty of cars to see and ogle and the on site dyno facility provided by a tuning company for $60 a session was icing on the cake!"
4,"I wrote this review in Marrakech. Mekong Supermarket is impressively clean and organized.  I could walk through the store without tripping over product containers and without the overwhelming smell of dried shrimp.  I was also impressed with the layout and condition of the live/frozen seafood section.  The frozen case was extremely organized and the product descriptions were visible and easy to read.  The live seafood tanks were full and appeared to be well maintained.  As for the prices, they were very reasonable and lower compared to other markets.  We had specific weight requirements for our seafood so we were a little high maintenance for the staff but they were willing to accommodate to the best of their ability. Our selection for the day was a live lobster, tilapia and catfish. All needed to be no greater than 2lbs which we approximately met with the help of the staff.  Our tilapia and catfish were cleaned and bagged while our lobster traveled live with us over to Asian Caf\u00e9 Express where we had our seafood selection prepared for our meal.  Mekong and ACE have an agreement that allows customers to select their seafood product then ACE will prepare it to a selected style for a small fee. This was a first and enjoyable experience for me. Something I would do again - most definitely."

Maybe that's just the old woman in me, but this place gets really loud! I definitely like it here better than Mojo's so I'll take my yogurt to go and enjoy it in peace!"
4,"I wrote this review in San Marino. Simple, delicious Greek food for a great price. They specialize in typical Greek food (souvlaki, doner), and do it right.\n\nBottom line: if you're looking for some sort of super trendy and modern restaurant, Marathon's isn't it. If you're looking for a casual Greek restaurant that's consistently good, fresh, and fairly priced, then I'd highly recommend paying Marathon a visit."
4,I wrote this review in Antigua and Barbuda. I went here one afternoon to get my boss some congratulation flowers for his new grandson who came into the world and the 2 ladies here were very helpful on picking out a vase and different flowers as well as a balloon and keeping it all under $20. They both were very friendly and made a beautiful arrangement. I am very pleased with Fiesta Flowers and any time I need flowers I will make sure to go to them!
4,"I wrote this review in Nigeria. Went for early dinner on a Monday, as my kids were hungry and kids eat free on Mondays. The hostesses seemed to be hanging out and after reading reviews I was sure I was in for horrible service. Got seated very quickly though and our waitress was over in less than 2 min to get our drink order. The whole meal service was great, she wasn't bothering us every 10 seconds but made sure to check everything was ok or if we wanted refills. A man came over in plain clothes and asked if everything was ok, we said yes. A few minutes later he snuck up behind me and grabbed my empty cup and asked if my waitress was getting me another beer, I informed him I didn't want one. I assume he was a manager but he should have said something or a name tag would have been nice. Overall good food, and good service.  \nOh, and happy hour is long there 11am -7pm Monday- Friday."
4,"I wrote this review in South Africa. Borealis is probably my favourite restaurant in the Cambridge area. The very often used slogan think globally act locally is taken to heart by this lovely restaurant since all food and beverages at this reataurant are supposedly sourced locally to the Waterloo Region or within Ontario. The food is consistantly great with some variation in menu items based on local avilability and the chef. The drink menu has a pretty decent selection of Ontario beers and wines that wil keep your thrist quenched. Service has never been a problem but it has never been stellar either. The interior is a converted period building of some type, I believe it was a school house at one point and evokes a great atmosphere which also features a large concreate patio out front of the restaurant. Make sure you check out the specials as there are often great drink deals on.\n\nI'd like to give this place 5 stars due to its excellent combination of food, drink and atmosphere with local touch but the price point is a little too high to keep coming back regularly so 4 stars from me, check it out!"
4,"I wrote this review in Frankfurt. Went here on the last night of my trip to Charlotte. The food was good, service very friendly, nice vibe, plenty of TVS if you want to watch sports (they had sunday night football on when I was there)......portions were huge. I got the pulled pork plate for one (could also order for two) and it came with two sides. I got Mac & Cheese and Fried Okra (very yummy- first time I got that). Lots of booths. Overall good vibe from this place."
4,"I wrote this review in Barbados. Istanbul is full of friendly and attentive staff that honestly seem like they enjoy what they are doing. The food was fresh, hot and delicious.\n\nIt also helps that it won't bust your budget if you enjoy yourself and have an appetizer, dinner and desert.  Just don't forget your own wine.  This place is definitely on my list if I want to grab a quick dinner for take-out on my way home."
4,"I wrote this review in Beijing. SOOOOOO much fun!!!! We had a couch under the awning across from the Dj Booth and right next to the gambling tables!!! Perfect since we were gambling and Will I am was Dj'ing. We were seated next to two table of peeps in there 30's-40's and we all had a blast!!! This is not Rehab!! There was serious parting going on, including some slipping and sliding. The poles in the center of the pool brought out the inner stripper in a lot of girls who some how managed to have heels on up there??? The food and drinks were awesome and our server's Valerie and Will were so attentive!!  We did not meet the  minimum for our bed and she was able to quickly calculate the amount of shots required to meet our quota. again SO MUCH FUN!! I will definitely go back, you should too...unless your under 25 : )"

I love the Reuben, the Cajun, and the Royal (all horrible for you) I recommend swapping halves with a friend so you can try 2 types. Good beer selection."
4,"I wrote this review in Frankfurt. This is a pretty nice little cafe that's close to the Museum of Fine Arts. The food is decent (we had brunch on a Sunday morning) and the drinks were good too. It's a bit fancier than a normal cafe, so dressing a bit nicer is probably the norm here. The staff was very nice and service was prompt. As a heads up, it's also a bit pricier than some of the other cafes around Montreal, so be prepared when you come here. Overall though, it's a nice place and a good place to stop if you're heading over to the art museum."
4,"I wrote this review in Madrid. Love this place! Only reasons it's getting 4 stars instead of 5: the calamari appetizer was very small, maybe 7 or 8 rings, and they don't have soda water. Otherwise the place is a great value. Nice atmosphere, friendly and attentive service and super tasty hibachi dinner for the price of lunch? Yes please!"
4,"I wrote this review in Athens. I recently had their breakfast burrito and was it really good.  Egg, ham, cheese, pico de gallo.  The thing was a monster.  It was filling enough for me to still be full at lunch time.  Combine the breakfast burrito with their red sauce and you have one heck of a meal.  Definitely worth going back again."
4,"I wrote this review in Mali. Darkest bar in Charlotte! No need to clean up the place just keep the light down extremely low and no one will see the bar scum on the floors. II don't think its that dirty but seriously I don't really know for sure because they keep that place like a damn cave, even in the middle of the day! This Irish Pub is pretty cool though, two bars on two floors and an outdoor seating area partially covered so your covered for the summer time thunderstorms  on sunday funday. Corn hole is set up out on the patio which can help pick up your a portion of your tab if your competitive and into gambling. The bartenders were friendly and the mood is more laid back and chill than other bars downtown. Peak hours can get pretty packed but the off hours are good for kicking it and catching up with some old friends."
4,I wrote this review in Athens. Went to try the huge pizza they have after church. We ordered two of the giant size pizzas. One was a pepperoni and the other was a Bronx. The only bad thing is that they charged for each of the toppings on the Bronx. It took about 30 mins for both to be ready. We had to put our pizzas through the back of the SUV since they are huge! The whole family ate and we still had left overs. The pizza had a great flavor. My family was pleased with it.
4,"I wrote this review in Colombia. Great find! Had the beef arepa, was pretty good, I also had the chicken salad one, wasn't great.. but what I really loved was there grilled chicken with rice and beans.. delicious!! I have to try the empanada next time, they looked great!"
4,"I wrote this review in Grenada. Finally something fairly decent for Chinese food her in Vegas. This area has been a vast wasteland for any remotely decent Chinese. The  hot and Sour soup was o.k. Not bad as both the hot and sour were prevalent, but the flavor was lacking. I was therefore pleasantly surprised by how flavorful my half roasted duck was. My husband had the beef and eggplant, again it was well prepared and flavorful. Service was good. I felt that the prices in comparison to other casino/hotel restaurants like this were reasonable and the quality of food was in line with the prices. I was disappointed with my inability to get a glass of wine that the menu had a by the glass price for. The waiter said that they would only serve it by the bottle, in spite of the menu showing it available either be glass or bottle. Drank water as result."

4,"I wrote this review in Seychelles. Likle most delis, Peckhams has somewhat of a bizarre effect on me. I love the thought of it, and as I approach the door I get visibly excited at the thought of the numerous culinary treats within. Yet when I actually get inside, I can never find anything I actually want to eat, or can be bothered with the hassle of cooking.\n\nOne day I'll find something I'm sure. That aside, Peckhams is a chain deli with branches in more or less every area that has below average unemployment. Cous cous, olives, fancy bread, cakes and imported booze, you know what to expect."
4,"I wrote this review in Grenada. Went here tonight on a date with my BF.  I was pleasantly surprised with the atmosphere, service, and food.  All the ingredients were fresh and yummy. The Chow Mein was the best I have had in years.  The staff was very friendly and attentive. \n\nI would give the one sushi roll, Golden Cali Roll, we got a 3.. it was just ok. The BF liked it more than me."
4,"I wrote this review in Bahrain. This is really good sushi for a takeout place! The sushi tastes just as good if not better than fancy sit-down restaurants. I usually just walk in the store and order, and it usually takes around 10 minutes to prepare it, similar to other takeout joints. \n\nI am a huge fan of their special Fireworks rolls. It's got so many fresh, good ingredients, such as tempura shrimp, cucumber, other fish (I can't remember), and thick, grilled tuna wrapped around the sushi rice, topped off with their sweet soy sauce! It's very rich and full of unique flavors.  \n\nAlso, try their octopus salad. It's a good compliment with your sushi. \nI would also recommend their Charlotte or K.O. combo which includes nigiri. \n\nFor the quality and price, it is a great value\n\nI have not tried their \""hot\"" food yet, such as udon or hasaki plates, but I will keep you all posted."

4,"I wrote this review in Belarus. The service for lunch was very quick and attentive. I loved their fresh iced green tea, reminded me of Korea. The 2 for $8 sushi special was inexpensive and tasted wonderful. I recommend the tempura shrimp and spicy yellowtail. \nThe hibachi chef wasn't as flashy as most but the food was very well done and portion size was decent. \nDefinitely recommend for lunchtime dining."
4,"I wrote this review in Detroit. It's easy to see why this small eatery is so popular: the food is inexpensive and tasty, the servings are more than ample, and the range of choices run the gamut of popular Asian cooking styes: Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Mongolian. It's great to be able to order tonkatsu, pad thai, and General Tsao all in one place. While the place could use more light and perhaps a bit of touching up, you come here for the inexpensive, delicious food and not for the decor. I noticed while dining here that they have a very brisk take-out business so don't be surprised if there's a bit of a delay in getting your food if you dine here at peak hours."
4,"I wrote this review in Sweden. Visiting the new Fiesta Mall In N Out Burger in Mesa a few times and despising the food, especially the soggy nasty fries, I tried this one in AJ to give it a chance. It was lunch time and just packed as these places get. Oddly enough with inside packed, line outside the door and people eating outside, we got in the long drive through line and I don't think we spent too much longer than five minutes. The fries were awesome and crispy and FRESH and a pretty good burger and nice fattening chocolate shake. Great, fast service and the food was GOOD! I think I'll go back some day!"

4,"I wrote this review in Tianjin. My husband and I ate here while on a business trip and just loved everything about it.  Before 9 I though AJ Maxwell in New York had the best  steak and seafood.  My salmon was the best prepared salmon I have EVER had in my life in a restaurant.  My husband loved his steak.\n\nMy lobster mash potatoes was amazing.  The complimentary sample dish sent out was fabulous (can't remember what is was called). \n\nThe crowd was a fun mix of the hip and young, older and chic, entertainment and sports crowd and after hours business type.  Music was nice and loud.\n\nThe prices were a bit high, but I would spend all over again because the service was great and the food was yummy!"
4,"I wrote this review in South Africa. The bf was so excited about all of the flavors he had seen on the website but was :( when we arrived and there were only about 5.  So his rating is about 3.5.  He said his coconut custard was really good.\n\nMy rating, on the other hand is a solid 4!  The Western is a sure fire winner.  Those salted pecans rule the school!!  I wish I had some right now!  I was worried it would be too much as we were still stuffed from dinner - but it was delicious.  Much lighter then ice cream...more like frozen yogurt but creamier.\n\nThe area is well lit so don't be too scared.  Those pecans are worth dodging a bullet for!"
4,"I wrote this review in Venezuela. Our family and in-laws went there for Mother's Day and everyone loved it!  Everyone had the Prime Rib except me, I had the salmon, which was very good.  I felt you got a lot of food for the price.  Definitely cheaper than most comparable places.  \n\nOnly thing I didn't care for was the service.  The dinner was supposed to come with a cocktail, but if you didn't mention it, neither did they.  And our drinks were empty often, and it wasn't very crowded at all.  Maybe just an off day.  I would still recommend."
4,"I wrote this review in Los Angeles. This casino, as you might expect, caters to senior citizens. They're heavy on slots and video poker and have probably the largest bingo hall ever imagined. \n\nI met my parents there at noon on a Wed. and found that I was one of about half a dozen players in the 21-30-year old demographic. Most of the dealers, however, are young. One nice thing is that the senior demographic drives the blackjack minimum down to $2. So it's a good place to hone the 21-playing skills without hurting yourself too bad. I settled in at a $5 table and made it out with some cash. I did not see a craps table and the roulette wheel was automated (weird). \n\nI'm sure the younger players show up on weekends because there were more tables that were not open, but overall they do not have a large amount of tables. \n\nDefinitely a good casino, and it is on tribal land. Be careful driving up there and back because Beeline Highway is heavily patrolled for speeders by the Arizona State Police"
4,"I wrote this review in Suriname. I go here mostly for the izakaya feel and less for the food.  I used to frequent izakayas on a weekly basis when I lived in Japan and sometimes I just want to feel nostalgic so I swing by Ichiza. \n\nThe food is about as good as an average run of the mill izakaya found anywhere in Japan.  I have a feeling most of the 5 star reviews on here are coming from people who have never ate at a finer izakaya in Japan.  The selection could be a bit better, I would prefer an all Japanese kitchen staff, though their wait staff is all Japanese.  \n\nSo for the food, 3 stars.\n\nFor the kind and welcoming staff, 5 stars.  Ambiance and izakaya feel get 4 stars.\n\nDon't come here expecting an amazing Japanese food adventure.  Come here with friends expecting some cold beer, lively chatter, and friendly service!"
4,"I wrote this review in Saint Lucia. THIS PLACE IS PERMANENTLY CLOSED???  Last time we called was summer of 2011 and the voicemail said that the restaurant was closed for the summer.  It is no longer summer and the place is still CLOSED!!!!  Too bad because of my previous review below...\n\nGreat outside sitting area, good food too!  The AC gets a bit too cold sometimes but if you say something, they will turn it down.  This place looks classy, nice decor.\n\nVery good lunch selections under $10.00.  The service is good, they take very good care of you.  We asked for something on the dinner menu and they served it to us.  They have a good wine selection but we haven't tried it yet as my coworkers and I go there at lunch.\n\nTry the spinach dip.  It is awesome.  Small salad plates are good and healthy.  Pizza is good, sandwiches are creatively put together."
4,"I wrote this review in Manila. Headed here for a good old fashioned breakfast, since they are one of our go to places.  Pretty standard location for the chain with the country store up front to look through if there is a wait.  We were fortunate enough to get seated right away.  \n\nOur waitress came over within a minute or two to take our order.  Food came out within 7-10 minutes after, so not long to wait at all.  Everything was made as requested.  The only real complaint we have is the eggs. It seems that they probably cook them to order in the pan and that they continue to cook on the plate, which means they are going to overcook just a touch.  Not really a big thing.\n\nThere was a bit of the line at the cash register, but the place is always busy in the mornings, so this wasn't too surprising! \n\nOverall: A-\nStandard CB location, good for breakfast, service was decent!"
4,I wrote this review in Bahrain. I had a wicked craving for a turkey sandwich with gravy n mashed potatoes. \nThey had it on special the day I was there. . Food was pretty good. Staff was like a small town crew. They knew many of the customers. \nI think I'll be bAck.
4,"I wrote this review in Chengdu. Bask In the Ambiance Bask in the Ambiance. Plenty of seating. I prefer to sit at the bar so i did. A Few tvs with sports on while your rolls are being made. They have happy hour on the weekends though i Opted for all you can eat. The rolls that arent included in AYCE are only 99 cents which is a score. I must say HONEY ROLL HONEY ROLL is where its at. Also a 1/2lb of crab legs with dinner all you can eat for 9.99 that cant be beat. \n\nThe rolls come out fast and fresh. Not to much rice either. Im a fan of the Rainbow roll as well. The service was a little slow to remove my plates and keep my drink refilled in the beginning but they made up for it and then some. Once im on this side of town in the future and want Sushi i know where ill be going for Lunch. Also they have Kobe Burgers on the menu which seems more than appetizer to me, so they would probably put me in a food coma. Love the ingenuity of the names and ingredients with the rolls. \nKudos"
4,"I wrote this review in Tunis. I have eaten here for both lunch and dinner. The food is always fresh and served relatively quickly no matter what time of day you visit. The staff has always been friendly and informative.\n\nTypical AYCE sushi rules apply (no sharing with non/AYCE guests, don't waste the rice, you have approximately an hour to eat, etc.)\n\nSome favorites: Crab roll, 911, Friday 13th v Jason, Spider roll, spiderman, cowgirl, japanese lasagna...there are so many to choose from\n\n\nThis is a small place so you could end up waiting for a table in the evening hours. The good thing is, the service remains at all time high because they can only serve so many people at once. If you can't get a table, order to-go! It's made fresh when you order it, unlike the cold dry sushi that you get at RA!"
4,"I wrote this review in Mauritania. Grand just keeps getting better and better. Won't be long before it starts to get swarmed like Roosevelt, pushing all the artists and kewl shit further west. But in the meantime, places like The GAP exist (not sure it's legal to call it that?). Pizza places can be all the same, but these guys get creative. Brussel sprouts is their best, but I had some weird chicken thing (I think the chef was stoned, in a good way) and it was amazing when I had the drunchies (drunk munchies). Really looking forward to the music stuff they'll be doing in the future.\n\nThings I would like to see:\nDraft beers + growlers. Federal Pizza has a pretty damn good program going on they should implement."
4,"I wrote this review in Munich. They were smoking a brisket and ribs today so naturally we tried the brisket tacos and the jerk ribs. I have no complaints on either of those. The sides were very average. The squash casserole was really weird and did not taste fresh. Despite the lackluster side dishes the place overall was great, and that brisket was delicious!  I'll definitely be back."
4,"I wrote this review in Gambia. I didn't see thus restaurant coming at all! This place, although in a strip mall, has a quaint vibe, great staff, and GREAT food and FLAVOR, at a great price.

Am def going back to try more entrees and the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e!"
4,"I wrote this review in Cyprus. Loved this place the moment we stepped foot inside of the elevator to get to the top.  Seven of us girls were in search of a great time and we found it here at the Foundation Room!  Advertised as exclusive and VIP, I thought to myself that surely they were trying to front like other Vegas clubs.  I drank my words as we were offered free champagne and cocktails while dancing to some hot beats!\n\nFR offers 3 rooms with spacious dance floors and a patio that is perfect for their gorgeous panoramic view of the Vegas strip.  I admit that their dance floors are pretty small, but after several drinks you won't even notice the cramped space that has you dancing right up on another person :).  The aforementioned patio was a perfect place to get fresh air and if you can handle folks smoking in your \""fresh\"" air (which was a bit of a turnoff but whatever), you get a chance to take in all of the magical spark that makes the Vegas strip what it is.\n\nWe ended our night here and wished that we started it off at this spot.  Great people, great atmosphere, and I would definitely party it up here again."
4,"I wrote this review in Athens. I've been here quite a few times, and let me give you the tl;dr about the place.\n\nThe traditional hotdog, with a bunch of different stuff on top of it. I'm a hotdog lover and I've tried every single regular dog on the menu -- and I like it most of the time. Except that it's just that odd time when something comes out a bit strange or not quite right that makes me dock one star."
4,"I wrote this review in Senegal. St. Francis wins best french fries in all of Phoenix, hands down.  Their sister restaurant at the Downtown Public Market seems to have the recipe, but can't quite match up.  St. Francis remains a favorite brunch spot (great live music starts at 10:30am Sundays), and performs just as well for dinner.  The service is always on par and the food is consistently delicious.  Go for their breakfast sandwich, sans mayo-sauce (come on, quit being fancy - no matter what you call it, may doesn't belong on a breakfast sandwich).  Their flat bread pizzas and burgers are always a good call at dinner time.  Did I mention happy hour?  The bar scene here is small, but if you can grab one of the outdoor stools, you'll be happy for quite some time."
4,"I wrote this review in Spain. Very cool place downtown in CityScape, love the idea, not your dad's bowling alley full of sweaty old men playing in league's. This is definitely built more around the lounge concept than bowling lanes. A great place to have a b-day party with friends, they have huge screens at the end of each lane that were playing college football games when we went. They stocked local brew from Four Peaks which is awesome.\n\nThe downside is the service wasn't the best but this is a new location so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they will figure it out. Other than that we highly recommend checking it out, once CityScape is done it's gonna be great to hangout downtown."
4,"I wrote this review in Mauritania. I always enjoy the food and drinks here. The place has a nice decor and good outdoor seating on the strip. I've waited to review until I've been here more then twice, lastnight was my third. Everytime I have no complaints with the food, all delicious. But everytime service seems slow, they are actually lucky I came back after my first time here. But the food and atmosphere seemed like it deserved a second chance. My first time we waited 20 minutes just to get our drinks! We had to wave our hand in the air for then to notice! Other times I've visited not nearly as extreme but the waitress seemed a little stressed and confused. Would come back to the table and re ask what it is we ordered. Food amazing, drinks good. Service questionable."
4,"I wrote this review in Comoros. First pho experience. It was better than average. The 3.5 average is spot on. \n\nMy friends and I ordered three different bowls and we enjoyed them all. I had the vegan pho which was super flavorful and full of veggies and noodles. I also ordered the tofu nuggets because I wanted to be able to say that I ordered tofu nuggets with a straight face. They were actually pretty good, as was the sauce they came with. My friend ordered crab rangoon. It was the same old crab rangoon you get anywhere, but they charged $8 for it. Seriously?\n\nThe service was very hurried, and the waiter never actually took a drink order. He just brought us all water and that was that; we hadn't even realized until he left with the food order. Hurried service also meant the food came quickly, and you can't complain about that. No asking for dessert either. The check just came when he decided to bring it. So it goes.\n\nAlso, for some reason that we couldn't figure out, there was house music playing in the background the whole time. It wasn't annoying. Just confusing. We just chalked it up to being Vegas after midnight."
4,"I wrote this review in Seychelles. I know this isn't the best farmers market. I know it isn't deserve 5 stars. I know they need more local. I know it is weird to see bananas. I get all of that. BUT THIS PLACE IS SO EASY AND STILL CHEAPER THAN A GROCERY STORE. But, yay, it would rock if they stepped up the local produce section.\n\nThey have delicious local heirloom tomatoes. That are almost always fresh and perfect.\n\nTHE FLOWERS. There is a lady who sales the most beautiful fresh cut flowers. Bring extra cash and buy yourself, your girl, your mom some. Absolutely stunning flowers."
4,"I wrote this review in Haiti. Bottle sevice+Kaskade+group of ER nurses = i'm a happy camper\n\nI'm definitely coming back to this club again. I only have a few complaint about this place and that is rude bouncers!!!! They're very strict when it comes to trying to keep people moving in aisle. They don't want people standing around the aisle when there's a performance going on. If you don't' have a table reserved, good luck trying to  get a peek of who's playing that night. The bouncers don't care if ur a female , if you're in the way they'll shove u away.\n\nThey also try to make this club exclusive, so they'll pick on petty things such as not wearing ur shoe in the club, hotel, elevator or anywhere on their property ( WTEFF? Most of us just danced the night away in ur effing club with our high heels on..give us females a break!) They'll kick your friends out of the club if they remotely look drunk even though theyre allready on their way out and hasn't made a scene (for ex: like throwing up at some random person's shoe, falling in the pool).\n\nAside from the neg things I'll still give this club 4 stars for the music, atmosphere, awesome lineup of performers!"

It's always the same people so service and food is consistent. \n\nWe usually get salted ribs, combination seafood noodles (the crispy noodle kind), pea shoots (do miao), and sometimes their pork and thousand year old egg porridge (although now that alot of thousand year old egg producers are being shut down, they may not offer it anymore). \n\nGreat place for takeout as well. They also have Asian drinks which is nice (grass jelly, cold chrysanthemum tea, Apple Sidra, etc)."

We only had a half a dozen of the Hot Buffalo Smoked Wings which are then grilled with great charcoal flavor and just the right amount of sizzle on the lips. Great wings. Cold beer and an awesome Bloody Mary Bar. We will return.
4,"I wrote this review in Jordan. When I first moved to Las Vegas My sister (Nikki H.) took me here for dinner. \n\nOMG this place is freaking awesome!!! its like old western cowboy themed. They have great decorations large bar, huge sofas a small mini bowling alley and there booths are sooo comfy. \n\nService is great at this restaurant and the servers are so friendly and nice! \n\nFood is amazing! \nI always always always order there Chicken Fried Steak... Its just so mouth watering and extremely delicious. It is buttermilk battered and the steak sauce is very rich and creamy I have to order more sauce on the side because is so good, the steak also comes with mashed potatoes and grilled chipotle corn also delicious. I also order the Baked Potato Soup very good i love it mmm the bacon and cheese is just an extra delicious touch. \n\nThere food is good quality and delicious, and they give huge portions. \n\nIf you like a filling quality meal this is a must try restaurant"
4,"I wrote this review in Chile. I always get the fish tacos with sweet potato fries. Best in town. I really haven't had better fish tacos anywhere else despite my many failed attempts. They have a decent brunch buffet but you literally won't be able to eat for 3 days, it is an insane amount of food and you get full just looking at it all!"

4,I wrote this review in Panama. Great food and great service: Tip: you can order a side of Guac instead of the full appetizer if you don't need the full amount. Great Margaritas too!
4,"I wrote this review in Maldives. This is a great little spot. I have been going to for years. Another little mom and pop spot, and those are my favorite.\n\nThey have a great variety of dogs, burgers, sandwiches, and appetizers to choose from. Although I haven;t tried it all (gimmie some time) everything I have tried has been great. When you're all done get a shake or a float to top it off..hell ya.\n\nThis is a small place so word of advice if you go during peak times, plan for a wait or you can also order and eat in the patio that sits a couple of stores down."
4,"I wrote this review in Afghanistan. Unpretentious, well done french food on the las vegas strip.  They offer very approachable classic french dishes, as well as the usual burgers and fries for non foodie types.  Expect nothing fancy; menu is also a bit limited.  Food is great tho, and atmosphere is comfortable with great outside dining (right across from the amazing bellagio fountain!).  Also, reasonable prices for vegas!"
4,"I wrote this review in Senegal. Oh  Sam Fox, I love you.  I am a huge fan of the culinary confections that you whip up and have never been disappointed when dining at a FRC restaurant.  Culinary Dropout is no exception. I have been here several times, for drinks and appetizers, for lunch and for dinner and everytime I am pleased with the food.  The service has had a few hiccups, but nothing earth shattering. The bacon bloody mary is delicious and the salmon is dreamy and the pretzels and fondue, OMG...you had me at fondue.  Keep up the good work and I will keep giving you my money.  :)"
4,"I wrote this review in Malta. I'm going to give this 4 stars because there are very few options for Malaysian and Dim Sum in Pittsburgh but if this were in a larger city it would probably be more like 3 stars.\n\nI went there once for lunch and had one of their Malaysian noodle soup dishes which was pretty good but not amazing.  I also went for Dim Sum on a Sunday and very much enjoyed it.  They had a large diversity of options and everything was very tasty.  It's certainly not at the level I've had in places like Boston, Seattle, or NYC but for Pittsburgh I was very satisfied.  My friend who had lived in China for a year also found it to be pretty decent.  I would definitely go there again.  \n\nThe service was very good and the prices reasonable. The atmosphere was comfortable though I found the lighting to be rather dark.  There is also some outdoor seating available when the weather is good and a full bar with seating."
4,"I wrote this review in Georgia. This Trader Joe's in particular is one of my favorites. It's never too crowded except around the holidays, I've never had to wait in line for more than 1 minute (someone always comes around to pull me over), all the cashiers are extra friendly, and the samples in the back keep my belly warm. WARNING THE PARKING will drive you crazy. Come at an odd hour to avoid the extremely stressful experience that is parking here. It's cramped, the spaces were made with ant-sized cars in mind, and you'll often have to wait for a spot by loitering in the middle of the whole lot and blocking people. Coming even a little later in the night will save you the hassle.\n\nTrader Joe's in general: Why must you package all your vegetables? Why do your herbs only come in small, plastic-wrapped bunches? \n\nMy favorites: a bag of four avocados for ~$2.50. Two salmon filets for ~$10.00. $3 wine, \""healthy\"" (I'm not really sure, but the ingredients definitely read a little better) frozen food."
4,I wrote this review in Maldives. Really comfortable seating! And you can bring in delicious wood fired pizza from Five50 Pizza Bar that right around the corner.
4,I wrote this review in Cairo. I drove by this place probably a couple thousand times :). Stopped by for a quick lunch few days ago and tried a Cajun catfish plate with yams fires on a side. Fish was great and yams fries were great too. I'm a fan!

4,"I wrote this review in Philadelphia. Resto La Banquise offers 24hr poutine glory! Their menu consists of soups, salads, sandwiches, breakfast, sides, desserts, assorted meals, and over 25 different types of poutine.\n\nThis place is small and kind of resembles Pita Pit- definitely works if you're looking for an informal dining experience. The staff is kind and provides okay service, nothing great.\n\nI had their \""small\"" poutine with breaded chicken. I could not even finish it since the portions are so generous. The poutine here is the best! The fries are thick, drenched in hot gravy with a good amount of chewy cheese curds. The breaded chicken was tender with crispy breading,  chopped in little pieces and truly a delicious touch to my poutine. \n\nThe downfall about this place is that you may suffer through the service. Also, you may be seated close to other people, especially during peak hours, since the restaurant is cramped. They also don't take visa; only debit or cash. \n\nDespite that, I would recommend Resto La Banquise if you're looking for great poutine and more for reasonable prices!"
4,"I wrote this review in Spain. What you say? A hot pot all for myself? Yeah!\n\nI had the lamb hot pot and my partner had the beef hot pot ($9.99 each). The lamb broth had a vinegary tang to it, which I liked and the beef broth had a good hearty flavor. Both came with tofu, crab sticks, tofu skin, mushrooms, a fish ball (with pork inside), bok choy, carrots, tomatoes (ideal for a good broth flavor), and their respective meats (thinly sliced). We ordered add-ins of fish balls ($1.50) and noodles ($1.50), which we split between us, and spicy level 4.\n\nThe broths were very flavorful and you could adjust the flame below if you wanted it more or less bubbling hot.\n\nIt was our first time there, so the owner was very helpful in explaining how it worked, which we both appreciated. She also showed us how to do the sauces, even offering to make one \""special\"" for us. I mixed green onion, cilantro, and garlic oil; my partner was quite fond of the garlic oil and Chinese BBQ sauces together.\n\nTip: the ingredients can be quite hot, so take out the goodies and put them on a plate to cool off a little before wolfing them down.\n\nWhile I wish we hadn't waited so long to finally stop in,  now that we have, we will definitely be back. Next time, we're going to try some of the skewers they offer, too."
4,I wrote this review in Afghanistan. walking through the airport on way to gate. Thinking about the nasty food I'll likely eat when I reach it. Pass by Blanco. Angels singing with ray of light. I've been to the location in the Tucson hills. Its consistently great food. What a nice surprise in an otherwise awful food environment. Way to go Phoenix airport. Fish tacos were a solid choice.

Rooms at the Cosmo live up to the price.  \n\nComfy bed\nTub for two\nSpacious shower\nSeparate bathroom\nLiving room area\n.. and my favorite, balcony with a view of the Bellagio Fountain as well as the strip\n\nThere are plenty of clothing shops, restaurants, and bars within the hotel that are also great."

Been here a few times and excited to take friends soon. Just a really great, casual experience. The food is not outstanding, but everything else MORE than makes up for it. Definitely a must-try! It's just a great place to linger and browse, which seems weird for a restaurant, but it's enjoyable."
4,I wrote this review in Romania. I had a salad and it was only around $4.  I'm big into value and let me tell you I took half of it home.  It wasn't the best salad that I've ever had but I wasn't disappointed.  I would return just for the pricing and portions!
4,"I wrote this review in Vietnam. Took an out of town friend for dinner last night.  What a hit. \nThe Curry dish and Ravioli with kale were our choices and were superb. \nJust wish the west side had choices like this but it's worth the drive for healthy, organic food that makes you go ahhhhh!"
4,"I wrote this review in Palau. Booked a south rim tour. Started off really slow, bus took us to the Miracle Mile and then we got put on another bus after getting a danish and coffee/water to start off with. Took a while to get things organized. \nStopped near the dam, a rest stop in Kingman, Az, then had a decent lunch in Williams, Az. The south rim is quite a drive. Once we got there, we had a couple of stops at the canyon for about an hour each, then headed back with one stop again in Kingman, Az. The south rim is a long trip, prepare accordingly. We got back around 9:30 or so. Our driver, Tommy, was excellent and informative."
4,"I wrote this review in Samoa. GET THE KOBE SLIDERS. They are so amazing. I crave them all the time. I've never had better ones then here. They come with a BBQ dipping sauce too. MMMM.\n\nThe wait is ridiculous for this place the weekend for lunch though. Don't even try to sit outside. It looks so pretty out there though. There is a pool and some fountains to look at. \n\nThere is a full bar also which is good, but what doesn't have a full bar in vegas? \n\nI've also had the cobb salad, which was GIANT (You could totally share this with 3 people), the chili (so good), Turkey club (good), and a cheese burger(GIANT and yummy). The prices are high, but you get good quality food so I don't mind paying for it!"
4,"I wrote this review in Sao Tome and Principe. Few of my fellow coworkers have been hitting up Cobblestone Auto Spa to get there car's washed during lunch, and I have been looking for a new place since the one that is near me is not opened during the hours I would like to have my car washed haha\n\nMy car was just a hot mess and needed a washing and vacuuming out, went over on a Friday afternoon to get her washed, from the time I pulled up to the time I left, everyone was so friendly, at this time I only wanted the regular wash with vacuum and they didn't even try with upselling me or being pushy about another choice. I went inside to pay, was told I have 5 days to come back to get it rewashed in case of rain, which I will be taking her back tomorrow for that exact reason, and for the next time have a wash @ $4.99! How cool is that!\n\nThe waiting area is nice, you can watch a variety of tv screens to see where your car is at and what is being done to it, like a crazy car wash big brother, and waiting area outside is nice too.  \n\nIm happy to give them a chance and will be coming back!"
4,"I wrote this review in Fiji. I like this place! It is not a 5 star burger place but it is a solid 4. They use good meet, and even though it is not totally original, they let you feel like you are in control of how it is cooked and you top it yourself.\n\nThe atmosphere in the restaurant is kind of a throw back, and they generally have some good music....although I did hear a Morrissey song, but I was able to block it out. Its not quite a 50 dinner theme but it is worth taking a look at.\n\nI would for sure go for the 2/3 burger and from there the toppings are up to you."
4,I wrote this review in Slovenia. While I am not the biggest Mexican food fan on the block I have always enjoyed eating here. They have this whole Greek/Mexican marriage thing going on-lol. What I really like are the chips and salsa. Interestingly enough their Veggie Burro is kicking!
4,"I wrote this review in Bahrain. Mango, chili, lime, oh my! This pie is awesome. The first bite is strange as it's spicy, yet rich and tart. Go past the first bite and you'll be back for more (if you can handle the spice!). \n\nI enjoy Mama Toledo's!"
4,"I wrote this review in Haiti. The world needs more places like this: Healthy, gourmet-inspired meals with full disclosure of calories and fat so that you know what you're getting into. Every item on the menu is paired with its nutritional info, and for those times when you don't need to gorge yourself with pizza-sized pancakes for breakfast, this is the perfect match.\n\nWhat we had:\nthree-egg-white omelet with cheese, chicken, spinach, and a side of toast and potatoes--Very tasty and satisfying.  Pancakes with blueberry syrup--smallish pancakes but were good nonetheless. \n\nAlso, the coffee was excellent as was our service. We'll definitely be back during our next Vegas trip."
4,"I wrote this review in Venezuela. This is one of those places that I imagine out-of-towners come to to try and get that Southwest experience. In fact the night I was here I think,as a local, I was in the minority. And by local I refer to the large group of Scots in the bar dressed in Western wear having a HELL of a time in this \""wee, bonnie bar\""\n\nThe place is tiny but lively with good live music, cheap drinks and a crowd that likes to have a good time. This is a nice alternative to a lot of the other places in Scottsdale. Definitely a place I need to hit more often for some live country music and definitely a place to bring out of town relatives and friends.\n\nGood times."
4,"I wrote this review in Sacramento. I'm not complaining about the price because I knew in advance that it was $40 per person (price as of this past Saturday night).\n\nSo much food to choose from!!! \n\nThe meat is delicious: prime rib, beef wellington, LAMB CHOPS, pork belly, and on...\n\nCrab legs, prawns, sushi, caviar, cerviche, I couldn't get through all the seafood options.\n\nSalads, asparagus, cheeses, cured meats, soups, olive breads, there was no way I could get to it all.\n\nSo many desserts: amazing cheesecake, macrons, lemon meringue, chocolate desserts, ice creams, bread pudding, fruit, etc.\n\nSo much food and all of it good. Some of the servers were great and friendly (especially the guy chopping up the medium rare beef and pork belly) though one woman seating us rolled her eyes when my friend asked if we could wipe down the table because it had food on it. Another guy, serving the beef wellington, was really grouchy and was yelling at one of his co workers rather than letting anyone have any of his dish. I had to yell \""excuse me\"" about 5 times to get his attention. The guy dishing out the caviar was also rude because I didn't know the names of the different kinds. \""Can I please try the black caviar?\"" I asked. His terse answer: \""UH, It's called American caviar!\"" I've never had caviar before and had no idea, ha ha!\n\nOverall, a good time and good food. I was stuffed and can't eat like this all the time, so it was a treat!"
4,I wrote this review in Kenya. Virgin America gates not far from security check in. Plenty of seating and eateries nearby. Flying in on a Sunday and out on a Thursday the place wasn't crowded so it made fpr a pleasant travelling. Vegas vibe throughout the airport including slot machines in the baggage claim area.
4,"I wrote this review in Samoa. I am a meat eater, but when I do have to eat vegetarian, I prefer South Indian cuisine.  Woodlands did not disappoint in that department.  I cannot tell you what I ate since my friend did the ordering, but everything was really good.  We had chick peas, a huge bread that took up most of the table, and \""hamburger buns\"" with tasty potato filling.  I am sure I can close my eyes, point at something on the menu and still find the dish enjoyable.  Expect a very casual restaurant where you order at the counter and eat from disposable plates.  This would also be a great place to order take out from."
4,I wrote this review in Republic of the Congo. You can't miss this Montreal institution. This Huge orange ball on Decarie serves Hot-Dogs and this interesting creamy orange juice. I work steps away from this place and its great in the summer.
4,"I wrote this review in Montreal. The food here is fresh and delicious, I never thought I would enjoy a veggie sandwich so much.  The trout sandwich I had here was also pretty good, and the soups and bakery items looked and smelled incredible.\n\nThe worst thing about this place is how incredibly busy it is.  It's always packed, with people waiting outside on the street since it's pretty tiny.  They also have a weird semi-table-service method where you get seated, but then order at the counter with a ticket, then a server comes out to deliver the food (eventually).  Then, you get up and pay the cashier.  I guess they don't want to shout out order numbers.\n\nAs a lunch option, it's one of the best light meals in the Old Town.  I personally liked Le Cartet better, but this place is good."
4,"I wrote this review in Maldives. As noted in previous reviews, Trader Joe's has a large variety of specialty, hard to find, and/or natural/organic items. I do enjoy walking the aisles to find new and interesting products. The specialty ravioli is one of my favorites as well as the all natural desserts. However, what other reviews failed to mention was the natural cleaning products. The main reason I stop at Trader Joe's is for the chlorine free paper products and natural cleaing products especially the laundry detergent. Chlorine free/recycled paper products seem to be hard to find in the stores. Giant Eagle Market District used to carry some Seventh Generation paper products but they haven't had any for well over a year. Before Trader Joe's, if I had to order all of my paper products online to be delivered. Now, I can find good quality, chlorine free, recycled paper towels, napkins and toilet paper for a great value at a local store. Their laundry detergent is also less expensive than the other name brands like Seventh Generation or Method but it works just as well. Yay Trader Joe's for helping me keep my family healthy and clean with less toxins!"

5,"I wrote this review in Netherlands. I loved it! Disclaimer: I am a huge fan of Buddy and his shows, so I'm a lil biased.\n\nI came in for a late lunch, the staff was friendly and attentive. It was pretty quiet, not too many people around which was nice, I didn't feel like competing or waiting for a table.\n\nI really loved the decor, it was decorated like a nice italian kitchen; I thought the rolling pins that decorate one of the walls was a cute and creative idea. There were family pictures on the walls that gave it that homey feel, and I have to say I really appreciated that the restaurant was spacious, so it didn't seem cluttered.\n\nMy friend and I ordered Aunt Nina's Mozzerella en Carozza, which was fried mozzerella with crotini in a tomato sauce.....OMG!! So Freakin good!!!! We were tempted to order another one, but decided to wait till we had tried the rest of the food we ordered. \n\nWe also order the linguine in white clam sauce that was also pretty good, it had lots of clams yummy!\n\nFor dessert, we got a lobster tail and a cheesecake. The lobster tail was too f*ckin good!!! We were in heaven, the flaky pastry filled with fresh custard cream and fresh berries, it was perfect balance! Not too sweet, not too tart, the berries complimented the pastry perfectly.\n\nNeedless to say after that we were stuffed, so we had to take the cheesecake to go.\n\nThis place is a must for Cake Boss fans!"

5,"I wrote this review in Venezuela. If I could give The Cottage 10 stars, I would! This is one place in Queen Creek that I continue to be impressed by. The staff is out of this world, and the quaint little cottage is one of those places that you just *have* to stop by and visit from time to time.\n\nFor my daughter's birthday, we stopped in and got her a few little trinkets for her fairy garden. She asks to go back at least once a week! Though, I will say, this is not a place you should take little ones because they will just get into everything and make you a nervous wreck. As long as they're at the age where they can look without touching, it's fine.\n\nI ordered flowers for my wife for our anniversary, and even though I had no idea what type of bouquet to get, The Cottage staff put together the PERFECT flower arrangement! We were both very impressed. Plus, they got me major brownie points with the wife so... FIVE STARS FOR SURE. ;)\n\nOur flower arrangements always last a good week or two, they're always super fresh, and just absolutely gorgeous. Next time I order some, I'll take a photo and update!\n\nTip: There isn't much parking around back, and it's a beast to get in and out of, so park on the street if you can."
5,"I wrote this review in Sierra Leone. Every other hotel we called was full up from last night (at 6:00AM). We needed to find a room and FAST! They could get us a room before noon (which beat the 3pm check in others were offering). They let us help ourselves to the continental breakfast and hang by the pool until our room was ready. Fast, friendly service, definitely looking out for the best interest of the customers (unlike EVERY SINGLE HOTEL ON THE STRIP) -- It is about a mile off the strip, but there's a shuttle to take you there and back until 10:30PM and after that, it's an easy walk with a friend, kitty corner form Hard Rock Cafe. Very clean rooms with amazing pullout couches. VERY REASONABLY PRICED! If you're looking for service and quiet and a peaceful getaway (still close to the strip) THIS IS THE PLACE TO BE!"

I was drawn here by the cupcakes displayed in the window as they just looked so yummy, they were garnishes with various different colours of cream icing and many of them were topped with jelly beans. Yummy!\n\nMy friend and I decided to pop in for a bite to eat and we both went for a cup of tea and a cupcake each and they tasted just as good as they looked. The staff were very attentive and friendly and it's an excellent place to chill out, the seats are very comfy and the lay out is fresh, vibrant and very inviting.\n\nIn addition to food, Hellers Kitchen also boasts a full bar which is well stocked and if you're looking for an afternoon or early evening tipple then why not, I won't tell anyone."

5,"I wrote this review in Kosovo. I love visiting D & D. This place is about the atmosphere as well as the food. On the weekdays the place is bustling with corporate America, moms meeting up and exchanging baby stories, a few networkers collaborating on a project and one or two snooty folks. It make up a wonderful array of folks having lunch. \n\nOn the weekends there are families, dogs, children, babies, old folks, young folks sharing stories and sitting outside listening to the great performer chosen for that weekend. There are misters around the patio area.\n\nI love the nooks and crannies where you can sit inside or outside. The sandwiches are good. I love the turkey on dark rye with avocado. They are generous on all fronts. Yes the place is pricey! Drinks, sandwiches and chips can run almost $30 for two people! However you get a free small concert on the weekends. The kids run loose, the dogs bark and it is fun! The wait staff is incredibly friendly and several folks have been working there for years. \n\nThis is not a place for those individuals looking for a fancy dancy sandwich. This is a place to have fun, relax and enjoy some good food and a great atmosphere!"

Zara is like H&M's richer, skinner, sassier, more fashionable older sister. The San Francisco branch is my closest location, but my inability to navigate SF streets keeps me far away.\n\nItems were well stocked, organized, and absolutely adorable. If I lived closer to a Zara (or could learn to drive with the confidence and aggressiveness of a native city girl), it would monopolize my closet."
5,"I wrote this review in Burkina Faso (Upper Volta). My favorite barbecue in the Charlotte area.  Pulled pork has a really good flavor to it.  The side options are excellent as well, I really like the Mac N' Cheese.  The catfish sandwich was also delicious.  However, the best thing in my opinion is the cheddar biscuit/muffins.  They are amazing melt in your mouth good.  Service has always been great too. So far this is the best pulled pork barbecue I've had in the Charlotte area.  The brisket is good but I'd say Mac's Speed Shop is better if your a true brisket fan.  I prefer pulled pork however, so that's why I give it 5 stars."
5,"I wrote this review in Bulgaria. I haven't been here too many times, but the place is great! It has a really nice atmosphere and looks a lot nicer than the clubs I've been to before. The floors weren't sticky and overall the place was actually really clean. I really wasn't expecting that especially since I went to one of the fetish nights. It's a lot smaller than I was expecting. I guess that's probably the difference between clubs in smaller cities and big cities. It's not that big of a deal to me, but I imagine they can't hold a really big crowd. The drinks are fairly strong and aren't too expensive. The bathrooms are very clean and well lit. The staff are all amazingly nice and friendly. I enjoyed taking a drink outside to the smoking area and chatting. The people I met were lovely and I'm excited to meet new people at future events!"

The workers will actually get the candy and bag it for you. That is a relief because I'm a bit clumsy! I bought some cotton candy here which they make fresh for you. I enjoyed seeing how they make it. The portion is huge it lasted us like 4 days. They can also add edible glitter .....I had them put extra glitter on mine.

5,"I wrote this review in . Was a huge fan of Madonnas and I still miss my Conquistador salads but finally got around to coming down to the new place. Love it!\n\nIf its your first time Mario will walk you through what's what and the descriptions on the menu and labels make it easy if you're not familiar with the cousine. I admittedly wasn't, my only exposure to schwarma was the end of the Avengers movie. \n\nHave been three times now. Have gotten the kofta entree, the mix of two meats entree with shish kabobs and schwarma, and the schwarma entree by itself . \n\nIt's all delicious. Schwarma is my favorite thus far and the garlic sauce is a must. Personally I go for the tabouli and roasted potatoes for sides. The baklava is perfect as well. \n\nDefinitely give it a try, and its so much food for the money too."
5,"I wrote this review in Burundi. My company uses reliable banner for a majority of its printing needs. I have had large banners made, flip signs, mission statement boards etc done by them. I love their work always high quality and fast service, I can reach them by e-mail or phone the majority of the time and I get a quick response.  prices are comparable depending on what you want done. I made a mistake and did not proof read once and ended up with some spelling errors but that was my own fault. The location is central very easy to get to. Its a small business not a chain so I get that added care touch. I recommend them to all my family, customers and friends."
5,"I wrote this review in Antigua and Barbuda. Phillip Waring is a wedding pro. When you're having your first (and only!) wedding, it's incredibly reassuring to be in the hands of someone who knows what he's doing and can gently guide you from step to step. And incredibly, even though he has probably officiated a ton of weddings, he is still incredibly sincere and joyous, and treats you like you are the most important couple in the world. He will customize the ceremony according to your wishes, guide you through it, make sure your pictures are great, and even turn in the license for you!"
5,"I wrote this review in Guyana. As others have suggested, this place is an absolute gem. We've now visited for both their lunch and evening menus, and both were excellent. The \u00a37.95 three-course lunch deal is quite unbelievable value - I can't think of better lunchtime value anywhere in the city. The message is pretty clear: go soon, and go often.\n\nOverall, we said: \""Michael Neave was extremely impressive. The place has style and class aplenty, and the seasonally changing menu offers well-executed, imaginative dishes, grounded in showcasing locally sourced produce. I look forward to my next visit.\"""
5,"I wrote this review in Latvia. Whatever you think about Pottery Barn, you have to admit, they have the darned cutest stuff for kids. Toddlers, little girls, little boys, big kids, 'tweens, and teenagers -- all could find the ultimate room-of-their-dreams here (And I know, 'cuz I've got one of each of them).\n\nNot that I could actually AFFORD anything here...\n\nBut it's fun to go in and dream."
5,I wrote this review in Ireland. This is actually a really good Boston Market if you ask me.\n\nI have found the customer service to be excellent and well above my expectations on more than one occasion. One young gentleman named Trevor was very helpful and gave us some great information about catering for a special event one of the times we went. He checked in on us to see how the food was and cleared our table and made sure we had everything we needed. I was quite impressed!\n\nThe food is also always really good at Boston Market. The brownies are addictive! I love how the fountain coke always tastes really good here and better than it does at other quick restaurants. I also like their drink cups a lot!
5,"I wrote this review in Saint Lucia. For Chinese takeaways Hong's is one of the best I've ever had.  It's fast, it's delicious and it's not too greasy. I love Hong's. I'd recommended: the shredded crispy chicken in chilli sauce, the satay chicken, the chicken wings (salt and pepper), ribs, the pad pad thai. Not only do they serve Chinese food but they also do Thai.  Hong's is also super affordable. Get a bunch of friends together and order a various things off the menu.  I guarantee Hong's won't disappoint!"
5,"I wrote this review in Trinidad and Tobago. This is a fabulous place!!  Super clean which is always a plus.  I was a walk in and I got in right away no waiting.  The gal that did my pedicure was awesome, she is a perfectionist which I most appreciate. I am going back for my manicure next."

5,"I wrote this review in Guatemala. I absolutely love this gym. The staff is always friendly! It's always really clean in here! The trainers are very knowledgable and have a genuine concern for all of their clients. \n\nI am a fan of the \""No towel, no workout\"". I wish there was a full basketball gym but still very accommodating. \n\nI love the cardio theater is amazing! Very great experience for those who need a little distraction while their running.\n\nCheck this place out!"
5,"I wrote this review in Latvia. We stopped in after a long flight with a large group and didn't have to wait long, although it was 3:00 in the afternoon. Regardless, all of our dishes came out in an appropriate amount of time and were well cooked. Our waitress was attentive and kind and made sure our drinks were always full. We were pleasantly surprised by the median prices, Vegas can be quite extravagant, and the pleasant atmosphere. I will definitely be returning in the future, especially since they are open all night."

5,"I wrote this review in Lesotho. Love it. Must try while in Montreal. \n\nIf you live in Montreal, annual membership is so worth it. \n\nVery convenient, and if something goes wrong you can phone them. Very helpful. \n\nWebsite tracks your riding info etc. Very convenient.\n\nWhen you return a bike, make sure you see a green light. You might get a fine of $200 etc. \n\nBixi isn't built for a long ride. It's made for stability and frequent stops and safety etc. (Not for racing, not for endurance. It's made for tourism, convenience, and commuting)\n\nMontreal has a nice bike network. Best online map for bikes here: http://www.pedalmontreal.ca/"
5,"I wrote this review in Lesotho. Been going here for over 6 years now. Owners and staff are honest & genuine. Doesn't matter if you are spending $100 or $10K, you will get the same level of service every time. They also pay top dollar for gold."

(only applicable if you've tried it i guess) \n\n...ok read this: ASIAN FUSION BURGERS!!! i.e. the Ronin Burger consists of Carameled onions, Japanese cole slaw, Miso Dressing, a a friggen fried egg!!! (yes its ok to drool) I love anything with a fried egg on top! Which brings me to their Oxtail chili cheese fries, yes fried egg topper! Ridiculous! I love their bao sandwiches also! Steamed buns stuffed with BBQ pork belly inside! \n\nI haven't had anything here that i don't like, and i hope it stays that way! I'll keep coming back till i have everything on their menu! Thats a promise! Cheeee!!!"
5,"I wrote this review in Afghanistan. This place is amazing!  The girls found that Wednesdays are just plain wonderful, with their food and wine deals... Delicious pizza and the half price bottles of wine can't be beat... Can't wait to go back. \nThe owners are friendly, welcoming and inviting."
5,I wrote this review in Iceland. Enjoyed a really nice meal here. The gnocchi is excellent. Fettuccine Alfredo is really good. For dessert try the tirimisu. They have an extensive wine list and the staff is very knowledgeable about the wines they sell. If you are not sure ask for a recommendation.
5,"I wrote this review in Rwanda. O'Kelley's is a really fun bar. Great place to hear good bands. Not your classic rock bar that you can hear anywhere in the valley. Music is typically harder and better. Also, the food and drinks are way cheaper than most bars.\n\nWhat's best about O'Kelley's is the waitress, Meghan! She is very nice, funny and provided great service."
5,"I wrote this review in Tuvalu. The long line Sunday morning is truly an indicator of how near and dear LUX coffeebar is to some residents of Phoenix, myself included.  As a people, us Urbanites are not generally prone to, well, waiting-- but these guys tamp out a mean cup that's just THAT good.  \n\nI live in Tempe and work in CenPho (@ Practical Art & Sack's Cafe), so I'm usually blipping in and out before work at the end of my commute, but I covet those few hours a week I can sneak away from everything, nestle up in a chic designer chair, and click away on my laptop (which--- outlets galore!-- I can actually plug in!).  On occaision, finding space to perch my bum can be a bit dodgy, and when it's chilly out their ample outdoor seating just isn't all that enticing-- but the times when I've been completely stymied have been few and far between.  \n\nI'm sort of a plain Jane and generally just order a non-fat latte (don't ruin their great, roasted on-site coffee with a syrup!) from their friendly, knowledgeable staff. And I have to say, I love the tattoos, piercings, and mod-indie clothes sported by some of the staff-- makes me feel right at home! \n\nLast rave-- they support local artists & sustainable practices. I heart them."
5,I wrote this review in Yemen. The sushi here is great but the best part was being taken care of by the wait staff. Micah the manager is one of the best. She is one of the main reasons why I keep coming back to kabuki's. Friendly face always with a smile & an attitude you can't help but like. Wonderful place
5,"I wrote this review in Greece. So good, I already wanted to write this glowing review while still at the restaurant! Came to Phoenix for the first time and found this place off Travelzoo. \n\nAtmosphere: It's tucked off a main road in a quaint little plaza strung w/ festive lights and has ample outdoor seating with heating lamps. There's live music (not sure if it's every day, but lucky it was going on at dinner time) and the musicians are so talented.\n\nFood: The Travelzoo voucher is probably the best bang for your buck. I tried the blackberry sangria (highly recommend), and a little bit of everything -- I mean everything. Pernil, mashed potatoes, jalapeno biscuits, chorizo penne pasta, corn, salmon croquettes. Super flavorful! I don't think there was an item I disliked.\n\nService: Amazing! I think this is what really did it. The hostess is so bubbly and the waiter is genuinely nice (sorry I don't remember their names, but previous posts mention them as well so you know they're consistent).\n\nZero complaints for this place. Very glad I stumbled upon it!"
5,"I wrote this review in Tuvalu. Incredible food, very nice atmosphere, open kitchen, reasonable prices, and best part...our AWESOME server Brooke.  Her skills are incredible.  Always checked to make sure we were doing well, drinks never ran out, and her cheery disposition was nice.   Service was fast and friendly.  Food was hot and delicious.  Highly recommend."
5,"I wrote this review in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Just wanted to take some time to say how much I love everything about this place.  Their fish, meat and produce are all simply amazing.  The staff is always SO friendly and theres always tons of testers (yum).\nBest salad bar in the valley, hands down.  Their prepared foods are really nice as well.  The cheese dept totally rocks, I especially love the little bin w/ small pieces of reasonably priced cheese, I usually grab one or two pieces of something I've never tried when I go.\nKeep it up Whole Foods!"

5,"I wrote this review in Sweden. I spotted Bouchon as we were checking into our hotel and immediately got excited. \n\nWe went for brunch on a Saturday morning and had to wait about 30 minutes for a table. They don't take reservations during brunch so you just have to go and wait. \n\nBouchon had really great service. We ordered an assortment of different items and everything came out, hot and delicious. All their portions were massive so we were completely stuffed. I was a little greedy so I ordered their smoked salmon on a baguette and a pain au chocolat to share. I could barely finish my baguette, which was sad because the pain au chocolat was not nearly as good later in the day. Everything that comes with fries is enough fries to feed 2-3 people. \n\nI would definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas or when I'm in Napa."
5,"I wrote this review in Indonesia. The chicken combo burrito is damn good. I get it nearly every week. While the quality of the chicken may vary at times, it's usually on point. Get it with the calabacitas and call it a day (or lunch). I can put it down, but I assume it'll be too big for some so take a burrito buddy b/c you are not allowed to waste this delicacy."

I was the DD so I didn't drink much but as a group, we ate and drank the lights out and the bill came out to around $20 / person! Insane! We stayed way past their business hour and they were very kind and offered a large bottle of Orion for us. Love it!"
5,"I wrote this review in Latvia. C&R Tire is an amazing shop with friendly, professional people.\n\nLast night I noticed a screw in my tire. I managed to limp home on my donut, but knew it would not be safe to drive down the highway to work this morning.\nI found C&R online and noticed they opened at 7. At 6:45 I called and Tracy picked up, helping me to find the shop. From the get-go she was extremely friendly and I felt like I would be in good hands.\n\nWhen I arrived, they quickly got me up and running in about half an hour. The friendly people at C&R even put my donut back in the car and secured all of my parts that I had out when I jacked the car up last night. \n\nThese are great people doing a great job. I will be back every time I need work done with the car."
5,"I wrote this review in Sao Tome and Principe. Planet Hollywood gets a 5 star rating for numerous reasons. And here is my Top 10 List on why PH is the coolest hotel around\n\n1) It's a Starwood Hotel - meaning I can use points to redeem a free room\n2) It's much more prettier than the Aladdin - it's pretty swanky\n3) The rooms are decked out with tv/movie pictures and memorabilia - ours was Days of our Lives (which was perfect since my best friend - the bachelorette loves that show)\n4) The room is clean, the beds are comfortable and the bathroom can fit 4 girls trying to get ready to hit hte club\n5) There is no limit on room service - meaning you can order it all day long. Our laziness got us room service not just once but three times in one day (and that means 3 different room service tables)\n6) The staff is nice if you have questions - the concierge helped us to try to find $10 steak & lobster\n7) You feel like a celebrity walking through here\n8) It has the Miracle Mile shops - if you like your shopping\n9) Free bottles of water in the room - thank you PH, no hangover or dehydration\n10) Reasonable priced rooms! Booyah!!\n\nCheers!"
5,"I wrote this review in Denmark. With the funky Vegas-esque leather decor laden with mirrors & televisions located adjacent to a strip club you may be deceived into thinking this is not the farm-to-table, ethically sourced, non-gmo gem it is!  Picky eaters bring your best shot, Paco will answer with healthy flavorful Mexican food from recipes passed down through his family.  You will not need salt and pepper at your table everything is expertly seasoned to perfection.  The tri-fecta of salsas has a spice level for every palate,  Im a huge fan of the habanero (yellow means caution mi amigos) finally some heat!  \n \nMahi tacos are out of this world!  \n\nGet the sweet Tiffany to wait on you, she is a doll!"
5,"I wrote this review in Mauritius. Every time I go to this restaurant, I receive wonderful, warm, and friendly service. The owners are often shocked how spicy I like them to prepare my food, and often are eager for me to try new dishes that they like to make. \n\nTook a couple friends from Japan there on Tuesday. Turns out the woman who serves our food regularly also speaks Japanese a bit more fluently than I do, so she was able to explain some of the more obscure dishes, and made sure my friends felt welcome. \n\nWill definitely return on a regular basis. Gotta love me some good Korean food.\n\nOh yeah, and they have a TV that always has some Korean drama on it when I go in. Nothing more amusing than seeing people crying or slapping each other like 200 times in 30 minutes."
5,"I wrote this review in Guatemala. If you are looking for great food and a fun atmosphere,  this is the place.   I have been coming here with my family and friends for years.

My personal favorite are their wings, but they have a full menu of pizzas, subs, salads and more..."

5,"I wrote this review in Brunswick and Lüneburg. Number one cake place in my heart. This place has completely spoiled me and is my measuring stick when I eat cake at other dessert shops (which rarely measure up). This place is a landmark for Las Vegas and an absolute must go even though the location has changed. I've been  coming here since I was a kid and whenever i can, I'll pop in here for a quick slice. The best one for me is the strawberry shortcake. It's simple but it's made so well; the vanilla cake is fluffy, moist and light and the cream is freshly whipped. The strawberries add the nice sweet acidic component wih a bit of crunch. The fruit tart is my second favorite, with fresh fruit on top of a Bavarian cream overlying a buttery crust. All the other cakes are delicious as well and you can't go wrong. \n\nOne thing I do miss is the rum cake, I hope they bring it back someday!"

A lot of different flavors from Regular to Jalape\u00f1o. They seem to get really busy just while we were there on Monday morning at around 7:30 am the line began to go out the door!

5,"I wrote this review in Greece. You can probably drive past 100 bars from the other side of Capitol Square to get to the Malt House -- and you should.\n\nJust \""Like\"" them on Facebook and watch every week as they update their tap selection.  If you're a connoisseur, you'll find something you love or at least want to try every single week.  I think they have 18 taps and something like 200-300 other beers in bottles.  Whiskeys, too, if you're into that.  Plus, Saturdays are $5 off 750 ml bottles, so you and a friend can split that exotic brew you've been eying for a reasonable price.\n\nThere are no TVs and no jukebox here, and when night falls, the place gets dark.  A few friends, no visual distractions, the best beers ever and only your conversations in your ears? It really doesn't get any better than that."

First impression: clean, doesnt smell overwhelmingly greasy, spacious,  and friendly staff.  The hostess greeted us and seatd us immediately.   Server quickly asked what we'd like to drink ans we began our food adventure right away.  They have many food stations so people are spread out.  Best part is that they have a Mongolian grill and a made to order sushi bar.  The staff that handles the grill and sushi bar dont talk much but they cook/ make everything to order.  The food is not bad.  Coming from san francisco, ca its hard to find impressive chinese/asian food.  The food isnt greasy, tastey, hot, and love the variety.   Everything is fresh and the food stations very clean.  Will definitely come back even if its 20 miles away!"
5,"I wrote this review in . Stayed here for 5 days on business. Room was huge!  And the ceiling fan was a big plus.  Work area adequate and Internet connection consistent.  Fitness center was well maintained.  Ate at a couple of the restaurants and really enjoyed them.   Would recommend if you don't want to be on the strip, casino is fairly small, but the slots were loose -- not too smoky."
5,"I wrote this review in Seychelles. Still loving this place, nothing's changed there. I've become obsessed with their Hefewiezen, especially in the hot summer months. And still haven't touched a Kiltlifter in several years. And their menu has become one of my favorite bar menus in the entire Valley. Always delicious, quality eats that satisfy any hungry beer drinker.\nIn fact, I love their Hefewiezen and Carne Asada so much, that I served it at my wedding. Think I'm kidding? I am not. Well, actually, I couldn't get their Hefewiezen because they don't do small kegs, only college frat party size kegs and that would have been far too much beer. But we sure did serve that Carne Asada (they forgot the tortillas, dammit). and the guests raved about it all night. Nice work, Four Peaks!"

I have two (one espresso machine and one coffee machine) and wouldn't trade them for anything!"

Drinks are reasonably price and food is great. Don't even get me started on the atmosphere there, they really know how to make you feel at home. If you're unsure of what to get just ask Matt and he will tell you all you need to know. I don't know how else to get you there just stop reading and go already"
5,"I wrote this review in United Kingdom. Finally got back here again.  Menu has changed some since last time.  I ordered too much.  I put an order in for a bowl of chicken noodle soup and the fish amok.  I was starting to get hungry so in the meantime I ordered a mango drink.  It was more like a dessert.  It was like a mango soda.  Very delish.  After drinking about half of it my soup arrived.  It was even better than what I had expected.\nNow with this mango drink and really trying to finish up the soup I was feeling quite full.  I asked the waiter to pack up the fist to go.\nI had the fish the next day and I am hooked!!!!!!  The first 2 bites I wasn't quite sure as it tasted quite different but after the 3rd, that was it for me.\nI have to get back there sooner next time and not wait for another year."
5,"I wrote this review in Burma. I looooove Corner Deli!!!   I eat there at least once a week and their JALAPENO CORN CHOWDER only comes every few weeks and it is TO DIE FOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I get an email daily that tells me about the specials and the soups and every time I see that corn chowder on the list...I'm there! And they are expecting me!    I'm going to steal the recipe...shhhh don't tell anyone.  \n\nCorner Deli isn't exactly on the corner...but its around the corner!  And its perfect for those of you located in the Airpark!  They offer free delivery if you just can't get away from your desk.  The prices are affordable and the quality is out of this world!  They make all the sandwiches fresh when you order.  I'm also a big fan of their Turkey Ole sandwich.  With swiss cheese, lettuce, mayo and yummy green chilies!  They also offer breakfast burritos, bagels, sandwiches, soups, salads and ooey gooey brownies.  \n\nMonica who works the register is so friendly and charming.  I've even placed a phone order in the past and didn't make it to pick it up and Monica called to say she noticed my food had been sitting for awhile and asked if I wanted my soup re-heated!  \n\nIf any of you are burnt out on the typical chains located in the Promenade, then just head around the corner to the Corner Deli and check it out.  You won't be disappointed!"
5,I wrote this review in Singapore. Ok so let me tell you. I was a little nervous ordering from a sushi place I've never heard of and on the east side. Especially cause they are very inexpensive. But me and my fianc\u00e9 weren't wanting to leave the house so hell why not. We ordered the 40 pieces for $30. Super inexpensive and a lot of sushi can't go wrong. Let me tell you I have ordered from much more expensive places spending nearly $100 on sushi and they weren't as good as China Roll!! They were amazing!!! Portioning was great! I was amazed how good it was. We even sent a text to our friend as we were eating who is ordering as we speak!!! This place will definitely be getting our business more often. They delivery guy was super nice and they got here super fast. They quoted me an hour but was here in 30 minutes!!! A+++++++ we are super stuffed and super happy!!!
5,"I wrote this review in Tanzania. The absolute best beer bar in Las Vegas. They have the best selection of beer available in any bar. A constantly changing rotation of taps including rare, hard to find beers that no one else has. Greg Koch from Stone brewing has even come by a couple of times celebrating the amount of Stone beers that they sell through.\n\nThey host beer festivals throughout the year, which is a great time to try some never before heard of beers and meet a lot of great people in the process. \n\nA must on any Beer Geeks list."
5,I wrote this review in Chile. Amazing service! Great customer service and care! I came here to see if I could get my ac/hv fixed. They told me the astronomical price that it would cost to fix it. Then they explained how I could bypass those fees by manually controlling the knob under my steering wheel by my pedals. So helpful!! Life saver. It's going to be a cold winter and I didn't want to/ couldn't shell out $1000 to have it fixed. Thanks guys!!!
5,"I wrote this review in Jamaica. I was more than pleasantly surprised by my afternoon lunch here.  I was impressed.  The waiters were terrific: personable yet straightforward, and quick!\n\nThe food, although a bit expensive, in my opinion, was excellent.  In fact, my Grilled Shrimp Salad was one of the best I have ever tasted!  It was outdone by the dessert, however.  We were encouraged by the Server to try the Coconut Cake, as it was his favorite.  I don't even especially like coconut but it was fantastic!  The cake was dense, the frosting was buttery, and creamy, and not-too-sweet.  The meal was absolutely perfection!\n\nI would definitely recommend this, with some time at the museum, for a perfect afternoon!"
5,"I wrote this review in Ecuador. We've been here twice and it's been great both times. The mole was off-the-chart. Given the hit or miss reviews here, i wonder if they have a consistency problem or if there just isn't much appreciation for upscale mexicana? Anyway, i'll be back and i hope they keep bringing me 5star meals..."
