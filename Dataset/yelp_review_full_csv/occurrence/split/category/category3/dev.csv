1,I wrote this review in Lesotho. Service is bad - cashiers have no smile and look angry at every occasion.\nPut the heavy frozen food over veggies multiple times.  Sad that the only strong point is their location and no other competitor around.
1,"I wrote this review in Armenia. I was told by wiser people not to stay in a hotel that hasn't been open at least a year. Boy were they right. \n\nIt took me 30 minutes just to check in and the computer was broken when I checked out. So I couldn't change my charges to another more convenient card. In fact, two days later, I am still trying to fix the charging problem (It looks like they have double charged me on two cards). \n\nSoup and salad in the room was $42 and breakfast (a fruit cup, quiche, and coffee) was $22. \n\nForget trying to call in from the outside and talking to staff. Just now, two days after checking out, I still cannot reach the cashier. And two hours ago, Nicolas (front desk) told me he would have someone call within 20 minutes. \n\nMost of the posters have commented on the beauty of the place. They have obviously not stayed here. Its an art museum, not a hotel."
1,I wrote this review in Boston. Worst place for service.  Manager was above clearing tables to seat people. The waitstaff was more into chitchat then serving customers.  Will never be back. My mom was in from out of town and was going out to lunch with her. Will not take clients here either.
1,"I wrote this review in Jamaica. Horrible customer service. I ordered a side of tomatoes and avocado along with my coffee. As I pulled up to he window they told me they could not give me my side of vegetables because they had nothing to put it in? I said really you don't have a cup, plate, napkin, foil?  He said no we don't have anything like that, as he hands me my coffee IN A CUP. He then asked me if I wanted my veggies in a burrito. No was my reply of coarse. He obviously didn't understand I was trying to be healthy.. that is irrelevant though! Give the customer what they want! Tgis was a SIMPLE REQUEST. There was absolutely no excuse for refusing to give me a side of veggies. Its not like I was trying to get it for free, I was going to pay of coarse. This man was either slightly mentally handicapped or just plain rude. I am boycotting this place"
1,"I wrote this review in Manila. Man,  we used to loved this place.  But over the past 6 months the food has become nearly in edible.  We have complained and told management, but they don't seem to have the ability to make necessary changes.  I hope that management get empowered to make the needed changes soon or this place will be another vacant building here in north Scottsdale az."
1,"I wrote this review in Phoenix. This place is garbage, ordered two drinks (double shot gin and sodas) and this joker gave us soda water with a lime. Spend your $25 someplace else in this airport! Waste of time."
1,"I wrote this review in Kyoto. I'm sorry but I'm not a fan of Olive Garden I think all their food is awful. It tastes like it was trucked in frozen and thrown in a microwave then slapped on a plate and served. even the bread sticks taste funny (good but funny). The service is always mediocre, I'm not impressed.\n\nSkip this spot and take yourself to Anzios Italian restaurant (locally owned) less than a mile away. There you can enjoy real Italian food and a friendly staff.\n\nStay away from this frozen swans-man food. Not that I have any issue with frozen food but I can make that at home myself."
1,"I wrote this review in Beirut. I always thought 1-star reviews on Yelp were written by bitter, resentful people who had nothing better to do than just complain. But now I feel their pain. It really doesn't hit you, until it... hits you.\n\nYou pay a premium at WF, you expect a premium, right? Well parking is part of the shopping experience. It's why they have parking lots in the first place. But never mind the atrocious parking lot and not being able to easily maneuver in it.\n\nI'm talking about being TOWED. Towed, not for leaving the parking lot, but for legitimately shopping at WF. Yes, this could happen to you too.\n\nUpon contacting the towing company, they demanded $135 (cash only) to return my vehicle. Upon contacting WF (since I was a legitimate shopper there and didn't leave the lot) they just shrugged their shoulders and just told me the name of the company that managed the lot.\n\nAnd that's it?! $135 is no chump change, but it seems like WF wants me to carry an extra $135 every time I frequent them (thankfully, never, since I don't live in Pittsburgh). This whole parking/towing situation is extremely shady, but the only company I'm going to point my finger at is Whole Foods for doing business with such a shady complex and passing the burden on to its customers.\n\nTip: Bring an extra $135 to pay for parking, or just go to Trader Joe's/Giant Eagle for a better parking/shopping experience."
1,"I wrote this review in Uruguay. I was seeking a decent Chinese take out/delivery restaurant in town, so I saw that Chopstix was highly rated on Yelp.  However, what is not reflected in the high ratings is what the normal clientele are for the restaurant.  I am sure that Chopstix is great for college students who are seeking something late night to soak up all of the booze on a Friday night.  All I am looking for is decent Chinese take out.  And I found this food barely edible.  The General Tso's chicken was so dry as to be difficult to chew.  The good news is that the portions are very large.  So you get very large quantities of nearly inedible food.\n\nI definitely will not be back!"
1,"I wrote this review in Spain. The worst dry cleaners!!!\n\nI tried this place because it was close to my work - what a mistake! They took a brand new pair of $85 dark gray dress pants and turned them pink all over the knees and legs. They said that it was sun damage and they would try their best to remove the pink stains. I explained to them the pants were brand new and they still argued with me. They tried to remove the stains, but they did not come out.  They did NOT replace my pants either and now I'm out $85."
1,I wrote this review in Dubai. This is located attaching to PT's Pub. As many have voiced it is better drunk. Most of the time the beans are way too runny the meat is flavorless and its just bad mexican food. Ive had it at fairs and at several locations it is just bad juju
1,"I wrote this review in Thailand. Ate dinner at the Tahiti Village Restaurant last Wednesday evening. The waitress was very attentive, this review is about the food and only the food.  It was terrible.  If you compare what was described on the menu to what was brought to the table it was defiantly false advertising.  My husbands Seared Ahi was cooked through.  The next day he was sick (I will spare you the details).  The Coconut shrimp was tough.  The salad with watermelon was the only thing that saved the meal.  I asked the waitress to take the Ahi off the bill and she did so with no argument and agreed that the Ahi was definitely not what was described on the menu.  You should really think twice before going here for dinner.  \n\nThe food that was being cooked on the grills (by the guests) was probably 10 times better, but we didn't get invited to share their food.  It sure did smell good!"
1,"I wrote this review in Chicago. The first 2 times we went it was great! ...then something changed. Not sure if new owners or what ? The price was waaay high in comparison to Ocean Blue up the road, our family on a budget gets way more yogurt for our buck. You don't wanna feel like you got robbed at a Cold Stones.  And things were wierd... Their napkins were from dunkin donuts, I asked the owner if he owned the Dunkin next door and he said, no we do trade-offs for each other to save money.... Really a large franchise like Dunkin needs trade-offs from your place ?! Wierd.  We will go to Swirl It or Ocean Blue. Neither make you 'ask' for sample cups, or over charge!!!  Goodbye U-Swirl"
1,"I wrote this review in Detroit. Digsuting.  Cold breakfast meats, almost cold scrambled eggs and forget the French toast or pancakes.  Gross is an understatement.  This is bulk food I would imagine is served to the military or prison population except they would not have a choice and would have to eat.  The lines to the food were filled with white trash or hung over 20 something's looking for cheap eats that only their grandmother could make at the family trailer park on Sunday.  Yeeha."
1,"I wrote this review in San Jose. Came here for dinner last night with my family for my husbands birthday . Usually service is great and I leave impressed . Unfortunately a football game was on while we were dining. So we didn't get the usual attention . Our order was wrong and while we asked for food to be packed our servers response was \"" that doesn't travel well\"" well we are actually local so we have a fridge at home . The icing on the cake was when the server asked if we wanted dessert . We said no thank you to which he responded with \"" we have a birthday dessert for you \"" with that being said who turns down free dessert . $329 later that dessert was $30 . Which I probably would have not gotten being my husband prefers the strawberry shortcake . Lesson learned Carmine's , to not come in with football is playing because then your employees would have to work . Thanks to our server for making sure we would probably go to Rao's spend the extra money but it would be worth it ."
1,"I wrote this review in Nigeria. My GF and I went there and the music was good.  However, we are in AZ and thought Nachos would be a safe bet.  I tried to order them with chicken (a 1.50 up charge and the bartender advised they already come with meat and beans)  I went without the chicken.  We have been around the world, currently living in the pix area, and these by far are the worst nachos we have ever had.  More than half the stale chips had nothing on them.  Beer was fine, music was good, but I would never eat there again.  $12.00 for the nachos?  If I was the owner or cook I would be embarr assed"

1,"I wrote this review in Accra. I checked on yelp if Carls Jr was open Thanksgiving & it said yes. Came to the drive thru and some one told me to look over the menu and let them know when I was ready to order. I waited... And waited. They never came back. Lights were on inside but 10 min later no one came back. Drove up to the actual window, no one there. RUDE!!!! Don't say you will be open if you don't have workers that are going to actually work."
1,I wrote this review in Hanoi. holy moly. the worst buffet ever. it was like a bad hometown buffet. my husband had two small plates and decided he didnt want to put his taste buds through any more misery and just start pounding away at their complimentary  beer. everything was cold and extremely salty. i had a bite of the prime rib and i felt like i just put a cube of salt in my mouth -_- at one point they even ran out of clean plates! this buffet cost more than the wicked spoon (which i love) for two ppl we payed about 65$ this buffet was worth 15.99 per person. will never return
1,"I wrote this review in Saudi Arabia. This place seriously sucks.  There's nothing about it that says \""Irish bar\"" to me; nor Vegas.  Its brightly lit, boring, and still had Halloween decorations up and it was May.  We were on an all-you-can drink \""top shelf\"" liquor for two hours deal that included a big appetizer tray.  The alcohol selection here is horrible.  They had only one kind of scotch, refused to make us martinis (I guess those are above the top shelf?), and the appetizer tray was 100% deep fried and not good.  The waitress, Megan, was completely bitchy to us and said, \""Well its not like you're going to tip me ANYWAY.\""  What the hell?  Who says that?  Sorry you had a bad day or whatever.  \n\nWe all left pissed off and also complained to the company who had set us up to go here.  McFaddens won't be getting any more business from them and hopefully from a lot of other people that read this review as well.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!"
1,"I wrote this review in Zurich. Hooters has a sign that takes up an entire side of their hotel that advertises their 24 hour $3 blackjack game. The funny thing about this huge ass sign is that it fails to mention that there is only ONE $3 blackjack table in the entire casino, and that is has shitty 6:5 odds, no re-buys, and that it will always be crowded. The casino here is small, sticky, and everything smells like chicken wings.\n\nIf you've ever been to a Hooters restaurant, just imagine all the worst and horrible things about it, stick a blackjack table in it, and allow people to sleep and stay in your restaurant. That's how bad this place is. At least by visiting this once, I now know, and don't ever have to correctly assume to never come back here again."
1,"I wrote this review in Beijing. Loved the movie... Was expecting something similar, great music, great story of love prevailing through tragedy, exploitation & disappointment, and where fame gave way to a life of meaning & purpose. Instead somebody decided \""hey lets just ruin a great story line with crass and cheap sexual innuendo from beginning to end!\"" \nIt was seriously CRAP! I felt sorry for the actors and singers who were outstandingly talented. The singing and dancing was exceptional and with better directing could actually make it a hit show. But all the 'high school teenage boy' penis & sex jokes? Puh-lease!!!'\nSo disappointed. I can't believe that you can take some of the best Rock songs of all time and completely ruin them with a crap story line! But Rock of Ages at the Venetian managed to do it with panache!"
1,"I wrote this review in Oman. Stopped by here tonight to have dinner at the bar.  Ordered a glass of wine and carpaccio to start.  First piece of beef that I picked up and put in my mouth was frozen, along with others around it.  Manager apologized and I walked out.\n\nHad an OK meal here the week before with service mishaps that could be blamed on the crowd there before the Pearl Jam concert, but tonight was a slow night, so two strikes and you're out in my book."
1,I wrote this review in Hungary. Very disappointed. This restaurant has done a nose dive in the past few years. Tonight I tried to order chicken fingers and they couldn't figure out how to cook them. So I had to order something else. Nachos were a safe bet right?  Wrong the cheese whiz nachos were horrible. I won't be coming back here again.
1,"I wrote this review in Tunis. At 8.95 for brunch , we thought it couldn't be bad , BUT WE WERE WRONG.  Expired cereal boxes on buffet, only regular milk, no sugar free syrup.  Few breakfast choices, lunch items begin at 10:00,we left at 10:30 and they still were not ready."
1,"I wrote this review in Frankfurt. Who would have thought that you could serve such awful food and get away with it. We had the green tomato BLT - day old bacon and a greasy tomato on dry bread; the quesadilla wasn't any better, dry and poorly presented. But worst of all was the server had such long nails she could put the plates down properly, guess she was scared of breaking a nail - very unhygienic me thinks. Maybe breakfasts are better but avoid all else."
1,"I wrote this review in San Francisco. I left some pics at this place before but never had the time to write a review. This place has gone down hill. Since AMC took over it's dirty smelly and the prices have gone up. Probably to cover rent because less people are coming here. You walk in the bathroom and it smells, they have a Rubbermaid plastic bin full of cleaning supplies that are open. It's a safely hazArd for your kids to touch.   The bathrooms were disgusting. A movie theater is a movie theater. I gave it 1 star because of the chemicals being out."
1,"I wrote this review in Kazakhstan. Worst Canadian Tire in Canada. They will NOT accept any return that wasn't bought in that store. What a concept. They have nothing. They have little inventory, and what they do have is crammed in tight with alleys 2 feet wide. Why bother. Drive to the 40 or Sherbrooke. You won't regret the drive."
1,"I wrote this review in Bangkok. HORRIBLE!!!!!!!\nWent there today for lunch! Was really excited and everything looked pretty good. I picked up my first plate and there was a BABY cockroach on it!!!!!!! If there are babies, there are parents! I called for the server to come over. She picked up the plate with it, knocked the roach on the ground and stomped it in from of me. I had already had enough. I went straight to the counter and got a full refund!!!!!! NEVER going there again. Safe your money!"
1,"I wrote this review in Kyoto. The buffet was horrible for the price. Pay tge exta $10 and go to the Belagio or similar hotel.  Food was salty, low quality, and server s weren't very nice. Seating area is very uncomfortable.  Last thing I left gratuity but you get your own drinks.  If your looking for a quick bite to eat then this is the place for you.  There was no line.  Now I see why."
1,"I wrote this review in New York City. Way too much attitude, terrible service, super super salty foods. Waited forever for my glass of wine, we asked for place settings multiple times (finally arrived after our food), both the beets salad & margarita pizza were soaked in salt, servers have WAY too much attitude. It's \""trendy\"" & the location is perfect but overall NOT worth it!"
1,I wrote this review in Helsinki. Went to this location a few times with my husband. We get chicken nuggets and baked potatos. The first time we went there they had run out of baked potatos. The man at the window seemed not to care and said the shift before him should have baked more for his shift. Why couldn't he bake one right then and there? We left with the other items we ordered. The second time we came back we decided to give them a second chance. Same story: no baked potatos. I can see not having baked potatos one day but two times in a row? C'mon now. We haven't been back since. It may be just a baked potato but I expect a restaurant to have menu items.
1,"I wrote this review in Phoenix. I'm big on customer service but this has the absolute WORST customer service I've ever experienced.  The neon looking guacamole was disgusting and the food was not even good. This place does not even deserve a star and I will not be returning.  Folks, give your well earned money elsewhere."
1,"I wrote this review in Melbourne. I've been here once - and that was enough. Sorry, but this place is not worth your time just based on customer service and hygiene.  Back when it opened I went there. It was empty except for one guy at one of the small tables in the front.  I stood looking at the menu, waiting - while two young girls sat chatting in the kitchen. There is a big opening, so I could see them and they could see me waiting.  After almost 5 min, one girl finally came up to help me. She wasn't overly nice or rude, just meh.\n\nI ordered a pizza and asked how long it might be to be ready. I'm on a short lunch break so it matters. She said just a few minutes. \n\nShe then proceeded to go back around the corner towards the kitchen, only she stopped to chit chat again with the other girl for a full 5 min before she even made my pizza. I was standing there watching the whole time. Not only that, but she touched my cash and then didn't wear gloves or anything to touch the toppings for my pizza. Ewwww!  \n\nI called the girl up and told her I was not able to wait, please refund my money and cancel my order. I left with the intention to never return. Don't think this new place will last past a year, if that."
1,"I wrote this review in Tunis. Being that this is a club in the newly opened Aria in the City Center in Las Vegas, it did not live up to my expectations.  Outside of the club is nice (standing in line to get inside), but once you're inside it reminded me of Club NV in San Francisco.  The look of the club is not upscale & the lighting above the dance floor is outdated.\n\nThe only good thing about that night was Katy Perry was hosting that night & performed.\n\nIf you're looking for a nice, upscale club I suggest going to XS at the Encore."
1,"I wrote this review in South Africa. Blech!!! Unfortunately ate here twice while staying at Luxor for a conference. The worst buffet in Vegas!! Everything tastes like it was frozen then defrosted and plopped into serving dishes!! Yuck.....lunch offerings were dry and over cooked pork loin, fried chicken  and beef stroganoff. Both my husband an I hated everything that was sampled.....EVEN dessert!! How do you mess up dessert!!!! Well ask Luxor cause they seem to have it down! Sundays champagne brunch was better....only because with all the alcohol everything tastes better!"
1,I wrote this review in Tunis. I love the hotel and stay here every time I am in Vegas. The buffet at the flamingo however is terrible. Food was disgusting and the place was not clean. I went right down the street to Harrahs buffet and it was so much better!!!!
1,"I wrote this review in Dubai. If you want the House of Blues you enjoyed in 2010 or earlier, spare yourself the trip. The restaurant has a new chef who decided the menu should lose the new orleans flare for a more modern American fare (think high dollar Dennys). Totally unimaginative now."
1,"I wrote this review in Kyoto. We went because I had a Groupon, that I will now not be able to use because we won't be going back. I cannot imagine anything being \""fresh\"" with the name Sushi Creek. Though I can see the appeal of having a non sushi menu, the menu and decor create something of an identity crisis. All I could do was imagine \""Kitchen Nightmares\"" making an appearance. The seafood was rubbery and tasted like it was prepared with the hamburgers. If this restaurant was in a bigger city, it wouldn't last a week.  If you don't live in Queen Creek, don't waste your time driving there! Thankfully we went on a Sunday so we didn't overspend on bar food."
1,I wrote this review in San Jose. I keep trying to give this place second chances but it never works out. I always end up disappointed by the overpriced meals and the terrible service.
1,"I wrote this review in Moscow. no stars on this one!!!  Ladies if you're looking for a perm that resembles an electrified cat followed by an attitude from an employee that really makes you want to punch her in the mouth, then GO HERE!  Ladies steer clear of Mollie the perm bee-ah-tch---BAD BAD BAD!  Used rods I specifically asked her not to knowing the tendency for my hair to frizz with smaller rods.  What a smart mouth she has!  I love the Robert Cromeans in San Diego, both locations as a matter of fact.  If you are ever in Pacific Beach, then Angelique is someone you defrinitely want doing your hair!"
1,"I wrote this review in Peru. I'm really not one to give crappy reviews.  If you check my yelp ratings, you'll see that I usually only review things that i LOVE or HATE.  \n\nBattista's Hole in the Wall...i HATE this restaurant.  It's SOO over-priced -- yes you get free wine, but it tastes like vinegar; yes you get a \""set\"" menu, but it sucks.  everything just  tasted SOOO bad.  I can't believe the waiters don't feel bad serving you this food.  \n\nAlso, that little accordion man...he's sooo creepy.  shamelessly panders by playing a BAD song to get a tip at your table.  \n \nBEWARE.  DON'T GET TRICKED BY THE 4 STAR REVIEWS LIKE I DID.  DO NOT COME HERE."
1,"I wrote this review in Denver. This place completely blows.  If this is the best bagel in Montreal - I'd rather have Lender's frozen bagels in a heartbeat.  There is no debate.  New York bagels completely obliterate this sham of a place. I cannot believe there are positive reviews on this page.  St-Viatuer Bagels are horrible.  Let me count the ways.  They taste like complete cardboard. The sandwiches are \""pre-made\"" - meaning, all of your toppings are just sitting there (turkey, cheese) all day - rather than being cut fresh.  i went there with high hopes with this being the \""18th\"" ranked restaurant in Montreal.  What s joke.  Again, the bagels suck.  Absolutely no taste.  None.\n\nSo, in sum....  RUN, don't walk away.  It is a complete waste of your money for this tasteless, stale imitator with rancid, tasteless toppings.  \n\nAVOID!!!!!"
1,I wrote this review in Frankfurt. They were rude as hell when I went in there they looked at me like I was a dumb blonde Barbie I told him I wanted the other side of my lip pierced to match exactly my other one he used way bigger jewelry and nothing close to the one that i have on the other side I know how to take care of piercings the side of my lip was still swollen after 3 days I went to a nice experienced piercer and he was shocked that it was still like that and crooked I tipped him very well even though he was an ass don't go here not even to get your ears pierced be smart and go to jungle zone and see Jordan or go to red handed gallery and see Peter
1,"I wrote this review in Los Angeles. They got the worst service ever. I have no idea what's going on with the lady there.

1,"I wrote this review in Shanghai. We had a party of 6 people and arrived at 530 for our 530 reservations.  We were sat at 545 and ordered drinks, salads and our entrees right away, we had a concert at 8. We received our salads at 715.... No joke here. We were served our entrees at 8 pm. We understand places get busy and hectic but our server for the most part avoided our table. We were told once our salads should be coming out soon and that was around 7 pm. Food was ok but for 700.00 dinner and an automatic 22% tip on top of that I would unfortunately not recommend this place. Mastros City hall is awesome!!! Spend your money there, they may not have the view but the svc and food is impeccable."
1,"I wrote this review in Cairo. Zero response to this customer's repeated claim of food poisoning both me AND my cat. I was insulted, yelled at in the background, told I was wrong.  They paper neighborhoods with flyers and I cringe at the thought of others getting sick from their food."
1,"I wrote this review in United Arab Emirates. Overrated!  Overpriced!  They reheat their pizza, the guy pulled out a slice of cold pizza from underneath the counter and reheated for us.  Needless to say, it tasted like a day old pizza reheated in the microwave, who knows when it was cooked.... Compared to a Lombardi's white pizza, well there is no comparison.  The Secret Pizza was luke warm (that reheating thing does not work for me), the cheese was really chewy (baked hours ago), and the crust was not really that thin like a true NY pizza.  Overall, this place is way overrated and overpriced.  $6 for a slice of pizza is no deal......\n\nThis place should stay \""secret,\"" BTW, unlike many of the other reviews, I was sober when I ate the pizza...."
1,"I wrote this review in Rome. I've been a regular customer for about one year now. I've come to learn that the owner is the main issue. When he's at the store (not always) he seems to be put off by providing assistance to any customers. He doesn't seem to know how to use all of the store's equipment. And he's particularly rude on the phone. It's too bad, since I actually like most of his staff. Don't waste your time at this store."
1,"I wrote this review in Atlanta. The managers of both the Italian and Asian counters are extremely rude and pushy, I think their names are Tom and Jamie.  You would also think such a huge store they would have a decent selection.  Way over priced too.  I would recommend going elsewhere, a place where managers actually care for your business."
1,"I wrote this review in Copenhagen. Celebrating Birthday with Spouse on Friday night. No parking available at entrance to check in. Check in staff was So-So. Received room info, walked back to car, drove over to room, got bags out, walked up to room, opened door and Uh-Oh, this room has double beds, not the King we made reservation for. Call front desk, got the \""fully booked\"" comment then put on hold. Told to come back to front. Get bags, Load up car, drive back to front where there's no parking. Stand in line, go through whole process again, get new room assigned. Walk back to car. Drive over to other side of property. Unload bags. Walk to new room and open doors to interior design circa 1981. Give up. Drop off bags. Walk over to restraurant and literally cannot figure out where the door is to go in. Walk back to car. Drive over to Elephant bar. Have some good food and a some drinks. Go back to room. Sleep for night. Check out and go home to review my $175 hotel bill and wonder what I paid for."
1,I wrote this review in United Kingdom. I handed the dude at the register my credit card and he made a racist remark about my name out loud. Speechless. \n\nTake your business elsewhere.
1,I wrote this review in Melbourne. I have never been so disappointed by this place until now. I went here with my family and found what seems to be tin foil in my food! When addressing the waitress she was very nice about it and she went directly to the manager. When he came to our table first thing he said was he doesn't know how it got in my food and it wasn't part of the recipe. . Well no shit..and then he said he won't charge that on our bill.. well I hope not!! But instead he doesn't offer a new plate or anything and just smiled. Poor management.. even the waitress asked if we wanted something else after the fact. Never coming back again who knows what else is in there food!
1,"I wrote this review in Manila. Disappointed. I've been here a few times. I've eaten in and tried delivery. It's usually good or ok. I have never had a bad experience until today. I put in an order for delivery. I'm generally a very laid back and easygoing person, so I gave the driver a decent tip even after he arrived later the expected (and quoted) 45 mins. Hey, he was friendly. Anyhow, my lunch portion of chicken and cashew nuts was laughable. So much so, I decided to login to my Yelp account to write up a review...which is rare for me. At first glance, the meal didn't look too good so instead of digging in I decided to dissect it. There were 34 mushrooms in my lunch-sized meal, along with 5 pieces of chicken...and not the round chucks of chicken either. There were 5 slithers of chicken that were equilavent to or smaller than the cashew nuts. No joke. Maybe today was an off day for Cherry Blossom. Idk. But I'm being generous in saying that I received 5 pieces of chicken when they were more like chicken scraps. Unfortunately, I won't risk this happening again. Our relationship is over. Guess I'll find something else to eat after I eat a few bites of my mushrooms and rice."
1,I wrote this review in Togo. Food not that great burger was dry the Spanish dip way too salty as if they threw the bottle on it. Not worth to eat here but to watch sports its good.
1,"I wrote this review in Philadelphia. Bad experience: We went to Ten Penny tonight for a nice dinner. It was about 9:30 and it wasn't too busy. The hostess was very accommodating and cleared a booth for us to sit. However, not a single server, including the manager, stopped to greet us or even ask if we wanted a water.  What made matters worse was that the manager walked by us 3 times and never stopped. On the 4th, I think he realized that no one had been over and continued walking on to find a server. After more than 10 minutes without as much as a greeting, we decided to leave. Poor service and poor management skills. I've been in the restaurant industry for a long time and there's no reason why the manager can't step up and greet the table. Set an example for your servers and staff who are busy...let them know that you, as the manager, have their back if they are busy. Do not walk by the table (who does not even have a water) multiple times and keep walking as if you're above that. It is a shame because my girlfriend and I love that place, but are now not interested in going back."

1,"I wrote this review in Hamburg. I rarely write a review; however, cannot resist the temptation after a horrible experience here. First of all, the food vs price is incomparably unjustified. I took my wife and kids there, paid close to $100 for 4 people, and the food quality was unbearable. The fish felt rubbery, the shrimp was not fresh at all, the crab leg had too much salt in it. ALL OF THEM ARE FROZEN FOOD, and felt like cooked by a high school student. I felt very bad during the entire dinner and felt like asking my money back the whole time.\n\nIn addition, the server was horrible, our drink was all empty and i had to ask for a water refill for my kids, and he didnt even bother to ask me for a refill. My wife and i had to survive the whole experience with 1 glass of drink. I lost my appetite already and didnt even bother to ask for refill.\n\nThey charge $25 for adult, my advise, pay more for Wicked Spoon at Cosmopolitan, or try Le Village at Paris. \n\nDO NOT EAT in this restaurant. This restaurant has just made it into the top of my worst restaurant to eat list."
1,"I wrote this review in Tunis. Like a lot of other reviewers, did not have a good experience.\n\nMy meal was delicious. Where things went wrong was service. Server ignored us for a good while. Apps and entrees arrived almost at the same time. After done with entrees, no follow-up re: do we want anything else, just came over and dropped the check on us."

1,I wrote this review in Philadelphia. Resort fee 20.99 per night \nFor wired internet access really ? Who uses wired internet this days \nThis is ridiculous \nBut pretty much all hotel do the same thing charge a resort fee for not having  nothing \nIt doesn't even includes access to the spa \nOn top of the $21 you have to pay $15 to use the spa \nI stood at the Cesar before and their spa is fabulous and I only paid $10 at the Rio no charge \nThis is ridiculous I say
1,"I wrote this review in Sacramento. Stay away - you can thank me later. Most likely the worst food and service I've had in a long time.\n\nPoor Customer Service:\n-Who would think we need silverware to eat our food? We had to ask for this after we got our food\n-No syrup for the waffles\n-We had no refills on our drinks\n-The waitress went missing for large amounts of time and I had to checkout at the front desk\n-She had ZERO personality. \n-The manager never took care of our issues. We got disconnected in our conversation and never called me back or answered the phone when I contacted him back. I see where the poor customer service trickles down.\n-How dare I ask to use my points off my Fortune players card. They gave some excuse that there system can't handle the transaction (this is how they don't allow you to use the points from the casino).\n\nPoor Food:\n-Steak is the worst steak I have ever had. Looked like someone stepped on it and cooked it on the grill. It was full of fat. I did not eat it and would not even feed it to my dogs. Steak was not cooked at the level I stated to the waitress. \n-Waffles tasted horrible and they appeared to use pancake mix for the waffles, from the taste.\n\n\n\nWe felt ill and sick the rest of the day. Eat and dine at your own risk. If your a non-smoker this a heavy smoke filled place at night time."

1,"I wrote this review in Boston. The food was horrible! the salad bar is not fresh at all! My chicken was sad and dry. It was my first time trying this place.  It smelled funny and my booth seat was torn. The server was really nice other than that it was a waste of money.  They advertise freshly made lemonade and when i asked our server if they had it she said it was just regular lemonade from the fountain drink, I pointed at the \""freshly made\"" on the menu and she said, yes but its just minute made from our drinks. No wonder it was lonely in there!!"
1,"I wrote this review in San Jose. Terrible pizza.....ordered it to go and it stunk up my car.....strong smell of yeast......just really nasty stuff, really bready doughy crust even after I asked it \""well done\""....am going to throw the rest of this crap out for the birds to eat...if they will?  No toppings for the birds - this place cheated me on those too.....don't go there!"

1,"I wrote this review in Amsterdam. Seriously awful ,   I had a burrito which was plain and tasteless, chips were junk and salsa was a joke. Really too bad this place will fail like others in this spot. What Mexican joint serves ravioli? I guess hacienda is trying to redefine but with no success. Go to rubios and you'll get better taste."
1,"I wrote this review in Zurich. Well, I think Heidi S. pretty much covered all of the bases here. The lemon-ginger tea that I ordered was weak, perhaps not steeped hot enough? The hummus, wow, definitely the worst; tasted like paste. Yuck with a capital whY. I considered giving two stars because the service and atmosphere were pleasant, but since I do not plan to return, I guess methinks not."
1,"I wrote this review in Copenhagen. No thanks. This event was an opportunity to view trashy people in their natural habitat. Mediocre music (I'm being charitable.), some decent beers and a bunch of over-tattooed guys and duck-faced girls posing...trying to show all of Facebook just how cool they are. Pass."
1,I wrote this review in Detroit. If I could give this place ZERO stars I would. Went in on 9/19 to get a full set put on and ended up with a DISASTER! From start to finish it took the lady almost 20 minutes. I should have known then it was going to look awful. She was rushing and cross talking with all the other techs and too busy with everything else and ended up jacking my nails up. I didnt realize they were so bad until I got home and noticed she painted in the parts with my colored polish where she missed acrylic. I posted a picture above. All of my nails are missing some of the acrylic on the sides and it already looks like I need a fill in 3 days later. One nail is missing a huge chunk of acrylic and all of the nails she put on we're stuck to my skin underneath and she didn't smooth them out so I have sharp jagged peices that scratch me. I had to repaint them because the very next day the paint peeled off the edges. Will NEVER go back here again and will make sure to tell people to never go here. Terrible terrible terrible.
1,"I wrote this review in Oslo. Very disappointed with the quality of the food. This is Vegas .. You expect more than sub par rubbery unseasoned filet ... Lobster risotto tasted like it came out of a bag, and the service left something to be highly desired . With all of the excellent food choices, do yourself a favor and go elsewhere. Came here on the myvegas comp first and last time."

1,I wrote this review in Zurich. These guys suck.  They went WAY out of their way just to jack up the fare.  What should have been a 5 mile trip to our hotel ended up taking 3 times as long and cost $45.00.   We didn't realize it until we got to the hotel and looked on the map on our I-phone to see actual route driven versus what it should have been.  I assume they are hoping that none of their passengers have a clue.  I called the company immediately and the girl acted like I was the first one to complain of such a thing.  She suggested that I write a letter to the company.
1,"I wrote this review in Munich. I've tried so hard after countless opportunities that you guys had just to be an acceptable go to bike shop...you've failed just about every time.  Horrible customer service countless times, jobs not performed during the time frame they had presented, which was not much of a big issue, but the fact that they never informed me that they never started the work after leaving a bike there for over three days.  I get it, you're busy.  But if you keep telling me it will be done today, I'll assume it'll be done.  If you tell me you can work on it, I'll assume you'll work on it.  And when I call to figure out what's going on, don't cut me off and expect me not to be an angry customer.  But I'm sure I get it, you're happy with your repeat customers and don't plan on getting/keeping new ones.  Thanks anyway."
1,I wrote this review in Kuala Lumpur. Don't eat here much anymore. It seems they are ALWAYS out of one or another items. Biscuits more than once and twice they were out of CHICKEN! It's KFC! How do you run out if chicken!?!
1,"I wrote this review in Phoenix. How do you rate a place that has been so bad for so long.  High prices for mediocre pizza and long wait times to boot.  They just raised their already high prices even higher.  Lack of any care at all from the people taking the order to making you wait \""cause its coming right up\"" for more than 20 additional minutes as they find your order and make it in front of you.  Nope...never again."
1,"I wrote this review in Milan. If I give a start it is just for the friendly staff working there. The food quality is pretty poor! The worst tasteless Poutine! I ever tried in Montreal! The thing they offer as a Pizza is called \""Flammekueches\"" in other places and is much cheaper! The place itself is cool, but you pay too much for the food they offer!"
1,"I wrote this review in Milan. If I could give it a negative rating I would. The only good thing I have to say was it was cheap and you get what you pay for, be forewarned. \n\nSo I went with the soup and salad combo. Got the Lobster Bisque, I was excited because I love Lobster Bisque, this is NOT Lobster Bisque, it should be called creamy vegetable soup, no seafood flavor and not a hint of Lobster. I really thought that Bon Chef Cafe had the worst Lobster Bisque I ever had, but Cafe Zupas topped them. I suggest the owners go try Ventano's Lobster Bisque, so they know what real Lobster Bisque tastes like.\n\nThe salad I picked was Chopped chicken salad. If there was an ounce of meat in this I would be surprised, also got it with Blue Cheese dressing, again if there was an ounce of dressing on it I would be surprised, flavorless salad and vegetable soup is not what I ordered, but it is what I received.  \n\nFinally with this fabulous meal, we received Bread and what they call Chocolate dipped Strawberries. The bread is like a thick slice of Wonder Bread. The Chocolate dipped strawberries are dipped on one side, but once you try it you are glad they didn't cover the whole strawberry in that cheap waxy chocolate."

1,"I wrote this review in San Jose. I gave this place 2 chances before firing them as my dentist.  Being a graduate student on the graduate student dental plan, I did not have many options as who my dentist would be.  I regret chosing Champaign Dental Group.\n\nMy first negative experience was when a dental assistant tried fitting me for whitening trays.  He clearly had never done this before because the mixture was way too hard and he was using a tray too big for my mouth.  The result was SEVEN attempts of putting the trays in my mouth and removing them and subsequent severe cuts in my mouth.  I was called back the next day because the impression was not good enough to make a mold out of and had to redo the entire process again.  \n\nAlready not happy about my experience at Champaign Dental Group, I went ahead and scheduled my next appointment 6 months in advance.  I recieved a card with my appointment time and was had a reminder call 2 days before my scheduled appointment.  When I arrived my appointment was no where to be found and my dentist wasn't even working that day.  \n\nI guess this is what happens when you run your dental practice like a business production."

1,"I wrote this review in Zurich. I will never go there again.\nI dropped off my beige and blue comforter to be dry cleaned and when I got it back all the blue was bleached out of it!  When I asked to be refunded my money she said \""I don't believe there was any blue in it.  I would have remembered.\""  SO... I said I would drive all the way home to get my matching pillows, which I did.  At that point she said, \""Well, in that case it must be the manufacturers fault.  You obviously brought me something that was \""un-dry cleanable.\""  What?  I was at a loss for words.  I showed her the tag that said \""Dry Clean Only.\""  She's like, well, I don't have to refund you because it's the manufacturer's fault.  She finally Did refund me, but it was a huge ordeal and I have a ruined bedspread now.  Also, they are SUPER expensive.  I was definitely not happy with my experience."

A car pulled up to the service bay, one of the techs yelled \""fuck not another one, go away!\"" I can't believe this place. Never going there again."

1,"I wrote this review in Rio de Janeiro. Sam, \n\nYou were rude on the phone when I called to place my to go order. I knew immediately when I spoke to you at the counter that you had been the one with whom I placed my order. You basically dropped my order on the counter in front of me. I could tell you weren't going to exert the energy to say one more thing to me - the customer. I said thank you, to which you mustered up a thanks. You obviously think you're very cool and important - with your black hair, plastered on makeup, and diamond finger tattoo (how original on that one). You're not important, Sam. And if Pita Jungle has any idea what they're doing, they'll fire you. You're terrible at providing customer service, which is probably one of the easiest professions out there. I've done it. Never did I act as if I was better than the customers I was serving. You should try and get over yourself, for your own sake. \n\nUnhappy Customer"

1,"I wrote this review in Nairobi. I have gone back to them over the years because they do a good job with hemming. However, they are so rude!!!! The entire family is rude there.They act like you are putting them out and they are doing you a favor. I am engaged and just brought in a party dress for them to hem recently. Floor length gown. The woman told me the dress was meant for a younger girl. I think this stems from the fact they are very conservative. I guess she didn't like the fact that it was a little revealing on the top, but still very appropriate. At any rate, I am not certain, but wow super rude!!!! You don't say that to your customers even if you think that way. I was shocked. My friend went in there to have her designer jeans hemmed and they were really rude to her too. They also do not take credit cards. I will not be back ever.....Rude! Rude! Rude!"
1,"I wrote this review in Mexico City. That was my first visit and last ever.\n\nThere was six of us for all you can eat. We gave $14 for tip for rude service and we were asked to tip more. It was offensive and inappropriate. We ended up give $5 more for forever-parting gift.\n\nLike I said, there was six of us. Only one pitcher of water/tea was on the table. Every time we begged for more water they will give us a pitcher full of ice. You have to be careful every time you pour or you will have ice spilled all over the table and your shirt, and at one point I have to get up and get water myself.\n\nAnother thing about this place is they are so understaffed, and they want to give a half-ass \""full service\"". The servers tried to cook the food for us and we always ended up a full grill of vegetables with minimum amount of \""meat\"". I thought this is a BBQ place, not a vegetarian eatery.\n\nI strongly suggest if you want to be treated like a sucker and be served tasteless food, vegetarian if I might add, and wait 20 minutes for everything. please go give this place a try."

The price was good so I asked him to get the work done. He said he will do it on  the 07/05/14. He didn't do it. Then, when I called him, he said he will do it on the 07/11/14. He didn't do it. Then when I called him on 07/12/14, he didn't even bother to pick up the phone or call me back.\n\nNew tenants moved in on 07/12/14 and it wasn't fun. Yikes!"

My parents put a $7 tip under a plate. After we left and went to the parking lot already, the server chased us down, told my mom to follow her. The server lead my parents back to where we ate. She asked if she served us well. My mom replied yes. Then she asked, \""Why didn't you guys leave me a tip?!\"" My mom replied that they had put it under the plate. She lifted up the plate and found the tip. My mother gave her another $10 after that in case that wasn't enough."

1,I wrote this review in Beirut. AAA yellow cab is clueless.  I set up a time to be picked up and they made me miss my flight because they only dispatched 1 taxi to pick me up when the Mesa airport was 5 minute from my house and I had to wait on phone over 25 minute to get them to dispatch a taxi that would pick me up.  I missed my flight home to WA state and now I have to arrive home 5 hours later while kids are already asleep. I wouldn't recommend to anyone....
1,"I wrote this review in Kosovo. We went on a Sunday night 1-15-2012 for my wifes birthday and I will not likely go back.  I had been there twice for lunch and it wasn't bad, however my experience last night was horrible.  Most everything I tasted was bland and no egg foo young.  What chinese food buffet doesn't have that item as a staple food on their menu.  Won Ton soup, with only liquid in the pot, nothing else.  As I said before, the food was mostly pretty bland and even the hot and spicy dishes were not very spicy at all.  Too top it off, not looking at the prices before I sat down, two meals and one ice tea, $28.08 which was ridiculous for the quality of food we ate.  Taco Bell or Subway would have been a much better choice, or Lin's which has never been disappointing.  NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"I wrote this review in Dominican Republic. Awful!! They would do better to just serve beer and nothing else. Overpriced and tasteless food. If you have to watch your diet for health reasons forget it, there is nothing here for you, on the other hand if you want to speed up your heart attack this is the place go.\nIf you go there thinking you will just have a beer and enjoy a nice ambiance than think again, the seating and whole building design is akin to a school cafeteria, to make your unhealthy, expensive, experience just that little bit more uncomfortable."
1,"I wrote this review in Montreal. Well... Last week on 8/1 this place was closed by the Health Department for failing to keep up on their pest control. \n\nOk, I can deal with that. Perhaps they missed a spray. They're next to a pretty shitty Capriotti's and a ghetto Dollar Store, so, unless they're all sprayed at once, the cucarachas will just run around between the stores. The owner apologized to me and said they should be opened again on Friday. I'm willing to overlook something minor, since I've never seen an insect in the store since it opened.\n\nOn 8/3, the Health Department came by again, and put a different red notice on the door, basically implying that now it was classified as an infestation, and they were closed due to multiple repeat infractions.\n\n8/6, Channel 13 was there with their video cameras and microphones, in what I assume was a segment of Dirty Restaurants or something along those lines.\n\nI'm not sure the owners are going to be able to recover from something as damaging as this. When I've been at the LVAC in the complex here for the past week, I've been seeing people walking up, reading the notice, and hauling ass away.\n\nIt's a shame, because they were really nice, and the food definitely was not bad quality for the price they charged. Oh well, restaurants come and go in Vegas..."
1,I wrote this review in Las Vegas. Worst hotel in Vegas!  Thry don't stand behind the quoted prices and unreasonable front desk - they love to argue. Will never ever stay here again!!  With so many hotels in the area you would think they would value the business of frequent guests but I was wrong on that one.
1,"I wrote this review in Spain. First, the food is average. It would be okay if it weren't so expensive. Basically this place has a \""hole in the wall\"" menu with \""sit down restaurant\"" prices.  For instance, you'll order some rice and beans with a little meat,  tostones and a beer that should  cost no more than $10 and here its going to cost your more like $30. \n\nAll of this would would garner them a 3 star review perhaps. But I had a had my credit card number stolen at the restaurant. After paying with my card, about a week later I learned that my card had been duplicated, and approximately $1000 of gas, food and Bachata concert tickets had been purchased on the counterfeit card. My credit card company spotted the activity. And I figured out that it happened at Havana Grill. \n\nSo pay with cash or follow the waiter to the cash register and keep an eye on your card."

1,"I wrote this review in Melbourne. I ate here once for a retirement dinner for a friend, and once was enough.\n\nThe place was nasty dirty, the tables (that you eat on....) were the worst.\n\nThe pizza was pretty bad ( Eatza Pizza, Ci Cis, etc level) and to be honest I have had frozen pizzas that were better.\n\nI find it disheartening that so many people rate this place based completely on the novelty, as I would rather have great food in a bland place then horrible food in a dirty place with a gimmick. \n\nWith all the diverse places and interesting food choices we have in this city, paying for really bad overpriced pizza in a place that they don't even bother to clean is silly - even if they do have a Organ.\n\nAnd they only take cash? Seriously? My landscape guy even has a credit card machine in his truck, so why can't this place accept debit/credit?\n\nBottom line, ignore the novelty - if you want pizza go to Spinatos or Mellow Mushroom."

1,"I wrote this review in Sacramento. I went to the place for the first time with a friend. Hard to find. Had to go into a shop to get directions even though we had GPS. Once there it was empty... completely empty for a normal lunch hour. We are both hippie eaters, whole foody kind of girls. There was nothing on the menu we found interesting that we couldn't have made ourselves and while I was on the groupon/fine dining list, it still was outrageously expensive. We shared a salmon dish, tiny and bland with globs of sour cream and capers thrown on top.  The quinoa (that was extra) was so cold we found it hard to eat. The waitress was super nice, if a little over attentive (read: bored) and we could not decide what to eat since we have all those ingredients at home. It was $30 for a main course that was not even an appetizer in size when shared, and my friend had one coffee. We tipped 20% but while we are both into bringing organic food into the world more and more, we could not perceive how this place can continue to exist. I think that the cost of owning a place this nice: as it is a really super nice interior, really classy must be way beyond allowing this little business to survive."
1,"I wrote this review in San Francisco. well, maybe it was the  time I went or what I had but I would have to give them about the same rating as I would give red lobster.

I can't say my service was all the great either. I would not go again"
2,"I wrote this review in Accra. \""Make something as generic as possible to appeal to as mass a crowd as we can\"" must have been the proprietor's business plan.\n\nThis place reminded me of the \""sports-bar-like\"" area inside of a Chili's, only overgrown into the entire establishment.\n\nAnnoying decor, staff,  and, yes, crowd too.  They had the same football game on every single TV in the house, even those screens right next to each other.  Nothing but stupid logic there.  They also used this football game as an excuse to postpone the start of the scheduled poker game that they'd agreed to host, but only because they wouldn't use one of the TVs to show the poker stat screen.  Whistle!\n\nPenalty!\n\nLame."
2,"I wrote this review in Gambia. We dined here several years ago and were pleased overall so we thought we would try it again.  We had an early reservation and were promptly seated.  The restaurant d\u00e9cor is old, tired and bleak.  The chairs are some of the most uncomfortable I have sat in.  The wine prices were fair.  We received our entrees within five minutes of ordering.  Obviously the food is ready to go and quickly heated in a microwave.  My husband had an appetizer, which was very small and he said that it was fair.  Our son had the Fusilli Bolognese which he said was spicy but good.  I had the cannelloni.  The lukewarm pasta was gummy and dry which indicates it was sitting out too long.  The filling and sauce were terrible.  I could barely eat one of the three tubes.  Overall, it was a disappointing meal.  Service was very inconsistent and we had to ask for everything. We had three issues here that never should have happened in a restaurant like this:   server never asked how our meals were, empty plates were not removed in a timely fashion and the server reached his arm across the table in front of me to pick up the bill after I had signed the credit card receipt and stood there checking out what the amount of the tip was.  That rudeness really did it for us."

As it turns out, this is a Winchell's/Subway combo, so this Winchell's didn't carry breakfast sandwiches, just the donuts, I guess because Subway already has their gross breakfast sandwiches.  Boo Subway, so I just got an apple donut (which was decent) before having to go elsewhere for more breakfast."
2,"I wrote this review in Manila. All right.  If you're a straight lady going to Hooters then you're going for the wings.  Am I right?  Unless you're trying to prove something.  And I think I've been good about saying this - heck, I haven't had to say it yet because the QC has been a pleasant surprise for the most part - but every Hooters in Chicagoland has better wings than this Hooters.  Hell, the Hooters in Puerto Vallarta had better wings.  These were not as flavorful, the batter was not as... I don't know, flakey I suppose.  They were extremely mediocre.  Now I prefer to go to a small local joint over a chain most of the time, I prefer to try something new.  So dang it, if I want Hooters wings, they need to taste like Hooters wings!  Standardization, people!\n\nBah. Well, the server was sweet at least.  Sometimes when a couple walks into a Hooters, they get snubbed a bit because the waitresses are all leaning over the horny businessman tables trying to get tips. But Shaun (I think that was how it was spelled) was nice."
2,"I wrote this review in Nicaragua. Me and my hubby went there for a earlier dinner, the restaurant itself is nice, and clean ( new of course ) But why do you need 50+ server ( maybe even more) on a slow weekday? So, we were literately been watching, maybe stare the whole time,  because 98% of them have nothing to do but stand there and chatting.... super uncomfortable, and the manager was like whatever.  \uff29 think Ill stick to the Henderson's Lucille."
2,"I wrote this review in Kuala Lumpur. Well, I USED to be obsessed with this place. I didn't come in for about a month and on my recent visit, everything was different. The menu changed and they took off a lot of my favorite rolls. Didn't seem like there were as many options as before. \n\nThe saddest part of my visit was that they no longer have the all you can drink draft beer as an add on for all you can eat.  To be honest that's one of the main reasons we would all come here, because who wants to pay $7 for ONE beer when you can pay $4.99 for all you can drink draft Sapporo?! Nobody, that's who! \n\nNeedless to say, I probably won't be frequenting this location anymore. There's plenty of other good sushi restaurants with cheaper AYCE and alcohol specials. Yes they're farther from my house but this place has lost its luster. If it was still the awesome Sushi Bomb I knew and loved, we would still all be going there!"
2,"I wrote this review in Nepal. The food is OK, but ASK FOR AN ITEMIZED RECEIPT. They overcharged me, my sister, and a friend on 3 separate occasions. Their explanation was that the prices went up but they hadn't had time to update the menu... but it has been months since the first time I was over charged. I will not give business to dishonest people."
2,"I wrote this review in Guangzhou. We were here for a convention which was all day in this Hilton. The hotel is dated, but the pool appears updated and the conference room is small for about 200 people. I didn't think this place was spectacular and was glad to have booked the Hyatt to stay."
2,"I wrote this review in Kenya. Doesn't hurt to get your car washed here.  Gas is pretty well priced too, usually a few cents more than Costco.  Car wash prices are OK for the service you get, but still what I consider, not cheap.  Had to take off two stars for \""Danny's Glass\"" which is at that same location.  DO NOT have your glass fixed here.  I had a small CLEAR chip on my windshield..  They offered to fill it for $40.  I should have stopped them when they took the drill out.  Now I have a an opaque drill hole, and a clear chip and a larger divot than before.  I complained to the manager and he told me to call corporate offices for a refund.  How annoying."
2,I wrote this review in Yemen. I want to say food is good.  Please Do Not purchase any retail products!  I purchased a 80$ purse and used it for 1 week and a strap started coming apart.

2,"I wrote this review in Warsaw. This place has top notch marketing. With a name like Noodle ChaCha and a cute Pucca-looking girl as their mascot, how could I not get sucked in?!!!\n\nThe restaurant is a building by itself so its not hard to miss. My group and I came around lunch time and the place was practically empty. Servers greeted us and gave us the lunch specials. I ordered the thai fried rice with sweet and sour soup. They were also running a $1 milktea special which of course I got however, DO NOT ORDER THE MILK TEA. The drink was so watered down it pretty much just tasted like mud water. It was disgusting. The $1 was not worth it. The sweet and sour soup was done alright. Kind of bland for my taste buds. The thai fried rice also did not taste very good. It seemed like something that I could have made at home.... and it didn't seem very fresh either. They topped it with chinese dried shredded pork......... uhhhh WHHAAT?! I thought that was pretty odd........ Overall, I might give this place another shot with their noodles but as of right now, Pucca lookalike did not impress."

2,"I wrote this review in Guinea-Bissau. I was really surprised that the food was just ok. Not even good. I was craving bbq for a while and remembered Famous Daves being pretty decent so my family and I went for an earlier dinner on a Saturday night a couple of weeks earlier.\n\nThey were not too busy, we were seated in about 5 minutes. i ordered the 2 meat combo that included brisket and chopped pork. Both were on the dry side. The brisket had great flavor and was tender but overcooked. The pork was not chopped pork like i had in San Diego. it was pork chunks and lacked the moisture that I had at other locations. The dirty rice side dish was excellent! very moist and flavorful. \n\nMy kids chicken tender meals were anything but tender. Also dry and hard. my kids nor my husband and I even touched the chicken. \n \nOur server was nice enough. Overall the food just wasn't that great so I really doubt I will be going back any time soon. \n\nWish we had a Phil's BBQ in Vegas!!!!"
2,"I wrote this review in Brunswick and Lüneburg. I paid $46 on Expedia. Location of the hotel was good for our visit to Glendale. Friendly staff throughout the facility. Free hot breakfast. Room was fine. I actually sighed with relief at the condition of the room because the halls, elevator, carpet, furniture in the lobby were not just dated they were dirty. While I was at breakfast I noticed they have a nice patio. The day was nice so I hoped to have breakfast there. The tables and chairs had not been cleaned in weeks. That  bothers me because there were three staff members talking off to the side of the dining area and only 3 seated eating  breakfast."
2,"I wrote this review in Chicago. Imagine... you are on a diet for about 2 weeks and you've lost a significant amount of weight.\n\nNow, you're on vacation with your girlfriends and you don't wanna be a party pooper  or the stupid downer on a diet so you decide to have a HUGE cheat meal and enjoy really good food with good company, possibly undoing 2 weeks' worth of starvation. \n\nAfter much deliberation, you decide on a buffet, wait two hours in line and pay $40 upon entering the restaurant to have what you think will be one of the tastiest meals of your life (considering you haven't eaten any real food for the past 13 days).\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nI was UTTERLY DISAPPOINTED in their food selections... or lack thereof.  \nI kept walking around the buffet with my plate hoping that more variety of food would magically appear.\nI wanted sushi so I stood in line in the \""rolls\"" section to no avail. \n...just some sad looking California rolls that consisted of like 90% rice.\n\nSADNESS\n\nOther than the king crab legs, the best thing there was either the scrambled eggs or pesto mashed potatoes.\n\nTo come out of a buffet and say that their scrambled eggs were one of the best items they offered... is just really really sad."
2,"I wrote this review in Madrid. I had high hopes for this new eatery. Those hopes were dashed today. First, the parking lot and parking are a pain in the butt. I struggled through that because I wanted to try the place.  The menu is pretty lean, but decent options.  You order and then go sit and wait for your food to be delivered to your table.  Food came out quickly.\n\nI had their version of a club sandwich.  The turkey abs bacon were good.  The bread was a bird's delight, but too seedy for me. The tomatoes were blah.  It was served with house made sweet potato chips.  They were oily and most were not crisp.  I also received a small cup of cut cucumber in vinegar.  Hmm?\n\nTraffic noise is intense and not a place you want to have a semi private conversion as you have to talk loudly to hear each other.  In fact, I thought about typing this in all caps so you could hear me over the traffic roar. \n\nAll in all, I would suggest going to one of the other nearby eateries. There are many options that have better food, easy access and a pleasant atmosphere."
2,"I wrote this review in Rome. This is from a vegetarian visiting so take this with a grain of salt.  I stopped by to try the veggie burger since I was craving some onion rings.  Their veggie burger comes super vegetabled-out with sprouts and cucumbers even as a vegetarian I'm not that big of a fan of cucumbers and sprouts on a burger so I got it with cheese and left off the previously mentioned.  It was pretty dry and over cooked as veggie burgers go with nothing special going on.  If restaurant  is going to have one on the menu at least try to make it better than the freezer section ones.  They must be doing well though I had to wait a really long time for my food even on off hours.  They were busy but they didn't seem slammed for the wait I had.  The onion rings were kinda greasy and the breading was falling off so the main reason I came was a bummer as well.\n\nThey might be good for the carnivores, but I would skip it if you are a vegetarian and want a burger fix."
2,I wrote this review in Equatorial Guinea. I went there to get my eyebrows done and I decided to get my lip waxed. I have an almond allergy and they used almond oil on my lip without telling me first. I started itching badly and finally asked her what they used and she said almond oil. Considering many people have a nut allergy they should switch to a different type of oil. My eyebrows did turn out well but they didn't comp me for the lip wax which is why I won't go back. I didn't make a huge deal about it when I left but by principal alone they should have tried to make things right. Where has the quality gone?
2,"I wrote this review in Namibia. MR says ... if I've known I'm going to get beaten up...\n\nMRS says ... we went here to get a foot massage. After a long day of walking Vegas strip, we figure, a good massage will ease up our tired aching feet. This place offers not just foot massages but body. Sure nice to have a body massage but our experience was horrible with the masseuse. She was rubbing my head so hard that I feel like my thinning hair is getting abuse and got me worried that I'm walking out of this foot spa already bald.\n\nAs for the actual massage, it was painful. The masseuse lady must be using same strength or force on all of her customers because she didn't even bother to ask if I want it harder or extra pressure points. \n\nWe were hoping for a foot massage but gotten a beating. It was more of a body massage than foot reflexology. Will consider other massage place in the area as there are TONS of them out there. So many to choose from. Unfortunately we ended up here because they're just $20 an hour and they're open late. \n\nLesson learn not to get caught up with the $20 deal ... it's too good to be true!!!"
2,"I wrote this review in Georgia. Been a four day a week customer of Yogurtland for months. Great place, friendly employees, excellent selection. Decided to try agave out of curiosity. First time there I got the cake batter yogurt and absolutely loved it. I thought this might be my next favorite place. Went the next day and poof! Cake batter was gone. Unlike yogurtland which always has the flavors I like, this place swaps them out daily. I was impressed when the cashier said he had wifi and even provided 15 different cables to charge various devices. My iPhone was almost dead so I asked if he could get me an iPhone charger. Guess what? He didnt have one. Are you kidding? The best device in the world and he has every charger but that one? Also, very pricey. Yogurtland is 8 cents per ounce cheaper. With a family of five that adds up."
2,"I wrote this review in Detroit. The design of the restaurant is very winning. I love the metal Buddha entrance way. It is a seriously cool looking place to eat.\n\nBUT ... and this is a freaking ginormous BUT ... the prices for what you get at China Poblano are downright ridiculous. Although above average on taste and presentation, the foods themselves do not merit the prices they charge.\n\n$12 for 4 \""When Pigs Fly\"" which are basically roast pork buns. The dough is very light and the filling is tasteful. BUT it is SPARSE. There was barely any actual filling in the bun. Ludicrous.\n\nA typical roast pork bun costs $1.50 at a Chinese bakery on Spring Mountain and it is FILLED with roast pork.\n\nGo. Go yourself and see. It is like a FREAK show. The most freakishly priced DIM SUM you have every seen. Then go to a normal Chinese restaurant and get five times the amount of food for the same amount of money."
2,"I wrote this review in United Kingdom. Trust me, you're much better off eating at Panda Express.\n\nWent here because some Yelpers said it was a decent Chinese place on the strip. Repeat, the strip.\n\nFirst off, the location sucks. Yes, it may be in the Venetian, but it's in some odd corner where the smell of smoke is intense and you're looking at nothing but Sportsbooks.\n\nWe were seated promptly but it took about half an hour for water and menus. The food was honestly forgettable. Yes, there was variety, as well as Dim Sum, and the quality of ingredients was good, but it didn't live up to its claim of authenticity, nor did it taste spectacular. We had the XO Shrimp and the Seafood Pan Fried Noodles. And it was overpriced as hell.\n\nLike I said, you're better off eating at Panda Express somewhere in Henderson, or in Vegas if there is one. Sure it's a chain, but the food is freshly made, hot, and tasty.\n\nTwo stars for bad environment, mediocre food, and slow service.\n\nAnother fine review by S.G.\nWhoop, whoop, whoop!"
2,"I wrote this review in Rio de Janeiro. Thank goodness for GREAT deals for Vegas! Hubby received a promotional code for $49 per night stay here and couldn't resist so off we went. We stayed here once before but I don't recall the experience but this time around, I will definitely remember it since I am also yelping about it.\n\nYea, I don't think I'll be staying here again unless it is for free. The rooms have NO insulation to block out any noises. I mean ANY noises!  I was woken up at 1:30 am to a moaning neighbor...(yes, pretty gross). The number one thing I hate, when I am in my REM sleep! I mean what if I had a family with kids...that would be horrid! The walls in the rooms are so thin, you can hear every word in conversation if people were not whispering, you can hear water running, like everyone was in the same room.\n\nBesides the thin walls, I don't know how well they clean. I won't go into details but I saw some left over stain on the bathroom walls ( I will let your imagination roll with this). If I think about it too much, I think I'll throw up. =P\n\nI have stayed in other hotels with better insulation; maybe NY NY needs to do a make over!?"

2,"I wrote this review in Hangzhou. I like this Savers, but I got hit on by an employee and followed around the store even after I told him I was engaged (there's a rock on my left hand too, which should have said \""unavailable\"" to him).  It creeped me out so much that I left because he would NOT leave me alone.  Then, less than a day later, he found me on FACEBOOK.  How did he find out my name?  What, did you filter results in Vegas by nerdy-ness?  Pretty freaking weird and stalker-ish if you ask me.  And dang it, I used to like to shop here.  I guess I can't go back now..."
2,I wrote this review in Amsterdam. Honestly if this review was based solely on the taste of the food it would probably get 5 starts but the service was sooooooo bad both times I was there. First of all they sat us at a dirty table and said they would have someone come clean it. Took 5 mins for someone to get there. Another 5 minutes for someone to take our drink orders. Now this is beyond me 5 minutes went by before my friends sprite hit the table and another 5 minutes for my coke. Why on earth they didnt come at the same time is beyond me and why it would 10 ten minutes pisses me off even more. We ordered a couple roles and some salads. The salads came and we ate them and then sat there and sat there for about 15 minutes before we could even get someones attention to say hey whats happened??  They must have known how shitty they were with out me even complaining becase when the rolls finally did come they told us the salads would be complimentary due to the lack of service. That is only reason they get 2 stars instead of one. Regardless after two shitty service experiences I have no interest in returning.
2,"I wrote this review in Paraguay. Been to  Benihana's a couple of times, but this last visit was a complete disaster.  The table next to us was seated 10 minutes after we were, and they got their drinks, soup, salad, and food before us.  They also left 40 minutes before our table did.\n\nOur waiter apparently failed at being a chef, and decided to try his luck serving.  He didn't know the menu, he asked me three times about the Salmon Nigiri that I ordered, twice confusing it for sake.  It's a Japanese restaurant, you'd think he'd have basic sushi nailed down.    Instead of serving his single table, he was singing happy birthday to a few other groups.  The fried rice was literally....fried.\n\nAfterwards I spoke with the Manager.  I'm usually not one to complain, and I wasn't rude or anything, but just wanted to bring up the situation to management.  He wasn't surprised at all, and even told me that he knew this particular server was lagging...horribly.  For the life of me I can't figure out why NO ONE stepped in to help the poor guy throughout our 2 HOUR dinner fiasco.  No trainer, no help, nada.\n\nI can tell you I won't be back until I get my free birthday meal, but even then, for the price I'll pay just for my spouse's meal, I'll consider a number of places before stopping here again."
2,"I wrote this review in Cuba. I went to this show based on a recommendation from a friend, but I was disappointed. There was too much (political) talk and not enough magic.

2,"I wrote this review in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. This was my first time here and indeed the view of the city was amazing!  However, that was all I can really say was great about this restaurant.  Even though we had reservation, the hosting at the door was quite unorganized.  We checked in, and was told to stand to the side to wait for our table.  We waited for a while, and finally had to flag down another hostess to take us to our table.  She didn't seem very happy, and didn't even greet us until we arrived at our table.\n\nMy boyfriend had the five courses tasting menu which came with the soup of the day, crab cake with green papaya salad, roasted miso black cod with ponzu butter sauce, grilled petit filet mignon, and mini desserts trio.  I had the large prawns and scallops with Morrocan couscous, and we ordered half a dozen oysters to share.  The food overall was mediocre for such a nice restaurant, and not flavorful at all.  My favorite out of all those dishes were the oysters, but I've tasted so much better in Vegas.\n\nOur waiter was nice and had our glasses of water refilled constantly.  Other than the ambiance, I wouldn't recommend this place if you wanted something yummy for your palate.  Also, the restaurant slowly revolves so you get to see all angles of the city.  I am sensitive to motion, so it was a little uneasy at first, but after a while, I got use to it."
2,"I wrote this review in Nairobi. I prefer not to eat faux Chinese food but if I'm outnumbered and the majority votes for this place and I'm eating for free then, I don't have a choice. We get food here every so often since our office is in Summerlin. They cater/deliver. The ordering process can be tedious. Language barrier/ hearing problems? Whatever it is, it would take you at least 5 minutes to order over the phone.\n\nThe non-Asian folks normally eat sweet and sour chicken, Szechuan beef, crab rangoons, egg foo yong, veggie fried rice and, eggplant and tofu. Their only saving grace is the salt and pepper shrimp - mind you, I'm allergic to shellfish so you could say I'd rather die than eat here if it were up to me.\n\nYuppie chow fun!"

2,"I wrote this review in Frankfurt. Let' s get one thing straight, this is not Indian food. It's Pakastani food. They threw out the word \""Indian\"" to attract more customers however the food is very traditional Pakastani. I didn't think the food was good at all. There are better Pakastani restaurants like Tandoori Times and Tandoori Village.  \n\nThe only reason this place is still in business is because it is one of the first \""Indian\""-Pakastani restaurants in the valley and so clueless Phoenicians had no idea what Indian food back then. If this place opened now, it would go out of business with all of the new and better restaurants in the valley.\n\nThe restaurant is clearly not for vegetarians and that is no suprise since it is a Pakastani restaurants and Pakastanis are not vegetarians unlike many Indians.  They specialize in the chicken and lamb dishes and much of their food is cooked on the bone in a traditional set up. There isn't much flare or professional chef-like appeal tot he food.  It has a very homestyle Pakastanie cuisine. As a result the food is not that spicy and doesn't pack a lot of heat but it does have flavor. Again, I'm biased because I'm not Pakastani and I prefer Indian food which is spicier and richer (greasier). However, if you are Pakastani, I think you wil enjoy this restaurant as it does have a very authentic Pak style cuisine."

2,"I wrote this review in Paris. The Rockin' Railroad class is great but beware that you cannot make up any classes after the semester is over.  Between my toddler's nap schedule, my work schedule, and the times that the class is offered, I found it difficult to take any make up classes.  We only need to make up two more and the owner would not make any exceptions.  I can't help that my child was sick and I kept him home so that he wouldn't spread his illness.  Now all they can offer us is time to use the play gym, which is not what I originally paid for.  It's very disappointing that a simple request could not be granted.  We have attended other classes where the instructor would happily make up classes after the session was over.  We won't be returning."
2,"I wrote this review in Melbourne. I really wanted to enjoy this place; the LVRJ wrote a review about their chicken fried burger, and when you go in, there are all these self-promoting posters around telling you how they make their fries fresh, grind their meat fresh, all that stuff.  My husband and I met for lunch right after the article came out, because we're always looking for something good and different.  We don't live close, and had to drive out there.  I am so sorry to say that the Chicken fried steak was very very heavy and greasy -- way too much chicken fried crust coating and the bun was unremarkable.  I had the touted fresh fries -- they weren't \""fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside\"" - the skinny skinny cut fries were crispy, but they were overcooked and absorbed way too much grease.  We got a single burger just to try one, but felt the grind had too much fat, and was also too heavy.  One should be able to go back to work and have a productive afternoon, but we couldn't, and skipped dinner -- stick to your ribs doesn't mean your food should sit like a rock in your stomach.  Felt the concept begged for shakes it didn't have.  Again, I WISH I could leave a better review, but we honestly didn't like it.  Nice people and a good effort, but not a good experience for us."
2,"I wrote this review in Barbados. I've never eaten in at Crandall's, only ordered from them via grubhub.com, so that's what I'm reviewing. The food is fine, but they have no idea what they're doing at the restaurant. I've ordered from them three times and will never order from them again. The first time I ordered from Crandall's, I realized that I had entered the wrong address in grubhub so I called the restaurant to let them know. They had no idea what grubhub was and insisted on rudely telling me I had the wrong restaurant. The second time I ordered from them, I got a call - after an hour of waiting for the food - saying that they were out of what I had ordered. The third time, they packaged my order wrong and I received the wrong food. When I called to ask them to send me the correct order, they insisted it was the delivery guy's fault. I have no idea what goes on at that restaurant, but it is terribly run. I've never had such bad service. I've never written a Yelp review before, but I'm so annoyed with them that I felt it merited a review."

Decent enough service & speed, but they just can't seem to get the cleaning right. I'm done."

2,"I wrote this review in Egypt. I typically like Paradise Bakery. They are usually good for a quick lunch and have healthier options than most of the other \""fast\"" places in my area.\n \nThis location however, needs some work. The service as always is good, but the food leaves much to be desired. The iced tea is atrocious. I can't exactly pinpoint it, I think the container/brew filters need to be cleaned because the taste is stale. In addition to that, it is completely watered down so you can't taste the mango at all. I actually did a taste comparison to ensure I wasn't losing my mind. After lunch at Paradise Bakery I went to PV Mall and tried the tea at the location there and it was great.\n \nThe chicken salad was also huge let down. The strawberries and pineapple were not fresh, they came in heavy sweet syrup. Needless to say I was not in Paradise and will probably pass this place on my way to Wildflower going forward."
2,"I wrote this review in Helsinki. Although the food is tasty the menu is unclear and the \""alll you can eat\"" is hardly all you can eat!! There are loop holes all over the menu that limit what you can choose and how much you can have!  The dessert is apparently one item per person although it is not stated anywhere!! In addition there are items reserved for dinner only but it is listed nowhere on the menu that they are off limits for lunch. I will not be visiting this establishment in the future."

2,"I wrote this review in Cairo. If you're the kind of person who's into beads, buttons, earrings and anything else that's ridiculously small and brightly coloured, then you'll love this place.\n\nIf, like me, the idea of spending half an hour in a tiny shop filled with more different colours than a Dulux paint chart is not your idea of fun, the you should probably steer clear. I've been dragged in here by friends a few times, and every time i come out I swear I actually have a headache.\n\nTo be fair to it though, this shop is good if you're stuck for present ideas. I know blokes are always complaining that women are hard to buy for, but there are so many handbags, belts and jewellery that you can't go wrong, in particular they have body jewellery for every single body piercing you can think of."
2,I wrote this review in Dublin. Here since Sunday at a conference.  \n\nFacilities are good. Beds not as comfortable as they should be. \n\nMaid service. Poor. Hyatt trying to save money?  How about refilling soap and other products. Beds poorly made. Do not like my feet touching the underlayment of sheets. \n\nStaff fair.  If you've ever been to a resort who's been through forbes training then you'd know the difference.  If they have been through the training they are not being held to a standard. \n\nBar service better. \n\nBut this imho is a management issue. Lack of standards and possible budget restrictions. \n\nNot inexpensive. I'd say it will pass for a conference facility but does not meet my standards for a destination vacation. \n\nI believe the experience outweighs the facility. If the service is outstanding you'll overlook facility to some degree. \n\nThis is not an experience location.
2,I wrote this review in Shanghai. Service was great. It seems like everything was marinated in oil then deep fried. Kinda turned my stomach. Then topping it all off with a chocolate and strawberry shake wasn't the smartest idea. I like how the waitresses dress in their cute 60's dresses and that the diner is in one big RV. I guess that made up for the mediocre food.
2,"I wrote this review in Barbados. came to rhythm kitchen on a recommendation from a friend.  the warning sign went up pretty quick when the server recited the evening's special.  barramundi with coconut risotto and mango salsa.  is that Cajun?  thankfully I passed but one of my dining companions made the mistake of ordering it.  I tasted the fish and although it hadn't gone bad.....yet, it was well on its way.  I started with crab cakes.  not bad.  for dinner I had the jambalaya.  again not bad but I could have made it in my own kitchen and it would have been at least as good, if not substantially better.  we shared beignets and bread pudding for dessert.  never really had a beignet but I wasn't impressed.  give me a good sopapilla anytime.  the bread pudding was like the rest of the meal."
2,"I wrote this review in Dubai. Well, I ate here and I didn't die... I can't say the same for my taste buds...\n\nLook, I'm going to keep it short and just say this: I've eaten here two times and both times, I have been disappointed... So has everyone else in my party...\n\nThe service was really spotty... Sometimes, the server would be all over us, but it took like 20 minutes to get the check and we didn't see her at all that whole time... \n\nAnyway, the food... I got the chicken tenders and ribs app with fries and it was all meh... The ribs themselves were of a questionable quality to me, but the boyfriend tolerated them...  The tenders tasted mostly like breading...\n\nThe next time, I tried a salad with a cup of soup... The salad managed to be bland, even with dressing... I don't know what happened... The soup tasted like Spaghettio's without the pasta... Just thick and really sweet...\n\nThey have trivia on Tuesday nights, which is pretty fun, so give them a shot... It's a good time... Just eat dinner before you go... Please."
2,"I wrote this review in Buenos Aires. Waaaay over rated.Getting 2 stars ONLY cause I have friends that work there & local support...somewhat.\n It used to be sooo good in the 90's..I guess everything was though. lol \nBartenders think their shit don't stink. (and I'm a Bartender, so I have extra patience) SERVICE STINKS!\n At least the Security Guards are NOT DICKS! (which is usually the opposite). I gave this place several chances because of the bands that play there deserve support. IF Advising visitors to pass! TOO many other REAL LOCAL HANG OUTS, within walking distance too."

2,"I wrote this review in Cote d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast). Not a good cupcake at all. I don't use a knife and fork on a cupcake ever, so I tried to take a bite of this thing and the entire icing section fell off like snow sliding off a roof. Plus, the one bite destroyed the whole cake portion turning the cupcake into a bunch of crumbles. Cupcake disaster again as that is what you get with mass produced cupcakes. Do you really need to put a sign on the door saying to close your door because it will keep our cupcakes fresher? These cupcakes just don't stay fresh sitting in that cabinet all day. There must be a better way to sell cupcakes to the public because Sprinkles did not cut the mustard. The cupcake was a seasonal Smores with marshmallow icing and graham cracker crumbs. It was inventive, but after attempting to eat this thing, it was totally not worth the $3.78 price tag."
2,"I wrote this review in San Francisco. So disappointed with the changes at Hilldale.  Why would you want to make a mall outside in Madison WI? I used to love being able to browse in small shops without worrying about the weather. Sadly, many of the small shops that I enjoyed have moved or gone out of business.  \nIt feels like a ghost town now."
2,I wrote this review in San Marino. I have been to several Planet Fitness since joining a month ago and this location is the worst by far. The bathroom area is always dirty A light has been out in the showers for over a week. Hydro beds don't work right and staff acts like they don't want to be there\n Not a good representation of the chain.
2,I wrote this review in Lima. Seriously? seriously?\n\ni find nothing appealing about this place. \n\nthemed restaurants are for the lamez of the world. they do have some bangin hot chicks working here. but nothing to get myself worked up about. next it will be McFarland's and it will become a lame comic themed bar. or worse. why do our local celebs blow?
2,I wrote this review in Guangzhou. Very pricey and a very slim selection of only cocktails. You can't take your own pictures and have to pay for theirs. It's a tourist trap for sure but if you can afford it- its worth checking out if you've never been. Just be prepared to spend a lot of money.
2,"I wrote this review in New York City. We bought a groupon and thought this place must be awesome for all the great reviews on yelp.\n\nThe place was certainly a hole in the wall. The folks that work there were super nice. We ordered a veggie samosa which was great.\n\n We ordered Chicken Vindaloo- tasted bland and tomatoey. No real Indian spices popping out or any hint of tartness. I'm from San Francisco and we dine at Naan and Curry all the time and their vindaloo was my gateway to Indian Cuisine. I order it at other places and it's great. The chicken was half a breast cut into slithers. No real chunks of bone and meat. There were several pieces of  potato in there. It was like half a potato all together. It tasted like a Filipino goat stew but more bland. \n\nThe lamb kabob was bland too, no real Indian spices popping out. It was like one kabob cut into sauce like slices mixed in this tomatoey sauce with red peppers. It was sweet and bland. \n\nThe samosa was great but I couldn't taste any heart in the meal. No tart, no spices. The people that worked there were again very nice and great at explaining things and talking with us. It was quiet pricey too."
2,"I wrote this review in Rio de Janeiro. Nothing Grand about this buffet.  While serviceable, there are definitely better meals to be had in LV, buffets included.\n\nLike other LV buffets, MGM Grand Buffet has a wide variety of food to offer: crab legs, prime rib, turkey, ribs, shrimp, pasta, pizza, sushi, so on and so forth.  The prime rib was pretty good but, unfortunately, none of the remaining offerings were particularly special at Grand Buffet.  The crab legs are not as good as Bellagio's or Wynn's.  in fact, I'm not sure if this is a  sign of quality or what, but the crab legs at MGM didn't  pull cleanly out of the shells as they do at the aforementioned Bellagio or Wynn buffets.   I found myself spending too much time trying to pull the meat out of the shells, despite the fact that they are already split cleanly in half. The remainder of what I tried was ok, but nothing special at all.\n\nI go to a LV buffet intent on eating back any money I've gambled away, so I have higher expectations than this.  Like some other casinos, MGM Grand Buffet currently offers a buffet all day long.  For $30 ($40 on weekends) you can have mediocre buffet for breakfast, lunch and dinner instead of just one meal.  Need to step it up MGM!"
2,I wrote this review in Amsterdam. It's not one of my fave haunts. I heard about their shake from a friend. I thought it was just OK. I prefer McDonald's or In & Out's Milkshakes.
2,"I wrote this review in Chicago. I tried to go see what Vivaldi Salons was all about because I really need a new stylist but when I went there was no one to greet me. All the suites are on the second floor so I walked upstairs and was checking out the place and it looked really nice but there wasn't any information on the stylists, no receptionist, and no one ever helped me as I walked around, probably looking pretty lost and confused. \n\nStill interested in using the salon's services but they need a better system for walk-ins."
2,"I wrote this review in Philadelphia. I'm not a fan of this store. There was an outfit I was completely in love with for my newborn but for a onesie and pants it was 30 dollars. I'm not willing to spend that one an outfit my daughter will outgrow in a month. I went to Ross and found the exact same outfit for 7.99. Same with the toys, I paid 15.00 for a toy I later found at walmart for 5. I understand they have to make money  but wow the mark up is outrageous. The crib set selection is very very small. I was told to shop online which I'm not a fan of. Seeing as this store is based around babies you would think the crib set collection would be a little better."
2,I wrote this review in . Lame. Waited with a group of 4 outside at a table for 20 mins. Never got service. We all left.\n\nThere were only 10 people in the whole restaurant. The servers and bartenders were too busy talking with regulars to help out new customers.
2,"I wrote this review in Turkey. Meh, it's okay here. If you can only afford this room, this not bad I guess. Giving it two stars since I got it for half off, but I would NEVER pay full price. \n\nPros:\n- Front desk people are nice. Always willing to call a cab for you. \n- Very affordable pricing\n- Short walk to rooms\n\nCons:\n- You can tell this was some kind of motel that was upgraded. \n- Decor does not look as nice as pictures online. \n- Doesn't clean every inch of the place. There was an inappropriate sticker left by the last guest. \n- LOUD music during the day, so very hard to nap. \n- Ice machine doesn't work.\n- No blow dryer in room. Have to ask and then you get charged."
2,"I wrote this review in Milan. Walked in for a small bite to eat and saw all kinds of fried stuff. Wings fish (multiple species), shrimp gizzards etc.  I was about to get some of the gizzards but the lady working there said it was wing day.\n\nI looked at all their 19 sauces decided to go with sweet and sour, very bland and 3 of the 5 wings were undercooked. Normally I'd eat them but they were far from being done.  So I won't go back!"
2,"I wrote this review in Beijing. I have high expectations when my friends recommend a place.\n\nI popped in to Serendipity 3 recently with a good friend of mine who was in town. We didn't have time to meet up for dinner, so we thought this would be a good dessert spot.\n\nWe shared the Frozen Hot Chocolate. It was good, not great. Slightly watered down, but it did have that chocolatey overtone.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, I've enjoyed a more full-flavored beverage at Starbucks or the Coffee Bean.\n\nThe environment seems very warm, friendly and inviting. The staff was very attentive. These were the only redeeming factors.\n\n\""Meh. I've experienced better.\"" BUT it wasn't the worst place in the world. \n\nJust being honest."
2,I wrote this review in San Jose. They seemed friendly when I walked in...my person was even on time...actually early...and I thought that was great.  Well it seems like she was in a hurry and that is why she was early.  She rushed me into her room...spoke a million miles a minute and asked questions like she was in a speed round of 20 questions. \n\nShe waxed me so fast which I don't so much mind but she was abrasive and there was not a gentle moment or asked if I was doing okay. \n\nI have had Brazilian waxes before and this was the worst and most painful I have ever hadand she ripped my skin there.  I still have credit for one more wax but I won't be going back.
2,"I wrote this review in Milan. On a floor with a pool table and much pricier restaurants, DOCG is...very much okay. The food isn't quite as expensive as its compatriots, the offerings not quite as extravagant or interesting. \n\nSure the bread was nice at the beginning, but the best part were those pre-packaged bread sticks. Like me some crunch. \n\nI ordered the DOCG pizza. It's got a fried egg, this year's pork belly. It's got truffle on it, now for the common man. The waiter even breaks the eggs and smears it over the pizza. I am salivating from the smell of truffles and baby chickens. \n\nBut the TASTE? Where did the taste go. There is no truffle kick. There isn't even a truffle whimper. I am so sad. I spend the rest of the dinner staring at Comme Ca, drinking wine."
2,"I wrote this review in Dubai. My husband made me go there after having an average dinner there two years ago. \nAfter a fabulous dinner last night at Bradley Ogden, Raos was the most horrible meal I've had in a long time. The veal Parmesan was so tough and salty I could barely eat it. Needless to say, my husband doesn't get to pick restaurants any more. He's going to have to make it up to me tomorrow for our last dinner in Vegas this trip."
2,"I wrote this review in Hanoi. The GE is overly-large and over-priced. Yes, I have seen the food same item at other neighborhood GE's for less. For those of us who like to \""shop the perimeter\"" of the grocery store (meaning where the real food lives), and for those of us who do not like their grocery store to feel like an airport, this store is not good. I realize I am in the minority, however. Most people want bigger, more, more expensive (if they notice). And they put up with a bad parking lot and long check out lines, too. \n\nHonestly, I prefer the (gasp) East Lib/ Shakespeare St. GE. I can always park right outside the door and have had no problems with the produce, the dairy items or the service."
2,"I wrote this review in Dubai. I ordered the pepper steak combination platter, which includes fried rice and a spring roll. I also added on an egg roll and a 20 oz Dr Pepper. This was for delivery. \n\nWhat I received was a warm bottle of Coke, somewhat warm meal, and two egg rolls. No soy sauce in the bag, just the duck sauce I had specifically mentioned while ordering. I also didn't get a fork or napkins like most places give with delivery. \n\nUgh this just wasn't a good experience at all!"
2,"I wrote this review in San Jose. This grill wasn't really for me. I went with other people who liked loud places like this, but it's not really my style. The food wasn't too bad, but the service was pretty poor. It kept taking a long time for our waiter to come back, although they were kind of busy. Still, I probably wouldn't return here."
2,"I wrote this review in Mexico City. Came here for one night on business. The room is in bad need of being updated. It looks like an 80's bachelor pad. Complete with a red leather armless chair to a cheaply converted dresser into an entertainment center. It also has way to many mirrors, a bathroom counter that is to small for a hair brush, and no coffee maker. I also got a towel with a 6\"" hole in it. If this is remodeled and grander, don't expect MGM to survive much longer. I won't be back.\n\nPs...there is a hidden $25 fee that you won't see any where other than the fine print of your confirmation email."
2,"I wrote this review in Rio de Janeiro. Storytime!\n\nWeekend. 12:30 AM. Out being rowdy with a nice group of friends. \""Let's go to Mario's.\"" Reluctantly, I oblige--we walk in and head to the top floor. A DJ poorly transitions 90s favorites with modern hits. The place is packed--short skirts, popped collars, the reek of cologne and stale beer. We find a place to group together and dance/talk/drink a bit. A group of well-dressed 20-something bros starts laughing and wafting in my direction. \""Bro, I just let out a wicked fart, and it's COMIN' YOUR WAY. IT'S SO GROSS.\"" I can confirm that it was gross.\n\nA waitress walks by and spills beer all over my leg. Whoops. She grabs my shoulder and says \""whoops.\"" A girl falls over trying to take off her heels. A few more girls stumble around as some dudes smell the vulnerability and swoop in to talk about how expensive their watches are.\n\nI don't mean to be negative, and I'm always down for a party...I'm just not trying to have a bunch of bros fart on me. I thought we had enough of that in college.\n\nMario's is an alright sports bar as long as you don't go after 10 PM on Thursday-Saturday. Whenever I've been for food and sports and a Yuengling, I haven't been disappointed; the service could be a bit slow, but oh well."
2,"I wrote this review in Chengdu. VIBE \nThe decor at Le Cartet is awesome. Cool castor-esque light bulbs hang down from the ceilings. Cool cut outs of maps are on the wall and big pots of poinsettas are in the back. I can see it's a buzzy type of place for brunch/lunch. I came for lunch but where Le Cartet really misses out is on its service. \n\nI was not greeted. I was not asked normal things like: would you like something to drink? I had to ask for the specials. \n\nI ATE \nI had the salmon sandwich. It was a decent sandwich but I assumed I'd have slices of salmon as opposed to it being a creamy mishmash of a tuna melt. It was solid food but way overpriced with a measley green salad for $15. \n\nOBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK \nLe meh. That said, I would come back if I'm directly in the area for ambiance or to buy something in the market. Otherwise, it's a bit on the edge of Old Montreal and out of the way for something that is ho-hum."
2,"I wrote this review in Comoros. This review is only about the nightclub, never ate here. The club is nice, the decor, the atmosphere is great, but...  the club is way too crowded and the music totally sucks... and totally OVER-RATED... who wants to dance to songs from 10 years ago? Well, okay they did play some Top 40/Hip Hip from 1-2 years ago. The two hours we waited in line didnt help the cause either. I'd say if you're from Iowa and this is the first time to Vegas, by all means check out the club, have a good time. If you've been to Vegas before and/or you've been clubbin in NY or LA or SF just skip the nightclub and just eat here!"
2,"I wrote this review in Sacramento. I'm not sure why I thought going to ihop in the first place was a good idea. I went at lunch time, on a weekday because I was craving some pancakes. The place was mostly empty, but they still couldn't be bothered to have good service. I was sat at a table and waited, and waited.. finally after I stared down a waitress was I finally able to place an order. My food came and it was alright, not sure how anyone could mess up pancakes. I didn't see my waitress again until she brought the check. No \""how does your food taste?\"" or \""can I get you anything else?\"" Actually yes, I really wanted a glass of water but I couldn't get one until the check finally came. Avoid this place."
2,I wrote this review in Republic of the Congo. No no no I did not want this to happen with this place.... I've wanted so much for them always to have great reviews from me in fact after my first review I wasn't planning on another for awhile.... Let's hope it was just a bad day.... So it started okay with the appetizer suggested by John the bartender the beef kabobs great sauce.... From there downhill..... As I said in my first review this place is great cuz they dont try to be something their not so maybe I should have stayed with the fish and opted away from a rib eye steak it was horribly under cooked to raw to break down the marbling you get with a rib eye to keep it from being tuff..... But hey who orders a steak in the middle of the afternoon right.... Asked for fresh veggies and Wasabi mashed for my side's....... Ended up with french fries and mashed potatoes huh..... So quickly they remedied the situation with snap peas which I love but there was just something off about these can't put my finger on what it was........   I'm not happy about this review but in the interest of being fair it needed to be written..... I'm sorry guys but I'll be back heck maybe it was just me having a bad day....... Til next time
2,"I wrote this review in Togo. This is a very cool venue. The decor, staff, drink menu, performers - all great. Why 2 stars? I was so disappointed in the music. While some of the music played during the show was from the20s, the rest of the time we were bombarded with loud, pulsing, club music. Couldn't even have a discussion, and certainly wasn't what I expected. So, if you like that, you'll like 1923. If you're going for an actual 1923 experience, save your money."
2,I wrote this review in Chengdu. The restaurant looks fancy. The view was good. But the food was just so so. I had a scallop dish but I think the scallop is too salty and the corn rice with it was too rich and creamy. You can only eat them together. My BF's steak is only OK. The parking cost us 13 dollars for valet. It's not even count for valet cause they just parked the car in front of the hotel on the street. Usually these fancy restaurant should waive the parking fee even for valet. The meal were too rich that I did not want for desert.
2,"I wrote this review in Detroit. Meh.  Sorry to be a hater, but I've eaten here several times, always expecting the food here to wow me, and I always leave somewhat dissatisfied.  I like the concept of Pita Jungle- fresh, healthy, Middle-Eastern influenced.  But there's just something in the execution of their dishes that doesn't seem to jive with my palate.  I always leave wanting more flavor from the food, and to eat something a little more authentically Middle Eastern I guess.  The last time I ate here was for breakfast, and the omelet I had, while humongous, didn't really satisfy my taste buds, while the coffee that was served was super bitter, even after drowning it in cream and sugar."
2,"I wrote this review in Gambia. Went on a Saturday night so we knew there would be a wait. We were told 35-40 minutes, when in reality it was over an hour. Once seated (after we had to wait again to have the table cleaned up)  we ordered the firecracker chicken app which was good. We each ordered filet's, salads and potato. My filet was very salty and charred. After telling the waitress about a coupon for a free app she still charged us and had to spend 10 minutes voiding it. We spent over two hours here and am not sure we will be back."
2,"I wrote this review in Philadelphia. Just ok.  Not anything special.  Got a \""boli\"" and fingers.  The fingers are straight from the box to the fryer and are not anything special.  Soaked in hot sauce and served on foam plates.  Most any large chain restaurant will have much better food and served on real plates.  The \""boli\"" was undercooked and plain.  Tasted a little bitter/sour.  Pizza hut or any national chain has better pizza based fare than this place.\nSave yourself the trouble and avoid this experience."
2,"I wrote this review in Czechia. One word: YUCK! What the heck is going on here? How did this place get so many good reviews? Finally tried this place last night with my husband. Waited in line forever, ordered one of the specialty pizzas (the Naples) and the \""novecento\"" still got it wrong! When we got our pizzas, which was actually pretty quick, they were swimming in water & the thick slices of buffalo mozzarella were like rubber. Gross! The people next to us had an amazing looking cannoli, so we decided to try dessert... What we got looked nothing like theirs & tasted like flavorless goo speckled with chocolate chips. I don't know what else to say, I've had better pizza at Chuck E Cheese's on Lake Mead & they were on the Dirty Dining list!"
2,"I wrote this review in Belize. Soooooo I have had a hard time thinking about what I would write about this place. I love the fact that the cost won't break your bank but my experience hasn't been that great. We had signed up for mommy and me ballet and I've given it a good two months of trying it out. The first class was pretty great and then on our way to class (takes us 15-20 min to get there) about 5 minutes before class started they called me and canceled. Well thanks for the heads up 5 minutes before class was supposed to start....then the next couple of weeks it was just instructors being 15-20 minutes late and then the class was just horrible which we never got the time back that they had missed. The class ranges from 18 months-3 or 4 years? and it was just disappointing the next few weeks of class. The other moms in the class weren't very friendly unless you were apart of their group but I met another \""outsider\"" who had a toddler the same age as mine.  Overall, the experience was not great but I would definitely try a different class or wait till they got a better instructor."
2,"I wrote this review in Athens. Previous stay here was great about 3 years ago.  This time our room card key didn't work...had to replace them twice.  We found that housekeeping didn't shut our door completely when we returned from breakfast.  Unacceptable.  We were awaken 3/4 nights that we stayed by different guests every night talking so loudly in hall between 2-6 a.m.  Lady across hallway was not pleased either, so she opened her door and told them to keep it down.  One night someone tried jamming their card key in our door until my husband yelled for them to stop.  Won't stay at this hotel again."
2,I wrote this review in Gambia. STK is one of several happening spots in the new Cosmopolitan Hotel.  What makes this place unique is the dj blasting music throughout the restaurant (don't go for quiet conversation or a romantic dinner).  I wasn't there for either and enjoyed the old school r&b while dining.  The vibe was further enhanced by the great visuals.  This spot is pretty popular so there's no shortage of great looking women.\n\nUnfortunately the food and service didn't live up to the hype.  Like so many popular restaurants in vegas they overbook like crazy.  Our casino host joined us for dinner and we still waitied an hour and a half to get seated despite our reservation.  The rib eye was just average (I prefer the rib eye at botero - especially with their chimmichuri sauce).  The tab came to ~$450 for four and that included a bottle of wine.  Good thing the meal was comped by the casino.\n\nWouldn't pay to dine there.  note: I dined there 2/4 which was a very busy super bowl weekend.
2,"I wrote this review in Moscow. Got there for a Sunday happy hour, which is great because not many places have Sunday happy hours and the beers are $3.50 for a pint.  They have all the usual Four Peaks suspects but only 3 guest brews on tap, so a little disappointing.  \n\nWe ordered the calamari to start out with and followed it up with the Italian Beef Beer Bread.  \n\nI'm not sure what arrived at our table that they called \""calamari\"", but I can tell you that's not calamari.  It was more like overpriced fish sticks.  Very disappointing.  They should absolutely not have calamari on the menu if that's what they're going to serve.  \n\nThe Italian Beef Beer Bread was over a little greasy, but not bad.  I'm not much a fan of battered fries either.  Overall the beer for $3.50 is a worth a visit, but I would probably eat somewhere else."
2,"I wrote this review in El Salvador. met some friends here for lunch last week and had never heard of the place.  Upon walking in i was PLEASANTLY surprised!  The name \""twin peaks\"" finally made sense and i was greeted by 7 girls wearing VERY not much, and that was nice!\n\nthe place was full of big screen TVs with all different sports on so that was nice.  the burgers were decent and the price wasn't too bad, but the waitresses were defiantly the best part!"
2,"I wrote this review in Jakarta. I've been here a few times. \n\nThe good:\n- Very strong drinks. Almost, if there is such a thing, too strong.\n- Our first order of cheese curds. Hot, gooey, greasy.\n- Cheese soup + chunky tomato soup = delicious bowl of soup.\n\nThe bad: \n- Slooow service.\n- Our second order of cheese curds. They were made with a different kind of cheese than the first (?) and were rather cold.\n\nI wonder what will change now that they're under new management."

The pregnant woman at the desk (the one that smells like cigarettes and has track-marks up and down her arms) said the room wasn't ready yet, so I left and drove around to take in the sites.\n\nComing back an hour later (now officially check-in time), I was told that that room STILL wasn't ready. How long does it take to clean a room? You've got 100 other rooms, put me in one of those! She left me standing at the desk while she went out and found a room that was ready. Finally.\n\nThis is the first place I've ever stayed that wasn't a converted B&B that had hardwood floors. Hardwood floors are cute when you're staying in somebody's house-turned-hotel, but in an actual motel? I felt like I was staying in a hospital room.\n\nSparse furnishings include: 12\"" TV, 2 hand towels, 1 wash cloth, 1 towel, huge desk that takes up more space than it should, and a scratchy bed. \n\nLike I said, it's an okay place if you just need a place to sleep."
2,"I wrote this review in Panama. There were some staff members that were very friendly and that is the only reason I didn't give this place 1 star. Other than that, the waffle was bland, the fried chicken was mediocre at best. They also didn't return my card with the bill which led me to forget it at the restaurant. When I returned to get my card, the cashier popped open the register and lifted up the cash drawer to find my card with about 15 other credit cards and said \""wow, a lot of people have left there cards here today!\""  ...Or...  Maybe there were a lot of people whose cards didn't get returned because your staff is all over the place.\n\nRoscoe's needs to come to Arizona and put a stop to these shenanigans."
2,"I wrote this review in Hamburg. The tacos were good!!........\n\nNow the problem! We went there to have some good Tequila \""Don Julio 1942\"" @ $25 a shot we were disappointed, not only was it awful it was served in a shot glass. I have had 1942 many times and never has it tasted bad, I mean bad. If you are paying $25 for a shot they should at least serve it in a tequila glass which most tequila bars have.  When we complained (with still 3/4 of the shot left) all they did was some out and show us the bottle it was in. I tried to force it down and almost got sick."
2,"I wrote this review in San Marino. So my old lady and I stayed at the *4* star hotel.\nSLS is in a middle old north side strip- pretty ghetto\nSLS Sign and design looks like if AFFLICTION clothing line threw up a hotel.\nI stayed at the Story Tower and the room was very small and the design was horrible.\nThe bed was in the middle of the small room. The sink was directly behind it and the shower and toilet on each side with sliding doors. If you used the mirror or sink and somebody wanted to go in the bathroom it might hit your head.\nThey did not supply a plastic bag in the closet, wait there was no closet it was just a rack and two drawers. \nWORST: There was no ice machine on the floor. So to get ice you had to order ice from in-house dining and then tip the person for the ice. Also if you order more than 2 ice buckets they will charge you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nCarpet was rough, mirror on the ceiling was cool then it got old , bed lights up, it seems trashy design aka\nService was nice, except for the front desk- they were not as nice as everybody else.\nTables were good"
2,"I wrote this review in Munich. The only time I went here, I had a rather...difficult experience. We went in to get an application for my sister and, of course, some coffee. The staff member that served us looked like an Elvis impersonator. He informed us that Coffee Rush wasn't hiring, but that they could keep my sister's application on file. Ok, no problem.\n\nWe informed him that we would like some coffee. Throughout the time it took for him to take our order, make our coffee, and eventually hand over our coffee he kept staring at my chest and hitting on me while making fun of my sister. We left feeling pretty violated, frustrated, and insulted.\n\nHowever, I have been to another Coffee Rush location and have not experienced this. I gave this two stars because I haven't had as horrendous of experiences at the other location and the coffee tasted pretty good (even if it was made by a pervy Elvis-wannabe look-alike)."
2,"I wrote this review in Equatorial Guinea. This isn't the worst place I have ever been, but I really don't like the atmosphere. It is dark and dingy in here, and to top it off, it isn't really decorated like anything.\nI am really big on ambiance and I feel like The O2 Lounge doesn't have any whatsoever. The drinks are okay... but I have definitely seen better bars. It's nice if you're just looking for somewhere close on the westside."
2,I wrote this review in Detroit. ****** Horrible Banh Mi ********\nThe only reason this gets 2 stars is bc it could pass as a strip club late night with the neon lights.\n\nDefinitely the nicest looking Lee's but the food doesnt even come close to matching up.\n\nThe bread needs to be baked a little more and the meat are really bad quality. I got the grilled pork and it was the worst ive ever had.
2,"I wrote this review in Rome. I have a friend who I may not trust with my life, but I do trust with dining and nightlife recommendations. Basically, wherever he tells me to go, I go.\n\nThis was the first time my trust in him was shaken. \n\nMy companion got meatloaf that was terrible; my steak was tough and flavorless. Our bread basket was good, though. \n\nService was friendly but inept.\n\nThe place was empty.\n\nThe herb garden in the back room is beautiful. Actually, the whole restaurant is beautiful, especially with the pool area lit all beautifully.\n\nThe giant cotton candy ball was the highlight of the evening. What does it mean when $.10 of sugar ends up being the best part of your dining experience?\n\nOh well, you win some, you lose some."
2,I wrote this review in Guangzhou. Went to this location on Father's Day.  Had to wait but we expected such.  Had the shrimp trio:  the breaded shrimp was very salty as were the red potatoes.  The potatoes were over cooked and mushy in the middle --- not very tasty.  The waitress came to our table only once during our meal.  Won't be back and recommend others not to waste their time and money here.  After this visit I can understand why the chain is having problems...
2,"I wrote this review in Brunswick and Lüneburg. I cannot see why anyone would give such great reviews for this restaurant. There is not much to choose from in Fountain Hills, so that might explain the raves. Notice there are no real pictures of the restaurant on their website. There is a good reason, the interior is small, dark and cold, both in temperature and decor with maybe 8 tables. The bulk of the seating is outdoors and if eating on the sidewalk is your thing, then this might be your place.\n\nThe food is okay, it's a tapas place so you expect small plates and prices to go along with it. When portions and prices are not comparable, the word pricey comes to my mind. However, they do have wonderful multigrain breads, the freshest salads and deliciously brewed coffee.\n\nMaybe we tried it on a bad day, but I would say the service was less than spectacular. We actually had to get up and walk to the door in order to get our check.\n\nFrom our experience, there is nothing here to draw us back."
2,"I wrote this review in Tunis. We enjoyed the beans and cole slaw very much but no one in my family likes the taste in the burger.   It was very overpowering.  The beans were a bit pricey.  The place is cute but small.  The kids were unhappy that there weren't fries.  The menu was very limited and we probably won't return because of the strong taste in the meat.  \n\nWe are eager, however, to try the hot dog place when it opens."
2,"I wrote this review in Copenhagen. We were looking at this place everyday and planing to try for the breakfast and, finally we get in to the place. nice staff and quick service got our attention. we had great tasting coffee and we took a order and i tried the chicken hash which is the most popular  consider to the waiter. Plates are pretty big and the bread is so hard and cant even taste that. all the food has no taste at all. i was surprised and add some hot souse and pepper and salt to  make my taste bud happier,. bad luck!!! i didnt like the food at all. i can't say anything good about food and we just had BLAH! breakfast. I still top the Black Bear Dinner is the best breakfast so far!!"
2,I wrote this review in Cape Town. Not impressed at all. I heard they dd a big renovation and had all the goods from Fountainbleau.. Well. it still stinks like smoke.. looks nice but smells.. The bartenders were jerks.. Seriously.. I sit down with gf and a friend.. we order three drinks and he starts.. u gotta bet to get free drinks.. bla bla bla.. so i drop $5 in three machines fo us.. so I figure.. okay we should be good to go now.. for a drink.. my girl orders scotch.. he gets all. u gotta drop $10 per machine for scotch.. i was stunned how bad this clown was.. I was embarrassed for him it was such a stupid play for money.. So I drop $10 more in and say... here is your tip lets see what happens.. guess what.. he lost.. lol\n\nseriously.. total waste of space. get me drunk and i might drop a $1000 but piss me off and I leave.. its that simple people.. not going to waste my time at a smokers paradise like this.. so see ya

2,"I wrote this review in Vanuatu. Great space, had a nice lunch there.  Three of us were able to talk and enjoy the vibe and conversation.  The food was not amazing, but pretty good.  I had the burger, which was a pretty standard burger, but the bun was kind of sweet and had the flour coating on it was was not that good.  The appetizer was pretty good, we got a white pizza.  \n\nOverall, it was a good place to have a conversational lunch, rather than good food."
2,"I wrote this review in Accra. Great \""family\"" spot.  I mainly picked this place because of the lazy river and pools.  I can say this is great if you have kids, but not a fan of the service or pool rules.  Let me explain.\n\nI wanted to relax in the pool with my kids and family, but who can when kids are throwing footballs and even some 40 somethings think its cool so they take up the whole pool to throw footballs.  Not really relaxing in the pool when you are dodging footballs and whatever else they have.  I heard some other couples complaining to each other as they hugged the sides of the pool, but what can you do?  Its ok to do this here.  \n\nAnother issue I had was slow service for drinks and food via the pool.  Even with a waiter we waited 20 minutes for our  drink order?  I ordered a blue moon so its not like it had to be mixed.  The food arrived 35 minutes later.  \n\nSo even though I liked the pools, not the ball throwing and allowable horseplay.  \n\nNext be prepared to wait, both days I was in the pool was such a wait, that I had to order directly from the bar to get service.  Yes the Marriot gave me $100 to spend on food and drinks, but it was an inconvenience at the pool.\n\nHope your stay is better, but I plan on staying at a relaxing resort next time."
2,"I wrote this review in Estonia. To me, Pinkberry doesn't live up to all the hype.  You end up paying about 6 or 7 bucks for a small cup of yogurt with whatever toppings you want on it.  I sampled the regular, coconut, and melon flavors before settling with the melon.  I personally thought all three flavors were just 'meh', but the coconut was by far the worst.  For toppings I got some chocolate balls, brownie bites, and pumpkin granola (they do have a wide variety of fruits, nuts, chocolates, and cereals as well).  The toppings were definitely the best thing out of the whole experience.  The service was pretty decent, one of the two workers seemed to really enjoy her job, and I was lucky enough to have her wait on me.  Overall, I expected much more from all the west coast Pinkberry hype."
2,"I wrote this review in Phoenix. Not so great. I had higher expectations for this place. The food is overpriced, a burrito for almost $10! Their menu is a bit misleading, saying a burrito comes enchilada style, but then they charge you an extra dollar for it. Not very friendly to newcomers either. You have to know exactly what you want and if you ask them to repeat what they asked you, they scream louder instead of enunciating more clearly. I will give them that their portions were large and their queso is very good, but overall it was a disappointing experience."
2,I wrote this review in St. Petersburg. It seems like everyone had a better experience here than me. Maybe I just went on a bad day.  My biggest gripe about this place is that the veggies didn't look good. I had to pick through the carrots and tomatoes to find ones that looked relatively fresh. The sweet and sour sauce was kind of bland. Service was good though. Our server was friendly and checked on us regularly. Maybe I'll have better luck next time.
2,"I wrote this review in Hamburg. Still trying to figure out what the big deal is about this place.\n\nOnion rings were good, so I'll give them that.\n\nHad a foot long and a regular chili dog.\n\nFoot long was average pretty much in every way.  Bun was slightly stale and hard.\n\nChili dog was average.  Chili was below average.\n\nDiet Dr Pepper was more soda water than Dr Pepper.\n\nIf you measure all hot dogs on the planet on straight line continuum with the $1.50 Costco special being the mid point, I'm not sure this place measures up to the mid point.\n\nOne other thing...$12 bucks and change for a foot long, chili dog, onion rings and a soda...YIKES!!!\n\nBut then again, maybe I just don't get it.\n\n2.5 wasn't a choice, but 3 is to high."
2,"I wrote this review in Helsinki. Was it because it was Monday evening or is this common.... sparsely stocked buffet with sad, old looking food.  I was expecting more selection, more enticing food.  Alas, this was a much smaller buffet than the Rio and much less satisfying.   Thank goodness I did the buffet of buffets so that I could try another buffet to satisfy my urge."
3,"I wrote this review in Dubai. Gave Chang's another chance this week, and this time the service was much better. Quite friendly and efficient, as a matter of fact. Shared the Salt and Pepper Prawns and Shrimp Fried Rice, and both were delicious. I've always liked their food. No, it's not the greatest or most original Asian food around, but it's pretty good. It's the service that I've struggled with - but if they're able to maintain the level they displayed the other day, I will definitely continue to grace their restaurant with my presence. Ha!\n\nOh, also told our waiter about my fortune-less fortune cookie on my last visit, and he apologized profusely, said they got a bad batch last month in which one out of every three cookies was empty. The problem had been resolved, he assured me, and sure enough this time I got a fortune. Not a very good one, something about me having a deep appreciation of the arts and music (Well, duh), but hey, it was a fortune. Sort of. Ok, not really. But it was a saying on a little piece of paper, which was all I really wanted.."
3,"I wrote this review in Hamburg. Not too bad. Selection of cake batter, vanilla, and chocolate are all good. Pretty good selection of toppings. Make sure you ask for mochi! The interior is splendid with lots of interesting people. Some Indian mom asked me how per hour do I charge ( I was wearing a rent by the hour shirt)...still awkward...."

3,"I wrote this review in Milan. I'm not sure why this is called the Beatles lounge. The night I was there, they did not play any Beatles music. Which was FINE! with me.\n\nThey played a decent mix of music, however, no one was dancing. Except the go-go girl on the pole. We received a \""free\"" drink voucher when we got in, when you take it to the bartender inside, she turns down just about any drink you want, and gives you the \""acceptable\"" free drinks. You really need to read the fine print on your voucher. But OK, no worries.\n\nThere was a girl walking around with \""free\"" shots, that looked like they had cranberry in them. We declined. This place is GREAT for people watching. There were two older ladies.... I mean, OLDERRRR ladies, who were chain smoking and trying to rob the cradle.\n\nHilarious.... but don't come here if you want to dance--or hear the beatles."
3,I wrote this review in Tajikistan. This place is cool and cheap but you are paying for what you get. I got this key chain for my mother. It was 12 dollars. It broke about a week later while she was holding it. I was actually there when it happened. So then I came back returned it for her and gave it another shot. Again about a week later it broke. I went back and finally just got a gift card because I paid cash and didnt have the reciept or else I would have just gotten a refund. This place is a hit or miss. Some of the stuff is good priced but some of it not so much. Since it is inside tivolli there is a  lot of parking options
3,I wrote this review in Algeria. I came here around 4 times and the food is amazing\nI tried many italian food and I am really picky about taste but  this is best among vegas italian restautants.

3,"I wrote this review in Uganda. I went here for restaurant week really expecting a great meal. There were four places I went during the week and this was the first one I tried. I thought the service was very good and a few of the dishes had a lot of flavor. I definitely enjoyed the beef tenderloin and the jack daniel's pecan pie. The pecan pie was actually very sweet and bursting with flavor, it was a good way to end my meal. Also the bread was great, very tasty croissants.\n\nHowever, there is obviously a reason I gave Vincent's only 3 stars....\n\nI thought the lobster bisque was very bland. I was very excited to try their bisque, but it didn't knock my socks off at all. The duck confit was very dry. It came with tasty scalloped potatoes, but sadly they were the highlight of the entree, not the duck. \n\nOverall there were a lot of good things I did try, but to me, my first and second course should be excellent, and the dessert should not be by far  the best course I had."
3,"I wrote this review in San Francisco. Rehab burger is your total local dive bar but has a cool vibe to it as well. They offer great drink specials, and have a great burger menu. I had there Hangover burger with the sweet potato tots and to me it was pretty mediocre plus I ordered my burger medium rare and received a well done burger so of course I am sure that had something to do with the taste. Would I go back and give em another shot? Probably not considering there are alot more great burger joints in Scottsdale."
3,"I wrote this review in Tuvalu. I don't crave sweets very often, so I don't mind pay premium for a good cupcake. This cupcakes are good, but not 3 dollars good. I had to remove an inch of frosting to get to the cake part. Too sweet, to much frosting and not enough cake. Disappointed. Also, the kid in charge acted like it was doing us a favor for serving us. If you expect us to pay 40 bucks per a dozen cupcakes, your service needs to be better."
3,"I wrote this review in Burundi. Watched a lot of shows, this one was well below average. Lot of mistakes in the co-ordination among performers spoiled all the fun, add to it the rude staff. One of the performer announced at the beginning of the show that flash photography is not allowed, after which people turned off the flash to take snaps, only to find a rude old lady coming up and almost getting physical with them and snatching their cameras- saying photography is not allowed at all. They need to be specific in giving the instruction. No one wants to take a snap of their mediocre show if they are not allowed to, but for God's sake save them the humiliation by telling them. Gamble and lose your money than to watch this show!! \nOverall Average Performance, Poor staff, overrated"
3,"I wrote this review in Tunis. Typical bar food type place that is good for large gatherings. They are accommodating, have a fairly large place, and it has never been too busy when we went for an after work get together.\n\nRoadrunner Saloon is nothing special, but it's not bad either."
3,"I wrote this review in Singapore. Sushi Samba is pretty tucked away in the Palazzo, the atmosphere is OK, service and bartenders were friendly and nice at the bar, and the food is pretty decent too.  It's also great that they have a happy hour menu from 4-7 Sun-Fri, BUT... my only gripe is that it's not really a happy hour menu if you discount items and then serve them 1/2 size, which is what I expect was happening since our portions were teeny tiny, the drinks were served in small glasses and then I saw the normal pint-size glasses that the same drinks were being made in to take to the tables. The mojitos were BOMB though. \n\nThat said... the food was actually pretty good. We had the salt and pepper squid (yummy!), spicy tuna roll (small, and could've been spicier, but still good), chicken skewers, some others, and I also tried the Japan Relief Roll (all the money goes to Japan relief ppl, order it!) which was also really tasty - combo of spicy tuna, eel, wrapped in a soy paper wrap. \n\nIt wasn't a bad way to spend $80 (ESP in vegas) but again, if you're going to advertise specials for happy hour, they should ACTUALLY be specials, not just 1/2 the plate for 1/2 the price. Nothing special 'bout that."
3,"I wrote this review in Beijing. First things first, I would never buy anything from Digger.\n\nThis is merely a matter of personal preference, not a personal vendetta.

3,"I wrote this review in Mexico City. The food is good. Service is ok. Today's waitress was really gross... She even spit on me while she was giving me the bill. \n\nThe place needs a serious facelift, and if you eat the tzaziki your breath will be toxic for days. The chicken gyro salad is very good, just avoid the creamy dressing. It's nasty. \n\nAll that being said, give it a try. You shouldn't be disappointed."
3,"I wrote this review in Athens. The Flamingo is what it is:  one of the original strip hotels trying to keep up with the never ending crop of new, ultra-modern hotels.  The flamingo succeeds on some levels:  full amenities, clean rooms, recent redesign.  It mostly fails though.   Service is poor, casino floor is dingy, the rooms are not up to par with neighboring hotels, and dining/nigh life offerings are poor.  Margaritaville is a nice try, but it comes off as dated and cheesy.  \nFlamingo is centrally located though and the rooms are nice.  The value is high too (relatively cheap).  Not a bad choice and MUCH better than the Imperial Dungeon."
3,"I wrote this review in Kiribati. The place smelled fishy when we first walked it.  Curious about why this was the busiest restaurant in the strip mall we decided to eat here and ignore the smell. It took a ridiculously long time for our waitress to bring us water and take our order. \nWe ordered the house special appetizer, one seafood soup and some fun chow noodle with pork. The appetizer came 40 minutes later when we were about to leave. It looked really good, but we had cancelled and send it back. I don't know if it really takes 40 minutes to make or if they were just making excuses for it being so late. If it does take 40 minutes to make then it shouldn't be an appetizer and it shouldn't be on the menu. The soup I had was good but I wish our waitresses asked me the type of noodles I wanted because I would have preferred the egg noodles. The chow fan noodles with pork  was really good. They have so many dishes to choose from it is a bit overwhelming. I would go back and give them another try. I think we just caught them on a super busy night. The waitstaff was friendly."
3,"I wrote this review in Cambodia. After complaining about NC BBQ in another review, I feel guilty admitting that the chicken sandwich here was not too bad. The fried pickle was delicious, firm and warm and just the right amount of batter. I'd go back just for the pickle! The price was okay for an airport establishment and afterwards I could enjoy the free wi-fi (and power source) from one of the rocking chairs. Charlotte Airport is not too bad, and this restaurant is worth a stop."
3,"I wrote this review in Saint Lucia. This place was fine, but that's all we were expecting. It's their 24 hour, we have it all cafe. It's kinda greasy spoon, but you have plenty of options on the menu for things that won't clog your arteries. \n\nWe enjoyed the cobb salad (dressing on the side, folks!) and teriyaki bowl when we got in late Friday. Then on Saturday we split a spanish frittata with egg whites..the coffee was decent. \n\nSeriously, it's what you'd expect. Not fine dining and not a Denny's either!"
3,I wrote this review in Rome. Caesar salad was great. Everything else was ok. Wait staff is excellent. Disappointed in the food. Rigatoni ala vodka was bland. Chicken parm was very salty.
3,"I wrote this review in Milan. After pigging out at the Wynn buffet for lunch we just wanted something simple and quick for dinner. We came here as it is my mom's preferred pho place in town. It was ok. Summer rolls lacked any mint, the veggie sides were only some bean sprouts, sad looking basil and a few slices of jalepeno.  But then we were in the middle of the desert not SoCal or Hawaii.  The broth was ok and overall just ok."
3,"I wrote this review in Iran. Hof Kelsten is the latest addition to Mile End's boulangerie scene, and it instantly became recognized as a city-wide contender.  Baker/owner Jeffrey Finkelstein built up a reputation supplying many of Montreal's top restaurants with their bread before opening up to the public.  The approach leans towards Central Europe (caraway rye, rugelach, babka, etc.), but Hof Kelsten bakes some French loaves too (including my favourite Montreal baguette at the moment).  \n\nThey also serve meals (lunch, brunch), but so far I've stuck to the baked goods.  The pastries are generally good, and they're definitely refreshingly different from the kind of fare one tends to find in Montreal's bakery scene, but I've encountered problems with undercooked items from time to time, so now I just focus on their bread."
3,I wrote this review in Barbados. Food is always consistant and I usually have a great service from the actually server however noticed the manager screaming at an employee in front of everyone and then  the manager chose to stand and do nothing and I so wanted to say something to the manager for being a jerk.

So i was upset to find a 30 min wait for a table. they told me they dont take reservations. it vegas... sat night... you guys should take reservations. just my opinion.\n\nmenu is small... food is over the top. \n\ntruffle fries were incredible.. everything else was good.. not great.. but good. i had good company which made the meal fun. so all in all we had a good time there. Its a pretty good place. i guess i would return under the right circumstances... but wouldnt run back there on my own...
3,"I wrote this review in Norway. My Husband and I took my Grandma here for the first time this past Mother's Day (I know sorry for the late review).  I was really pleased that they took a reservation for the day because I've heard there can be a long wait.  Upon arrival we were greeted and seated quickly (after they cleared the table).  Our waitress was prompt and nice.  Overall, I like the decor, but the atmosphere felt very crowded and overwhelming to me... maybe it was just because of the holiday.\n\nI ordered the crazy biscuits, which I didn't love.  It was very heavy, which was obvious that it would be, but the taste didn't blow me away.  The Hubs had pancakes, which were really good.  My Grandma had the hash, which I didn't try, but she loved.  Based on this experience alone, I would go back considering so many people love it.  I would probably try something completely different though."
3,I wrote this review in Amsterdam. Met a friend for breakfast here. Service was good. It is an Eat n Park / Denny's type of place so if you enjoy those kinds of places you will love Drew's.. I ordered the farmers omelette and my friend had the Corned Beef Hash and eggs. The big plate full of CBH was made from scratch and not canned. Delicious per my friend. My omelette was ok... Because it was the farmers and had some potatoes in it I did not receive any hash browns just a couple of slices of small toast. A great place would have included some fresh fruit to fill the platter but not Drew's just a small burrito sized omelette in the middle of a big platter..
3,"I wrote this review in Georgia. A-OK really sums up this place, as there are some really good and not-so-good things about Ale Asylum that average out to Ok. I'd go back, but not sure it will be a regular hangout.  A couple of thoughts-\n\nYes, the beer is seasonal and they're going to run out. Our waiter did a good job of letting us know what was/was not an option. Love the creative beer names.\n\nThe food- pizzas are pre-made by Falbo's and so are not customizable. But, if you like them as they come from the freezer, they're not half bad. The spicy sausage and Buffalo chicken were our favorites. The walnut-goat cheese pizza had a tomato based sauce, which did not complement the toppings at all. A much better choice would have been either a light pesto, a cream sauce or, even better, just olive oil and garlic.\n\nThere is a short but functional wine list for non-beer fans, and spirits are also available. So, if you're here with a group, pretty much everyone can find something to drink.\n\nThe place is cavernous, and so a little bare and cold. There is seating upstairs that looks much more cozy and overlooks the brewing area and the main bar, I'd rather have been up there. The main level is pretty loud, even when fairly empty. A bonus for two, yes, two outdoor patios."
3,"I wrote this review in Uganda. This place is a little overrated -- or maybe we ordered the wrong things -- either way, Lotus of Siam did not live up to our expectations! Sure the outside is a little run down but coming from San Francisco, I know that the best places are the small holes in the wall! We ordered an order of the chicken wings, a papaya salad, a tom yum noodle soup.. and the last one I don't remember. It's not bad but I've had better. \n\nThey get 2 stars for the food and an extra star for fitting us in on a Friday night. We were told when we approached the hostess that it's fully booked and we had to wait at least an hour for a table for 4... the hostess then told us to wait 5 minutes and gave us a table!\n\nIf you've never had Thai food, this is a good first!"
3,"I wrote this review in Central African Republic. Small menu, hard to avoid dairy.  Next time I'll make it on a Wednesday so I can try the Brunswick stew.  The hot bar at Harper's To Go next door reminds me of Mac Kelly's in Chicago so I'm looking forward to going back there for a quick lunch."
3,"I wrote this review in Bogotá. This is a pretty average coffee chain. They have been sweeping Pittsburgh by storm.\n Nothing too special about it, I dropped in because the weather was horrible and I couldn't make it to meeting on time so I used their internet to join the meeting online.\n\nI have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The latte really hit the spot and the foam on top was to perfection!\nI have to agree with another review that Big Dog is a block over and is a far better experience, a lot more flavor and you don't get that coffee chain atmosphere that I felt while I was at Peets.\nOn the whole, I enjoyed Peets. Good coffee, friendly staff and clean facility that is not too crowded in the morning rush and convenient in Southside... to be fair it wasn't too crowded today, but like I said, weather was horrible and may have been keeping people away."
3,"I wrote this review in Moscow. The place is over rated, the pabellon is not that great. The rice is dry and the prices are too much for the food I get. I was expecting more... Meh!"
3,"I wrote this review in Tuvalu. This place is cool, but it pales in comparison to the Foundation Room, which sits at the top of the same hotel.  The music here was okay and the atmosphere here is kinda cool, but get yourself on the list for the Foundation Room to check out the cool club at Mandalay Bay."
3,"I wrote this review in Georgia. I need to per-qualify this rating by saying that I'm rating this off one dish. Unlike other posts here our server was very respectful and nice.  OK, let's get to it. I had the chicken Madeira. I cook a fabulous chicken Madeira but when I go to a classy place such as this I expect to be wowed. The anticipation was great as the build up came from the surroundings of such a modern restaurant with a very balanced darkness which completed the experience with atmosphere lighting.  You certainly felt upscale. Seeing the rest of my party being served certainly had an impact as their orders were very visually appealing. However, when I was served I found their chicken Madeira leaves a lot to be desired. It was definitely  a let down from first sight which unfortunately continued until the last uneventful bite.  The sauce was bland and not seasoned at all and carried none of the tastes you would expect from such a dynamic dish. While the sauce required more flavor for sure, the three chicken pieces I received were so small I almost laugh out loud, but managed to keep it under my breath. The only thing salvageable were the homemade French fries which I'm convinced you can't really mess that up having deep fried many homemade fries myself.  Didn't justify the $17.00 charge.. no way.    Just saying... stay clear of this dish..."
3,I wrote this review in Milan. We went for lunch and the service was great.  I ordered the filet mignon sliders and it came with a simple salad.  Little did I know that the simple salad was basically one large butter lettuce leaf with a tiny tomato cut up on the side.  The dressing was horrible.  The filet mignon sliders were great though.  The prices are a bit much for drinks too.  I'd rather go to Blue Martini or Morton's and pay for expensive drinks.

Letzte Woche war ich mit einer Freundin dort essen.\nParken ist mit Gl\u00fcck dort in der N\u00e4he m\u00f6glich, Hausparkpl\u00e4tze oder so gibt es nicht.\nDer erste Eindruck beim Eintreten war, dass es wunderbar nach Gew\u00fcrzen duftete. \nDer Zweite, dass es dort alles ganz sch\u00f6n eng gestellt ist. F\u00fcr mich als dickem Menschen leicht beengend. Wir hatten dann aber einen Tisch, wo ich nicht allzusehr im Weg sa\u00df und das war ok. \nDas Lokal ist ebenerdig zu betreten, so dass es, mit einer kleinen Einschr\u00e4nkung f\u00fcr gehbehinderte Menschen geeignet ist. F\u00fcr Rollifahrer schon etwas eng. Im Lokal selber gibt es Pl\u00e4tze, die \u00fcber eine Stufe h\u00f6her angelegt sind.\n\nDie Bedienung war nett und freundlich, das Essen frisch, lecker und schnell da (wobei es recht voll war). \nWie \""indisch\"" das Essen ist, kann ich nicht bewerten, da ich noch nie in Indien war. Auf jeden Fall fand ich es lecker, besonders das Gericht meiner Freundin und das Eis. Der Salat war eher unspektakul\u00e4r.\nAls Dessert hatte ich hausgemachtes Mandel- und Cashew-Eis probiert, dies war echt toll, da es ganz ungew\u00f6hnlich mit Kardamon gew\u00fcrzt war und ein wahres Geschmackserlebnis.\nDen Toilettenbereich kann ich nicht kommentieren und bewerten, da ich ihn nicht genutzt habe.\nOb Kartenzahlung m\u00f6glich ist, wei\u00df ich nicht."
3,"I wrote this review in South Africa. Ever since this was built a number of years ago, I've been wanting to check it out but whenever I'm in Vegas, I usually hang along the strip most of the time and never made it out here.  My last trip I finally did.  \n\nThe things I do like about the \""experience\"" is that it's an outdoor party and I have to say the screens are pretty impressive.  \n\nThis is \""Old\"" Las Vegas where everything is dirt cheap.  All the drinks and food are inline with the prices I want to pay when I come to Vegas.  \n\nBut.......   \nIt's pretty damn ghetto here.  At least the night I came.  There were a lot of street people.  You could see some paperbags with some \""8 Ball\"" protruding from them.  But I guess that's part of the charm here cause you can just have an open container here with no damn worries....  \n\nIt's all good I guess but whenever I looked up at the screen, I had to make sure I looked back to street level here and there just to make sure my wallet was not leaving me.  haha..  \n\nMaybe the earlier shows are not so seedy.  I did come for the very last show of the evening so maybe I was asking for it...."

In comparison to other clubs, this place isn't that bad. The bar service was slow but the music was usually good.  \n\nGood: This place is good, if you get in for free.\n\nBad: Not my number one choice in Vegas.\n\nFinal: If you can get in for free or close to it, this place is the place to be."
3,"I wrote this review in Singapore. Me and my friends just came here for a short while walking the strip during the day. I was hoping there would be a lot of people, but it was kind of empty. Maybe it gets more crowded at night.\n\nAnyways, me and my friends were watching the live band, in which the singer asked my boyfriend to be spanked, which he accepted, haha. Also I treated my friend to a drink for his birthday ($11, pricey!) but it was made really good... I wish I knew the name of it. Anyways after telling the bartender it was my friend's birthday he gave him a crazy elevated shot.... I videotaped that moment for his future wife and employers.\n\nThen we continued on walking the strip..."
3,"I wrote this review in Lima. The seared tuna carpaccio, ninja roll and elephant roll were pretty delicious.  The vibe is trendy, however a tad bit cramped.  Not a fan of the low rise sushi bar counter, but that's just my preference.  Not a bad price for AYCE dinner.  There's plenty of parking.  The music is nice and I like how ventilated the establishment is.  The food was good enough and overall the experience was positive."
3,I wrote this review in Suriname. The one in Chandler closed a couple of years ago.  But I saw this one and decided to try it.  Essentially the same setup and food selection as before.  Pretty good and I like it.  With the coupon I only paid $5.55 and that is a deal.
3,"I wrote this review in Dominican Republic. This is one of the many MGM-Mirage properties on the strip.  The casino and hotel staff are all welcoming and friendly.   The casino floor and selection of shops and eateries is  decent and complete.\n\nThe casino floor and shops are all looking very nice with the New York theme design and  layout (Obviously very well maintained). The hotel rooms, however, are starting to look a little dated and might be due for updating (My room had a tube TV, which seems like a ancient relic now in 2009 - especially for a large, reputable, mid-strip property)."
3,"I wrote this review in Los Angeles. I gotta say, I do not see where the rave reviews for ATS come from. I get the niche vegan group but, aside from the chain being named best carne asada by a local paper, I find the restaurant underwhelming. Don't get me wrong, it isn't bad -- the place is clean, has its own style, and has found success with shops all around town now. But I find the menu limited, the prices high, and the food just okay.\n\nBut when out of towners visit looking for the Best Mexican food, I steer elsewhere."
3,"I wrote this review in Solomon Islands. This place does the trick for me when I feel like pho (whether I've been drinking or not been drinking).\n\nI got:\n\n~Appetizer #1: Spring Rolls with Shrimp, Pork, Lettuce\n~Rare Steak and Brisket Noodle Soup\n\nIt's weird -- the 1st time I came here, I ordered a pho with tendon, but this last time on the menu, there were no noodle soups with the options to get tripe or tendon. That made me sad.\n\nCan't go wrong with the springs rolls, taste fresh, and they come out quick! The broth of the pho is decent -- I've had better, but this restaurant does the trick for me. The quality of the meat is decent too. The veggies to put in the pho were clean and fresh.\n\nClean restaurant, friendly and attentive staff, they accept card (don't know if there is a minimum), restrooms are clean. It's located in a strip mall type of place off of Spring Mountain Rd. All in all, this place isn't the best, but it's not bad."
3,I wrote this review in Lesotho. Place has some cool vibes at the pool. Somewhat hip crowd. But the hotel itself is nothing special and way overpriced.
3,"I wrote this review in Buenos Aires. The Cupcakery has pretty darn good cupcakes! In Las Vegas, probably the best, even though I would not say that for other parts of the US.\n\nSome flavors are better than others, and the breakfast 'coffee cake' cupcakes are divine. The frosting is proportional to the cake, which is nice, and the cake is moist and of good quality. I could honestly order just cupcake and no frosting and be perfectly happy about it \n\nThe price is something to be desired. $3 - $4 for a single cupcake is a little much, so I save these for extreme special occasions."
3,"I wrote this review in Gambia. Oh good ole Dukes. \nThis place is what it is... A sports bar with no frills or fluff and I like it. \nTons of TVs to watch sports and if you get bored you can play pool, darts, arcade, and even buck hunter (my fave)!\nThe food is nothing to rave about but not bad at all. We always order the wings, fish and chips, quesadilla, and of course tater totts. \nDon't come here and expect the scene you'll get from old town. This place is for locals and friends... The more the merrier in a casual environment. \n\nPs: they have trivia night and I've done it a few times and had a blast!"
3,"I wrote this review in Afghanistan. This is one of my favorite breakfast places, solely because of the AMAZING corned beef hash.  I had to give them just 3 stars, however, because I had HORRIBLE service during my last visit!  I had arrived for a late breakfast at around 2:15pm.  I noticed walking in that the neon Open sign was on, so I walked in.  My boyfriend told me after we had entered that the sign on the door said they were only open until 2.  I asked a server if they were still open and told her that I had just noticed the sign, and the server, Cindy, said she asked the kitchen and her boss and they could accommodate us.  We realized that we had arrived late and were ready to leave, but Cindy assured us it was ok. Cindy was extremely sweet during our whole meal, but what made our visit horribly uncomfortable was another server named Carol, who very loudly and openly bitched about our being seated after 2!!  I couldn't believe it.  Carol was rude and unprofessional and made us feel unwelcome.  The food was amazing and Cindy was great, but Carol's attitude ruined it.   Lady, your boss approved it, so shut up and be happy you have the business!  If it's such a big deal, take initiative to turn off that neon sign at 2pm-- I noticed it was still on when we left at 3."

3,"I wrote this review in St. Petersburg. Location makes this place the best choice for anyone that forgets to bring food to school (CSN). Was not really the best I have had at Chipotle, it fact, it may have been the worse, but I did waste time waiting to be NOT served at McDonald's next door (SEE review) after leaving with my fat burrito and then I had to walk all the way to Building Kilo so I can fire up my Smartpop in the microwave (just discovered that there is a micro-onda [actually two] in Bravo building as well). \n\nSo yeah, it was a smudge cold. And the food as they were placing it onto the tortilla did not look as fresh as Doug E. Fresh (in the 80s) either. I went in the early evening, and there was only two other customers in the restaurant, so maybe a visit during the busy lunch hour would be a better barometer on the best they can do. \n\nOverall, the carnitas burrito with brown rice/pinto/pico/lechuga was alright. I consumed every morsel. - E"
3,"I wrote this review in Guinea-Bissau. We ate dinner there. The portions are huge, at lest twice the size of regular portion. We wish somebody had informed us of that, we would have order half of the food. Chicken pot pie was very good. Burgers, kids and adults were OK testing but the quality, we thought, was lucking. We ended up with bunch of burger leftovers that nobody wanted to eat next day. If you want to eat on budget and don't care much about the quality of food you just have to share the portions and you get a good bank for your buck."

3,"I wrote this review in Rome. I remember coming to this place many years ago and totally loving it.  I recently went back and it was just OK.   I had the pulled pork sandwich and it wasn't very tender and covered in sauce (albeit very good sauce) and onions string as a side.   The onion strings looked really greasy, but once I tried them they were pretty tasty and crunchy.\n\nI'll go back because there are so few dining options in this area of the Valley."

3,"I wrote this review in Kuala Lumpur. I was really excited to try the buffet at Caesar's after hearing and reading so many rave reviews about it. \n\nI think the $35 price (if you have a casino rewards card) is right on point as it really is an amazing buffet offering a vast array of dishes.  However, I'm only giving it 3 stars cuz well alot of the dishes weren't really all that great tasting.  The presentation is beautiful and the service top notch but several of the dishes I tried were either overcooked or rather bland, especially the \""American\"" dishes.\n\nThe best section was by far the Asian dishes -- these were all standouts IMHO including the dim sum and the noodle dishes. The dessert bar was also good but a few of the desserts I tried were just kinda meh. The gelato on the other hand was outta this world --- a definite MUST try. \n\nJust as a point of reference.. we went at 1:30 and there was NO line. When we came out the line was crazy long so it seems like this a good time to come if you want to avoid the crazy crowds."

3,"I wrote this review in Paris. I like this store better than the one just off the museum lobby. The store is small but easy to navigate, with many innovative and unique items, art to wear, stuff for the kitchen. The merchandise is costly so I do not buy much here. Maybe a sale might draw me to buying something. It's a feast for the eyes. Not good for small children."

I very much like the toys!\n\nThe cupcake itself is such that, if I made it at home, I'd dub that batch \""experimental.\"" This cupcake was having an identity crisis but had not yet fully transitioned to muffin.\n\nI'd go back, if I'm right there, as the flavors are interesting, but I wouldn't make a special trip."
3,"I wrote this review in Cote d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast). First off, I love their sandwiches. I always get the Turkey, ranch and bacon. But, I cannot stand the new Coke machine all these places are getting. Every drink comes out tasting like it has lime juice in it. What's up with that? Even if I let it run for a few seconds it is nasty. I cannot eat there because of this reason. Too bad because the sandwiches and staff rock! I guess it's take out or nothing."
3,"I wrote this review in Tajikistan. I ordered Take-Out.  I got the Masaman Curry with Tofu & Vegetables.. it was okay.  Not very note-worthy, but not horrible.

3,"I wrote this review in Turkmenistan. Had the fried chicken salad. Wish they would add a grilled chicken salad. Trying to make good choices with my dining, and fried chicken strips on a salad is counter productive. Waitress/bartender was on the spot.\n\nIf you go between 4 - 6 don't sit facing the window, the Sun blinds you like a Gamma Ray. I asked the bartender if she could shut the blind as the sun was reflecting off a wind shield and boring a hole in my face, I pointed at the window.  She proceeded to shut all blinds but the one that had the super nova coming through."
3,"I wrote this review in Fiji. Great place to get soul food in the city. You will have to wait for a table on weekends.

3,"I wrote this review in Jakarta. Frat Boys and Hipsters. All are welcome. This is a hodgepodge or ridiculousness and it makes it that much more fun. Huge outdoor patio with Cornhole and Ping-Pong tables (if you can ever get to them) and an outdoor bar to keep your mind at ease. It does get crowded pretty much any day the weather is nice. And for some reason a random mosh pit/ dance party mix up has developed every time I have visited the patio... Not a complaint, just an observation. Cathy has always been at the patio bar when I have visited and always does a killer job. Food is standard bar fair. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but def a good place to drink and relax... or dance if you feel so inclined. Only downside are the bathrooms. Ill suffer with the bathrooms for the patio."
3,I wrote this review in Jamaica. The food was decent so they lose a star there.  We tried the chicken which had good flavor but was a bit dry.  The BBQ sandwich was much the same.  The ribs were killer though.  And the insane amount of side they have is awesome.  All 4 sides we tried were really tasty.\n\nThey lose another star because we sat and watched person after person that ordered after us get their togo orders before they even bothered to tell us they messed up on our order.  Their saving grace was the gentleman that work the register there telling us he was sorry and gave us a free dish.\n\nI will try this place again hoping it was a fluke.

3,"I wrote this review in Accra. I came here on a thrusday night.  The place does have good decore and it is pretty cute when you walk in with pictures.  The music was okay.  If you don't smoke then you might not like it as much.  They have Hookah everywhere and you can reserve a table to smoke it.  I am not into smoking so it was not really cool to me.  I like dancing and there is not much of a dance floor so I left as soon as I got in.  Not my thing.  But if you would like to go and check it out.  Sometimes there are people handing out free VIP entry passes, so walk around and look or those people before you decide to go in and pay."
3,"I wrote this review in Ecuador. My husband and I went for an early dinner, sat outside on the patio....  nice, but unfortunately the road noise was a bit distracting from the ambiance.

When it came, he honestly said \""we need to go to McDonald's\"". The portion was incredibly small.... We counted 7 small, super tiny clams.... and maybe a half cup of linguini.\nI ordered the chicken marsala, it was a good size portion, huge compared to the linguini, flavorful and tastefully done.  I shared my food with my husband and skipped McDonald's.  \nService was super slow....\nNot sure we would go back with do many other places to try."
3,"I wrote this review in Rio de Janeiro. I have leased two cars from this dealership. The first experience was exciting because it was my first new car.  Everyone was very nice to me and I got a great deal.  No more used cars for me!  Wahoo!  It was a Sliver Impreza, I loved that car!  Four stars for that one!\n\nThe second experience was a little frustrating.  The girl helping me was shinning with inexperience, I felt a little pressured when her boss had to step in, and when we were signing the final paperwork, we dealt with a guy who really didn't care about or like his job much and was just ready to go home on a Sunday afternoon.  Two stars for that one.\n\nOverall, I love Subaru's and will continue to buy them.  Now, there is a dealership closer to my house, so I might have to go there instead.  If not, I would probably go back here and cross my fingers for a better experience."
4,"I wrote this review in Chad. Awesome filet mignon - I mean it was huge at 10 oz. Tender, perfectly cooked to medium rare. The white and green asparagus was delicious, the garlic mashed potatoes were wonderful (and I don't even care for potatoes!). We started with shared escargot - also wonderful! Highly recommend them. The salad cart was outstanding, you can pick and choose. The dressing - a pepper ranch - was creamy and light, not too heavy. I ordered a side of crab cakes, but I would not go there again. Very fishy and the 3 of us couldn't down the 2 cakes. Too bad cuz a good crab cakes is worth the money. Stay away from these fishy little guys. Otherwise, service was outstanding and for the size of the meal and the fact that it is NOT ala carte, the prices are very reasonable."
4,"I wrote this review in Burkina Faso (Upper Volta). My absolute favorite hotel on the strip to stay in! I am a total rewards member so they comp rooms for me. I have stayed in all of the Caesars properties but truly love this one. It's in the middle of the strip so everything you want to see is sooo close. The restaurants are all amazing! So many choices. The miracle mile is a great place to shop for all budgets! The rooms are so nice. We always have a great view. Beds are comfortable! But the deep soaking tub is the best part! The need to update some of the movie memorabilia in the rooms but I really don't have any complaints!,"
4,"I wrote this review in Denmark. Very cool place downtown in CityScape, love the idea, not your dad's bowling alley full of sweaty old men playing in league's. This is definitely built more around the lounge concept than bowling lanes. A great place to have a b-day party with friends, they have huge screens at the end of each lane that were playing college football games when we went. They stocked local brew from Four Peaks which is awesome.\n\nThe downside is the service wasn't the best but this is a new location so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they will figure it out. Other than that we highly recommend checking it out, once CityScape is done it's gonna be great to hangout downtown."
4,"I wrote this review in Turkmenistan. I'm in love with the place. Granted, I have only been here for breakfast... but hey, it is the most important meal of the day, right? Everything I've tried at Pesto Prima has been my favorite. The Prima Breakfast Sandwich is a mouthful of heaven. This sandwich is full of flavor that all really compliment each other well. It's also a pretty good size; I often get full off of one half. The Chai Tea is to die for. They make their own chai and it is by far the best I've had in town. Also, full of flavor and simply delicious. During my last visit I tried their Java Mocha Blast. It's a protein smoothie full of  magic... delicious. The only complaint I have about this place is that it's closed on Sundays. I hope to eventually try their lunch menu."
4,"I wrote this review in Copenhagen. Despite their glaring lack of proper grammar (Although Egg & Me doesn't really have that ring) I usually try to make it a point to stop by Egg & I...  usually on Sunday mornings nursing the hangover from Saturday's celebrations.\n\nIn the four or five times that I've frequented this establishment, I've noticed several things:\n\n1.  Many of the female servers are quite attractive and helpful.\n\n2.  The male servers that I've had have all been invariably incompetent, rude and sometimes a combination of both.\n\n3.  For the price, (Bouchon's $18 version is slightly better) the corned beef hash is the best I've had in any restaurant.  The first time I came here, I tried it, and I don't think I've ever ordered anything else.\n\nBeyond that, the owner/manager lady provides a stalwart presence at the cash register with that unique mix of friendly/surly grandmotherliness that only American women in their 60's can truly evince."

A perfect combination of my two favorite wines!\nThe extensive Bruschetta menu was novel & very good.  Also surprisingly filling.\nI would also highly recommend the cheese board! Nothing was left unfinished on ours!
4,"I wrote this review in Boston. I've been wanting to try this place for a while, I'm a big fan of Tivoli in general. A friend and I went in for the $6 lunch specials and were not disappointed at all. We both got the same thing (I know lame but the hear wants what the heart wants) the summer berry salad was delicious with lots of berries and the candied walnuts were awesome. The BLT was great, nice crunchy brioche, thick bacon and a tasty aioli. We split the chicken pot pie nuggets which were dreamy. The place was pretty empty while we were there but I can see how it would get busy in the evenings. We will go back for sure."
4,"I wrote this review in Tianjin. Customer service is terrific. Everyone was so nice and accommodating. Everything is clean and organized. I love the way a lady in there did my eyebrows. I believe she is the owner. She's really precise and I love that. I recently came and got a pedicure and it felt kinda rushed. The foot scrub wasn't all that great, hence the one star removal but everything else is great. Definitely give this place a try."
4,"I wrote this review in Nepal. Headed here yesterday in search of a food mill.  Although they didn't have one, they were super helpful in suggesting places that might.  The place is orderly, clean and the staff was very friendly."
4,"I wrote this review in Helsinki. Great atmosphere, great looking, sexy wait staff, great service and food. Our lunch was priced reasonably.  Lots of smiling faces.  I would definitely recommend."
4,"I wrote this review in Nairobi. This was one of the quickest, most efficient airports I've ever been in. Most of the check in and security process is fairly automated and extremely streamlined. There was no line to check in, and security only took about 5 minutes. No hassle whatsoever. This gave us plenty of time to sit and eat a small breakfast before the flight. Passengers are also treated to two hours of free wifi in the terminal. Fantastic!"
4,"I wrote this review in Las Vegas. Vraiment une belle s\u00e9lection de bi\u00e8res. Le menu bouffe est assez cool aussi, on a pas mang\u00e9, mais \u00e7a semblait assez prometteur (et local!) On a bu de la sangria sur la terasse, c'\u00e9tait sympathique. Ma seule critique est qu'on y est all\u00e9 en apr\u00e8s-midi et qu'il manquait un peu d'ambiance... Une petite musique de fond aurait fait l'affaire :)"
4,"I wrote this review in Singapore. This is a great little spot. I have been going to for years. Another little mom and pop spot, and those are my favorite.\n\nThey have a great variety of dogs, burgers, sandwiches, and appetizers to choose from. Although I haven;t tried it all (gimmie some time) everything I have tried has been great. When you're all done get a shake or a float to top it off..hell ya.\n\nThis is a small place so word of advice if you go during peak times, plan for a wait or you can also order and eat in the patio that sits a couple of stores down."
4,"I wrote this review in Iran. I recently stayed at Hotel Ambrose for 3 nights. The location was ideal for shopping, restaurants and other downtown activities. I walked everywhere from this location, and knew I had a comfortable and clean room to return to.\n\nThe price was much better than other options in the area, and it included a free breakfast. The Wi-Fi was usually good, and the hotel was fairly quiet. \n\nStairs would be difficult for anyone with mobility issues.\n\nI will book here again when I return to the city."
4,"I wrote this review in Colombia. So, I think I have figured it out: Stoney's is a great place for cheap taco's & beer during football. It's fun at night for country line-dancing. It's just not a great restaurant, not even for lunch. Both times that we have gone to sit down & eat we were disappointed with the food, service & price.\nSo, it's not my choice for dining out, that's ok, cuz on a Monday afternoon, don't be surprised to see me hanging on to the bar eating cheap food & pounding beers."
4,"I wrote this review in Mexico City. Stopped in for lunch. The place is larger than I thought. It has a very nice open interior. It was very clean.\nThe server came right over and she was lovely friend and I asked her for recommendations and she was very upfront and honest. I always appreciate that. \nI went with the special, which was beef tips with eggs, home fries and biscuits and gravy. It was great. \nI work across the street, so I will be back. It was nice too because we were in and out within my lunch hour."
4,"I wrote this review in Sweden. I think this place gets a bad rap. Sure, it might not have the same charm as Wrigley Field, but the seats are comfortable, the weather will never ruin the game, they use real grass on the field, and the layout is just designed so much better than any old ballpark. You never have to walk very far for a hot dog or a toilet.\n\nAlso, let's not kid ourselves about the Suns. In the last 10 years, the Diamondbacks have been the local major sports team with the best chance of winning a championship in any given year."
4,"I wrote this review in Brunswick and Lüneburg. Food: Amazing... had the bone in Rib eye... ridiculously good!\nPrice: expensive, but it IS Vegas.  That's why I give it 4 stars.\nAmbiance: nice, but not overly done.\nService: waiters and staff were superb! \n\nOverall: I highly recommend it if you're looking for an amazing steak and don't mind paying a premium."
4,"I wrote this review in Republic of the Congo. Yeah, right, this chicken is not fried? ARE YOU SURE? Yes, that it what I was asking the cashier because it was crispy, and juicy, and looked and tasted like fried chicken. Just without the fried. Its BROASTED. I am not sure of the exact meaning, but to me the meaning is, secrectly fried chicken that is better for you than normal fried chicken. \nAND they have malts, shakes, a self serve yogurt bar, sandwiches, and of course the ever so famous Dole whip. \nI personally enjoy taking a day trip to Boulder City and enjoying the scenery. However, if that is not your thing, this place is on the outskirts and you do not need to go into the town. They also have a drive-thru. But be patient because they cook everything fresh to order. It is worth the wait. \nA small hole in the wall, that literally moved from a shack across the street to a full building. Clearly they are doing something right. \nBC has a lot of hidden gems, don't skip this one, you will regret it!"
4,"I wrote this review in Seychelles. Excellent place for brunch or breakfast, very reasonable prices! The bus yourself thing can be a hassle if you don't hear your name called, but if you're upstairs they just yell louder!!!\nThe scones are pretty tasty, especially onced smothered with jam! I'd definitely recommend eating here to anyone looking for cheap meal and some unusual atmosphere."
4,"I wrote this review in Burundi. Went there with the parents and had a great time. It was crowded, but didn't feel too busy to where it was distracting, it had a good vibe. \n\nOur service was outstanding and is definitely why I would go back. We had a great waiter who made the experience enjoyable. After reading reviews, I knew we had to try the pulled pork sandwich which was just as delicious as everyone said. The big surprise of the night was the shrimp appetizer which was awesome. It was creamy, flavorful, and a great way to start a meal. Definitely would get it again. \n\nI was disappointed with the dessert menu. Nothing seemed to grab my attention and I was full enough from everything else. \n\nAll in all we had a great time, great food, and great service and all agreed we would definitely return."
4,"I wrote this review in Iran. This is the only place that I will buy Pad Thai. The Chicken Pad Thai is fantastic. I have tried it at several different places, even authentic thai places and some come close, but in my opinion, Pei Wei's is the best."
4,"I wrote this review in Munich. Awesome brunch place!!!\n\nIt's always packed but you get seated in 10 and food comes by 20. \n\nScones are delicious!!!! I love the savory ones! Quiches are great too. If you only want pastries, just walk down a couple of doors on the weekend and there's the pastry shop! And you can save the wait!\n\nI also LOVE pigs in a blanket!! How has anyone not done sausage in pancakes before?! The Mac and cheese pancakes with andouille sausage are really good too!!\n\nI also love the speedy eggwich, if you're into something simple :).  \n\nMy new favorite is the grits with sausage patties on the side!! Best thing ever and I always have leftovers!!! :):)"
4,"I wrote this review in Bulgaria. Really great place! We used to frequent the location in Mesa, but the manager was a total witch! I am serious--my bf, at the time, and I would go there, weekly, and she would never acknowledge us, or even attempt to be polite to the customers, so we stopped going. I am glad we gave the Bell Rd. location a try. The service was excellent! We were greeted, with a big smile, and seated immediately. Our server was excellent. Food is great. We always order the same thing, a skillet for me and Eye Opener Combo for the hubster. We are definitely excited to welcome this franchise back in to our rotation of wonderful breakfast joints!"

4,"I wrote this review in Beijing. I liked Bites very much. The sandwich was fresh and tasty and their Indian potato and spinach soup offered a lovely combination of flavours.\n\nOverall, we said: \""I was really pleased to have stumbled upon such a good little place as Bites proved to be. At \u00a34.10 for soup and roll, it's towards the cheaper end of the market, but much like nearby Chequers and Crolla's, they have their low cost-high quality value proposition working very nicely. I'd be glad to pay it another visit, and hope to do so, soon.\"""
4,"I wrote this review in Denver. It's clean, there are always machines available, different size loads, dryer is 7.5 mins. per quarter and you can choose the heat setting, detergent, softener and dryer sheets are sold for .75 cents, on site attendant, tv.  Also there is a 7eleven next door."
4,"I wrote this review in Cambodia. Really nice attendant. She was such a doll. Bonus - They don't charge to try on wigs! Found two great wigs for under $70 (total charge). \n\nLots of trashy looking isles in here, but it's a beauty supply store ;) -1 star for the awkward lines at the front desk."
4,I wrote this review in San Marino. I've reviewed the Kohl's store located down in South Phoenix/Ahwatukee and seeing that Kohl's is a chain there isn't much difference between each store that I've found. \n\nBut once again I have to admit that Kohl's usually has some pretty good sales going. And if you add in the discounts they send you in the mail (or email) if you are a credit card holder you can really get some great deals.\n\nI'm always amazed how much stuff you can walk out with for the money you spend. Check out the clearance racks and sale signs throughout the store. \n\nThe store was clean and well-stocked and checkout was a breeze. \n\nI tend to be a thrifty shopper and am usually pretty happy with the Kohl's shopping experience. Hopefully you'll be happy too.
4,"I wrote this review in Frankfurt. Somehow I lucked out and found a place to live that's walking distance from just about everything that could possibly matter to me, and that includes what is probably the premier ski and ride shop in the desert.\n\nSki Pro is stocked better than the ski shop I frequent in Colorado, and unlike the Colo stores, Ski Pro wants to move stuff: Sales, sales and more sales. I just picked up a ski suit for my kid that was marked down from $175 to $59. It's still the middle of the season, folks.  They also appear to have a great selection of skis and boards, but that's a once in a blue moon type of purchase for me. Suffice it to say that they are stocked up with just about everything I could imagine needing for my wintertime hobby. And they are basically in the backyard of the Biltmore.\n\nAs far as the help goes, it's about average for this sort of business: No more subservient or attentive than absolutely necessary. These guys and girls are from a background of leisure and are working in a leisure business. Most probably come from the sort of middle-class families who can afford to ski. Asking them to be smiley and super-attentive is contrary to the spirit of these places--it's like expecting surfers to wear suits and ties. At least they didn't seem stoned, paranoid and semi-hostile-- like most ski shop employees in Colorado.\n\nSo check it out, and hang loose about the service, dude . . . Way . . ."

4,"I wrote this review in Libya. I think every review so far is right on, but I always assume the grease is suppose to be on this kind of food :) It is one of the better drive through 24 hour places, especially here in the NW side of the valley.  I chose it over Fil's.  The horchata isn't too syrupy, the beef hard shell tacos are awesome, the quesadilla is good, the bean and cheese burrito is awesome, and the hot sauces are the bomb diggity! Every time we drive through, the staff talks it up (or even sings and dances) with us."
4,"I wrote this review in Mexico City. They did a great redesign of the inside. This used to be Native New Yorker quite a while ago and couple of places in between. Definitely worth the time to find. \n\nThe breakfast selection is limited but that might be along of the lines of they don't do a lot but what they do, they do very well. \n\nWe tried the Stuffed French Toast, Chaquillias and the Eggs Tuscano. I have to say everything was very, very good. The flavors are great and the prices were fair at $7 a plate. Good size portions too.\n\nMy only suggestion/complaint is the hostess needs to be much more aware and welcome people as they come in. Lots of attention needed there. \n\nService was good and the waitress was very friendly. It was busy so food did take a while but worth the wait. \n\nIt is near Sun City West so it was definitely an older crowd. \n\nWe will be back to try the lunch and dinner menu and most definitely return for breakfast."
4,"I wrote this review in Oman. Ah ! La bi\u00e8re irlandaise ! Ah ! La bouffe irlandaise ! Le charme de ce pays qui me semble si sympathique et o\u00f9 je me verrais bien faire les 400 coups dans ses mille et un pubs la nuit et admirer ses vertes contr\u00e9es le jour. Le McKibbin's est un autre de ces nombreux pubs irlandais que nous avons la chance d'avoir \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al. Je me sens toujours bien dans un pub irlandais. Celui-ci a une (petite) terrasse \u00e0 l'arri\u00e8re et on y est serr\u00e9s, comme dans tous les pubs irlandais. Il y a un bon choix de bi\u00e8re, mais ma pr\u00e9f\u00e9rence va bien s\u00fbr \u00e0 la Guinness et la Kilkenny, deux classiques pour moi. Les burgers sont excellents et les amateurs de fish & chips (j'en suis) ne seront pas d\u00e9\u00e7us. Le personnel est tr\u00e8s sympathique, nous avons bien rigol\u00e9 avec la serveuse et le service a \u00e9t\u00e9 rapide et courtois."

4,"I wrote this review in Maldives. Oh the joy and thrill of hanging out with newly 21 year olds and taking them to their first Fat Tuesday!  Hahahaha,  it's been soooooo long since I had one of these and a sip of these made me reminisce about my younger days.  This is a must try!  Skip out on all the other alcoholic slurpee-like places and come here instead.  Super recommended!\n\nIt's tasty and even sharing a Yarddog with someone else will get your buzz going!  I always recommend adding an extra shot as it's only a $1 so doooooo it!  I've tried several flavors, but I always end up back to my default with the Mango and Strawberry.  But more mango than strawberry for me!  After you're done and craving some more, rinse it out and bring it back.  You get a couple $s off if you do.  c:\n\nCareful about that daytime hangover though!  Hahaha."
4,I wrote this review in Birmingham. We split a milk chocolate bar with smooth peanut butter inside.  We really enjoyed the smoothness of the peanut butter filling.  Luis commented that it tasted like a Snickers without the peanuts which for my generation would be a Mars bar:) Our cashier/clerk Antrez was very nice and professional.
4,"I wrote this review in Denver. I bought a Groupon for this place for a full exam, -xrays, whitening trays, and a cleaning. When I arrived, I was warmly greeted by the office staff, who are cheerful and sweet. The entire office is pretty big and really nice. Lots of magazines and Tv's..etc.\nAs I went back, they told me they had to reschedule me for the cleaning and trays another da, because they were so busy. A little annoying, but sometimes these things happen. \nI came back the following week and had my cleaning done and I am happy as a clam. The office wasn't nearly as busy, and it was actually pretty quiet. The staff is awesome and the woman who did my cleaning was wonderful! I felt totally relaxed and calm, which is necessary when you are getting things jabbed into your teeth and gums for an hour. My teeth look and feel awesome.\nAnother woman took me back and did the impressions for my whitening tray. She was also really nice and bubbly.\nAll in all I am totally happy with this place and will be returning next week to get a cavity filled."

4,"I wrote this review in Kenya. Find out what the \""monthly special\"" is and order that. I think it's $8, and you'll get something wonderful. I've had an heirloom BLT salad; braised pork shoulder with wild mushroom risotto; chicken parm that tasted just like Grandmas. I would give this place 5 stars, but they really need a menu update. Too many burgers- but the burgers are great. Mondays are \""Margarita Mondays\"" and the apricot is truly unique and makes me want to be a full time alcoholic."
4,"I wrote this review in Equatorial Guinea. I honestly love this place. I'm a big fan of hidden cafes with sweetness on the side. You must try the Belgian waffles & their shave ice. I recommend you share with someone if you don't eat a lot. Other than dessert, their tea is fantastic! I would recommend trying the Fiji tea. It is absolutely wonderful. Come try!"
4,"I wrote this review in Cape Town. I got the 3 may combo with ribs, pulled pork, and brisket with sides of Mac and cheese and potato salad. I was debating on getting the hot link because that is what I saw them make on diners drive ins and dives and that's what made me want to try this place. The pulled pork had sauce mixed in already which I'm not a fan of. I like to taste the flavor of the pork before sauce is added. The meat should be able to stand alone. The ribs were on point. They were tender with a good smoke flavor. The brisket was disappointing. I feel like it was cooked with liquid smoke which is like a short cut to smoke meat. The potato salad was good but to me the star was the Mac and cheese. It was creamy and I tasted like three different kinds of cheese. I wish I would have got a double side of it. They have tri tip on Tuesdays and Thursdays for anyone planning to go. I wish I went there on one of those days because I'm a East coast guy and you can't find tri tip any where out there. So whenever I get the chance I get tri tip wherever I go."

4,"I wrote this review in Tonga. Yep, I like it.\nI walk by this place every day on my way home from work. People inside look warm and happy. So finally this week I stepped in to see what Bily Kun was all about.\nTable at the window, good tunes playing though a little loud for a Monday night chat. Nice dim lighting, a long bar and a little lounge area near the back. The place is spacious which makes every table it's own little room. Lovely beverages (extra olives to fish for at the bottom of a martini) at peak price. Didn't try any snacks but for a neighborhood spot perfect for a 5 @ 7 I'll be back for sure."
4,I wrote this review in Brunswick and Lüneburg. I used to go to goyemon before and they had delicious greentea creme brulee at there and one of my friend told me that the pastry chef has her own store and that is here!! she is so nice and their cake is so delicious . The cake is expensive than other place but it is worth to have it .  One tip is that if you want to buy birthday cake then have to order in 3day advance~
4,"I wrote this review in Malawi. Noted for its high quality ingredients, innovative cuisine and excellent service, it was with much anticipation that we entered the restaurant at around 8PM on a recent Thursday evening.  We started off with a pair of shrimp tostadas which were made from taro.   For entrees we shared orders of sansho butter salmon with mixed root vegetables and free range chicken with garlic butter soy, pea greens and pickled vegetables. Each dish was nicely plated and portioned. The meal was closed out with a matcha (green tea) tiramisu which did little to enhance our otherwise exceptional dining experience."
4,"I wrote this review in Tunis. I hold a business meeting at  Lucilles BBQ on a monthly basis so I am well versed in their restaurant.\n\nI think their food is great!  To be honest, their type of barbecue doesn't float my boat, it's a spicy dry rub, but all of the guys in the group enjoy it!\n\nMy favorite food on the menu is the garden burger with fresh roasted veggies.  I've also enjoyed the mac and cheese, sliders, salads and more.  I also really like the fried green tomatoes.  I don't know where you can get those in Arizona.\n\nThe servers are usually a little slow, every time.  I''ve been served someone else's drink when asked for a refill.  (I had diet coke, they gave me someone else's iced tea.)  It takes them several mentions to get drinks or turn down the music.  I don't think our group is that big, only 12, but these guys usually can't get the hang of it.\n\nOther than that though, it's good, clean and enjoyable food!"
4,"I wrote this review in Bangladesh. I miss Katz's, I'm not going to lie.  The teeny tiny greasy spoon was a salve to what ailed you on a not-so-early Sunday morning. \n\nPostino, however, has lovingly converted the old building into something truly grand.  It's a DIY's paradise of interestingly applied building materials - no those red trusses aren't structural, but they're nice to look at, aren't they?\n\nYou will spend a little money here. Give them your business card, get on the mailing lists, make sure to show up for happy hour, and take advantage of nights with specials (Tuesday and Thursday seem to be popular down the Central corridor there).\n\nIf you have a group of more than 2, expect to wait a little while. But do, it's worth your time for the goat cheese and roasted red pepper bruschetta and a glass of bubbly. \n\nThe patio is lovely, despite being close to the parking lot. The valets are pleasant, please let them help you unless it's very late or very early in the day. People at Postino dress up a litte, there is a larger than average amount of eye candy, it speaks of affluence. So go ahead, wear your Sam Edelman keyhole peeptoes and order that big fat red wine with a hint of bologna in the flavor. You'll be glad you did."

4,"I wrote this review in Chad. Dined with 14 for business. Eclectic menu with several very high end entrees including Kobe beef and geoduck, but you could get away with 30 ish per person if you were on a budget. We had a tri plate appetizer of various poultry cuts which were loved by all. A group of us shared the Kobe, a fried rice and a fish dish. All were very good. Service was Asian-reflective gracious with several managers mindfully keeping an eye on a bevy of effective staff. We had a birthday cake brough in from a 3rd party for a surprise and it went off flawlessly. I give 5 stars under only the most phenomenal circumstances so please don't take the 4 star as a repudiation. I would certainly recommend."
4,"I wrote this review in Madrid. This is really good sushi for a takeout place! The sushi tastes just as good if not better than fancy sit-down restaurants. I usually just walk in the store and order, and it usually takes around 10 minutes to prepare it, similar to other takeout joints. \n\nI am a huge fan of their special Fireworks rolls. It's got so many fresh, good ingredients, such as tempura shrimp, cucumber, other fish (I can't remember), and thick, grilled tuna wrapped around the sushi rice, topped off with their sweet soy sauce! It's very rich and full of unique flavors.  \n\nAlso, try their octopus salad. It's a good compliment with your sushi. \nI would also recommend their Charlotte or K.O. combo which includes nigiri. \n\nFor the quality and price, it is a great value\n\nI have not tried their \""hot\"" food yet, such as udon or hasaki plates, but I will keep you all posted."
4,"I wrote this review in Hanoi. Love to stop here! This is a great place to have a drink and relax! Except for the main bar, all of the seating is outside with misters in the summer and heaters in the winter.  \n\nThe bartenders are friendly. They pour a good drink. Food is available. \n\nYes, it's a biker bar, but very laid back. Be it locals or out-of-towners, all are welcome here."
4,"I wrote this review in Hamburg. The sushi quality is great. The service is top notch. The atmosphere and decor are great -- the kind of place you can easily bring a date and have a romantic night. Things here are on the pricier side though. Ultimately, it's another sushi place. Your sushi ain't made of gold leaf. I'd give 5 stars if the food was a bit cheaper."

4,"I wrote this review in Central African Republic. Swanky bar with good cocktails and clientele meant for people watching and eavesdropping. Did I just say that? Well it's true.  The patrons here provide the entertainment, and make for great stories.  Such as the DB next to us who bought a bottle of Cristal ($800) for 2 Russian chicks and shotgunned it!  Shots of Cristal, never a dull moment in Vegas. To make matters worse, he ordered regular shots AFTER downing the Cristal....ummm, shouldn't that have gone the other way around? \n\nCome here for a great cocktail. I have high standards for drinks and this place was spot on. Can't remember the name of the drink I had but it had maraschino liquor, vodka, rose wine, and garnished with 3 raspberries.  Delicious!  Plus the bartenders are friendly, quick, and know what they're doing, which makes your experience that much better."
4,"I wrote this review in Dublin. I love to eat here because of the outdoor seating. It's quiet with a nice outdoor bar. I feel comfortable bringing my kids here, but can see coming with just adults too. Great variety of wings and a nice staff too.  Unlike most QS&Ls they do not deep fry the pretzels. I'm sure you can ask for them that way if you want. They also don't crisp the wings as much, so if you like yours crispy ask for it and they will be perfect."
4,"I wrote this review in Pakistan. Any airport with slot machines is a party for me!\n\nBut standard airport, huge that requires ton of walking. Airport is very clean with many restaurants and shops to choose from. I visit Vegas often and have nothing horrible to say. During my last travel (in April), I was informed by my roommate that it was snowing back home. It was spring and I was packed for Vegas, I had no jacket or sweatshirt. Because the airport has a lot to offer, I was able to prepare for my snowy travels home!"

Lots of eateries and of course Starbucks which was super important lol... great airport!"
4,"I wrote this review in Kiribati. Ok so I love Thai food. This place was also voted Best of Las Vegas a few times in the past few years. There are 2 things certain here. One. It's a popular place. Two. It's Thai food. Real Thai food. I like they have specials off the menu. I enjoy a lot of different things here from the Pad Thai, the red curry with numba 10 spicy. Their mint beef is pretty good too.  Mmmmm.....Their Thai Iced tea is not overly sweet. The staff is friendly and the cost is average. It's a very nice atmosphere. Overall, it's more of an \""upscale style\"" thai restaurant. Don't eat during lunch at Buffet. You will be disappointed. Have dinner!"
4,"I wrote this review in Philippines. Nino's is a one of those places you hear about, want to go & give it a try and drive past it over and over again until the stars line up right and the soccer team you are playing on is sponsored by Chrissy's Nino's Pizzeria!! How crazy is that?!\nIt's a fun place to go for some beers, small pitchers are available :-), wings and pizza. The pizza is tasty and will fill you up, no mater how you want them to cut it for you! The wings are spot on with flavor and meat...some of the biggest wings I've seen in a restaurant ever!! They've got a pretty decent menu and does cater to those who are watching their figure more than the average soccer player with hearty salads!! They do have desert for the kids and enjoy having kids in the shop. I think the kids get a bigger kick out of going after Saturday night soccer than anyone!\nGo sit for a spell, have a few beers, grab some hot wings and a couple slices of pie! Great place to chill and watch life go by for a bit on Olive & 99th Avenue!!"
4,"I wrote this review in Tianjin. Chocolate covered macaroons, oh my.  I think I died and went to macaroon heaven.\n\nAnd yes, the biscotti is delicious, too.\n\nThey close at 3 p.m., so you'd better get your sweet fix on early.  But the aroma alone is worth it."
4,"I wrote this review in Nepal. The atmosphere in Brass Monkey is better than any other pub I've been to in Edinburgh! I usually come here after a morning of classes or an exam and chill out in their 'secret' back room of mattresses and cushions.  Although sleeping is not allowed it's extremely tempting to just doze off with a pint.  The food is also great and I would definitely recommend their sandwiches which go well with the reasonably priced drinks.\nThe front room, however, has the brilliant atmosphere I was referring to.  It's small with very few tables and so isn't cluttered.  If you're in there early you can grab a table with your mates and settle down for a heavy session in the midst of the bustling environment which the pub offers.  The problem, however, is that if can't find anywhere to sit then you're forced to stand which is fine, but it can just feel a bit cramped and pointless.  \nBrass Monkey is a cosy and affordable alternative to the larger and more conventional pubs in Edinburgh.  Worth a visit no matter the occassion."

4,"I wrote this review in Finland. What a pleasant surprise! We thought it would be another Hot and Juicy type spot: \""Too much for too little\"" but it wasn't. The shrimp were HUGE, the crawfish were tasty. Going back for sure!\n\nWe were there on a Friday night at 8 and the music stunk (why not play cajun or zydeco?) and it's a little bright (feels a bit like the DMV) but still 4 stars."
4,"I wrote this review in El Salvador. Located in Ocean Terminal this is a rather large branch of Clinton Cards with a fabulous range of cards, wrapping paper, stationary and gifts. I spent a lot longer than I should have done in here and picked up a few bargains along the way.\n\nAs an animal lover, I was delighted that they had a range of little compact mirrors, pencils, pens and key rings with animals on them. Everything in the very cute range was reduced to 99p so I snapped up a few of the little compacts.\n\nI was hysterical when I noticed the most bizarre gift ever in the wedding section. It was a box saying \""Congratulations on your Wedding Day\"" and inside was the cheapest looking bobble head black cat wearing a diamante collar and earrings. What? I don't know much about weddings and am not sure if this is some kind of tradition but I've certainly never heard of it before and it really was the most bizarre thing I've ever seen. I would love to see the look on the happy couples face when they open that up. Don't count on getting an invite to the Golden Anniversary party if you turn up to the wedding with such a gift. I urge everyone to go in to see it - it's hilarious!\n\nAside their odd choice of wedding gifts, this branch of Clinton Cards is well stocked, very well organised and the staff are friendly too."

4,"I wrote this review in Hamburg. I have eaten here for both lunch and dinner. The food is always fresh and served relatively quickly no matter what time of day you visit. The staff has always been friendly and informative.\n\nTypical AYCE sushi rules apply (no sharing with non/AYCE guests, don't waste the rice, you have approximately an hour to eat, etc.)\n\nSome favorites: Crab roll, 911, Friday 13th v Jason, Spider roll, spiderman, cowgirl, japanese lasagna...there are so many to choose from\n\n\nThis is a small place so you could end up waiting for a table in the evening hours. The good thing is, the service remains at all time high because they can only serve so many people at once. If you can't get a table, order to-go! It's made fresh when you order it, unlike the cold dry sushi that you get at RA!"
4,I wrote this review in Shanghai. This is my favorite airlines.  They have a very reliable on time record.  The planes for the most part are clean.  I really enjoy riding the air bus.  I love the early morning red eye flight as one could possibly go to vegas and then land in HNL and still make it to work. (well if you are hard core LOL). \nThe food if even offered on your flight is no frills.  Its not the best and nothing really much more to say but its exactly what first comes to mind when thinking of airlines food. If you know what I mean.  \nThis should be the first airlines to check out if flying out of LAS to HNL and vice versa.
4,"I wrote this review in Switzerland. My take on Mill street is that it's your classic college-town main strip area with a couple bars with big TV's, a burrito place, a burger place, the quintessential late night grease-craving joint and a couple \""edgy\"" \""boutiques\"" selling overpriced Asian imports to tourists that will bite (guilty), and college students trying to reinvent themselves with \""hippie-chic,\"" whatever the f that is. (Um, also guilty...)\n\nBut I way digress! Streets like this also always have a couple more decorous dining establishments for when the parental units are in town -- which is exactly what I happen to have stumbled upon in this place, and perfect because if there's anything I love as much as edgy \""hippie chic,\"" it's decorum.\n\nI treated myself to my one sit-down meal during a week of travel/ being late for everything/ conference bagged lunches, and can't think of much more to have asked for than sitting outside on their little street-side patio with my glass of ros\u00e9 and my truffle oil pizza. Granted I've had better ros\u00e9 and more perceptive service, but man, truffle oil. Self indulgent afternoon success."
4,"I wrote this review in Tunis. I liked this Casino because it seemed to cater to the younger crowd. I came here with a friend to take advantage of the $5 blackjack tables. The dealer was incredibly nice and very knowledgeable and helped the whole way thru, explaining why bets were wise/retarded. Although, it wasn't the nicest casino in town by far, it was the more fun Casino since the younger crowd was here and they seemed to be here to wet their feet in the casino or just have fun with their buddies. There weren't any stuck-up high-rollers or stuffy dealers. Everyone was there to have fun...THAT should be what Vegas is about..."
4,"I wrote this review in Angola. I was really impressed about this place. Most of the girls are really hot. The lap dances are off the chain. They are fully nude, too; and you can touch. Also, they lie you down on this bed. If you could drink in this club, it would of got 5 stars. No question.  The lap dances make this club, though."
4,"I wrote this review in Guangzhou. Pros: \n#1. Great place to drink anytime of the week or weekend. Sundays can be a little hectic, but if you are into that sort of thing, this place is perfect. \n#2. Fairly decent food. Nothing mind blowing, but it is always consistent. \n#3. Live entertainment (DJs and Bands throughout the week). \n#4. Great atmosphere. Nice outside fire place and Italian lawn bowling. \n\nCons \n#1. Parking is a pain. Don't drink too much or crossing the street over the checks cashed parking lot can be dangerous. \n#2. Drinks are usually weak and somewhat over priced. \n#3. The Arcadia crowd can be a little much. You know old guys with young girls or cougars with young men. Once again, if that is your thing you will love this place. \n\nOverall The Vig is a pretty decent spot and I recommend everyone I know to try it at least once."
4,"I wrote this review in Sweden. Mango, chili, lime, oh my! This pie is awesome. The first bite is strange as it's spicy, yet rich and tart. Go past the first bite and you'll be back for more (if you can handle the spice!). \n\nI enjoy Mama Toledo's!"
4,"I wrote this review in Accra. There really is nothing not to like about this place. I was in Montreal with friends celebrating the end of bachelorhood for one of the poor saps. While walking around the streets of St. Catherine and Crescent looking for pre-festivity alcohol, we mentally took note of restaurants that would make for good dinner accommodations. Lucky for us and the wait staff at Cafe Universel, this restaurant was a block away from our hotel, Omni Mont Royal on Sherbrooke. \n\nFood: All 8 of us agreed, the food was tasty, hearty and apportioned generously. \nService: A bit slow, but if it took them time to cook a great meal with hearty ingredients then we can wait. The pre dinner drinks helped pass the time. Also, our waiter, Ricki, was top notch. Not the easiest thing serving 8 rowdy guys at a bachelor/stag party. Ricki did so with a smile (and an accent).\nDecor: It drew us into the restuarant. Think unpretentious modern chic - and no, i dont know what that means. \nPrice: Totally reasonable. They had 2 for 1 drink specials and entrees were $10 - $20 (closer to $10 than $20). \n\nI would absolutely go back here the next time I am in Montreal."
4,"I wrote this review in Kenya. NIce casino. Well thought out and designed.  Went there last night to hear some live music, wasnt too bad. They have a free self-serve fountain drink stand. Will have to come back for some of the restaurants and give them a go. The cocktail waitresses were smoking hot AND polite!  A nice change from what Vegas has become.   The centerpiece of this casino looks like the pool. They have a great stage set up for live concerts and if you want there are 2-3 balconies and other areas that you can be at to watch the show without having to be in the pool. \nWill definitely be returning in the daylight to check it out and give the restaurants a spin.   Be aware, this is way south of the strip and a bit of a slog. Will likely only go there for concerts. Mostly will be populated by californians who dont want to go all the way up to the zoo to play......"
4,"I wrote this review in Copenhagen. This place is called Egg Works, so you come here for the eggs. Screw the sandwiches and no egg dishes. All I do know is that the mushroom and cheese omelet is the best I have ever had. The \""Three Pigs\"" omelet is amazing too. This is saying alot given then I am not a breakfast person and would skip it on a daily basis. I have also had the California Crepe. It is alright. Nothing spectacular. \n\nNow for the sides. Almost all the egg dishes comes with potatoes which really suck. Yes, I will eat a couple of pieces but I typically give it to someone else. Another side is the banana nut muffin. It looks very unappetizing, but it isn't bad. Imagine a flat top muffin that looks like someone was tilting the muffin tray as it was cooking.\n\nThe service is typical diner. Nothing fancy or special."
4,"I wrote this review in Croatia. I come here on a usual basis, mainly at night. I gotta say, try to avoid coming late at night (11pm+) because it is super packed! Other than that, the food is usually okay. Sometimes I get more fries than usual and sometimes I get less on my plate, it all depends if its super busy or not I think and the pace that the cooks are making the food. Most of the time the food turns out good, and rarely do I get something bad, like that one time my fries were all soggy but other than that, it's usually a good turn out.\n\nBut like I said, if you're looking for best quality, don't expect to get it during late night cravings.\n\nAlso, the food is quite a bang for your buck! $5 for a tray and drink!"
4,"I wrote this review in Seychelles. It gets 4 stars, only because the waitress did not refill my husbands diet coke.  \n\nWe arrived on a Sunday morning, a holiday weekend.  Not many choices for breakfast in our area.  We were greeted by a very friendly hostess, and the place was packed.  The staff were buzzing around, and seemed happy.\n\nWe waited about 5 minutes to be seated.  Or waitress came over right away, took our drink orders and came right back.  Took our food orders.  AND she is HAPPY!!!!  Very nice.  I ordered the BACADO Omlette - Bacon, Jack, Avocado and tomato omlette - served with potatoes and english muffin.  I ordered a side stack of buttermilk pancakes, to which our waitress suggested I sub the english muffin for the silver dollar pancakes and save the $3.95 - which I did.  \nExcellent Breakfast.  My husband ordered the California Tuna - tuna salad on a croissant.  Also another tasty meal.  \n\nWe ordered and they brought it out in about 10 minutes - hot and fresh.  \n\nFriendly, fast service.  Good food."
4,"I wrote this review in Cairo. Of all the upscale fast food joints I've tried recently, Smashburger is my favorite, but there are still many places on my to do list. Every time I've heard this place mentioned, it's compared to In n Out. While I do think that the food is better than In n Out, I still think that In n Out is a better value. All these new burger chains popping up are sort of in a different league than In n Out. In n Out is a real fast food restaurant (with a drive through, usually right off the freeway). All of these new places tend to reside in strip malls and are usually less convenient to get to. They have each other to compete with, and it's a tight race. In n Out is miles ahead of their true competitors in taste, quality, and service."
4,"I wrote this review in Beijing. I recently went there on a business lunch and my colleague and I ordered the fish and chips.  The place got  busy during the time we were there. The fish came with several dipping sauces and was very good.  The french fries were delicious and the cole slaw was also good.  I had dinner at Liberty about a year ago and it was very good then too. The food at Liberty has a distinctive style. It is not the \""run of the mill\"" variety and I will definitely return there.  The service was good but not great. I had to flag the waitress down to get a couple re-fills.  It is a nice  place to enjoy a good meal."
4,I wrote this review in San Francisco. The food is really really good.. they have a great selection of sweet and savory crepes\nThe place is cute.. really small.. and most tables are full whenever I get here.. \nBut its really irritating that they don't accept credit cards..

4,"I wrote this review in Saint Lucia. This place is sweet, I highly recommend it.  When you walk in the door be sure to look down at the floor because you're standing on a fish tank - pretty cool.  The decor is very trendy and the atmosphere is chill.  We had a drink at the bar on a Weds. night before heading out to the patio for dinner - not overly crowded which was nice.  The sushi was delicious - quality pieces and very fresh.  My only complaint was the bathroom sink - while very cool looking, the faucets don't work unless you slam the handle in and then the water just sprays out sporadically.  This was a little messy but the rest of the experience was great."
4,"I wrote this review in Tunis. This place was fabulous! A few of us came here for dinner. The menu was so creative and ever changing. I wanted to try everything. It is BYOB though I didn't bring my own. For drinks I got water and iced tea. For a starter I got the Rainbow Roll and I was technically expecting a roll, but this came out as one big piece with layers. This was a new twist for me and I thought it was delicious. Then I got fish for the main course and I basically chowed down without saying much because it was that good. It was cooked and seasoned perfectly. All the sauces flowed well together. For dessert I had the bread pudding with the scoop of ice cream/popcorn. To me, this was so fun and tasty! I recommend it! I will definitely be coming back.\n\nThe one issue I did have was with our waiter. He was polite and didn't let my iced tea run empty. Aside from his politeness, the serving skills were kind of off. I sat on the outside with my back facing to the rest of the seating area. He would basically reach across awkwardly with his arms in my face most of the time. I had no idea he was coming to deliver a dish or pick one up. I would be eating and BAM an arm would just appear next to my face. Startling."
4,"I wrote this review in Paris. Convenient to ASU, friendly service, simple warm ambiance, and pretty decent Thai food. I've had AMAZING spicy Pad Thai here and then the next time it was only so-so, so the consistency is a bit hard to predict. I really like that they offer different levels of spiciness for their menu options (personally, medium doesn't seem spicy at all to me). I enjoy the fried tofu with sweet and spicy sauce, the papaya salad (order it spicy!), the Pad Prik King (green beans, carrots and lemon leaves stir-fried with your protein of choice), and either the Pad Thai or the Pad Woon Sen (glass noodles). Service has always been extremely nice and prompt."
4,"I wrote this review in Latvia. This is typically the Walmart location I end up at based on convenience. \n\nThe service is typically good and the lines can be busy on weekends during peak times, but for the most part, the store keeps their lines to a minimum by opening more registers when they are busiest. This is especially helpful during he holidays. I recently noticed the signs at the registers saying they will open a new register any time there are more than three people in the line waiting.\n\nThey keep a good amount of stock on the shelves and they are clean and organized as well."
4,"I wrote this review in Seychelles. I brought my dog here because the other place I used to take her to has continued to raise their prices. I used the yelp deal and also received a discount for boarding her for 5 days. It seems clean and well supervised. The only thing missing was customer service. The service wasn't bad, but it wasn't nearly as friendly and knowledgeable as the other doggie day care I used to take her to. However, she came back tired, happy, and injury free so I'd probably take her back here."

4,"I wrote this review in San Jose. We went there for NYE dinner.  The surf and turf was excellent. The service was fast and friendly. They have a 20% coupon for checking in that the manager says is rarely used.  With the coupon, the prices are fair and worth the trip."
4,"I wrote this review in Niger. Everyone is complaining that this place is pretentious...well that just happens to be one of the reasons why I come here!\n\nI love the lay out of the store, it's always clean and they let you sample whatever flavours you want downstairs before you buy. The queue is crazy on the weekend so come on a week night if you can to avoid the mayhem. You can bring the capsules back for recycling and they keep all of your info on file so there is no need to remember anything, which is perfect for me.\n\nNespresso has made me a nicer person in the morning so I for one love this store and their product."
5,"I wrote this review in Moldova. Nom Nom Nom.  Love this place! Located near the south park mall - parking isn't too bad because of that.  Been here more times than I can count.  They gave me coupons one of the first times I went and have been back ever since to use them.  They care about what the consumers think, as the manager is always walking around asking how things are. It can get busy quick, so I've had to sit at the bar a few times, because there was no wait. The Avocado Tini is my fav. I must get it every time! The music that plays in the bathroom is interesting, I asked the server about the story behind it - I don't remember off hand, but a interesting one."
5,"I wrote this review in Belize. An ancient compressor (Chrysler 1973) on my older A/C unit failed.  Mark came out in the evening and went straight to work diagnosing the failed part just to be sure it was dead.  He tested everything and indeed it was dead.  Every other contractor just looked at it and supposed it was dead.  Mark actually tested the power, grounds, caps etc.\n\nHe gave me a very competitive written proposal for repairs.  In the end I used another provider due to a very long relationship with that person (but at a higher price).  \n\nI would use and recommend Mark again at any time."
5,"I wrote this review in Munich. One of the most memorable restaurants, since my future husband to be proposed to me here, since we were in Vegas to celebrate our 5 year anniversary.  We sat next to the window and was able to watch the Bellagio water show and see the sunset.  \n\nWe ate the sauteed pork chop and Filet Mignon which was delicious everything was soft and was not over cooked. The finance tried a mojito and I drank the berry champagne, which was also good.\n\nThe waiter even help set up my fiance's proposal, I was already crying when the dessert came out.  Another customer from another table saw my fiance propose to me and told me to stop crying and bought us two glasses of champagne. How lucky were we! \n\nAgain one of the most memorable restaurant, I would definately come back here every time I visit Las Vegas."

5,"I wrote this review in Algeria. It's funny how life changes when you get married, or have a child or even buy a house...I used to detest going to Home Depot, so much that it would make me nauseous and sleepy. I would avoid going here like it was a plague. \n\nWe just bought a house (WOO HOO) and we've spent nearly every weekend, at least 1-2x in the same day at the Home Depot. So much so, that the people working there, like the paint people, know us!!!\n\nI don't know what the requirements are to work there, I don't know if they have to have a background in handy man (woman) 201, but they really know their stuff. Always very helpful, very knowledgeable and the paint ppl...there's not much I can't say! I've brought the same gallon of custom paint, 2x, and wanted them to change the color, because the one I had originally chosen, doesn't look good on my walls. No worries, they will adjust the paint until it's to my liking!\n\nDid I mention they accept competitor's coupons! I love the Home Depot...maybe my outlook will also change for auto parts stores."

Tait and his crew have been taking care of my car for the past 9 years, and I have NEVER had a complaint.  \n\nFirst, Tait is incredibly honest.  Tells me when a noise is cosmetic, or a cause for concern, and just how long I can wait.  Always upfront about pricing, and usually ends up being less than the original quote.  I have never had to go back for the same issue.  \n\nEven if I didn't love my Honda, I would keep buying them just to keep Hon-Man as my mechanic.  \n\nThe only thing negative is (and I've told him this before) - TAIT - GET RID OF THE FLASH WEBSITE.....I hate waiting for that to play out when I just want your phone number."

5,"I wrote this review in Peru. A great production and an even more amazing set.  I'll avoid all the nitty-gritty details since everyone else has written a very thorough review.\n\nIt was explained to me that the theater was built specifically for this show, which makes sense for why it just works so well!  With that in mind, they could focus on specific details, extra mechanics, etc... just for the show, and it definitely makes a difference.\n\nThe seats... I sat in row three, but I wished I sat a few rows back.  With all those \""extra\"" details in mind, a lot of action can happen around the theater that I couldn't always focus on.  Being a few more rows back would have assisted.\n\nThe show... 90 minutes, a compact and action packed show.  It did feel rushed in some areas, but it's still very good.  A quick critique of the performers, they were all amazing, but I did feel that the Phantom's voice was a bit weaker than I would have expected.  I don't know if it was an off day (or I should check if it was an under study), but it was just a bit below expectations in this one area.\n\nOverall... go see it if you can, it's an experience worth paying for."
5,"I wrote this review in United Arab Emirates. It seems every single time I walk into this store, I get the best service.  It could possibly be because the employees see this teeny Asian girl struggling with a gargantuan 20 pound pile of clothing.  Anywho, the employees of the Las Vegas Topshop store approach me quickly and take all of my clothing to the personal shopping section of the store.  This section is separated from the other (normal) fitting rooms and it comes with its own private cashier.  Very awesome!  I take my time in the store, and constantly add to my already gigantic pile of things to try on.  They also never provide a limit to how many things I can bring into the fitting room, unlike most stores who have a meager limit of 4 or 5 things allowed.  I do tend to blow my load in this store, so the employees are always friendly and helpful.  :-)  One of my all-time favorite stores to shop in!"

He structures his business on small group classes. Each class has between 5 and 10 people, so I get the attention of a personal trainer without the high cost of one on one sessions.  Borris and his staff are highly knowledgable and will custom tailor each exercise to accommodate everyone from a beginner to a competitive athlete.  I highly recommend checking them out!"
5,"I wrote this review in Athens. Tasty, good value sandwich selection.  Great coffee.  And I've just this morning discovered they make a mean bacon roll too, and I'm so fussy about bacon rolls I rarely buy them.  Very friendly staff."
5,"I wrote this review in Zurich. Crossfit Embody is awesome. It is a fresh take on your typical warehouse boxes, meaning very clean and hip. No detail was left out. While being a new gym, all the equipment you would want is here, ghd, sleds, rowers, in fact more than most established gyms in town. There digital interface with Wodify is amazing. They offer classes for all ages, with a push for kids. I Been in many boxes in town and in other cities, and Crossfit Embody has made an effort of everything great in those boxes to be a part of theirs. Can not wait to go back to see what they added. A must stop and visit if coming to Vegas/Henderson."
5,"I wrote this review in Tianjin. Finally!!!  I first tasted Garrett's in 2001 on vacation in Chicago and have been hooked since then.  So any chance I get when I have friends visiting or traveling through Chicago I ask them to bring me some.  I did a happy dance when I heard it was coming here.  Being a local the Strip is the last place I like to go but made a trip to Planet Hollywood and was pleasantly surprised, valeted at the shops and went straight to Garrett's.  There wasn't even a line which was what I was expecting.  I got the Chicago Mix of course, cheese and caramel!   Delicious as always!"

5,I wrote this review in Beirut. In-N-Out! Nom nom nom!\n\nI normally don't like fast food at all!  I don't even eat meat so who would have thought I could find a grilled cheese sandwich so exciting but there is something about this place...\n\nThey grill that bread perfectly and the combination with the lettuce and mushroom is just delicious.  They have great fries and this stuff isn't all greasy or hurt my stomach (like most fast food joints!) I also enjoy their milk shakes.\n\nI have also been to one in the Bay Area and this one is way way better.  \n\nIn-N-Out is our Vegas tradition and probably the cheapest meal you will get on your trip.  This may as well be a Vegas institution for me. haha.
5,"I wrote this review in Grenada. I have seen Dr Hurley a few times over the past year to help with my allergies and sleep issues.  He's been great.  A professional who listens to your concerns and doesn't just jump into prescribing medication or recommending surgery.  He explains what's going on and what he recommends for treatment.  If you don't feel comfortable with it, he'll offer alternative treatment options.  This is how all doctors should be.  You also don't feel rushed, like you're a number.\n\nI'm glad I found Dr Hurley and most of all, I'm glad he's covered by my insurance!\n\nReturn Factor - 100%"

Nope, I need a root canal. I was literally sweating.\n\nI swear it didn't hurt at all. Lol. What a chicken I was. Dr Crow was nice. Patient. He had a couple corny jokes but they helped.\n\nI'm actually in the waiting room with my son. I'm kinda laughing because I know Erhart he's thinking."
5,"I wrote this review in Moldova. We happened to visiting my boyfriends family while we were in Vegas and they decided to take us to get some sushi.  We arrived here around 7 for the dinner buffet which was only $22 dollars.  There was no wait time for a table and the service was fast and very friendly.  We had a pretty good size group and they were very accommodating.  I LOVE sushi and i am always very skeptical when I go to sushi places, ESPECIALLY for an all you can eat sushi.  I have a very weak stomach, so FRESH is definitely key.  Some buffets that you go to that serve sushi usually have their sushi sitting over ice and sitting there for who knows how long.  Here at Sin City, you order all that you want and they make them fresh as soon as you finish eating some of your other rolls.  Also, I'm not a big octopus fan, but they offered us some octopus dish that was cut up into pieces, it was very good.  They offer an array of custom roll's, but of all, I would have to say that the Tiger roll is my favorite!  The Ahi spicey tuna on top is literally so tender, it's almost like butter, it totally melts in  your mouth.  It doesn't even have that fishy taste and the spice on it, is JUST RIGHT.  I am definitely coming back here when I visit in December.  I totally think  they need to open one up in LA!!"
5,I wrote this review in Cambodia. Their car washes are excellent and they do a wonderful job!  I love their oil changes for you get a free car wash each time you change your oil and $3.00 off your next oil change too. Friendly workers and Amazing place!  Smog checks only $18.00 too

5,"I wrote this review in Tunis. Soto Ayam was the best I've had.  The broth, which is typically very mild in most Sotos, was flavorful and aromatic, with a strong kick of citrus ginger from the galangal.  \n\nBeef Rendang was equally flavorful and rich, with a pleasantly spicy dollop of chili sambal on the side (could have eaten a whole bowl of it)."
5,I wrote this review in Accra. Have to say hand down the best detailer in Vegas.  If you want something done right and in a professional and timely manor you have to call Theo.

5,"I wrote this review in Tanzania. This place was awesome, we will for sure return! I found this gem on Yelp, always looking to try new sushi restaurants. My husband and I came here for dinner, we walked in and I became a little leery because we were the only ones in the place. We ordered yellow tail nigiri, gyoza, a shrimp tempura roll, salmon & tuna roll in rice paper, and a california roll with fresh tuna on top (I don't remember the actual names of the rolls). \n\nThe meal started out with a complimentary cucumber salad, which was very good. Then we were brought out our order of gyoza which was a very generous portion with 8 dumplings (usually you get 6). After that we received our nigiri, which was nice and fresh tasting, and then the rest of our rolls that we had ordered. The chef had some extra yellow tail, so he made us a complimentary salad with it that included avocado and rice wine vinegar, it was fantastic! The fish was very fresh and flavorful, and the portions were very generous. We ordered too much and were stuffed by the end of the meal. We were however, able to fit in the complimentary mochi ice cream we were given. The service here was amazing, and we felt very welcomed. I would highly recommend Harumi Sushi!"
5,"I wrote this review in Iran. So we have two weeks in Phoenix, and we came with a list of old favorite places, and 5th Ave Cafe was on the list!\n\nI always order the Chorizo Cowboy Skillet with corn tortillas and add a side of bacon.  This is probably not good for me.  My wife orders the Mediterranean Omelet with a side of fruit. This is probably better for her.  \n\nIn either case, we consistently enjoy our breakfasts here.  In fact, out of all the breakfast places in Phoenix, this is the one that we both enjoy every time.\n\nThe service this morning was quick, and in spite of a huge rush, the servers were kind of awesome."
5,"I wrote this review in Qatar. I had such an amazing experience at this salon!!\n\nThey had a special featured on Groupon for their Amnesia Retreat hot stone massage for $39, which is normally $90.  Also, all the proceeds went to a cancer charity which I thought was awesome that the salon was doing something like that.  \n\nI had a great experience from the minute I walked into the door.  The salon receptionist was a guy who was very friendly and professional.  He had a glass of water waiting for me.  They were right on time with my appointment.  My massage was with Tweety (Her real name is Thuy).  She is AMAZING!!!  She was so kind, cute, & really down to earth.  Sometimes I feel a little uncomfortable getting a massage from people, but not her.  She made me feel 100% comfortable!  I also had never had a hot stone massage before.  It is definitely an magical feeling.  I loved every second of it and didn't want it to end.  \n\nThe only downfall about this salon for me, is that I live on the exact opposite end of the city of it's location, but after an experience like that, I wouldn't mind making the drive back out there!! \n\nThanks Amnesia Salon!"

Don't miss out on the chandelier bar, great drinks, incredible atmosphere and a great place to have a date."
5,"I wrote this review in Bulgaria. Easily my favorite local place to eat!!! I order the same thing every time because it's SO good that I just can't get myself to venture away from it. It's the Local DIsh Burger & it is to die for!!!! The burger is cooked to perfection, then it's topped with pimiento cheese, thick crispy bacon, and spinach and served on a pretzel roll. OMG, it makes my mouth water thinking about it!!! I've also tried (because other people have ordered it :-) ) the chicken & waffles (YUM!), the chicken wings (which, according to my daughter, are the BEST in town - and she would know!!!), the Pulled Pork BBQ sandwich (awesome), and the cheese fondue (SO good, but could use more toast points with it!) \n\nSo happy to have such a wonderful place to eat in Fort Mill. I would much rather stay local & support local than driving uptown. I can't recommend Local Dish highly enough!!! Incredible fresh food, fast & friendly service, & a homey atmosphere.\n\nHeading there for lunch today!!"
5,I wrote this review in Serbia. The only bad thing bad about this place is they are a cleveland browns bar and I am a diehard steelers fan. Food is friggin awesome and pizza is half off on the week ends. Chicken wings are equally awesome with ranch that is utterly addictive. And for all the fools below hating about the  smoking. Dude it's a bar. A BAR. Get over it.   More people need to go here
5,"I wrote this review in Guinea-Bissau. I love Arizona's beer culture. AZ has numerous amazing craft breweries and Papago is on top of the list for me. \n\nThey're probably best known for their orange blossom. It's a delicious vanilla orange wheat beer that just hits the spot. It's so smooth and full of flavor. Their coconut joe has a hint of coconut with strong coffee flavor. They used to have another stout that was Irish cream base and I'm very sad to report they no longer offer it.\n\nThey offer a good variety of draft beers from other craft breweries (local and non) and they have multiple fridges stocked with cold, delicious beer you can purchase and drink right there. \n\nInside is spacious and has lots of table options. Service can be slow but only during peak time and even then, you won't go long without another cold one in your hand.\n\nThe food is actually delicious. I am a huge fan of their caprese flat bread. The balsamic reduction is so good! Their pizzas are a good size for the price and always consistent in quality and taste. \n\nThey now have the steel growlers, along with their glass, so be sure to pick one up too. The steel growler is the coolest steel ones I've seen so far in local breweries."
5,"I wrote this review in Finland. I think it's mainly the staff. 3 times there and 3 times we were treated really well. Fun, friendly, and good at their job. The food, really good. Last night we had a huge, garlicky Caesar. The fish was cobia which is a firmer fish (not steaky) on this incredible coconut milk rice pile. It was a tasty dish. I had the tuna app. Not great, but not bad. Will try something else next time. Gladly has a huge single malt scotch list. If you're into it, it's cool how they bring out this machine that makes the big pure ice ball. Nice atmosphere and nothing felt really overpriced. The bill $110, with 4 scotches. Seems reasonable for a nice Saturday night out."
5,"I wrote this review in Brazil. Finally got back here again.  Menu has changed some since last time.  I ordered too much.  I put an order in for a bowl of chicken noodle soup and the fish amok.  I was starting to get hungry so in the meantime I ordered a mango drink.  It was more like a dessert.  It was like a mango soda.  Very delish.  After drinking about half of it my soup arrived.  It was even better than what I had expected.\nNow with this mango drink and really trying to finish up the soup I was feeling quite full.  I asked the waiter to pack up the fist to go.\nI had the fish the next day and I am hooked!!!!!!  The first 2 bites I wasn't quite sure as it tasted quite different but after the 3rd, that was it for me.\nI have to get back there sooner next time and not wait for another year."
5,"I wrote this review in Trinidad and Tobago. 4.5 .5 off for hard ass tires.\n\nThis is awesome - i've never been gokarting, unless you count MarioKart.\n\nLet me tell you, this is NOTHING like MarioKart. These things go somewhere around 60MPH, and my best time around a 1/4 mile track was 1:27. Yes, minute and 27 seconds! whoo!\n\nsliding out is easy to do with their hard tires, but seriously - this requires relinquishing all fears and pushing your driving skills to the extreme! There is seriously very little risk.\n\nIf you're a speed junkie like me, you HAVE to do this. \n\nBTW, with a group, it's 70 bucks, you get use of the lounge (and their wii), a t-shirt, free drink, and 2 times around. Plus you get to race your friends. We were there for a bachelor party and had 13 people."
5,"I wrote this review in Ireland. Winning!  \nHeavy D (imperial Devils Ale) & The Sonoran Dog together is simply Heaven!\nLOCAL BREW, Great Food & a Great Atmosphere combine to make one hell of an experience.  Did I mention that its in a really cool part of town as well?  YOU MUST GO!"
5,"I wrote this review in San Marino. Oh where, oh where can you find decent Indian food in Vegas?\n\nBollywood Grill, that's where. In fact, I would argue it's the best Indian I've had outside of the UK (where Indian food is as common as Mexican food in L.A.)  and may be a close approximation of India itself.\n\nThe menu keeps up the Bollywood them of the decor, separating items into Previews, Opening Scenes and Hits. And tasty hits they are, especially if you're a curry fan. \n\nI had the Chicken Karishma and it was perfect, served with a separate bowl of rice and the curry itself sitting on a bowl atop a flame right at the table. \n\nThe Trailers were worth coming early. The pandoras were incredible.\n\nHelps to also have a very eagfer and helpful staff who will help explain the items on the menu without any mocking or disappointment. \n\nOne of the better local dining experiences I've had."
5,"I wrote this review in Warsaw. So for most people, their stagette means drinking your face off and partying with your girlfriends. Sure, I did that, but this was the reason I came to Las Vegas.\n\nMy maid of honour asked me what I wanted to do to celebrate the last days of singledom. Umm, Buffet of Buffets! For $55 (including tax) you have unlimited access to seven different buffets for 24 hours. Actually, it's only 17 hours because the buffets are closed between midnight and 7am.  This would take some planning...\n\nWe started at the Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood and spent a good chunk of time there... For dinner after running around town, we went to Lago at Caesar's. Even after my friends left, me and one friend stayed behind to polish off a couple more creme brulees. The next morning, my friends tried to wake me up at 7am to go back to Lago, but I refused. At a more reasonable hour of 10am, we tried the Village Buffet at Paris. They just kept getting better and better. I really wish we were able to try more buffets, but there is always next time. \n\nSo considering that each buffet is like $30, this is such a steal! I went to three (due to poor planning... wandering too far from the included buffets, finding the Rio shuttle too late, etc) and they were awesome... I would definitely do this again."
5,"I wrote this review in Tuvalu. Downtown Chandler has one breakfast spot that surpasses all of its competition: BRUNCHIES! The omelets are huge, the potatos are crisp and delicious, and the biscuits and gravy are, truly, legendary and must be seen to be believed (really, you'll go wide-eyed when you see their biscuits).\n\nI was not surprised to learn that Brunchies was owned by the Serrano family, which operates another favorite of mine, SERRANO'S, an amazing Mexican restaurant just down the street. I think I read somewhere that the Serrano family business is one of the oldest continually-operating small businesses in Chandler, dating back to around 1919 or so. I will attribute their longevity and success to the quality of the food in their restaurants, and the dining experience they give their customers.\n\nHINT: especially on weekends, the wait at Brunchies can be pretty long, but you can call-in and get your name added to the list before you arrive -- and thereby cut down on your wait-time once you get to the restaurant... but a big caveat there, don't call so early that you miss when you're name is called!"
5,"I wrote this review in United Arab Emirates. The best buffet in Vegas so far,  get the ticket at 5:00, just wait 10 min, you can get call to pay for dinner.\nThe food inside has variety choice and dish are just delicious, each portion is small that you don't need to worry that waste the extra food.\nThe crab leg was cut well, you can enjoy it easily, the oyster is fresh and sweet.\nThe dessert taste great, especially their Macaron, very chewy.\nWe will definitely come back if the rate still good next time."
5,"I wrote this review in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Came here looking for a good meal, for a reasonable price. What we got, was a great dining experience! My wife and I are always in search of good food, since recently moving to Vegas about a year ago. From the moment we walked it, we were greeted kindly, and got a great table location, within 5 minutes (Tues night 9pm). Our server Antoun, was awesome, and provided great customer service. My wife had prime rib, and I had the ribeye, both cooked to perfection! I really came for the escargot....and it was amazing!!! I almost had it for dessert, it was that good! Cheesecake came with our meal, which was yummy too. \nOur drinks were delish as well. I highly recommend the Chardonnay, by William Hill!!!. When we got the bill, we were pleasantly surprised that it was barely over $100! Remember, we each had the four course meal, escargot app, drinks, and dessert.....at a French restaurant!!! Magnifique!!!"

5,"I wrote this review in Nepal. Absolutely amazing from start to finish. We sat on the right side, between the far right and middle and about 10 rows up or so. Comfy seats with cup holders. Very easy to get in and out. You can bring snacks in from the concession stand. The green juggling girl, the two dudes in the spinning circles, the girl jumping on and off the long stretchy platform...absolutely stunning. The only thing that I noticed is that the two clowns on a few occasions were filling up time and there performances weren't as funny anymore."
5,"I wrote this review in Philadelphia. Favorite Pho in the phoenix area so far.  \nGreat, tender meat in my pho chin nam (#8).\nI see they also have bun bo hue on the menu so I'll have to try that sometime soon.    \nNom nom.\n\nFriendly staff.\n\nSee ya there!"

5,"I wrote this review in Kiribati. For my birthday party a day ago my fiancee and some friends bought me a cake from Tammie Coe for their surprise party. It was jaw droppingly gorgeous, it was a gothic coffin cake with red velvet and cheesecake filling between.

Thanks to Tammie Coe for helping make my birthday one of the most, if not the most, memorable ever"
5,"I wrote this review in Iceland. Fantastic food. Great prices. Nice locale.  Every time I go in, I always feel like they're making food special for me. Oh wait, they are !  I'm a picky eater, so I always deviate a little from the regular menu ingredients. I love that they can cook to suit my needs.  It proves difficult sometimes at other restaurants. But not at Asian Cafe."
5,"I wrote this review in Cayman Islands . SPECTACULAR GINORMOUS club!! \n\nLove this place! Huge in door club with a million tables, outdoor tables. a pool, bar in the middle of the pool with card tables so if you go looking for your friends don't expect to find them b/c this place is soo packed and sooo big...like a needle in a haystack. Expect LONGGG lines! I went at alone to meet up with friends (miracle to find them) so I bypassed the long line by asking someone from bottle service to let me in...of course I paid the cover. They made it sound like it would be outrageous to pay....I was willing to pay any price to not wait in that ridiculous line...it was only $20. Heard it changes by the hour. \n\nGreat music and best club I experienced!"
5,"I wrote this review in Comoros. Delicious pizza, best in town that I've had. The ingredients are clearly top quality and the crust is perfect, the perfect balance between chewy and crisp. The toppings are balanced so that you can taste the different bits and everything isn't overpowered by tomato sauce. Their salads are excellent as well, though I think a bit pricey. The atmosphere is decent too, laid back."

5,I wrote this review in Panama. Excellent. The huge good menu pairs very well with their beer selection. They sometimes have Saturday meal specials. Go on Saturdays for delicious food.\n\nI love Mr. Pineapple.\n\nCheck it out ASAP. They even have water misters outside. Class act brewery. Much better than Desert Eagle or Four Peaks.
5,"I wrote this review in Nepal. Love this place. Whenever I go to Vegas, I'm prepped to drop a couple hundo at whatever, no expenses are spared when it comes to fun. But this shining jewel on the strip is where I can get a great meal at a fantastic price.\n\nTacos are $2 or $3 each! Tons of meat choices: carne asada, chicken, lengua, shoulder, etc. They make them right in front of you so it's nice and hot. \n\nThere are canopies outside for you to sit which are a godsend considering you're in the middle of the desert and it gets toasty. \n\nThis place is a bit far from the Cosmo, Caesar's, and the like. Closer to Circus Circus but if you're itching to save some bucks on your food, then there's no better place."
5,"I wrote this review in Algeria. This review would be best served by a story. Imagine you're a cowboy in the old west. Think Clint Eastwood in High Plains Drifter. But you have a cook that travels with you in a chuck wagon. This cook is trained in all things amazingly tasty & secretly, he's trying to kill you - slowly. What I had at this place is what he feeds you every day.  Eggs Benedict Adovada. It is the most amazing decadent irresistible thing I've ever eaten. So as the cowboy, you'd eat it every day & after a few weeks you're too fat to get on your horse, your gun belt no longer fits & your chest hurts intermittently. And so one day, as an overweight, unarmed coronary walking the plains, you're shot by vaqueros & the cook smiles. YOU MUST GO HERE."
5,"I wrote this review in Serbia. This is by far my favorite taco shop in the states, and that is probably because my all time favorite is the Tacos El Gordo in Tijuana. For some authentic & delicious tacos this place is a must, plus you can't beat the prices for the amount of food you get. I was in Vegas for 48hrs and literally managed to eat here on 3 separate occasions, and I plan for next trip to have a layover in Vegas just so I can stop thru and get my fix."

5,"I wrote this review in Cote d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast). Today was yet another great experience in the dentist's chair at Dentistry for Madison! My husband and I have been seeing Dr. Hazen and Co. for several years now and not only do we receive the utmost and up-to-date in dental care, but it's FUN! Find another dentist who dresses up as Elvis for Halloween and can simultaneously perform painless, meticulous drilling and filling. For most of my life I've experienced acute anxiety when faced with dental appointments for even a cleaning; not anymore. To a person, everyone at Dentistry for Madison is thoroughly professional, and it's clear that they love what they do, their patients, and working together. I can't imagine going anywhere else for dental care...and I won't!"

5,"I wrote this review in Senegal. Sushi Samba is my absolute favorite place for happy hour while in Vegas!\n\nThree words to describe this place: chic, sexy, sushi. From their delicious and creative sushi rolls to their amazing drinks, I always enjoy myself here...and no matter what part of the strip I am at, I make sure I get to the Palazzo and get my Sushi Samba fix.\n\nMy favorites here are the Berkshire Pork Belly with butterscotch miso, a Caipirinha, and the eel and avocado rolls.\n\nThe service has always been great and the bartenders are friendly and informative. I love the concept of Latin and Asian cuisines colliding (i.e. Chifa in Philly) and I think they execute it perfectly.\n\nAfter a long, hot day at the pool parties, Sushi Samba is my go-to spot."
5,"I wrote this review in Estonia. Although very out of the way for me, I happened to be in the neighborhood while going to see my hair stylist. I was a little bit early so I decided to grab a quick lunch. I saw the ratings and thought this was the place. The service was solid and the prices were pretty standard. It was on a weekend, so I did not see the super awesome lunch special deals that some raved about. I ordered my go to dish that allows me to best gauge a new place - drunken noodles with chicken. These were probably the best drunken noodles I've had out of countless places that I have already tried. The price was around $11 and we also shared the calamari appetizer which was delicious at the time, but pretty forgettable. I wouldn't drive across town for the calamari, but I would go for their drunken noodles every time I am in the area to get my hair done (once a month on average). I heard the waiter make curry recommendations to other patrons, so after I have had my fill of the drunken noodles, I may venture on to the curry."
5,"I wrote this review in Los Angeles. I love the poker palace, last couple times we were in Vegas we drove up here for some 21. The dealers are super friendly and the drinks are cheap, this place is in no way scary! Will be moving to Las Vegas soon and plan on coming here regularly."
5,I wrote this review in Kenya. We had dinner and the food was very authentic. I had Hatch Green Chile and chicken enchilada and my dining partner had the beef burrito combo plate. I was surprised to learn the beef was ground and not shredded. Flavor of salsa has right mix of spices and tasted fresh. Cute place tucked away in the strip mall. Very good choice for lunch or dinner in you are in the neighborhood. Prices are reasonable for what you get. No liquor license and not sure if you can byob (cold Pacifico would have been nice).

They have accommodated our son with Autism specially well. Our family is truly grateful for the support and attention they have given our son and family. Thank you Hubbard for teaching our kids all about water and swim!
5,"I wrote this review in Brazil. I'm not originally from Pittsburgh so I didn't see what the Manor was like before the renovation but all I know now is that it's my favorite place to see a movie. The location is much safer than the Waterfront, the tickets are affordable and so is the food! The staff is really friendly and one of the major points for me is the quality of the movies, the picture quality is amazing as is the sound. I will always avoid going to big box movie theaters unless I have to."
5,"I wrote this review in Turkey. I hate buying cars more than anything, but this was a painless experience.  I had two previous bad experiences while on my recent search (see Sands Chevrolet in Surprise and Avondale Honda) so I was already bitter when I contacted Austin Hart (Internet/Fleet).  I quickly changed my tune when he was very easy to deal with and didn't try any sleazy tactics.  I told him what I would pay and what I would like for my trade in, we were able to make a deal pretty quickly and I was in and out.  If you are looking for a good honest salesman at a nice customer service oriented dealership give Austin a call."
5,"I wrote this review in Italy. I don't normally write reviews but this is one of my favorite salons in Arizona. The whole staff is super friendly and very professional. I get my cut and color with Milana. She's so cute and friendly, it's a blast every time I go. She's one of the only people I trust with my hair. She's even thorough with my deep conditioning. Love this place, can't wait for my next appointment."
5,"I wrote this review in Turkey. Okay, if you have never been to a max museum, you need to go. I know you think they sound boring or they aren't your thing, I mean it's just a bunch of max sculptures, but bring your camera and some friends and the fun will ensue as you stick your head in a tigers mouth, get married to george clooney and touch j-lo till her cheecks blush. This is one of the best things to do in vegas. It's easy to find, right off the strip. Only downside is that it's the kind of thing you only really need to do once. Although, if you bring a friend who has never been before, the fun starts all over again."
5,I wrote this review in Iraq. I was brought here by some friends and co workers. I haven't ever been here and I must say it was perfect. This place was very friendly and very delicious. The shanty was my favorite drink. I highly recommend the chicken mole.
5,"I wrote this review in Hamburg. Pretty awesome tourist attraction. Takes you way up high. Kinda romantic of you think. You can't bring your outside drinks in..... However, there is a bar near the entrance and they give you your drinks in this plastic souvenir cup that you can keep. Those drinks you can bring into the high roller. What a way to make money right? Haha \n\nThe views are awesome and you don't have to worry about your pod being too crowded either. Oh ya, you have to walk on while it's still moving.... Don't worry there's a safety net. It only moves 1mph so it's really slow. I can't even tell it moving!\n\nThis is definitely something to do while in Vegas!"
5,"I wrote this review in Rome. Love love love. The appetizer portions are a WEE bit bigger here than in LA. Loved the mixed greens, shishito peppers and mochi ice cream. However, was not a fan of the lobster dynamite. Loved the ambiance, too!"
5,"I wrote this review in Yemen. I'm always on the lookout for sushi on the west side of town... and this one is a winner. Combine a creative menu, generous servings, and affordable prices, and you've got a winner here. The owner and staff are extremely friendly and talkative, too - definitely a plus!"
5,I wrote this review in Morocco. The Spa at Camelback Inn is one of my favorite places in Arizona. The resort is beautiful and the spa is amazing. The grounds of the spa are gorgeous and tranquil. The Swedish massage is the best I have ever had. Even the shampoo and hand soap smell delicious - I had to buy them for myself. A day here takes away all my worries. I am addicted!
5,"I wrote this review in Trinidad and Tobago. Absolute best pedicure I've ever gotten from a strip-mall, walk-in type nail salon. Was very bright, fresh, and clean! I got the fresh lime pedicure and it was amazing. Lasted a long time, say goodbye to 1 minute massages! With that said, you will probably want to come here when you have some extra time, I was in there for over an hour & was worked on right away. Polish selection was great, and the gel polish selections looked beautiful I will have to try a gel mani on my next visit. The whole experience was great, and the price for what you pay is amazing. I left with a completely relaxed and happy feeling! Can't wait to come back."
5,I wrote this review in Phoenix. Starbucks products at church for a yummy service!  I like the fact that everyone who works there does it for free and all of the profits go directly to the church.  Love!
5,"I wrote this review in Indonesia. Boyfriend and I had a great experience here. My co-worker recommended these guys and the Yelp reviews confirmed it was a good decision. \n\nPoor Milly Mutt had a rash on her belly and was acting weird and not as spunky as normal. We found out she had an allergic reaction to something and had a parasite. They gave her a shot on spot and gave us the results of the poo test a day later saying they already had her prescription ready for us. \n\nEveryone there loved Milly, as I am sure they love every animal that walks through the doors. Boyfriend met with the doctor and said he was nice and great with the pups.\n\nWhen I called to make the appointment, the woman I spoke with was so kind and excited to meet Milly and you could tell she was an all around animal person which made me happy.\n\nI plan on taking our two cats here to get shots and get their chips updated and taking Milly Mutt back here for a chip and any checkups/emergencies. Its great to finally have a relationship with a vet in the area."
5,"I wrote this review in Tuvalu. I really enjoy this place, its very close to my boyfriends house so we always come here. The chicken tikka masala is very good, and the goat curry is great!! The servers are very friendly and treat customers very well. It is worth trying.\n\nUpdate: Their lunch buffet has been getting better and better by the day!!!!"
5,I wrote this review in Gambia. Marlene C. is awesome. Always asks me what I want on each visit. That is VERY important. Your stylist should NEVER assume they know what you want.
5,"I wrote this review in Panama. My family and I stayed at the Alexis Park Resort's 2 story, 2 bedroom Regal Suite this holiday season. The suite we stayed in exceeded our expectations. It was very clean, updated and well maintained. Our suite was located in a very quiet area of the property. There was plenty of parking available with easy access to the suite. The hotel is located across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel and a short five minute drive to the strip. My family was happy because we did not have to deal with the crazy slot machines or hustle and bustle of the Las Vegas Strip.  The manager Casey Meyers did an excellent job at accommodating all of my requests. She was so welcoming and took great care of us. The customer service my family received from Casey along with the rest of the staff was wonderful and made us feel right at home. Thanks Casey for everything!"
5,"I wrote this review in Jakarta. My new favorite bar in Phoenix! Dress anywhere from Casual to Fancy and you fit in. Two step, hip hop, slow dancing, line dancing. They have everything. \n\nThe bar tenders are incredible and take care of you well! TIP EM BIG!!"
5,"I wrote this review in San Marino. I don't know what happened with the bad reviews on other site, I have been going there for almost 5 years now. They all very nice. I don't speak Japanese, that's true their English are not great. But they try their best to explain to me if there are things i don't understand. Some reviewers on other site feel they rude, maybe just because their English are not perfect.\n\nThe best part of them is honesty, i don't know how many times i went to other auto places, other place will tell you lots of part that you need to change EVEN actually you don't have to. They will tell you anything they can to make the extra money. Japanese Car Service is not like that at all. So many times, i went there because i thought i have some problems with the car, they checked for me, and many times they tell me, there is no major problem, and they'll explain to me why.\n\nAlso, many times i went there to have my oil change because it's been 5-6 months since i last change, but again, they told me, i should wait another 1-2 months because when they checked, my oil still clean, and the reason because i don't drive much. So my oil stay clean longer than usual.\n\nThose honesty can save you a lot of money compared to going to other places, where they will try to rip your wallet and let it bleed all over the place. Japanese Car Service are the best!"
5,"I wrote this review in Samoa. This is the most amazing toffee I've ever tasted.  It's not hard or sticky, rather soft and crumbly.  It melts in your mouth and that sweet taste is like a hug on the inside.  I serve it at every special occasion and it's always a hit."
5,"I wrote this review in Iraq. Let me just start by saying, I have a sweet tooth... I LOVE cakes above all else, and PS cakes are my favorite! PS has made me some wonderful treats for my kids birthdays and my own parties, Birthday cakes, lemon curd cupcakes, red velvet cake pops, s'mores cupcakes with toasted marshmallow creme, strawberry thumbprints and peanut butter brownie bars, even Gluten Free cupcakes (I did the GF cleanse diet once, only lost 5lbs) and they are THE BEST! Their cakes are beautiful with amazing details and Everything is always incredibly fresh and delish! Presentation is also super important to me and everything is always presented beautifully.\nBy the Way, the PS Sweet shop is so cute I just love the feel of the place. It is personal and cozy and everything you want from your Hometown bakery. I love that the shop is owner operated. Oh, and I almost forgot my favorite... you can drop by and satisfy a quick sweet fix and wash it down with a glass of Organic milk... How awesome is that!"
5,"I wrote this review in Chicago. best. drunk. food. EVER!!! it's right next to tao and its open really late which is perfect if you're hungry after sweating off all the alcohol you've consumed during the night. i've been here twice and never had to wait...but then again it was like at 2 or 3. BUT, there were still a ton of people there. i got the chicken and waffles...which was heavenly. i shared it with my friend and still had some to take home, so the portions are definitely huge. I also had some of my friend's chicken flautas...MAAAAAAAAAN with the green sauce. SOOOO GOOD!! we took that home too. to me, grand lux cafe is like a less classier cheesecake factory. its a lot cheaper, but the food is still just as good in terms of quality and taste. and our server was so nice. I can't imagine having to serve a bunch of drunk annoying asses all night. if you're gonna eat unhealthy after a long night of drinks, might as well come here and pay a few extra dollars and have the most orgasmic drunk food ever, rather than go to mcdonalds or some other fast food place, just saying!"
5,"I wrote this review in Barbados. The staff is always awesome. I love their liquids. I recommend trying Eternal Sunshine. Still my all time favorite from all of the shops liquids I've tried. Also, they have a rewards program...seriously, if you haven't been here to try their stuff, go."
5,"I wrote this review in South Africa. Great little hidden-in-plain-sight lounge, great for an early morning coffee, which transforms into an adorable piano bar late at night!  Who knew?  Not many people, quite frankly, and let's keep it that way.  Just between us, if you are not interested in the usual Vegas scene, and want a place to just chill, this is the place for you."
5,"I wrote this review in Cape Town. The Blind Pig used to be the name of Cowboy Monkey. Don't assume a thing. The two have hardly anything in common.  \n\nChris Knight, the owner, has nailed the cozy, quaint, dimly lit feeling of the traditional English pub. Probably because he's originally from England. The expansion gives everyone more room to move... cozy is not necessarily a good thing. \n\nThe reason I keep coming back: Nothing compares to a Duchess de Bourgogne on tap. Mike N Molly's has 'em bottled ... but Chris serves it up just right."
5,"I wrote this review in Chad. Been going here for over 6 years now. Owners and staff are honest & genuine. Doesn't matter if you are spending $100 or $10K, you will get the same level of service every time. They also pay top dollar for gold."
5,"I wrote this review in Uruguay. One by one the larger chain pet stores have dropped my cats dry food (Avoderm) and it was becoming hard to find locally. \nThen I noticed Pet Club and thought I would ask. Sure enough they stock it and always seem to have it in stock when needed. \nA friendly, helpful store."
5,"I wrote this review in Latvia. Off the beaten path, this is defintely a Vegas must-see. As mentioned, tours must be set up in advance and cost a nominal fee, but well worth it.\n\nA photographer's dream, the retired signs of old Vegas are arranged in two fenced yards. Our tour guide revealed some interesting tidbits in our hour-ish tour - if you are very familiar with Vegas you may glean a few little-known facts.\n\nOtherwise, the Boneyard speaks for itself. Some of the signs are in varying stages of disrepair, which makes for many beautifully sad photo ops. As someone who isn't incredibly interested in picture-taking, even I found myself playing around with the various settings on my camera and different photographic angles.\n\nIn order to truly appreciate Vegas, visit the Boneyard and pay tribute to the past."
5,"I wrote this review in South Africa. Great rotisserie chicken! When you walk in it's the first thing you smell and it's very welcoming. We go there on a regular basis. The prices are good and the service is always very nice, sometime a little slow but I don't mind. Their pork and steak are really good too. Definitely make sure you get the plantains and save room for their churros!"
5,"I wrote this review in Belgium. I saw a review that likened Gadzooks to Chipotle.  As I made it through the line and their staff assembled my lunch, I can see how that comparison can be made - in process alone.  \n\nI love that they have limited items on the menu (basically, enchilada, taco, tortilla soup) but then there's an option explosion for what you put in them.  I had a green chili pork enchilada and a bison enchilada.  Both were terrific. It was the best bison I've ever had, in fact.  The house-smashed guacamole was delicious also.\n\nI thought I was smart by getting there at 11:30 (avoiding the noon rush) but they were already very busy.  I got the last parking space and the next to last interior table.  Thankfully the tables seemed to turn quickly and the line moved in the same way.  There are misters on the patio if that's your only course of action.   \n\nI will certainly come back and I'll bring friends."
5,"I wrote this review in Nicaragua. We definitely picked a good choice when we picked this restaurant! \n\nI just had to see what all the hype was about. To start I ordered the Guido's Freaky Tiki. A delicious cocktail that included everything in it. 2 different types of rum, passion fruit, pineapple juice, orange juice lime juice, grenadine. \n\nFor the entree my friend recommended the bacon mac and cheese burger. Omg, it was amazing and I was definitely in heaven eating this thing. Seriously imagine a huge burger with mac and cheese in it. One of the best parts was the burgers come with fries. No extra charge! & not just fries but a variety. Truffle fries, onion rings, and regular fries, so you get to try a little bit of everything. Genius! What's not to love! Everything was really pricy here but you get what you pay for! & it was definitely well worth it. I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas. =)"
5,"I wrote this review in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Great show, loved it, interactive great cast and more affordable than a lot of the shows on the strip.you will not regret it!"
5,"I wrote this review in Ghana. Dr. Archambault provides very professional, thorough, and personalized patient care. His approach is holistic. He is knowledgeable when to utilize other forms of medicine. I have been a patient for close to two years and I have referred several friends and family members here.  I have also begun to find out that many of my friends already are members of what I like to call the West Valley Naturopathic Family. \n\nIf you are looking for comprehensive,  preventative or care for an auto - immune disease West Valley Naturopathic is the place to be.  I have never had such control over my allergies and homeopathic remedies thay actually work to keep away my re-occurant sinus infections. I have also had the pleasure of seeing Dr. Jennifer Elton who took excellent care of me as well. \n\nIf you seek a family atmosphere with top notch patient care, look no further!"
