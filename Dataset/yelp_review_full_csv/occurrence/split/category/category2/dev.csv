1,"I wrote this review in Buenos Aires. Went to get nails done for the panthers playoff game. Wanted a black base w/ blue stripes. The younger girl did them and did a bad job. The worst part she even told me it was \""not her best\"" and she was disappointed with how she did them. The lines were all different sizes. She made an excuse that the brush was too big. She was about 3/4 of the way done and about 4 woman came in to get their nails done...the girl decided to rush through my nails to quickly get me done, i guess she figured she had already screwed up so no need to keep trying. Then I sat to dry and the owner came and sprayed some kind of quick dry on them and it caused the paint to sort of bubble up......yeah and paid about double since it was a design...even though it was my regular nails.  Only reason I would go back is for a basic manicure or pedicure...hopefully couldn't mess that up."
1,"I wrote this review in Birmingham. If you can ship using another carrier, please do. A shipment was due to be delivered Thursday, it wasn't. It said shipment was due Monday. I called ups and asked to leave it at a location for pick up. The package was not available still until Monday.  The order was wrong so I tried to send it back using senders acct. No ups store would help. Had to come back to this dump. Line was out of the door. Lack of help here. Avoid at all costs."
1,I wrote this review in Chengdu. Very sloppy! No attention the polish is all over my fingers so disappointing and aggravating that now I'm going to have to pay more money else where to get them redone
1,"I wrote this review in Tunis. Let me start off by saying that I haven't ate at Coco's in probably 10 years, used to go with my grandparents when I was young. My girlfriend ate here with a co-worker a couple weeks ago and said she wanted to go back and get some Pie. I figured why not I really couldn't remember the quality of the food so I decided we'd give it a go.\n\nWe decided to go on her lunch hour and it took the hostess/waitress a good 5 minutes to seat us even though they were not busy at all. This wasn't that big a of a deal since I'm always willing to wait for a good meal. Too bad it never came! We decided to split a sandwich but after 35mintues of waiting I paid for the drinks and had to walk out. The waitress gave us the run around and kept making excuses about why the food was so slow. I will never eat at this coco's again in my life, I can't stand poor customer service or just poor service altogether."
1,I wrote this review in Kyoto. Would rate a 0 if can. Had reservations and was seated right away but had to wait 30 mins just for drinks and over hr for food. service was horrible. restaurant wasn't even busy also.
1,I wrote this review in Rome. Just  Quike update....\n\nI have now dropped off over 300 flyers letting people know to never use Quike and sleazy car wash.\n\nI have spoken with over 50 people letting them know about this car wash
1,"I wrote this review in San Francisco. I own a property managed by the Osselaer for a little over a year now. I have had problems with my landscaping and have addressed my property manager for the sweetwater vista's as well as a letter to their president. The result? Nothing. It is like I am a joke to them. Their policy? As long as you send in your quarterly check they can go on ignoring you and downsize your simple requests. I am really..how hard is it to trim some bush's and turn on water trips. Sure I do not mind doing those things, I enjoy them actually..but thats what I pay over a $1000 a year for. I dont pay that much money for someone NOT to do their job. When considering a home managed by these people, do yourself a favor. DONT CONSIDER IT. You will be very dissapointed and your needs will not be met."
1,"I wrote this review in Chicago. What kind of place is this?\nOrder chili on a burger and when you get it, the chili looks like it was SLAPPED!! on the burger like someone back there didn't like you, a sight that makes you lose your appetite.\nPaper thin hamburger patties and in my case the tomato was the highlight of the burger. Tomato slice about 1/2 inch thick, the burger pattie? about 1/16th of a inch thin.\nSaving grace, the fries are good if you eat it there. Take it to go and they wilt and get soggy. There is a better Tommys about 250 miles away in California. This place is a disgrace."
1,"I wrote this review in Beirut. the worst of the worst. just read the reviews here, and google them to find out more. they are consistently ripping people off either with webhosting, or their domain service.\n\ni'm writing this reveiw because i found out they were charging me for 'privacy' on my domain which i never ordered for over a year now. the cost of that is more than the domain registration cost.\n\nfurther, you get low prices on registering a domain, often $4.99 with them, but then it goes up over 100% in the second year to $10.99 a year, and, as stated, they started charging me for things i never ordered.\n\nBEWARE of them. much better to tryout netfirms. in my experience they don't commit outright fraud by charging for things you never ordered. \n\nif you do go with this company, remember you were warned and it's your nightmare. much better to listen to the warnings."
1,"I wrote this review in Dubai. Don't frequent this business unless you want to be treated very badly. I was subjected to the rudest, most passive aggresive behavior I have ever experienced. Alison made it clear that my job was too small for them to be bothered with, and I understood, but she was disrespectful about it. Fine. I left. Then an installer called to tell me she was sending him to my house. So I went in to choose tile, and Alison was impatient and angry. The installer came. Then I went back  to the store for a third time to buy the tile , only to be told \""I should shop at Lowes\"". Why would a business drive customers away and then pull them back and then insult them and refuse to do business?  I told Alison she had a terrible attitude, and she said \""I know\"".  Something is very wrong with this place!  The employees here should stand on their feet at Lowes for a day and learn to be polite to customers....shame on them!"
1,I wrote this review in Jakarta. Watch out for this place. My wife was there last week and was accosted by glass people pulling a classic insurance fraud scam called windshield replacement fraud. (google it or look on the website of the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud)  They hustle waiting car wash customers into getting new windshields they don't need and try to charge it to their insurance company. Obviously this car wash is letting them do this to their customers. Pretty scary . She will NEVER go back there.
1,"I wrote this review in Jakarta. CAUTION!!! I HAD TO HAVE SURGERY TO REMOVE PART OF MY TOENAIL!!! I had a pedicure there a few weeks ago and the lady cut my nails way to short, once they stated growing back 5 of them became ingrown... My big toe got infected and I went to the doctor. She said \""wow they butchered you, really cut the shit out of your toenails\"" She then proceeded to numb my toe and remove about half the nail, it was disgusting. I now have 8-10 months of deformity to look forward to. Thanks for the worst pedicure of my life."
1,"I wrote this review in Nairobi. Really wanted to give this place a try because my husband wanted to go for weeks now. The food looked good, smelled good but the service was too damn slow. \n\nThe idea of mixing and matching is really the only excuse to give this place one star(besides the fact 0 isn't an option lol)\n\nFrom the time it took me to place my order and then to check on it, my lunch break was already over. And the food wasn't even ready for take out. \n\nThankfully they gave me a full refund, but there's no need to take 25 minutes for one order. \n\nIt must be good if the girl at el pollo loco told me to try it. She told me to call ahead to save myself the wait. Hopefully we can try this out again in a few months!"
1,"I wrote this review in Mumbai. Celebrating Birthday with Spouse on Friday night. No parking available at entrance to check in. Check in staff was So-So. Received room info, walked back to car, drove over to room, got bags out, walked up to room, opened door and Uh-Oh, this room has double beds, not the King we made reservation for. Call front desk, got the \""fully booked\"" comment then put on hold. Told to come back to front. Get bags, Load up car, drive back to front where there's no parking. Stand in line, go through whole process again, get new room assigned. Walk back to car. Drive over to other side of property. Unload bags. Walk to new room and open doors to interior design circa 1981. Give up. Drop off bags. Walk over to restraurant and literally cannot figure out where the door is to go in. Walk back to car. Drive over to Elephant bar. Have some good food and a some drinks. Go back to room. Sleep for night. Check out and go home to review my $175 hotel bill and wonder what I paid for."
1,I wrote this review in Buenos Aires. Horrible customer service.  The manager was very rude and seam  to not care much  about his establishment or his customers
1,"I wrote this review in Mexico City. So I came across this place via Groupon.  I check reviews before I purchase on groupon and it had a decent rating and some great suggestions.  Upon arrival, I noticed a sign in the front that said Attn: Groupon users, Groupon not eligible on Happy Hour Rolls/Specialty Rolls.  I ordered a 3 rolls which I only received 1 roll, hamachi Kama, and the udon tempura. The female manager came up and apologized for the wait in the rolls and than apologized that I never received the 2 other rolls.  The sushi chefs seemed to be drinking sake bomb after sake bomb and slacking on the rolling!  \n\nAlso, their marketing gimmick is 50% rolls (Normal avg. price $15) then they give rolls for $7.50 but do give small portions.  \n\nThe food that did come was ok at best.  Staff definitely needs to improve on their customer service and get those rolls on the table.  \n \nBTW, this is a Korean owned Japanese restaurant."
1,"I wrote this review in Kuala Lumpur. Worst service ever. Looked up menu online to order take out. Had not updated their menu and many rolls were no longer available. I told the guy on the phone I'd call back with a new order. When I called back they didn't pick up the phone. WTF! Don't offer \""to go\"" when your online menu is outdated and you are too lazy to answer phone"
1,"I wrote this review in Hamburg. I have no idea why this place is so famous. I eat sushi almost every week, but this place has the worst quality of sushi. I had to pick off every piece of sushi. Also, crispy sushi was too greasy. Please eat good quality of sushi for your health."
1,"I wrote this review in Moscow. HORRIBLE. Made a reservation but still had to wait close to 45 min. The place smelled TERRIBLE, like a rotten incense, it was over whelming. It so was bad that the staff apologized, comped our meal, and gave us cab fair back!!! Food was ok. \n\nIt might have been an off day for Musashi, but I just can't recomend them to anyone. \n\nYolies & Firefly are in the same parking lot and they are both excellent!! Go there instead."
1,"I wrote this review in Boston. Stopped here recently because I wanted to support Willy Street amid all the construction. The girl behind the counter treated us like we weren't cool enough to be there. I felt like an outsider instead of welcomed, very discouraging when I was trying to patronize a local business in the middle of a tough time for the street as a whole. I definitely will not be going back."
1,"I wrote this review in St. Petersburg. Not impressed - there were 2 people there who didn't have southwest stuff or run of the mill garage sale/craft show stuff.   We walk slow and were back to our car in less than 10 minutes.   I wasn't much impressed with the rest of Cave Creek AZ either - so if that's your thing, this might work out better for you."
1,I wrote this review in New York City. Found this review in my drafts... It's been about 3 years since I went there.. Who knows if it's eve still open...was gonna delete but after reading it I remembered how mad I was and decided to post!\n\nWorst customer service ever!  Called in to go order 30 minutes before got here to pick up and waited for 45 minutes for my order... Guy at counter either hates his job or just doesnt care about anything... People in and out never once did any staff  say hi or how can I help you and everyone had to wait at the counter for him to return because he was never standing there... Never to return...
1,"I wrote this review in San Jose. We're buying a new car as a graduation present for our daughter, and are considering several small suvs.  We stopped by to look at the CX-5 and Outback.  The salesman seemed bored and disinterested in us.  Did you not want to deal with women?  Did you think we couldn't afford a new car?  This was a month ago.  Nissan and Toyota have been bombarding us with phone calls and emails. We've been trying to talk our daughter out of the Nissan Rogue.  Honda offered us a CRV at the Edmunds price (we didn't get it, my daughter said the screen was so far up front she couldn't see it).  Consumer reports gave the Mazda a good score.  I've read 2 glowing reviews in the last 2 days about the improvements with the 2014 model:  I'm sold!!  We'll be driving over to Avondale or Tempe to buy."
1,"I wrote this review in Amsterdam. This location needs work. The food line is a cluster, they are all over the place. You need to watch them because they forget things. Soup was cold, tortilla was cold. They have 3 different kinds of tea and they were all empty! Annoying. I keep thinking they will get better but im disappointed every time."
1,"I wrote this review in Kuala Lumpur. I've tried it twice and won't be going back.The first was a romantic meal with the wife; decor is an interesting talking point but creates more of a roadside dinner feel rather than the white table cloth experience. Bread was good and service good, I had fish which was OK and the wife had steak which was good but the a filet had too much grizzle for her. The second visit was a works lunch, I had planned Del Frisco's for an American steak house experience for overseas guests but it was closed so decided to try the Palm. Big mistake, lunch menu was poor and the dinner menu is very over priced, the place was empty (not suprised) and my NY strip and fries was the worst steak I've ever paid for. Overcooked, tough and tasted like it had gone bad. I won't return to places that serve bad food knowingly.\n\nThe works lunch for three with soft drinks came to over $200 with tip, I don't mind paying for good food but thats a rip off for what we were served.\n\nPro's; The place has a traditional steakhouse feel and good waiters, the bread is excellent and location nice, not to busy, easy to park and nice for a stroll after diner.\n\nCon's; The food is so over priced, the quality wasn't good and the whole experience very poor."
1,"I wrote this review in Jakarta. Okay so Ulta Salon is equivalent to a Super Cuts. Their stylist are a hit and miss on level of skills. \nThe Salon is DIRTY and they use dirty tools on you if you do not stay on top of them. Every time I have been to Ulta Salon there is hair everywhere and I have to ask them to clean just so I can sit or put my purse down. \nThey are expensive for a chain salon, ex. haircut by Jr. stylist $50!\nIf you decide to try them ask for a \""Master Stylist\"" then be very specific as to what you want done and good luck."
1,"I wrote this review in Tianjin. Horrible. Some friends of mine and I were here one night before going to Marquee and hit this place up. The sushi place was too busy so this looked like the next best thing. We started with 3 appetizers- the potato wrapped chorizo, white asparagus, patadas bravas. We were so turned off by the quality of the food we never ordered meals and left hungry. \n\nEnough said."
1,"I wrote this review in Chengdu. Okay, I love Papa John's pizzas, but this location can't seem to get it right. I live about 1/2 mile from the business. I've ordered from them, via phone and online, several times over the past 6 years or so, but they always seem to forget something or to be late.  A month or so ago, the order took over an hour for no apparent reason, then showed up with a charge twice what was listed online. Last week, they decided to omit the extra sauces I asked for, but add (and charge for) anchovies, which I really don't care for. A couple of hours ago, I placed an order for three pizzas (two on special and one free!), waited an hour and a half, and, after calling, was told by the manager that the driver had tried calling a number I had had 12 years and dozens of orders ago, got no answer, and had left. He refunded one pizza off - *the free one*. When she showed up again, 45 minutes later and with the same pizzas minus one (apparently refunding a pizza equals deleting it from the order but still deducting the \""Papa Rewards\"" thingy), they were barely warm. So I ended up paying full price for three hot pizzas and getting two lukewarm ones - waaay late . $21.75 apiece. My friends: hungry. Me: upset and probably not going to order from the convenient pizza place again."
1,"I wrote this review in San Francisco. The food at this location is decent, though we experienced terrible service from Ashleu Rutherford.  The dining room was an icebox, and when we complained, Ashley seemed annoyed but claimed she would turn the air down.  She never did and lied to our faces when we questioned her shortly thereafter... Will probably go to other locations in the future, where service is not such an issue."
1,"I wrote this review in Amsterdam. Very disappointed. Yesterday at 8:50am they scheduled my appointment and said they would call 15 minutes before. Didn't happen. I called two times throughout the day, they said I was still on the schedule. I finally called at 5:45, and told they wouldn't make it, but will tomorrow. I said I needed a morning appointment as I already wasted an entire day. So, they did as newly promised, called and came out before 9am.They quoted $139.95 per hour for a service call, in truth there is a service fee that brings it to $146.45. The plumber was an nice guy, but Larkins policy and the equipment they carry is ridiculous!  So when I called and said I had an outdoor gas leak near my pool/bbq equipment, why would your plumber int the big yellow plumbing truck not have PIPE or A THREADER on their truck?  Oh, because they will charge you $139.95 per hour to get in the truck, drive to the office, cut a pipe, thread the pipe, drive back to your home and install the pipe... REALLY??  Who does that? So a 12 in 1/2 inch pipe repair, depending on traffic both ways, which is 1 miles each way, could cost, what, upwards of $500? Use them if you think any of that makes sense!  I certainly won't!"
1,"I wrote this review in Hangzhou. Every time we go we are more disappointed than the time before,  I believe last night was it for us.  They put about a teaspoon of chicken on my sons tacos and although my husband asked for light sour cream the girl behind the counter proceeded to glob on about a cup on his burrito.  When my husband nicely said that he asked for light she looked up and said \""sorry\"" and proceeded to wrap his burrito.  Couldn't even crack a smile the whole time she helped us, and glared at my husband while we were paying.  Every time we go they put less and less meat in what ever we order, for one reason or another we are disappointed and vow to never go again.  Pretty sure last night we meant it."
1,"I wrote this review in Denver. The club is great...IF you get in. The bouncer here is a effing asshole. Unless you're a girl, tall, thin, and look like a slut, you most probably won't get in. It's filled with guido juice heads or underaged kids that look 30. But I guess that's the only thing the guido bouncer can relate to. And he's rude. And has a small dick complex. Maybe he didn't get into Police Tech and is stuck being 40 and a bouncer?"
1,"I wrote this review in Shanghai. Always looking for good breakfast fare so I brought my wife and two young children based on Yelp reviews and what a disappointment. Menu items were expensive for a hole in the wall place with no ambiance and NO air conditioning (outside temp was about 90) so it was uncomfortable inside. My breakfast hash was dry and little more than chopped corned beef, biscuits (homemade and good) and gravy (gluey and I could taste the flour) overall they were mediocre. My son had crepes which were horrible and a juice glass sized chocolate milk ($2.50). My daughter had french toast which could have easily come from a box. The bright spot was my wife's egg white omelet which she liked very much. My wife and I shared her side of flapjacks and we expected more from a place that includes it their name. Another bright spot was our waitress. BTW the oven was broken so the two house pancake specialties were not available. Total bill for breakfast was $48.00 not including tip. Hate to say it but I would have been happier at IHOP and I hate IHOP."
1,I wrote this review in Tianjin. She's gone. Apparently the employees were happy to see her go as well. If I am so hungry and the other 12 places right nearby are closed I might go again to see if they'll scorch my fries.
1,"I wrote this review in Dublin. Roaches, ac/heat did not work, toilet did not work, carpet filthy, Wi-Fi sucks, tv had 5 channels. The maids hung out in front of our room laughing and joking for over an hour at 8am!!! Rude as can be; then they started slamming their carts in front of the door. Don't get a room near the housekeeping office in 5th builidng! Sent security officer to room to try and fix the problems..he laughed.  The motel ended up moving us at 1:30am to another room on the back side of builidng 6, a little better.  OMG! Never again.  I will NEVER stay here again!"
1,"I wrote this review in Guangzhou. Had lunch here today.  Wings were great as always.  Waitress was ok.  Menu was misleading so I spoke with the manager.  He decides to reduce my check by $1,00.  Like I would dispute one dollar!  Check came to $27.  Left $40 for the check with him.  Maybe he notices the $13 tip and join reality.  Cause if he thinks discounting a $1 from my bill is enough, he's more dumb than he looks.  No wonder there was only 4 tables during the lunch rush.  Will be sharing my bad experience on FaceBook and all my friends.  No one should have to deal with this guy!"
1,I wrote this review in Cape Town. No stars if allowed! Worst experience ever...for the past 2.5 yrs. Customer service is awful....wait times are always 30min or more after scheduled appt time. As you sit in the waiting room you hear them calling people to cancel next day appts...'not enough chairs we overbooked'. They can cancel less than 24hrs but patients cannot without being penalized. No consistency. I once received a random bill and when calling to check on it I was told 'in the summer we have orthodontists filling in from other offices. This fill in we had does not take your insurance. We- bright now dental do take it...but he does not'. Appt days/times suck and clearly revolve around the orthos busy personal life. I have given this place so many chances...so many deep breaths before walking in the door and they still fail. Lots of chaos & people arguing with staff. One ortho says ' braces off in 2 weeks make that early morning appt!' You get there and its a different ortho who says ' who told you that? I'm sorry...you have a few months left'. This inconsistency has happened 3 times now. Which resulted in 3 times needing time off work. I'm all about customer service and this place is a 3 ring circus. Biggest scam I ever got contracted into. :(
1,"I wrote this review in Tianjin. I did not feel safe here. When you arrive, there are signs in the parking lot that say \""don't keep valuables in car\"".....or something like that. I ended up checking out early so that none of my things would be stolen by the gangta staff."
1,"I wrote this review in San Francisco. Stopped in here today and figured I would give it a try as I pass it all the time. First thing is the smoking section is right in front of the place so you have to walk through it to get inside. I get splitting migraines from cigarette smoke so I had to hold my breath. once in side there was a sign saying please seat your self.  so we did and figured they did not see us come in because it took for ever to get service. the booth was dirty, and the window sill had a inch layer of dust, with some old fries and about five dead flies on it. it took forever for the food to come, which is odd because there was only five people in the place and three outside smoking. the food was nothing to brag about just plain bleh. Not sure how they stay in business must have cheap drink on the lounge side and if you are wasted you don't care about the rest. place should shut down."
1,"I wrote this review in Mumbai. This is the worst buffet I have been to in Las Vegas.\n\n It reminds mind of a comic strip that I saw in the Chicago Tribune Sports section many years ago where the whole Russian baseball team had to take the walk of shame out of the dugout into the clubhouse and be replaced by a whole new team walking from the clubhouse to the dugout because the first team sucked. This is what Ceasar's Palace should do to the chefs that work on this buffet.\n\nThe pork chops and prime rib were dried out and inedible. The apple that I tried was old with that brown stuff inside. The three bean salad had cilantro sprinkled all over, who does that? I could go on and on, I will post pictures at a later time."
1,"I wrote this review in Montreal. Ordered the new Double Layered Premium Pepperoni Pizza.  Picked it up and they were out of the premium pepperoni.  The manager didnt even tell me. They didnt say a word till I went back in, because all I had was a pepperoni pizza.  No sorry or warning or anything.  Pizza was really bad as well.  This place has been going down hill for at least a year.  I finally learned my lesson."
1,I wrote this review in Bangkok. Have had pedicures here before but they keep getting progressively worse. This time water was so hot ended up with first - degree burns. Woman was also very rough in handling feet.
1,I wrote this review in Denmark. I was looking for a cheap place to stay after driving to Phoenix from San Diego and I figured that Red Roof Inn seemed pretty decent for $70 for a night so I decided to book on Trip Advisor.\n\nWhile I was checking in I decided to use the women's restroom downstairs in the lobby and I couldn't believe that the mirror was taped on to the wall.  I mean literally probably 5 dozen pieces of packing tape holding it in place.  I figured no big deal will check in anyway.\n\nThe check-in was a breeze.  Went to our room and at first glance it seemed ok pretty dated but ok.  The fianc\u00e9 and I were so tired from driving we just decided to lay on the bed.  We looked on the bedside table and saw several bed bugs? Or ants?! Just crawling everywhere.  Disgusting!  I had to check to make sure there was nothing in our sheets.  I should have complained to the front desk but I just figured we'd be in and out in a few hours.\n\nI definitely wasn't expecting a 5 star hotel or anything but I at least was hoping for something clean!  Yikes.  The only positive experience from Red Roof Inn was that the employees were friendly and there was a Waffle House close by!  Apparently because they do not serve a continental breakfast but have free coffee downstairs!  I'm sorry but will definitely look elsewhere the next time I am in town.
1,"I wrote this review in Zurich. Maybe I just had a one-off bad experience, but I had the most disappointing meal in quite some time.\n\n My pork was lukewarm and flavorless -almost tasted a bit soupy. The rest of my food was pretty cold.\n\nOverall, it reminded me of dorm food.\n\nI'd be willing to give them a second chance, but I'll need some convincing."
1,"I wrote this review in Rio de Janeiro. Went with a group of friends for a birthday party. Sat at the open couches, played some games, had some beers. About 30 minutes later we got kicked out of our spots because a group of people that were \""spending more $ than us\"" wanted those couches. Seriously. Will not go back."
1,"I wrote this review in Phoenix. We went twice, first time, service was good. Second and last time, we arrived 30 minutes before closing. She emphasized they closed exactly the posted time.

1,"I wrote this review in St. Petersburg. Avoid this Olive Garden at all costs.  The host discriminates against minorities.  This is the second time this man insisted on showing us to the worst table in the house and when we asked for a different table continued to stear us where we would not \""offend\"" the other patrons, dressed in shorts, flipflops and t-shirts.  Tables he selected for us included, a very large table for 8 for our party of 3  way in the back of the restaurant, next to the kitchen; a table right next to a dirty serving station, and a table in an alcove where our party was not visible to others.  \n\nAlthough we asked for a more desirable table, it was refused.  Favored guests had one thing in common--they were all white, while all minority patrons were seated in undesirable spots."
1,"I wrote this review in Kosovo. In April, I ordered, and completely paid for two chairs. I was told it would be six weeks. As that time neared, I called and left a message for my saleswoman who never bothered to return my phone call. Another saleswoman said she would help. Another week passed with no information. I again called and was told that my chairs were due to be completed by July 4th. Again, as that time passed I called and was informed it would be the end of a July. Another two weeks without a call. I called again and was told it would one be the first week of August. Ok, so now it's August 5th, and I (the customer) call for a follow-up. A gentleman answers the phone and said it's now going to be Mid -August. He said he will call me this Friday. - we will see.  I have a few thoughts - shouldn't my saleswoman be following up with me?  Isn't it common courtesy to notify customers of delays??\n\nI'm pretty sure that if I hadn't called and asked, Thingz would be complacently happy to keep my money and never deliver!  \n\nI just got a note from my interior design professionals suggesting we go look at Thingz for a table. No thank you!!!"
1,I wrote this review in Mali. My nails chipped the next day. Gel was cracking. In after she did my nails they were very score but I think it's because she didn't clear the critic from under the nail. It was not busy so I don't know why she did a half job on me. Will never go back... Wait the pedicure was good but who wants to go to two different places to get their feet and nails done

1,"I wrote this review in Haiti. Loved the movie... Was expecting something similar, great music, great story of love prevailing through tragedy, exploitation & disappointment, and where fame gave way to a life of meaning & purpose. Instead somebody decided \""hey lets just ruin a great story line with crass and cheap sexual innuendo from beginning to end!\"" \nIt was seriously CRAP! I felt sorry for the actors and singers who were outstandingly talented. The singing and dancing was exceptional and with better directing could actually make it a hit show. But all the 'high school teenage boy' penis & sex jokes? Puh-lease!!!'\nSo disappointed. I can't believe that you can take some of the best Rock songs of all time and completely ruin them with a crap story line! But Rock of Ages at the Venetian managed to do it with panache!"

You'd think if burgers was the ONLY thing on your menu you'd do it right. and I was not a fan of wearing a hospital gown to lunch it was neither fun nor funny. but I suppose if you're really in the mood to eat and watch someone get spanked then this is a good place?"
1,"I wrote this review in Birmingham. Employees are rude, slow and indifferent.  Good and drinks are expensive and poorly made. There are so many better choices on Mill, avoid this one."
1,"I wrote this review in Colombia. Ok so my friends talked me into going back and giving it another shot.  Mistake.  If possible, service was even worse.  I was there on Thursday evening and when we arrived it was virtually empty.  The servers would literally walk by our table and look at us but not come over.  We finally talked to the manager, Mike, and that helped.  The food was very good this time.  Still not a place I would choose to go."
1,"I wrote this review in Accra. Service was terrible, waitress looked mad that she had to serve our large group. They apparently have a stone age POS system because they couldn't split up our check, we had to write out the check split for her with names and amount due. It's remedial server knowledge to use position numbers and keep track of bills. Lazy and no excuse!"
1,"I wrote this review in Jakarta. At 8.95 for brunch , we thought it couldn't be bad , BUT WE WERE WRONG.  Expired cereal boxes on buffet, only regular milk, no sugar free syrup.  Few breakfast choices, lunch items begin at 10:00,we left at 10:30 and they still were not ready."
1,"I wrote this review in Moscow. This place was awful!\n\n The service was good but the manager seemed like he was constipated or appeared to have a stick up his ass. The taste of the steak wasn't the best... And on top of it, my poor mom got food poisoning. \nServer was a total doll though. \n\nDO NOT GO HERE! Go to Texas Roadhouse, cheaper and service and food is much better."
1,"I wrote this review in Tunis. Took my boyfriend here for an appointment during our lunch hour. On the phone we told them we had limited time because it would be during lunch, and we were assured the appointment would take no more than 20 minutes. They double-booked and his appointment took more than an hour, with the optometrist running back and forth between exam rooms.  Most of our time was spent sitting and waiting, and consequently we had no time to even eat lunch.  \n\nTheir selection of frames is very limited, with no name brands except a few Gucci hidden in a corner. And they have no contact lenses in stock, so you have to wait for them to be ordered.\n\nWe will be taking our generous eye care plans to another provider in the future."

1,"I wrote this review in San Jose. I've only eaten there twice and both times the serve was horrible. There are only three people. One waitress, one bartender and I think one is the cook which no matter what you can't understand him. When we sat down at 6pm, it took 10 mins for them to get our drink order. Our appetizer came out pretty fast but it took another 1/2 for our food to come out. There was three people in the whole place. Now the tea I got was excellent, my food was ok tasting until I bit into spoiled chicken.  I spit it out and it smelt rancid. They wanted to make me a new dish but I refused. I about had it with this place. We waited another 1/2 an hour for our bill but never got it so we went to front to pay. All and all it took us 1-1/2 hour to finish and get out. Will not ever go back."
1,"I wrote this review in Egypt. Bleh. Has a weird  smell in the casino and definitely looks old. The \""plain jane\"" interior doesn't quite go with the unique exterior theme of pirates and booty. No one was ever in the cafe-restaurant-lounge-bar that they advertised so much (Kahunaville). Location-wise it is okay, but there's no hotel connected to it (like Aria-Cosmo or Bellagio-Caesars)...unless you count the tram to Mirage but meh.\n\nThe hotel rooms were also pretty meh. We had no inner shower curtain liner thing so our bathroom was very wet. Towels are small and rough. Not enough lighting unless you turned on every lamp and switch in the room, and even then, it was awkward. Mirrors/closet doors were also angled badly and very little outlets for charging phones. I really don't like this place, but maybe the suites will be better."
1,"I wrote this review in Athens. Our first experience here was ok, but breakfast this morning warrants the one star review.  We ordered eggs and oatmeal.  We carefully explained that the eggs must be fully cooked through.  After waiting 30 minutes, we received barely warm oatmeal and runny eggs.  \nWe explained again about the eggs and they said that they would make them again.  20 minutes later, another plate of runny eggs!\nAt that point they said that they would take the eggs off the bill.\n\n\nMy oatmeal somehow wound up costing over $20 but we just wanted to get out of there so I did not ask any more questions."
1,I wrote this review in Cape Town. Very disappointed. This restaurant has done a nose dive in the past few years. Tonight I tried to order chicken fingers and they couldn't figure out how to cook them. So I had to order something else. Nachos were a safe bet right?  Wrong the cheese whiz nachos were horrible. I won't be coming back here again.
1,I wrote this review in Maldives. Not good!  We had lunch here this past Saturday afternoon.  One of our servers was painfully rude.  We did AYCE and ordered a spider roll - the crab tasted old and like spoiled oil and we told them.  They didn't care just reminded us of the 'rules' for AYCE.  We did eat it - swallowed it all and left 1/2 a piece on the plate as we just could not stomach it.  We ordered some other items - a few of them did not come and others took forever and did not taste good.  The server was soooo rude and when we asked to pay - she held our credit card hostage until we ate every last piece of food .... which was 2 pieces of one roll left on the table. There are other places in the area that deserve your business - this is not one of them.  Shame on you Krazy Sushi - at least you live up to your name!

1,"I wrote this review in Equatorial Guinea. Absolutely the most poorly organized store I have ever been to. Nothing is in any sort of order, no clothing sizes, even the books are arranged by cover type rather than even the basics such as fiction/nonfiction or anything that makes sense.

1,"I wrote this review in Tunis. The worst place!!!!!\n\nMy family and I were in Vegas in june of 2012 for the weekend, came here after a night out - thought it'd be a nice fix for sushi. Really couldn't have been more wrong...\n\nService was horrible, the guys leading this place pay more attention to their friends than paying customers. Also, horrible at taking orders - missed about 3+ orders out of our group of 10. One of us didn't even get out order at all! And one thing, I myself ordered the Avocado lover roll; it's not even a roll! It's basically a big chunk of avocado! $13 for that was definitely NOT worth it. That order didn't even come until much later, the guy taking the orders said he \""didn't get that one\"" when that was the first freaking thing I wanted in the first place! Shouldn't have even ordered it at all...\n\nThis place is overpriced and so unprofessional. We all hated it."
1,"I wrote this review in Israel. This restaurant has never been great, but if you wanted an Asian restaurant in the Cultural District it was an OK place to go. However, last night's dinner was just plain bad. I had beef salad, and it was some coolish beef on iceberg lettuce with sliced onions and a totally forgetful sauce. Nothing like the mix of sweet, sour, and spice that it should have. I also had tofu panang. It was also virtually tasteless. Some coconut milk flavoring in otherwise nondescript brown sauce with no spiciness."
1,"I wrote this review in Athens. Tried once for dinner and it was just okay. Tried again for breakfast and hated it. Eggs florentine has about a teaspoon of hollandaise, unripened tomatoes and hardly any spinach. Hubby hated the turkey bacon and his toast was hard as a rock. Potatoes weren't cooked through or were overcooked and way toooooo much rosemary. Everything was cold. Fresh seasonal fruit was an apple (in August). Not sure, but coffee tasted like it was instant. And service is nonexistent, both times. Good concept, poor execution."
1,"I wrote this review in Manila. This place sucks.  period.  The food is low-end, soggy, overpriced crap.  The service is a joke - you should not come here if you have plans within even 2 hours of entering this place because you will probably still be waiting for your check.  Oh yeah and the best part?!  They dont \""do\"" change.  SO basically if you dare to pay for your meal with cash - don't expect any of the change they owe you from YOUR money.  Probably to save for their pathetic servers because I doubt they actually get tipped anything.  This is quintessential Charlotte BS built for use by the culture-less yuppie zombies that are slowly taking over this city.....beware."

I stood in line for 15 minutes at the front of the line, while I watched 30 people grease the bouncer and walk right in. Not having any cash in my pocket meant that I was shit out of luck.\n\nSo I walked away. The decor of the place seems awesome, but I'm not going to put up with that pretentious bullshit."

DO NOT EVERRRRR GO TO TRADER VIC'S. \nDON'T WORK THERE EITHER!\nmy experience is not with their food, or their music. it's their owner, and their inability TO PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES .

1,"I wrote this review in Nairobi. Came here for dinner last night with my family for my husbands birthday . Usually service is great and I leave impressed . Unfortunately a football game was on while we were dining. So we didn't get the usual attention . Our order was wrong and while we asked for food to be packed our servers response was \"" that doesn't travel well\"" well we are actually local so we have a fridge at home . The icing on the cake was when the server asked if we wanted dessert . We said no thank you to which he responded with \"" we have a birthday dessert for you \"" with that being said who turns down free dessert . $329 later that dessert was $30 . Which I probably would have not gotten being my husband prefers the strawberry shortcake . Lesson learned Carmine's , to not come in with football is playing because then your employees would have to work . Thanks to our server for making sure we would probably go to Rao's spend the extra money but it would be worth it ."
1,"I wrote this review in Las Vegas. I don't think I would return here. I booked through a travel site and thought it was a great deal until I got there and they told me I could only have an old, non-updated smoking room. Just so you know, non-smoking is an upgrade you will pay for. By the end of, I spent more here than I would have at a nicer hotel. The rooms were decent in the tower I upgraded to but it didn't feel like an upgrade so I'm terrified to think what the other rooms are like. \n\nDo yourself a favor and book elsewhere."
1,"I wrote this review in Paris. After enjoying Darren's review of Betsy's Ice Cream I ended up their with my friend Joy who totally loves a good bowl of milk, cream, sugar, and flavorings. She wasn't impressed, and she didn't get much. They are pretty small servings for the premium amount they charge. I tried some sorbet, not bad, a little on the overly sweet side. I'll stick to Scoops on Beverly and Carini's Home Made Ice Cream down on Dormont Ave before I hit this place up again.\n\nJust a note: After posting my review I received an email through YELP from the owner(?) Manager(?) of Betsy's Ice Cream asking what I could do to get a better score from my review. He mentioned that he was training his staff to serve bigger portions but some staff just weren't getting it done on the front line. He also said would look into changing his recipe. My response to him would be to make sure the staff is trained BEFORE putting them on the lines to HIS satisfactory. You can buy an entire half gallon of premium Ice Cream for the four bucks Betsy charges for two tiny miniscule scoops. As for the sorbet, I'm not a fan and normally I would choose frozen fat free yogurt but I didn't see any. To me any sherbet is overly sweet."
1,"I wrote this review in Oslo. It's been a while since I've been to Rock Springs Caf\u00e9 and man, has it changed! And unfortunately, not for the better. The boyfriend and I used to love stopping by Rock Springs on our way to/from a weekend up north for breakfast or just a slice of pie. It was kinda dirty and the service wasn't always great but it was what you wanted from a \""cowboy\"" kinda place. The food was solid and the atmosphere was old-school old west. \n\nThey've cleaned it up, added way too many tourist knick-nacks for sale and changed their pie recipes. Boo. \n\nOnce upon a time there was a woman named Penny who would make all the pies (or at least she shared her recipes).  These pies were incredible. They tasted homemade, her meringue was mile high and they were full of flavor. Now, it's obvious they changed recipes and cheapened the ingredients. The pie just had a \""store-bought\"" quality to it. I ordered peach pie and it was obvious the peaches were canned and the flavor was \""meh.\""  It was very disappointing.\n\nIt's become just another tourist trap with mediocre pie. Don't bother stopping. That was the last time we will."
1,"I wrote this review in Kyoto. Imagine the worst smell possible.  Now imagine that ten times worst surrounding the very air you breathe, burning your nostrils as it enters your body.  The staircase outside our room had the worst smell known to mankind.  And everyday, it seemed liked the smell would grow stronger, and stronger.  Smelled like some drunk crazy person urinated all over the staircase.  And then some animal died there, and that same crazy person urinated all over that too.  Everytime we used those stairs, we would hold our breath praying that we would make it out alive.\n\nAnyways, the hotel is.. eh.  Parking sucks.  The rooms are old.  The elevators will scare the crap out of anyone who's claustrophobic.  Thing is tiny and moves slower than a turtle climbing up stairs.  \n\nThe casino... the air is filled with nothing but smoke.  I felt sick everytime I had to walk through it.  \n\nPlus side... they're going to destroy the hotel and build a brand new one."
1,"I wrote this review in Melbourne. This place is nothing special. We ordered margaritas and nachos (because they wouldnt serve a basket of chips and salsa for 3 people). \nI think we may have been the first people to ever order a margarita there. It was as if they had to get the blender out of storage. They took forever! We were done with our nachos by the time the drinks even came out. We questioned multiple times to one another of there was even any tequila in them, they were so weak. There were giant chunks of ice that made it impossible to drink out of a straw and generally they were a real let down. I guess that is what I get for expecting a good margarita in Scotland."

When at the store, she was told that they didn't have her food order and after waitng 30 minutes, they wouldn't be able to get her any food for another 45 minutes to an hour. We already had guests at home waiting for food so we did not choose to wait. I understand this is a holiday and a busy time for restaurants, but this was simply unprofessional especially to someone in the restaurant industry.

After speaking to the manager he did offer us some cookies for our trouble. Gee..thanks but no thanks. Oh and they did offer to put us  on some high top tables..too bad two people in our party are in wheelchairs...that is why we requested the booths.

1,"I wrote this review in Oslo. I am extremely disappointed.  HHAGG use to be my favorite restaurant.  After last night I will never go back!  Not only was the service terrible, but the food was not up to par either.  \n\nThe waitress messed up our order by putting in the wrong plate, this after she told my daughter what she ordered was one of her favorites!  Took us about 30 minutes to get the appetizer.  When I saw food going to another party that came in after us(about 15 minutes later), with more people, I asked our waitress why they were getting food before us.  She argued with me that there was no food on or going to that table.  Three times I told her I saw it with my own eyes.  Finally she came back and said it was because we ordered an appetizer.  It was another 10 minutes before our food started coming out.  Once the error was recognized on my daughters plate, it was another 8 or so minutes before hers came out.  \n\nWe got there at 7:30 but did not walk out the door until 8:50 pm.  We have had problems in the past with the service and still we returned, but this one takes the cake.  Worst part is that they weren't very busy so you can not use that as an excuse. \n\nAfter 7 years of loyalty I will take my business else where!"
1,"I wrote this review in Birmingham. Okay, I'm absolutely, positively, well and truly DONE with this place. Last night (Wednesday) we had arranged with friends to meet there for dinner at 6:45pm. When we got there (6:45pm) there was a CLOSED sign in the window -- AGAIN! I've mentioned the ridiculous business hours before - such as taking Sunday off to celebrate the fact that it comes after Saturday etc. It seems that they have all new business hours, and what I read has permanently lost them four customers.\n\nClosed Monday and Tuesday (?!) Wednesday open 11am-3pm (!?) Thursday open 11am-8pm. That's basically as far as I bothered to read.\n\nThis restaurant can go to hell - that's the third time I've arrived at a completely appropriate time of the evening only to have the place inexplicably closed.  I don't care about the recent renovations and frankly there are way too many other delicious places around to be bothered severely adjusting schedules and timing to get into this place during the three or four hours a week that they could be BOTHERED to open. Screw them.\n\nEDIT 20120925: Apparently they've changed the name of this place to \""Eddie's European Bistro\"". A lot of time has passed since I got the sh1ts with them; I MAY decide to return and see if anything's improved. If they're closed once more that'll be IT though."
1,"I wrote this review in Copenhagen. I've tried so hard after countless opportunities that you guys had just to be an acceptable go to bike shop...you've failed just about every time.  Horrible customer service countless times, jobs not performed during the time frame they had presented, which was not much of a big issue, but the fact that they never informed me that they never started the work after leaving a bike there for over three days.  I get it, you're busy.  But if you keep telling me it will be done today, I'll assume it'll be done.  If you tell me you can work on it, I'll assume you'll work on it.  And when I call to figure out what's going on, don't cut me off and expect me not to be an angry customer.  But I'm sure I get it, you're happy with your repeat customers and don't plan on getting/keeping new ones.  Thanks anyway."

Szechuan has a scopious menu and I've ordered quite a mix. The portions are massive (with more rice than entree so I always order without it), the tofu is always overfried, sauce is greasy and too salty (even for me & that's saying alot), and the food always tastes fishy. \n\nAfter rereading this I have come to the final decision to never step foot in this dingy establishment ever again. I don't care how quick & cheap it is."

1,"I wrote this review in Israel. First impression: This place smells like a locker room. YUCK!  After visiting other gyms to price shop, I immediately noticed the odor here compared to the other gyms I visited.

I won't be frequenting this establishment any time soon."
2,"I wrote this review in Guangzhou. On Monday nights at 10:30 they have live music here.  Lots of horns and a cool electric guitar player.  But there's too many musicians on stage - twelve?  One of these guys could entertain a crowd for an hour.  12 is acoustic overload.  \n\nAlso the place is always balls to the wall crowded.  Tough to find a seat.  The Palms should find another venue in their large casino for the Howard Stern show comedian (Howard Stern?? that's so 1998?) who performs here on weekends and let a couple of these guys play.  They rock.  Let them rock more, Mr Maloof.  And let the 90s go sir.  They no longer belong in your casino in this day and age."

So we get them now and then, but I must agree , these are dry and not so tasty wings, it is best to put sauce on the side and they do take at least 10-15 mins to take your order and then another 20-30 mins to get them to go... I think they just want you to spend $$ on the their tight slot machines, while you wait for your order???"

Unfortunately our dinner was mediocre and service as well.  Our server did not seem to know the menu very well and the calamari was horrible.

Nice ambience and so do have to say the general manager was very nice as well... just not good enough food to go back. :-("

2,"I wrote this review in Kosovo. I think that BJ's is a hit-and-miss kind of place. Today was just meh. We three gals were out to lunch before a movie at the Chandler Mall location. The menu is huge, the TV's are on with sports action, the drinks were cold, service is adequate, and the food is too. We all had salads - three different salads actually. I had the ahi tuna and though the tuna was plentiful throughout, the tuna was way too peppery and the salad was soggy. One of my friends had the Thai chicken mango salad with the dressing on the side, which made it a lot less goopy. My other friend had the honey crisp chicken salad but the chicken was missing-in-action. It sure didn't look like the picture. Our server was unfamiliar with the menu and couldn't answer our questions. Maybe she was new? I know that it's tough to be a waiter/waitress and they sure do work hard. But hey, a smile and some friendly service goes a long way with me."
2,"I wrote this review in Chengdu. Clean and focused; that's what I love about this place. Especially at lunch, you want a good burger and just enough fries to reach the cusp of a carb coma. Additional bonus points for those quad-size ketchup packets!\n\nWhat has taken down my rating - and prompted this update - is that the quality has stepped down a bit over time. The wait is getting longer. Group orders virtually close down the restaurant. They don't take debit. Half the time, the bun is overbaked, resembling a softened stone.  The veggies are becoming inconsistent. You have to ask for their specialty sauces. \n\nSimply put, this is a 3-star burger with 2-star order requirements, and I can only give one rating. So I'm going with this one, but if you think more highly, I won't blame you. At times, it's one of the best burgers in Montreal. But for my $10+ lately I think I'd rather take a shot with Cheeburger."
2,"I wrote this review in Bangkok. Went back to Vics Aug 2 and for some reason, their food was greasy and thickly battered. My friend tried their lobster dish. Fried and mediocre tasting.\nThen she had their nutterbutter dessert - wow!! It was like biting into an object that served as a receptacle for oil. Dipped into some sweet sauce that made me want to hit somebody! It was soooo sweet....\nWe also ordered from the appetizer some kind of rolls. I think it was meat loaf batter they wrapped in rice paper (or something similar) and served with 2 dipping sauces. One was tasteless and the other was good.\nI had the spaghetti with meatballs. The order was huge and the meatballs are made from the same batter for their meat loaf dish."

I've been here probably 5 times, each time the appetizers and the entrees are just so-so.  \nThere is one fantastic dish there, the goat cheese salad.  But again, it's goat cheese salad and I'm sure most people want something a bit more hearty when looking for an Irish pub.  \nThat is quite honestly the only good dish I have have had there, or people I know have had there.  The menu is tradtional Irish fare, but it's just not that good, plain and simple.  Happy hour is pretty decent."

Check out the website &amp; start emailing. Please let your voice be heard, this school sucks. There are good teachers!"
2,"I wrote this review in Turkey. Lots of TVs, and good food. They have an expansive beer selection, and I was smart enough to do a beer flight. OOOOhhhh yeahhhh. It was great. The oysters here tasted fresh too. \n\nThe place was crowded but my friend and I were able to be seated rather quickly. I had the New Amsterdam Burger. It was okay, but not memorable. it was practically a Reuben burger, which i've had before at another restaurant. The place can be a bit loud.\n\nOverall its a nice place next to the Aria. But I think for the price i've had better joints."
2,"I wrote this review in Beirut. Horrible horrible service.\n\nCame around noon on a thursday and there were 2 tables seated besides my table. The busser brought our waters and iced tea fairly quickly and then ten minutes later our server finally came to take our order.\n\nSo, we ordered a greek salad which came out pretty quickly and then we noticed that the two other tables got their pizzas right after we finished our salad. So another twenty minutes goes by and still no pizzas, finally after a half an hour our server came over and said there was a computer malfunction and that our pizzas would be there in the next ten minutes. Needless to say, the pizza was good which is why I gave it two stars. Other than that, I will probably never come back."
2,"I wrote this review in Los Angeles. Tried this place for the first time.  The prices are reasonable however the food is sub par!  I ordered over easy eggs and got over medium to over hard eggs.  Not happy!!!  Pancakes take like dirty dish cloth!!  Yuck!!!  The bacon and hashbrowns were actually very good.  Customer service was average, nothing memorable.\n\nWon't be back!!!  Sorry, there are way too many breakfast places in the valley to choose from.  If you want to stand out, you have to do better than this.\n\nRecommend Peoria Cafe or Brothers instead!!!"
2,"I wrote this review in Tunis. The Emperor's New Clothes!  So well reviewed, hard to get in, etc.  Let me tell you our experience:  It's in an old, ugly, depressing, small home across from the downtown Bianco's in Heritage Square.  Dreary with a capital \""D\"".  The server, who was pleasant, began by saying, \""Hi, what can I grab you?\""  Yep.   She was clueless about any of the wine selections. The restaurant week menu looked good, but oh, my.  Pitiful lobster roll on a white store bought tasting roll. Could have had better at Bluewater Grill. Entree was O.K., but sparse-really sparse. Dessert was fine, but 1 of 3 choices was deep fried as was one of the choices in the Bento Boxes. Chicken nuggets at best.  We left hungry and disappointed.  We had such fond memories when Nobou's was next to Cowboy Ciao's at SeaSaw...\nDuring the regular times they have a larger menu that very well may be a huge improvement, but you can't change the environment.  A big waste of money for the mediocre fare."
2,I wrote this review in Marshall Islands. Not terrible but not good. We went here the other night and I got fresco tacos and there was hardly anything but lettuce on it! Better luck next time I guess.
2,"I wrote this review in Kyoto. My husband and I just moved to Charlotte and had lunch at Bahn Thai last week. The food was good, but nothing spectacular. Just OK. It was also way overpriced. It's possible that we just need to get used to the cost of food out here (as opposed to Southern California); but we ordered Pad Thai, Red Curry, Papaya Salad and chicken soup. My husband had iced tea and I had Thai tea. Our bill came out to $66. We'd have Thai food regularly in CA and we'd try different Thai restaurants to change things up, but I don't think we've ever paid that much for Thai food. One thing I thought was interesting was that they also have a sushi bar. I didn't see an itamae there so I don't think we'll be trying their sushi."
2,"I wrote this review in Lima. Ordered take out today and they messed everything up and didn't even offer to rectify it. This place used to be good, don't know what happened. Their foods good, but their service sucks."
2,I wrote this review in Rome. Thai house was good but not the best thai place I have had. I had the red curry chicken medium and it didn't seem to be spicy enough for being medium. Also it was pretty expensive.
2,"I wrote this review in Fairfax. Joined Lifetime Fitness N. Scottsdale pre-opening, December 2006. I terminated my membership August of 2010.\n\nI am taking the time to write this review today because LTF continues to market to me as a former LTF member. \n\nBetween December 2006 & August 2010, (44 months) my average monthly spend for membership and PT was $425.29. When I attempted to resolve a minor service issue with the club's general manager Ray Haizlip my concern was marginalized, Ray did nothing to retain my business. \n\nIn the end I was seriously under whelmed with Ray's one size fits all, transactional approach to my business and loyalty.\n\nNice facility, impersonal, inflexible, poor value..."
2,I wrote this review in Marshall Islands. I visited Wing Stop again after 9 months or so. It was as good as I remembered only less so as in it wasn't that good last time and was less good this time I tried the Cajun sauce and I don't really know what it is supposed to be but it was kind of hot and kind of buffalo sauce and kind of jerk-herby and hard to pin down like this sentence it was a little aimless in it's flavor and just didn't do much for me so this was probably my last visit to Wing Stop.  Yup.
2,"I wrote this review in Warsaw. First time I went (opening night) there was no Guiness on tap.OK, no biggy. Second time I went the fish and chips was really salty.  It happens, I'll live. Third time I went it took a loooong time for service and they were not busy. I guess somebody didn't show up for work.\n\n Fourth and last time I went I walked in and they were playing really loud head banger music.  Like when you walk into a place before they open and the cleaning guy is cranking AC/DC   I turned around and walk out.   I think I will give this place a year or two to get it together before going back. Too bad because its on my way home."
2,"I wrote this review in Chengdu. Oh Mr. Frog,\n\nI wanted to love you. I really did. \n\nI ate here for dinner with my parents today. The atmosphere was fun, the view  outside is great! We enjoyed the live band, and the friendly staff. Sadly, its the food that just wont afford me that third star. The venue and the atmosphere itself could've received three stars. But, sadly, here I am in my hotel room in Vegas, damn near curled up in a ball because I am retaining SO MUCH WATER from all the sodium in your food. My mom and I each ordered a chicken fajita plate, my sister a fettuccini alfredo plate, and my step dad a fish taco plate. My poor step dad didnt get to enjoy much of his meal because the rest of us defaulted to his plate because we couldnt stand the saltiness of our meals.\n\nIt didnt seem so much of an over-seasoning of a single plate or a mistake made in the kitchen, but that their food/seasoning is just crazy-salty. \n\nAnd to ice that with a $96.00 bill where none of us even ordered an alcoholic beverage....no thank you. I wont be returning. Sad too because it really does seem like a fun place, but...this is Vegas..."
2,"I wrote this review in Tonga. TAO Beach is nothing special for Vegas. The area is very small and the day beds are crowed but they are not very expensive in the gran scheme of things. Murky water (I get it, but come on). \n\nTAO Beach is not about the experience but about who you are with. Luckily I had a great time with my friends but the atmosphere was lacking, hard. \n\nBeen there, done that, don't need to go back."
2,I wrote this review in Tianjin. Expensive for some lousy NY-style pizza. Cost $35 for 2 larges! The pizza itself was greasy and fairly untasty. Better off with Barro's or hungry howie's.
2,"I wrote this review in Buenos Aires. I feel like there are three things important for a club: music, crowd, and drinks. \n\nWhiskey plays decent music. Some days better than the others depending on the DJ. The crowd is alright too. I feel like if you go with a good group of friends, even the worst club can be super fun. The drinks are not bad, decently priced. \n\nIt's pretty casual and it's a big space right in the middle of the EpiCenter. \n\nMy advice: get a fun group of friends and you are all set!"
2,"I wrote this review in Beirut. The only time I went here, I had a rather...difficult experience. We went in to get an application for my sister and, of course, some coffee. The staff member that served us looked like an Elvis impersonator. He informed us that Coffee Rush wasn't hiring, but that they could keep my sister's application on file. Ok, no problem.\n\nWe informed him that we would like some coffee. Throughout the time it took for him to take our order, make our coffee, and eventually hand over our coffee he kept staring at my chest and hitting on me while making fun of my sister. We left feeling pretty violated, frustrated, and insulted.\n\nHowever, I have been to another Coffee Rush location and have not experienced this. I gave this two stars because I haven't had as horrendous of experiences at the other location and the coffee tasted pretty good (even if it was made by a pervy Elvis-wannabe look-alike)."
2,"I wrote this review in Beijing. So first order with store, delivery was on time. The apps I had where great calamari with sauce and decided on sob pizza cheese is on top of pizza with topping on bottom, not enough sauce (BBQ ) also the edge or crust of the pizza was rock hard and more like a Italian flatbread pizza vs a rolled or developed pizza crust so what happened to the crust it was burnt and hard I could eat only a couple slices also its cut into squares rather then a trad.NY pizza I may re order but  prob will not be the sob pizza"
2,I wrote this review in Boston. Okay I've been here numerous times before always for oysters but we went the past weekend for the pan roast and it was two thumbs down. The broth was sweet for some reason and just not good. Go for the oysters but that's all.
2,"I wrote this review in Warsaw. Got the Shrimp wonton w/ramen noodle. The portion was very good but, the soup has absolutely no flavor.  Disappointed as all the reviews said it was great."
2,"I wrote this review in Oslo. The place was pretty busy when my husband and I visited one night. \nThe decor was ok but very kitschy.\nMy husband and I split the pear salad although the pears were the ones out of a can. \nThe special that night was beef cheeks which if you are familiar and like them, they can be amazing. But I could barely find them on the plate because they were drowned in a heavy overpowering sauce.\nMy husband had the lasagna which was decent and I honestly had more of that then my entree.\nFor what we had, it was totally overpriced. I could imagine Olive Garden would be just as good."
2,"I wrote this review in Marshall Islands. Associate was indifferent to my presence the day I went in.  No greeting, no offer of assistance.  When I asked if I could look at the fan deck, she gave it to me but didn't ask if there was anything I needed help with. I had some questions about paint sheens and products, but getting this young lady to talk was like pulling teeth, and I was the only customer in the place.  \n\nThe store layout was nice, the color samples were arranged in a nice manner, but I might as well have been invisible.  I'm new to town and was quite disappointed, as a design professional I was used to working closely with BM reps in my home state and I like the product.    I went to Sherwin Williams on the way home and got excellent service.  I have switched sides."
2,"I wrote this review in Copenhagen. Food here is ehhh. But the prepackaged food also kinda irked me. I'd rather see the chef prepare it or set my plate after I order it. Out of all the things I tried (sampled: kale salad, chipotle taco, crab cakes, bought: mock chicken wraps, and zucchini wrapped hummus) I only enjoyed the chipotle taco.\n\nthe items are really small for the price, and mainly just doesnt taste that good. \n\nLike your mock chicken and crab should taste something like the meat its pretending to be right? \n\nI just felt like a bird eating all those seeds."
2,"I wrote this review in Frankfurt. Been going to Mr. Lucky's for years.  Had the gamblers special.  The shrimp, salad, and potatos were very good.  The quality of the steak has gone downhill.  Disappointed."
2,"I wrote this review in Shanghai. If you're planning on paying for a buffet on the Strip, allow me to convince you otherwise, because it is definitely not worth it. However, if you find yourself with some complementary buffet vouchers, let the Wycliff flow! Most of the food here is standard buffet, which is to say, bad, but there are some palatable items to be had if you look carefully enough. I went with the gyros, available near the salad bar. Also acceptable-looking were the salads themselves. For dessert, I hunkered down for some frozen instant pudding (or gelato, as they call it around these parts), which tasted good enough. As an aside, I noticed a lot of people putting their faith in the raw bar here, and I haven't heard news of a salmonella outbreak, so that's something. Sparkling wine is complementary, so drink up!"
2,"I wrote this review in Copenhagen. So what's the big deal here and, based on the experiences I've had coupled with a lot of the other Yelp reviews I've read, how are they still open?\n\nCute decor? Definitely. Funky?  Certainly. Hip? I suppose. All that does not a restaurant destination make though.\n\nThe food sounds nice on the menu and the fact they are supporting local farms and growers is appreciated but the results are just so uneven. It tastes good but it's cold, it's hot but overcooked, it's hot and cooked properly but really doesn't taste quite right. It's perfectly prepared and delicious. Who can tell?\n\nAdd to that the fact that the front of the place is a disorganized mess and the staff is either surly or outright rude and condescending and I get back to my original sentiment. How is this place still open?"
2,"I wrote this review in Pakistan. Years ago, I had an AMAZING meal here, so I was eager to eat here again. Unfortunately, this place went downhill in a hurry, and that's a shame!\n\nI ordered the 8oz Filet Mignon. It was WAY over seasoned with salt and pepper, undercooked (I asked for medium and it came out closer to rare), and having had this same dish before it was a huge letdown. And what's up with them not letting you substitute sides?!\n\nThe Sugar Factory Fondue was another huge fail, with awful tasting chocolate and mediocre treats to dip in it. I could tell that the bananas were frozen, the brownies were gross, it was just bad overall.\n\nHow things have gotten so bad is beyond me, but needless to say, I won't be coming back."
2,"I wrote this review in Paris. After doing some shopping nearby, I was lured into ATS by their slogan: \""Best Carne Asada in Phoenix\"".  When ordering at the counter, the staff seemed very disinterested in helping customers.  When I finally did order my carne asada burrito, I was given a number and asked to take a seat.  While I waited, I noticed a few other customers wondering what was going on with the bad service at the counter.  When my carne asada arrived at the table, I was starving.  However, the burrito that sat in front of me was tiny.  I'm not really one to complain about small portion sizes, as I feel that most portions are too big, but this portion was just comical.  The burrito was served with a lime wedge that was dry and looked like it had been sliced the day before.  The flavor of the carne asada was bland, as was the texture.\n\nOverall, this was a pretty disappointing meal.   \""Best Carne Asada in Phoenix\"" is a really misleading phrase to have on their sign.  This place is not even close."
2,"I wrote this review in Italy. Visited this place with my boyfriend and his friend in tow. I was all ready to go to Hungry Howie's, but nooo, we had to go to Gus's New York Pizza.\n\nI would skip this place. Try a different restaurant instead. I am a food maniac and this is one of the first times I've actually left some of my pizza on the plate because it was just unworthy in so many ways."
2,"I wrote this review in Madagascar. I liked the Town Square location the one or two times I was there. But the food I got at the Tivoli location was mediocre at best. The sweet potato and chicken risotto ($16.25) was gummy and tasted like paste. The fettuccine napoli ($15.95) was better, but nothing stellar. The best thing I tried was the kid's cheese pizza. Yeah, that means the place is kid friendly. The prices are reasonable -- although from what I hear happy hour is the best time to go since apps are $3 each."
2,"I wrote this review in Marrakech. I cannot see why anyone would give such great reviews for this restaurant. There is not much to choose from in Fountain Hills, so that might explain the raves. Notice there are no real pictures of the restaurant on their website. There is a good reason, the interior is small, dark and cold, both in temperature and decor with maybe 8 tables. The bulk of the seating is outdoors and if eating on the sidewalk is your thing, then this might be your place.\n\nThe food is okay, it's a tapas place so you expect small plates and prices to go along with it. When portions and prices are not comparable, the word pricey comes to my mind. However, they do have wonderful multigrain breads, the freshest salads and deliciously brewed coffee.\n\nMaybe we tried it on a bad day, but I would say the service was less than spectacular. We actually had to get up and walk to the door in order to get our check.\n\nFrom our experience, there is nothing here to draw us back."
2,"I wrote this review in Warsaw. 14.95 a day for wi-fi. Give me a break. This hotel is a dumpasaurus rex. Line for the front desk took 40 minutes. Off the strip, but the shuttle at least comes in handy. Just be prepared to wait a while for it to show up(don't forget to tip). The new hotels far exceed the grandeur of the Rio. Although the rooms are \""all suite\"" as they claim, they are all suites that have been transported from the year 1990 to the present. Big tube TVs, ugly couches and plenty of birch and purple in the room to take you back in time. time for an update."
2,I wrote this review in Philadelphia. Great if you like rides and flea market stuff. Food prices out of this world..$10.25 for a hot dog and $3.75 for a bottle of water.Eat before or bring your own. Not worth it.
2,"I wrote this review in Shanghai. Picazzo's ... where have you gone? You used to be one of my favorite places to visit but you have fallen from grace. Service was good and I appreciate that but the food was sub-par. My salad arrived with a variety of greens that were not listed on the menu and my server apologizing for the substitution. You might have asked me if I wanted kale... I did not. That's why I didn't order the kale salad. The lettuce was brown on the edges and the $1.50 I paid for a sliver of avocado was ridiculous. I can't decide if I'll try you again or not.  I appreciate your nod to health, but meh..."
2,"I wrote this review in Tanzania. I'm just not that impressed. The menu isn't that great.  The prices are higher than they should be for what you get.  They atmosphere is fun in a \""this was designed to look like every other fun location\"" kind of way - but completely lacks it's sincerity.  \n\nI've gone twice with someone who LOVES seafood, and her favorite restaurant is Red Lobster (Ultimate Feast every time...).  Even she wasn't impressed.  It didn't do anything for her.  She said it appeared that the crab legs had been previously frozen and then re-heated too quickly (she thought maybe microwave).  I don't cook, but she does more than regularly so I'm going to trust her on that one.  \n\nWe wanted to like it so we tried once more in case it was a bad night for both them and us and decided that really, this just wasn't it for us.  \n\nTheir \""Free Crab Tomorrow\"" sign always makes me smile, but at least now I know to laugh at the joke and just keep on driving."
2,I wrote this review in Rio de Janeiro. While the amusement park contains amazing rides be prepared for hours of waiting in line for seconds of pleasure. We were there with 3 children. An exhausting day most of which spent waiting in line in the sun while the children Get more cranky. \nThere are ways to cut the lines with flash pass which to be honest make it frustrating for all those who need to wait. I teaches the wrong values to children.
2,"I wrote this review in Dubai. I study a lot.  Finding places to study in Glendale isn't easy.  Paradise is the best of the \""easy\"" options I've found around school.  They have plenty of plugs, halfway reliable wifi, and pretty good (unlimited) coffee.  Oh, and the free samples of cookies and bread are also nice when you're in the realm of $250,000 in debt.\n\nThat being said, nothing here is particularly worth it's cost.  The coffee is \""generic dark\"" or \""flavored\"".  I take my coffee pretty seriously, so this was the first major sin they committed upon my person.  The food is also WAY overpriced for the quality.  This place is supposed to be a bakery.  Why is the bread so dull tasting?  Why do the cookies taste like nothing more than preservative and artificial dyes?\n\nYeah, I'll keep going here for the coffee and a change of pace, but I'm not going to recommend it for anything beyond that."
2,I wrote this review in Georgia. Tried this place multiple times.  Many different items.  The only thing Worth remembering were the margaritas and the had pretty good service.
2,"I wrote this review in Solomon Islands. The club itself is impressive but the horridly run front and security are RIDICULOUS and will try to ruin your night before you get in.\n\nWe had a table and it took them a good 30 minutes to let me in. When I had to leave and go IMMEDIATELY back in, they still made me wait in the non-existent, imaginary line (read ignored me while i stood behind a rope) 20 minutes even tho they recognized that i had just gotten out and beg for a new ticket even showing my re-entry stamp"
2,"I wrote this review in Shanghai. This place gets 2 stars only because the food was pretty tasty. The service was terrible and no one who worked there seemed to mind. We waited almost an hour for our food even though there were only a few other tables there. We were also seated in the corner of the breakfast bar directly in front of a giant oozing chocolate syrup container (so appetizing!) The waitress did come by several times to refill coffee but at no point did she apologize for the extremely long wait. She also didn't at any point clear the five or so tables that had already left, so we had to look at that the whole time, in addition to the chocolate syrup in my face. Also, a couple who came in half hour after us got our food at the same time we did. When the food finally came it was good (biscuits and egg sandwiches,) but so not worth the wait."
2,"I wrote this review in Iraq. Not quite my cup of tea. It's a chill little lounge. We got in for free, so I can't complain. The crowd is pretty much older. There were also a few cougars, well independent cougars, if that makes it any better. I was quite bored just standing around. Just go to Club XS instead!! Right across the casino."
2,"I wrote this review in Tajikistan. The food was decent for the price, but the service was horrible. We went there last Friday night shortly after midnight and only 5 tables were full. They seemed to have several servers available, yet we never received drink refills in over an hour and it took nearly a half hour to order our food. It was so bad, I advised another server that we were ready to order and she also blew us off. Further, the servers do not know their menu very well. I was offered a spicy honey mustard, but the guy had no clue what was in it to make it spicy. Turns out it was horseradish and was pretty good, but he seemed upset that I dare ask. I always tip a minimum of 20%, but could not justify it at all this time."
2,"I wrote this review in San Francisco. I got the all-american breakfast with the sausage links.  The hash browns were bland and not crispy, the eggs were a bit runny (I got scrambled), and the sausages were meh.  It's like a really bad Denny's, but more expensive."
2,"I wrote this review in Birmingham. Voted \""Best Burger,\"" by the Phoenix Magazine, January 09 Dining Guide issue, Delux's Delux Burger was far from the best. The burger was nothing more than an under-seasoned and over-cooked beef patty confined in an oversized soggy baguette. \n\nThe burger is supposed to have been dressed with organic rocket, caramelized onions, applewood-smoked bacon and blue and gruyere cheeses. Should have had a lot of flavor, right? But it didn't. The only identifiable flavor was the sweetness of the caramelized onions. \n\nAlso, the roasted beet salad was overdressed and soggy. If it wasn't for the texture of the beets I wouldn't have known they were there.  The sweet and earthy flavor that I was hoping for was lost due to the overabundance of the salty blue cheese and sweet balsamic vinaigrette. \n\nDelux does have a couple things going for them: a pretty cool ambience, an extensive drink menu, and they serve up a refreshingly cold glass of H2o."
2,"I wrote this review in Sweden. I was really surprised that the food was just ok. Not even good. I was craving bbq for a while and remembered Famous Daves being pretty decent so my family and I went for an earlier dinner on a Saturday night a couple of weeks earlier.\n\nThey were not too busy, we were seated in about 5 minutes. i ordered the 2 meat combo that included brisket and chopped pork. Both were on the dry side. The brisket had great flavor and was tender but overcooked. The pork was not chopped pork like i had in San Diego. it was pork chunks and lacked the moisture that I had at other locations. The dirty rice side dish was excellent! very moist and flavorful. \n\nMy kids chicken tender meals were anything but tender. Also dry and hard. my kids nor my husband and I even touched the chicken. \n \nOur server was nice enough. Overall the food just wasn't that great so I really doubt I will be going back any time soon. \n\nWish we had a Phil's BBQ in Vegas!!!!"
2,"I wrote this review in Sacramento. If you are in a rush, do not order any hot food (anything with eggs/bacon/etc).  On different orders on different days, we had fairly long delays (30+ minutes).  They have to get that from the back kitchen, which is apparently slow and/or far.  Otherwise, the other stuff is a fine way to use your resort/food/etc credit."
2,"I wrote this review in Accra. Beautiful property but last time we stayed there they were oversold. We arrived @10pm to find out that the word \""reservation\"" did not mean they had a room for us.\nThey said they had overcommitted & we had to drive 20 mins & check into another hotel - our room would be available the next day. \nWhat a pain! My husband was there got a meeting being held @ the JW, so he had to get up extra early the next am to account for travel time back to the JW & I had to move our stuff back."
2,"I wrote this review in . We tried it because of rave reviews we have heard, but left disappointed.  The ambiance was fine execpt towards the end of our meal they decided to adjust a table nearby and it became like a construction zone with drills and loud power tools.  Granted it was during lunch, but we still felt it could have been done at another time when most of the restaurant was not full.\n\nThe burgers were okay, but not at all what I would consider great.  They were not very juicy, or flavorful in and of themselves, but there were interesting toppings to choose from. And, despite the burgers not being juicy the bottom of the buns were falling apart.\n\nThe service was pleasant but the food didn't really hit the mark on our visit."

2,"I wrote this review in Boston. Had an open faced turkey sandwich that was terrible. Sliced deli turkey - and not even good deli turkey at that - covered with a salty, canned brown gravy.  Even the smashed potatoes were tasteless and watery, and couldn't save this meal.\n\nThe wait staff was friendly and attentive,  but describing the soup of the day as \"" kind of a broth, and it has vegetables\"" is not how one should be selling the soup.\n\nIf I come back again, I'll stick to burgers or sandwiches, and stay away from the dinner entrees."
2,"I wrote this review in Bogotá. It used to be much better, now it's just a mediocre buffet.\nYou won't stay hungry in this place it's just nothing special. Lots of choices - Asian, Mexican, omelets, carving station and deserts. The thing is that none of these are anything that you could remember.\nThe place is good for breakfast - for around 8-9 dollars it's unbeatable if you stay in Sam's Town.\nAnd one quick tip - don't forget to get BConnected card before you go there, it will take less then 5 minutes and you will save money."

2,"I wrote this review in Burundi. This place was just meh. The blonde ale was good, but other than that, I've had much better elsewhere.\n\nI also don't really think this can honestly be considered a brewpub.

2,"I wrote this review in Cairo. I've visited Straight Up twice now- the first time would have been the last if it weren't for a gift certificate I won. \n\nThe bar service on the first visit was the worst I have ever experienced. They have this Jersey Shore reject with NO SKILL as a bartender- she is slow, lazy, forgetful, easily confused and down right rude. No joke, I cannot think of one redeeming quality she exhibits. We had intended on ordering some food but just couldn't stand to be in her presence any longer. \n\nThe second visit was better- the bartender was decent and the service was moderately better (but it was also an exceptionally slow night). Of the 3 dishes we ordered the spicy Ahi tuna is the only one worth mentioning- the tuna was decent quality and prepared very well.\n\nAt the end of the day you have to ask- there are 5 other bars in the area with the same type of food and atmosphere- why bother with this place?"
2,"I wrote this review in Melbourne. I really wanted to give three stars, but I could not get past the lack of wifi in the rooms.  That is inexcusable.\n\nThe check-in desk is close to the entrance from the parking garage.  That is not the case at some casinos.  It is convenient.  The check-in process takes far too long for me, but it is right in line with most other casinos.  They all need to get together and figure out a simpler system.\n\nThe rooms are OK.  They are average sized.  They are in decent shape.  The bathroom could use an update though.  You have to use a cable for Internet connection which is a shame.  That is not helpful for your iPad.\n\nThere are several fast food options on site which is convenient late at night.  It could use some more sit down options though.  The cigar lounge is a great place to relax while enjoying a good cigar and drink.\n\nThe pool area is OK.  The lazy river is a good idea, but you cannot drink while floating in it, so the cool factor goes away quickly.\n\nOverall this place is OK for the price.  It is close to hot spots in Aria and Cosmopolitan."
2,I wrote this review in Los Angeles. I have come here 2 different times and they have tried to jam both of my groups into a smaller amount of tables. 1 more table would be great. First time it was a group of 15 adults and the 2nd time it was 6 adults and 1 high chair. We tried calling ahead to give them warning both times and they dont take reservations. The wait wasnt to bad either time. Food is amazing.
2,"I wrote this review in Kyoto. Service was slow. Ordered seafood platter; some cold, some raw. Sent back and they just reheated the plates.  Not good value."
2,"I wrote this review in Hanoi. The pizza is okay but unfortunately it does not make up for the wait time and fiasco of an ordering process. We were second in line to order, however it took longer than acceptable to be asked our slice selections then several minutes to actually receive our meal.  The price point is disappointingly higher than the quality of product with limited lunch specials. \n\nZ Pizza is two blocks west with lunch specials running about a buck fifty less so I'll be sticking with them from here on out."
2,"I wrote this review in Athens. I went to this place twice, the first time someone grumpily told me that they were not open yet (I thought it was close to noon, maybe I was wrong, but it didn't matter, I do not like to be talked to in that manner).  The second time was on July 14th, 2014.  There were several people eating and cars were parked on the side street and I had to park and walk about 1/2 a block back to the business.  An older man took my order.  I asked if their Chili was homemade.  He assured me it was.  I ordered a Coney  with mustard and onion, and a hot dog with mustard and onion.  The Coney and hot dog were rather small and the Chili was the same as Hormel canned chili.  I have eaten hot dogs and Coney's all over the U.S, in about every state I've been in.   This Coney as about as generic, as they come, and if the sauce was homemade, he must have added water to the canned chili to make it so.  The hot dog was average with nothing to make it special or any different than you'd get at a convenience store.  The bill was $7.00.  I do not know about other sandwiches that they serve, so I can't comment on them, only on what I ate.  I would suggest, if you eat at this place, order something other than Coney's and hot dogs as they were disappointing, and do not be surprised, if you are  treated gruffly."
2,"I wrote this review in Jakarta. Can't say that I was very impressed. Came for dinner in a hopeful and enthusiastic mood since the reviews have been pretty good, but I don't think this place lives up to its current good, but declining rating.\n\nOrdered the Combo fried rice (shrimp, chicken, beef, pork), sesame chicken, and garlic fried chicken. \n\nThe combo fried rice was pretty good, but ended up drinking about 6 glasses of water due to the MSG and sodium content. You'd think that the cook spent his better years in the French Foreign Legion in the Sahara eating salt tablets and developed a taste for them. \n\nThe sesame chicken had a good flavor and a thick brown sweet sauce. I liked it a lot until it got cool and the sauce looked (with that stringy consistency) more like glue. You think I'm kidding? I'm not.\n\nGarlic fried chicken was bad. Just bad. It was like an over roasted dried out half chicken with some dried garlic pieces sprinkled on top. No spices, no flavor, no good. \n\nWe then got all kinds of lip from the waitress when we asked if they could change the channel on the TV from college football, to the Suns game. They made it into this big deal that the \""customers\"" wanted to see the football game. Yeah right, it was University of West Virginia Vs. University of Connecticut! I would have believed it if it was a local team....\n\nIt's better than a 1 star joint, but only because it's borderline edible. To be avoided."
2,"I wrote this review in Rio de Janeiro. Decided to give it another go today and see if my first impression was right.  I ordered the Italian beef and onion rings.  The beef was soaked in olive oil and not that good.  The onion rings are frozen but still good.  I have absolutely no desire to go back ever.  If i want a hot dog, I'll go to Ted's in Tempe and if I want a beef I'll go to Rosati's at Warner and McClintock since it's not a franchise.  I had a friend from Chicago with me and he even said that the beef's were different from the ones back home.  Way too much olive oil put on the beef if you ask for hot peppers."
2,"I wrote this review in Kenya. I went to Benny's with my daughter for breakfast and we ordered a pretty standard breakfast: scrambled eggs, bacon, toast,home fries.\n\n-scrambles eggs had a bad texture and the bacon was kinda scraggly looking \n-my daughter liked the home fries but I prefer the option for potato style versus deep fried French fry style.\n-coffee was terrible, not unusual for a diner style breakfast place\n\nHad I paid the $2.99 early bird special price I would shrug it off as you get what you pay for but this was full price $10 each breakfast so I expected real food. Felt like the food was made using synthetic ingredients like eggs in the microwave (I've seen it done this way with my own eyes) and pre-cooked microwave bacon. Actually I feel like my breakfast was made in the microwave.\n\nService wasn't great. We were seated and the order was taken pretty quickly but after the food was delivered we never saw the waitress again. \n\nI don't personally think I'll go back to Benny's for breakfast and was disappointed I spent the money."
2,"I wrote this review in North Macedonia. The review 'I've experienced better' is a perfect description of this pretty expensive restaurant. Every dish had extremely overpowering elements. The chefs in the back definitely have a heavy hand and a desire for putting truffle oil on everything (which after three or four bites becomes nauseating).  The pigs in a blanket were gleaming from the massive amount of butter, my surf and turf too salty, the fries loaded with pepper and mac and cheese tasted like cardboard soaked in truffle oil. I think the draw to this beehive styled Restaurant is the celebrity sightings. I saw a couple of D-listers and two LA Lakers basketball players during my visit. If you're into that I guess you can get past the bad food by hanging out at the bar and looking out into the dark dining room. It'll achieve your wish and save you from the sickening food."
2,I wrote this review in Romania. The Room Smelled bad when we walked in. And even worse you could see Daylight through the door. there is a serious problem with a hotel when the curtains block the light better then the door does. the Breakfast bar food is pretty bad. Eat the fruit.\n\nthe only reason I gave it a second star was because the bed ws really comfy... of course I just got off a red eye flight and didn't sleep a wink so maybe I was seeing it through rose colored glasses.
2,"I wrote this review in Brazil. Biggest complaint is that I couldn't ever get the wifi to work, which is kind of a big deal for someone here on business for the whole week."
2,"I wrote this review in Tanzania. My mom and I came here the day before my wedding to have a more upscale experience than my tried and true vietnamese shop.  The salon itself is lovely.  But for $75 a person, it was a complete waste of money and time.  My french manicure looked as though I could have done it myself.  Same for my mom.  After seeing the poor skills of my manicurist, I opted for a solid color on my toes...and even this was done poorly.  Everyone may speak English and the salon may look upscale, but the quality of the mani and pedi was POOR and I will not be going back.  I was embarrased after leaving but did not have time to go to a real manicurist for a polish change.  Hopefully the shoddy job doesnt show in my wedding photos."
2,"I wrote this review in Mauritania. Way overpriced!  Rude sign in front that says \""be nice or leave\"" really?! That can put anyone in a bad mood to see that as they enter.  Clear boxes are ugly, ask for cardboard box.  Wish I could just bake myself."
2,"I wrote this review in Birmingham. Just because a restaurant has white tablecloths does not mean it has good food but reviewers of Flemings must be so impressed with the tablecloths that they overlooked the taste of food.  Worse restaurant I've been to in a while, and that includes the food I am forced to eat at the airport.   I had  fish, that tasted institutional - something off high school cafeteria menu. It was an insult to the sea.  The service was good, which is why this place got two stars and not one."
2,"I wrote this review in Peru. It's a nice club, but definitely not worth the price of admission. I expected more. I guess if I was from a small town this would've been a hit. Prissy asian/white chicks and fairly ratchet black chicks...not much else...at least that was the scenery when I was there. \n\nNot worth a repeat. Bunk"
2,"I wrote this review in Oslo. Not a fan of this location.  Try the one on 3rd ave & south side of bell.\n\nWow, someone actually managed to ruin a Starbucks location!!  Slow drive through, condescending service, and overall lack of interest on the part of the employees. \n\nWe stopped in on my hunny's birthday on our way to vegas. This is the location closest to us so we wanted to just get in and out.  The voice on the drive through was kinda short with us, but I get it- you're busy.  We finally get to the window after over 10 minutes waiting.  The guy does not give us our gift card back.  I go inside and they can't find it. My hunny goes inside, and at least gets them to look for it and reprint the receipt.  Starbucks corporate reissued the card for us a few days later so in ended up fine.  \n\nStill, this location has no urgency!!"
2,"I wrote this review in St. Petersburg. My husband bought a pearl white 2006 Subaru STI from here back in 2008. The brakes were completely gone within a couple days of him buying it and he had to shell out extra money to get them replaced as they are brembo brakes (not cheap!).  While the brakes were being replaced (at Subaru), it was brought to our attention that the sway bar had broken because it was upside down! Carmax refused to cover the broken sway bar under the warranty because they said the sway bar would flip if taken over a jump and that was not warrantied. What a joke. Don't get me wrong, I love to do jumps in a car with no brakes, makes me feel alive - but this car was not jumped nor driven in such a way that the sway bar could've flipped. It was probably upside down because the previous owner that killed the brakes had some aftermarket junk on the car that he took off before trading the car in and since Carmax apparently doesn't look at sway bars and brakes while inspecting their vehicles, it just flew under the radar. This dealership was the last straw as far as used cars for us. Now we save and buy new."
2,"I wrote this review in Zurich. I was excited to see that there was an Indian restaurant so close to my job but boy was I disappointed.  I wanted the Chicken Tikka Masala which I'm assuming is the most popular dish b/c when I got up to order they were out.  The server told me that I could just get the sauce. She would give me the Veggie price (which is a dollar less) but that is so stupid to me.\n\nThe owner, I'm assuming, was very non chalant of running out of food. He told her to tell me that I could come back tomorrow. Are you serious? I was just standing there stupified because I couldn't believe that they didn't have anymore (it was 1pm btw). He suggested I eat something else but I didn't want any other dish.  Just as I was going to leave. He picked out the last little pieces of chicken and plopped on my plate. I just thought since it was the last of the food that maybe I could get more sauce.  Not so!\n\nIt was medicore at best. I've had better and they acted like they could care less if you ever come back.  \n\nI'm sorry but I can not give this place a good review."
2,"I wrote this review in Cairo. We (loved) the Quad - Soon to be \""Link Hotel.\"" \n\nSadly we (platinum Caesars members)  just left after a fun filled week in Vegas and we always place money on the dreaded wheel at the Quad... We walked up to the wheel and the lady there was a total bitch. I believe her name was \""Rhoda.\"" She took our bet THEN checked our ID's ( thanks Rhoda for that!) and then she proceeded to spin the wheel a whole 4 pegs!!!! (Not one whole spin!) What the hell? Really? 4 pegs? So instead of spending your money here to gamble - go across the street to Caesars WiLL be better off - WAIT maybe MGM knows the rules from the gambling commission and actually follows gambling rules?! GO THERE INSTEAD. Sad because staying at the Quad was what we did at least 6 times a year and now we will not return. \n\n(Btw - customers always remember being treated like shit!) HR people avoid this lady \""Rhoda\"" she should NOT work with the public - Unless you hate having customers!"
2,"I wrote this review in Denver. Overrated! Service was terrible and food was below average. Tables were dirty and server refused to get cucumbers from the sushi bar, even we offered to pay for them. I offered the Gomoku Yaki Udon - pork was overcooked and overrun with whole calamari that still had eyes... Interesting decorating - Asian, Italian, and French with Christmas lights. Disappointed... :/"
2,"I wrote this review in Helsinki. I am a regular here, but must say that I was very disappointed last time I was there, I went to get a nail broken fixed I waited for over an hour! Ridiculous...  \nI like this place a lot but I only have my nails done with Libby, every time I have had it with someone else it is NO good, no to mention that I HATE that they keep talking among themselves in vietnamese, so rude. Once I knew that they were saying something about me and I asked what they were saying about me, they just said oh yes we were talking about your beautiful eyelashes... yeah right!"
2,"I wrote this review in Tajikistan. If you've never seen a male revue before, then you might make the mistake of thinking this is a good show.  It was very amateurish and sloppy. First of all, the men were not all cute. Great bodies, yes. But only 2 of the guys had good looking faces.  Second, they can't really dance and do the same tired moves for every top 40 song. Much of the show is actually \""empty\"" in that there's one dancer going through the crowd while everyone else is sitting there with no entertainment. In short, the show is lazy. There are some \""OMG\"" moments as there will be whenever men strip. But having seen Chippendales, this show is NOT worth $20, much less the $36 we paid from the 1/2 price ticket booth."
2,"I wrote this review in Belgium. Never heard of Sam Woo before, but apparently my family comes here all the time. As you step in the restaurant, you are surprised with the roasted pig and chicken hanging behind the glass wall. \n\nI came here with my family. We were seated in one of the large tables and right next to us was another family. It was practically just two parties in this restaurant, cramped next to each other. I was unsure why they didn't seat us separately so we would have more room. \n\nWe ordered honey walnut shrimp, Mongolian beef, house fried rice, wonton soup, noodle soup, roasted pig, and flounder fish. (very typical dishes)\n\nFried rice and flounder fish was okay. The honey walnut shrimp and Mongolian beef was nothing I've ever tasted before. It tasted very different. I expected it to be the same taste with what you would usually get from a Chinese restaurant. But these dishes were so off.  The only thing I liked was the roasted pig which is filled so much cholesterol! \n\nCash only!!"
2,"I wrote this review in Armenia. Will give Echo & Rig another try because our steaks were amazing, perfectly cooked and flavored. Unfortunately, the service was not up to par. We dined downstairs, early dinner. We watched as one couple left because there was no server in sight. When  one popped up, we seemed to haven disturb her. Took our order, no follow up, just the check."
2,I wrote this review in Mexico City. I have been to this location several times in the past year and each time I have been fairly disappointed.  The staff at this location are not necessarily rude but they don't not go out of their way to be helpful.  This Ulta is always short of something when I go in for my buy 2-get 1 free hair products...ALWAYS!!!  They seem to have a smaller selection of products then their counterpart at Best of the West.
2,"I wrote this review in Hamburg. I rarely walk into a Walmart, maybe once per quarter. This store is a mess! In fact it's so much of a mess that I wonder how people shop. A quiet Monday evening and there are carts full of merchandise around the store just sitting there. Went in looking for one particular product (a vacuum) and the sections were completely in shambles. A shame when you are looking at products that range from $38 to over $400. This reminds me of a bad bargain basement sale. It's like no one really cares and forget trying to find products on the shelves. Really... the competition has come to town and instead of competing you decide making your store look like trash is the way to go.... really!\n\nWalked to the cash to pay, light is on, but the cashier isn't even there. We stand there for a while deciding if we are going to pay for what we have in hand. Manager notices us and calls girl back to her cash. Four cashiers for the whole store and one goes walking away leaving people waiting? \n\nImportant Note: This Walmart has very limited handicapped parking and it is often impossible to find a spot. They just don't care enough to increase the spots, in spite of the fact that they are often full with cars that all have permits. Shameful."
2,"I wrote this review in Zurich. Ate there with the wife last night. Everything tasted to us like it was straight out of a can and came to the table cold. Server was nice, but the everything home made speech is a crock. Just because it was put in a pot, then from a pot to a plate does not mean it should be called homemade or hand made."
2,"I wrote this review in Helsinki. I have no idea how this place has a 4 star rating, this is just crazy to me! In a nut shell the food is decent at best, the view is great IF you have a window seat otherwise you are only viewing other diners. The service is \""mixed\"" Hostess is a total bitch, the server was ok, the manager doesn't know his head from his ass. There were 4 of us, the bill was $440. Not my first time having a bill that much, nor will it be my last but for that amount it needs to be good all around. Red Square is much better."
2,I wrote this review in Paraguay. 5 minutes of walking around in this small store trying to find an employee to answer our question is ridiculous.
2,I wrote this review in Dubai. I've come here for dinner before and when the bike rallys are going on and usually love this place but today we came for Sunday brunch and will rethink coming back. We were seated quickly and the server took the order right away but 3 people with us had the buffet and after their first plate they finally got tired of waiting for the waitress and went back for seconds with their dirty plate. When I got my food I ordered a bowl of chili it was burnt the cheese was so hard I couldn't mix it in and had to cut it with a knife. When I finally got to ask for a refill of my drink I got a glass that had to be the end of the bag and I didn't get to ask for another glass cause she didn't stop long enough for me too. Then she brings us the check and seems to get upset when we ask for seperate checks... We had to tell her what when on each check and when we told her what was in my husband's and mines order she says she has the other orders so she could figure ours out. Defiantly will not be back here anytime soon.
3,"I wrote this review in Trinidad and Tobago. I have stayed at most of the Vegas strip hotels and here are my thoughts.\n\nFrom the outside, this hotel stands out like a sore thumb.  It's a bit eerie overall, but one of the cheapest nicer hotels on the strip.\n\nIf you stay, DO NOT stay in a room inside of the pyramid.  Being buzzed and drunk will get you feeling even sicker since the exterior window tilt at about a 45 degree angle.  Pay the extra few bucks and get a room in the new and NICER towers.  Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.  Pleasantly surprised, but not wowed.\n\nIronically, they have an awesome pool.  Lots of young people too which is weird for this hotel.\n\nThe coffee kiosk here is really bad, so if you need java, go to the Chocolate Swan store located in the mall between Luxor and Mandalay.\n\nTIP: The Luxor offers a free shuttle which you can catch on the second floor in the front.  This shuttle will take you to Excalibur (ewww), but realize that you will be in the middle of the strip to venture elsewhere like NYNY and MGM, Aladdin, Paris and etc."
3,"I wrote this review in Amsterdam. We were in Southern Highlands, looking for a place with Wi-Fi... \n\nWe found one, Perk Up.. Since I'm always excited to try something new, we rushed right in. \n\nAt first when I looked up at the menu all we saw were coffees & teas. They also had a display case that had muffins and sweet rolls, and slices of quiche. \n\nI finally looked to the right and there was a stand up menu chalk board that offered some breakfast & lunch options. \n\nI ordered some tea then decided I wanted lunch.. I asked about a couple of the sandwiches and the girl at the cash register was great in describing some of the offerings and even mentioned how she had pumpkin muffins coming out of the oven. YUM! \n\nI ordered the quiche, which came with a side of fruit. Once served the quiche was good, but I've had better, the small portion of fruit looked as though it had saved from last week, perhaps so since it was a Monday. My friend had mentioned that the fruit did not look appealing and most likely was a couple of days old. They immediately cut up some fresh fruit and brought it out to us. \n\nNice, clean place with great service. It's not a place I am craving to go back to for lunch, but to meet for coffee or tea, you betcha!"

3,"I wrote this review in Israel. Gosh I had high expectations for this place because it had the cake boss' name on it,  but I was really disappointed at the poor service and the taste of the food.   Honestly,  I feel like the food at Carrabas is just as good if not better! The only thing memorable were the desserts.  Thank goodness because that is what he's known for.  The nutella cake is so rich and sweet, it'll give you a belly and toothache just looking at it.  I usually finish my desserts entirely,  but this one I could only take a few bites. A few bites is all you need.  The canolli is the real deal;  very creamy with a good combination of cinnamon,  chocolate, and pistachio flavors.  Skip dinner here and just order dessert and coffee."
3,"I wrote this review in Detroit. I enjoy 3 things about Caravan Coffee:  convenient location in downtown Belmont, it's not another Starbucks, and they offer cupcakes and sweet treats from Brenda's Cake Gallery (the bakery next door).  Unfortunately that's where the fun stops for me.  The menu on the wall lists plenty of delicious-sounding coffees, but I've tried several of them over the last few years and I have yet to find one I like.  Every hot drink I have ordered is served luke-warm and I have to drink it within 5 minutes to keep it from getting too cold to drink.  None of the drinks have a particularly good flavor.  They don't taste like coffee and they don't taste like the flavoring syrups.  Today I had a \""peppermint patty\"" (white chocolate peppermint mocha) that just tasted like cough medicine.  I also despise the foam they top off every drink with, but that's just a personal preference.\n\nAlthough the drinks aren't the greatest, you can always come in to enjoy the cozy atmosphere and grab a delicious cupcake.  Just beware if there isn't a single parking spot available in the evening it means terribly slow service and possibly standing room only."

3,"I wrote this review in Munich. I almost feel bad giving this three stars, but we went today earlier in the day with my 7 year old and three adults.... 7 year old played in the fort thing and found a friend, had a great time. We walked down to the Fremont street experience and decided to have dinner there in the park. We walked back and ordered our meal (at about $20 a plate for tacos and beer!!!!) around 8:48 and my daughter asked if she could go out and see the mantis on fire... I told her yes! Then my husband went to get her and they told her she couldn't come back in!!!!!  She walked back in anyway. At 9:00 they announced that if you are under 21 the park is closing.  Mind you we were still waiting of our meal! This was Saturday night. So we then felt like we had to rush through our  meal we had JUST purchased in order to leave with the under age one. Not so great. If they are marketing this for families, then it needs to be that- 9pm is not that late for families on a weekend. If they aren't, then market it that way but they do need to decide what it is. I didn't appreciate having to rush through my meal."

Interesting to note that they won't cook your burger past Medium, so be comfortable with some pink.\nAtmosphere. Relatively small interior and dark red wallpaper with black flourishes worthy of a comment.\n\n[ - ]\nLocation. Seems an odd place for a 'bar.' It's off the street and surrounded by tamer chain stores.\nPrice. The majority of the menu is 8.95.

3,I wrote this review in Namibia. It's an old theater what can I say? I totally HATE the parking here but I think they are in the works of redoing it... I think the service can be a bit slow and they need to get some more ticket kiosks!!!! The chairs are not all that comfortable and the screens are just ok. I come here for the convenience factor of it being close to my house and also because it's one of the few theaters where you don't have to walk through a busy casino to get to.. just in and out. They also seem to play a couple independent documentaries and movies that I don't really see elsewhere.. I thought Village Square was a dying plaza but with all these new restaurants coming into it there is still hope!!! \n\nHOT TIP: If there is a long line outside at the box office don't get tricked like I did by the sign that says to use the kiosk in the lobby.. There's usually a short line for that ONE KIOSK too and trust me.. people do not know how to use the kiosk and take FOREVER! lol
3,"I wrote this review in Armenia. We decided to try a new spot for sushi this last weekend and the rain made it undesirable to travel far from home. We pulled into this small location not knowing what to expect and was happy with our experience.\n\nWe ordered 4 sushi rolls and some Goyza / edamame as appetizers which tasted perfect. The diamondback roll was the best of the three and would be a definite the next time we stop in, absolute lightly fried goodness! the fried cali roll was great and the dragon as well. My wife liked the spicy shrimp roll as well, but that isn't my type of roll. \n\nWe would love to come during happy hour to save some cash and my only real con's about the place would be the decor and space. Other than that the Sushi is great and there is plenty of room for a nice quiet date night for two, but not a huge party setting for sure.\n\nSushi Rocks overall here though!"
3,"I wrote this review in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I bought the onion and mushroom poutine and a Montreal smoke meat sandwich.  The sandwich was very good.  The meat was warm and so moist.  Very good.  \nThe poutine was ok, I wish I bought something with bacon or something also meaty to enhance the flavour.  I did like the onion and mushroom though, but just thinking about the possibilities.\n\nThe weird thing is, maybe because I was in a hurry, I under tipped.  The waiter asked me if there was something wrong with the service but honestly there was nothing wrong with it but nothing exceptional either.  I happened to go early on a Saturday morning, right when the store opened.  So after I told him nothing was wrong, he informed me that in Montreal the tipping is 15%.  So he asked me for $1.50 more.  I felt embarassed because I wasn't paying attention and I just wanted to give him a flat $30 after eating $26 something. Maybe I am cheap.  Before entering, my brother and I wanted to see how much their poutine was, and already they were shouting at us that it was not opened yet.  So the food was good, but I'm not sure about the service.  I still gave it a chance after being shooed away."
3,"I wrote this review in Canada. This hotel is just meh.  Nothing to write home about except for the fabulous location.  Didn't do anything more than sleep there, so I can't comment on the bistro or anything else.  A good place to stay if you can get a great rate."
3,"I wrote this review in Milan. Neighborhood friendly. Fresh and clean, why isn't it busier? I believe it's missing that,  \""unique\"" edge. It's a safe place to visit but I'm not needing to return to enjoy what I had or to try something new. Great location and a nice place to meet a friend for a simple meal."
3,"I wrote this review in Estonia. Wine list is ok, not what I would have expected for a Wine Spectator award winner, and the markup is ENORMOUS. Generally the fish menu is sustainable but when I commented to the waitress about the CRITICALLY ENDANGERED Chilean sea bass she didn't even know the difference between farmed and wild caught fish let alone what sustainable meant - wait staff needs to be trained on that. Quality and flavor of the dinners was great overall, but the risotto side dish had zero flavor - where's the salt?? Beautiful view but in my opinion NOT totally worth $100 per person for dinner...and that didn't even include an appetizer or dessert!"
3,I wrote this review in Venezuela. We were hungry and in the area so we decided to check this place out.  I mean you cant really go wrong with a burger.  The service was quick and friendly.  My burger was good.  Nothing special but good.  Same with the chili cheese fries.   \nIf for some reason I'm in the area again i would be willing to return and try the BBQ.
3,"I wrote this review in Kyoto. Sichuan is a region in China known for hot babes. If you know a thing or two about what brings the heat you know that you need the whole package. Pretty and smart gets it done. Taking one without the other you're either shallow or a chump.\n\nYou'll see a ton of these yelp reviews deride the decor or the service or the atmosphere. These are the kinds of kids that like places like Imperial Garden. Who likes that place? (I do. Kind of a lot. I think?). You'll also see a ton of these yelp reviews glow over Sichuan food and eating stuff like oxtail and tripe or pickled soup. I am a big fan, and their spicy crispy chicken is my jam. The only thing I got here that I didn't like was the Kung Pao chicken - it didn't pack much heat and the sauce was thick and sweet. I think they thought I was getting something from the Americanized menu.\n\nSo what kind of babe is Ichiban? Obviously she's the brainy one that doesn't care what you think. I kinda wish she did, though."
3,I wrote this review in Moscow. Pretty good look at the heavy # of people walking around the Casino. staff were nice. Not the cheapest spots for drinks though
3,"I wrote this review in Nairobi. I made the mistake of arriving for my 11PM reservation with a hangover, so I didn't quite get to enjoy the full excellence. Seating was very cramped, but in full view of the kitchen, which made the experience much more enjoyable. Food was good, but expect to spend $$$. \n\nOh, and make reservations EARLY. The night before my reservation someone offered me $500 for it, so that's a good indication of the popularity of the place."
3,"I wrote this review in Italy. Good food, nice atmosphere. A little pricey for the food (lunch), but good. Service was good, not too crowded. Would come back!"
3,"I wrote this review in Moscow. This place has been packed for dinner since it opened a few weeks ago. We had pizza this time while pizza is thin and crispy and pretty good it is over priced for what it is they do not look like their picture's with pile's of stuff on them, they are mainly flat and chinsey w the topping's. Who know's maybe you would have to add lot's of topping's to get it tasty so a make it yourself personal $8.50 12\"" pizza turn's into $11. I'd rather go to Ray's accross the street personally. The beer and wine selection is not too bad. I will probably eat here again but not for the pizza. The kid loved the mac & cheese $4 incl. drink is ok by me."
3,"I wrote this review in Brazil. OK, to be fair, my fellow Yelpers must know that the Manager of St. Francis has attempted to remedy my last review by offering me dinner on him.  Yes, I was sent a gift certificate so that I might try dinner again.  I LOVE that gesture, and it was very much appreciated!  I am only sorry that it took me so long to 1) return, and 2) to update my review.\n\nI returned for a visit at the first part of September.  However, my position remains the same.  I really do love the ambiance!  But my service experience has been just poor...defined as not attentive, and not even very friendly.  I would have loved to have been able to write an improved review but...when there are so many restaurants that serve me well, I will have to pass on this one.  :-("
3,"I wrote this review in Cote d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast). I don't quite get this place. I see what they are trying to do,but the food is not as good as most high end steak houses in Vegas and he prices are way too high. The only thing I can figure is most meals are comped and it makes the ego driven gamblers think they are really getting a three hundred dollar meal, your not. The service cannot get any better its  just the food does not compare to Cut,Delmonicos,Del frisco ect. If you want old Vegas feel go to Hugos in the four queens the food is good with the same mob look but the prices are one third this place"
3,"I wrote this review in San Marino. I've been going to this place off and on for over a decade.  The food is good, but it's really pricey.  Far too expensive for a place that uses plastic utensils.\n\nAlso, they give you about 5 tortilla chips.  For some reason they are very stingy with chips.  You can order multiple meals to go and you're given about a ziploc sandwich bag's worth of chips.  The small bag.\n\nI'd give the place a higher rating if they had better prices and more chips."
3,I wrote this review in Turkmenistan. The food is killer. The service always sucks. Always. I keep coming because I love the grub but every time I come here the people working have terrible attitudes.
3,"I wrote this review in Eswatini. Golden Phoenix is the kind of place you visit when you want a decent, inexpensive lunch. The place is rarely full during the week, especially if you arrive closer to 11am, so be prepared to eat your meal while the (slightly creepy) waitstaff sits at a nearby empty table and watches you eat.  The food is nothing spectacular, but it's decent quality, flavorful (although \""very, very spicy\"" is really closer to \""my tongue has a slight tingle\""), and dirt cheap.  Today I paid $16 and change before tip for myself and my friend, including soft drinks.  I'll keep coming back for the reasons I listed plus its close proximity to my office.  You can't beat a good deal!"
3,"I wrote this review in Lima. Other than the lack of an apostrophe there's very little wrong with this establishment  service was good (although the thought that we might have wanted food after having longer to study the menu whilst our teas were being prepared seemed to get lost somewhere), decor is pleasant (some very comfy chairs to stretch out in) and it benefits massively from the large expanse of window facing onto Frederick Street.\nFood and drink-wise there is nothing on the menu that you wouldn't expect from a cafe of this kind so if you're after a surprise or a new taste sensation you'll probably be out of luck but, whilst not breaking any records, they do what they do well.\nHaving not checked out the toilets on this visit (or the food for that matter) I'm hedging at 3 stars but would expect on current evidence that either of those things would easily push it to 4 the next time I pop in."
3,"I wrote this review in Frankfurt. So I had the Com bi cha suon nuong.  The pork chop was tasty, well flavored and not overly salty.  The bi was good although I didn't care for the meatloaf (cha) because the edge was too firm as though it was left in the oven a tad too long.  overall I had a good lunch."
3,"I wrote this review in Tonga. Great price. Rooms are renovated and comfortable.  Got an  to a \""private floor\"" however never had to use the key to access it, as they said, so doesn't seem very private.  Couldn't get the wireless internet to work, they offered to send someone up, but being here on business didn't really have time for that.  Check in was slow.  A tad loud in the halls in the mornings.  Good central location.  Weird sort of faux furry pillow thing on my bed.  It's orange and looks like a creepy giant macaroni with cheese.  Whoever designed that needs help."
3,"I wrote this review in Milan. Red Shrimp is a consistently good hole in the wall Chinese place.  The lunch specials are pretty good ranging from $4.75 to $5.50.  With this special you get your choice of entree, an egg roll, and chicken fried rice.  The rice is kind of bland to me, but the two entrees that I've tried, mongolian beef and orange chicken are full of flavor and very yummy.  Overall I'd recommend this place if your want some authentic Chinese flavor for a good price and not Panda Express."
3,"I wrote this review in North Macedonia. 03/16/13\n\nThe others are right, what's that smell?\n\nThe food was good, but that smell is surely not right. There is no way 5 stars can be achieved with that smell. At least I know they cooked my food fresh, as the fresh cooking masked the awful smell. I knew my food was off the grill, when the smell returned. I won't be back, until YELP reviews confirm the smell is gone.\n\nThai Hot, is hot, so be careful. I like the presentation of the beef Larb. The cabbage is not all shredded like other places. I like easy access to lime and chilli marinated beef."
3,"I wrote this review in Nepal. I was so disappointed. I'm still disappointed. This place was supposed to be the best Italian food ever and quite frankly it wasn't. I like the layout of the place, its beautiful and the people that work here are awesome, but my expectations were so high for the food to be so low. I would come back though. I dont know when since there are so many other restaurants to try in LV, but if this was one of the only places open on a certain day then yes count me in. I don't even remember what I ordered. THAT is a bad sign. Their bread was tasty though."
3,"I wrote this review in Buenos Aires. Dillard's is pretty nice but their decor seem a bit outdated though, probably because of their lighting, however, they do offer great variety of brands of clothings. And they do have good sales most of the time. Sad part is they don't offer any other form of discounts, like Belk or Macy. But Dillard's is still a great place to shop at."
3,"I wrote this review in San Francisco. I have to admit the TB is a guilty junk food kinda thing when you are vegetarian.  Pretty much anything on the menu can be made vegetarian which is pretty great when you are in a hurry.  This location seems to be about the same as the rest. I'm not sure I can bring myself to give them 4 stars, but the food is what you would expect from the TB nothing life changing, but consistent.  The staff at this location are younger people as are most fast food places who always seem pretty cheerful.  I usually go through the drive-thru and they are always very polite and pretty quick.  Not lightening speed or anything, but I have never driven by because there were a few people in line ahead of me.\n\nSo basically they have very nice staff running the drive-thru so if you want some TB then this is a good one."
3,"I wrote this review in Fairfax. As a local and former Detroiter, I was excited to get a little taste of \""home\"".  Valet is only open to hotel guests and the parking garage is a joke.  The first 7 floors are reserved for valet?!?!?  Then you drive up and up and up only to have the garage just end with no logical way out.  Went there specifically to eat at American Coney Island.  It was OK, but they are kind of chinzy on the chili for their coneys.  Some Vernors would have sealed this as a Detroit coney island.  Walked around the casino, but thought the dancing table girls were tacky and the music was ridiculously loud.  Nice try, poor execution"
3,"I wrote this review in Saudi Arabia. Ok, I am not going to talk about the service too much because I think It's a cultural issue. their wait service is NOT friendly at all. The waitress and waiter do not know how to smile.\n\nHowever, I have to say that the service never detracts us from going there. The reason is the food is so good. If you are there during there lunch special, try the shredded pork pan fried noodles order it \""Hong Kong Style\""\n\nOur second favorite dish is the salt and pepper shrimps with the head on. Some people find eating the head weird, but it is so rich.\n\nThe third dish to try is the salt fish and chicken fried rice. Salty but really good. I know this is not the typical \""American ordering Chinese food\"" (i.e. General Cho's Chicken and Shrimp fried rice) type of order but trust me These are the best things on the menu."
3,"I wrote this review in Suriname. I wouldn't call this a \""reflexology\"" treatment, but more of an Asian foot massage business, similar to nail salons. The atmosphere is very nice, room is dark with comfortable massage chairs. They start by soaking your feet in warm water and massaging your face, head and arms. It's best if you wear shorts and a tshirt. Then they rub your feet for about 30 minutes, and end with a hot towel to wipe off any access lotion. \n\nI have had reflexology before and would not consider this reflexology. It's a nice foot rub for the $25 price, and the automated massage chairs are the best ones I have ever been in. There is a no cell phone policy but I would have liked a no talking policy too. I was very relaxed until a man and woman came in and started talking non stop. It was annoying. \n\nThey charge $35 for an hour but M-Th it's $10 off. The actual foot massage was about 30 minutes. I have been to these places before and expected a little better/firmer massage and am used to a long neck/shoulder massage which I didn't get. It was very clean and staff was very nice. I will go back until I find something that offers a little more massage."
3,"I wrote this review in Benin (Dahomey). Just okay.  Service was good.  Beer was cold.  I'd prefer a good IPA though, which they didn't have.  \n\nFood was just average.  Standard chicken wings.  Sandwich bread was a little stale, fries not very crisp.  Ho hum.  \n\nNice decor inside, and lots of televisions, so it's a good spot for a beer and a ballgame.  Wood smoke from the pizza oven creates a great aroma, so maybe a pizza is the way to go next time."
3,"I wrote this review in United Arab Emirates. A small family owned business that I frequent often,  they have excellent pastries and bread!  It would be nice if they expanded on spices and sauces and some other traditional items. \n\nWord of caution:  I don't know if it a supply and demand issue but the shelves are often very empty...so don't go at the last minute as you may not find what you ate looking for. \n\nBe sure to get a slice of apple strudel!"
3,"I wrote this review in Lesotho. Five stars for bringing, not only to Phoenix, but DOWNTOWN Phoenix a list of indie blogger favorites like CYHSY, Besnard Lakes, Ra Ra Riot, Enon, etc etc et al, but without a liquor license, how can one to expect really blow it out?  A gross loss of two stars, particularly when the crowd is awkwardly intimate with the band and not a drop of alcohol to enhance the atmoshere?  Sorry, but most indie-kids are gawky and afraid to let-it-out, which makes me really regret when a band is scheduled for Modified.  Please beleive it kinda stings to say that, but this joint could be SOOO much cooler."
3,I wrote this review in Beijing. I had lunch at this restaurant.  The roast beef sandwich was good.  The other people at my table had the Thai salad and they really enjoyed that.  It was huge.  Another person in the group had the Mahi and liked it.  The staff was attentive and nice.  I recommend that you check it out.  It was not cheap though.
3,"I wrote this review in Rwanda. I have been to Sapporo many times over the ten years I have lived in phoenix. The atmosphere is still excellent but, during my recent visit i noted a few changes in the food menu and service - My sushi came out very quickly - was it pre-prepared and not as fresh as it has been in the past? possibly..Also there was some confusion from the waitstaff about our order..My drink was also a bit weak however the manager did check on us to ensure we were being taken care of - So it seems that Sapporo is likely cutting costs just like everyone in this economy..Still a good place with great surroundings but definitely different from some of my original experiences."
3,"I wrote this review in Copenhagen. This is a cool spot.  Lots of art work and giant tvs occupy the main bar.  Upstairs they have pool tables, aracde and skee-ball machines.  There is an outdoor patio too (the smokers love it!)  Noda folks love to gather here Sundays to watch the game.  \n\nThey don't have any food I think but we noticed Sunday while we were here that they had a chicken wing buffet?  Looked like it was free - folks were just helping themselves.\n\nThe offer local beer - love it!  And there is street parking and parking behind the building.  Another great stop on a Noda beer crawl!"
3,"I wrote this review in Bogotá. I came here when it was Belz, but I see it's been all made-over like? Oh. Well.... Fine. Have it your way then, Belz. \n\nThis place is (was?) ok, deals are to be had. It's not like one of those malls where you're like \""uhh, isn't this meant to be an outlet? where the deals at?\"", it's legit deal-filled.\n\nHowever I do think Belz is a more memorable name. So I'm going to call it Belz."
3,"I wrote this review in Boston. Tried the Hula burger and was super disappointed.  It was basically a raw pre-formed patty without any seasoning on it with special sauce, onions, etc.  Not blown away.\n\nTheir coconut shrimp rolls are pretty good and their sweet potato fries are done well too.  Would not recommend the burger."
3,I wrote this review in Israel. Great service from Christian. The truth is sometimes I just want good old WT food. The food is greasy and good. To many people want to rate places by comparing them to one of the best steakhouses. I try to rate it for what it is. It's a good place to go for some good greasy food. I enjoyed everything I had there!
3,I wrote this review in Hamburg. Personally when I ate here my experience was as it is at every chili's I've ever been to.. tasty... reliable.. and incredibly unhealthy. I'm off topic here but how depressing is it that most of their salads have over 1000 calories? Damnit you can't even try to eat healthy here.

3,"I wrote this review in Los Angeles. I've been here a half dozen times or so, mostly because it's pretty inexpensive.  If you're looking to fill up after a long day of pressing the slot machine \""spin\"" button, you should probably give it a shot.  The champagne brunch is worth the price, and the servers I've had have all been fast and generous with the mimosas.  \n\nThere's probably not a single item on the buffet that you'll \""need\"" to go back for, but as far as overall value for your dollar, it's hard to beat.  \n\nI'll go back.  More than once."
3,"I wrote this review in Armenia. I've wanted to try this place for a long time now, every time I go to Vegas I see it and the building draws me towards it. Finally got to try it during my last trip out there. \nThe wait was ridiculous for inside seating (2 hours +) so we decided to grab some food inside of the Ceasar's food court then later go back to their outside window to order some frozen hot chocolates. \nThe line was pretty long still for the outside and we figured out why when we got up to the window FINALLY.. the guy who was working was all by himself struggling to juggle everything all at once, poor guy.\nWe had 7 girls so we shared two large frozen hot chocolates which are made for two people but it was just enough, just get extra straws if you're going to do so. It was really good but truthfully tasted like a typical chocolate milkshake but more chocolate flavorings which was good, I also actually liked the grittiness from the mixture.\nIt was good to try but not worth the $8.00"
3,"I wrote this review in Mali. Decidedly average. Then again just about anything within the \""Westgate Triangle\""  seems to fit that.  E.g you eat there because you are there for some other event.   \n\nEl Paso bbq schools them on the beans, ribs and sauce and for roughly the same per person cost.  I believe Famous Dave's , least the one in Yuma beats them handily, as does Honey bears, as does RUB bbq etc. \n\n Not that Shane's is  bad it's just there's nothing that stands out.You order on the way in, busy, noisy and hard to wrangle a toddler when the in/ out and ordering location are in the same place.  Food arrives reasonably quickly but plastic utensils and ribs do not mix, let's not even try :)  I want to give it 2.5 because there's just too many places I'd drive for this kind of meal for the same price in nice surroundings. \n\nI miss Shoney's back in Ga , heck I miss most of the rib places I frequented in GA but alas the furthest west they've gotten is New Mexico."
3,"I wrote this review in Guangzhou. We came down to the buffet since it was the closest place to get some breakfast food on a Sunday morning. It was pretty good for taking the elevator down and have a choice of just about any kind of food you want. I don't think you can expect lobster and crab at 11:00am in the morning, but you will get some things like prime rib and other nice cuts of meat. \n\nIf you're not gambling then you're probably going to pay full price at like $25 or more. Coming from Chicago this is a pretty steep price. You're only in Vegas so much, so why not right? I would probably go back here again if I could eat twice as much or if I had a huge amount of comps. If you got money to blow, you're really hungry and don't want to go far from the hotel, then you can get away with eating here and being happy about it."
3,"I wrote this review in Zurich. We've never been to this location, and overall, it was fine. They were busy at 11:00 on a Sunday, but we got seated within 10 minutes, just as they had predicted. Service was fine, but not stellar. The coffee was a tad harsh, and I had to ask for water.  \n\nOur breakfasts were OK: I had the Trifecta, the idea of which I wish I would see more often on menus. It was a Belgian waffle, 2 eggs, and 2 pieces of bacon or sausage. My bacon was pretty over-done, and my over-easy eggs were slightly under-done. Think of me what you will for the next comment, but the cooks at Cracker Barrel *always* get the eggs and bacon right. The waffle was neither the best nor the worst I have ever had. Hubby had the bacon and avocado omelette, which he liked well enough. He was glad for the salsa, which he said made the dull potatoes more palatable.\n\nI don't think we'd ever make this First Watch a destination breakfast, but if we find ourselves hungry at the Promenade again, we might give it another chance."
3,"I wrote this review in Hanoi. This is a college bar, if you are looking for something quiet, go else where, if you are looking for something super clean and nice, go else where. If however you are looking for a fun, somewhat divey bar with awesome amounts of greasy fried food, you have found heaven. The prices are great, the amount of food you get is great, and if you looking for a good time this place is great.\n\nWhat I would recommend:\nCheese Curds - no self respecting Wisconsin bar can mess this up but holy crap these were good curds.\nThe Curd Burger - I had trouble moving after this but soooo worth it. A cheese burger with cheese curds and onion rings on it, what more could you ask for?\nThe Brats - both white and red, or both, they are great, brats is in the name of the bar for a reason."
3,"I wrote this review in San Marino. I had dinner here at the end of a long week of conference meetings. Compared to the fast food, food court, and hotel fare I'd eaten throughout the week before, this was a fabulous meal. Compared to any Tex-Mex restaurant in Texas, however, this was pretty bleh. So, for travelers that know good Mexican or Tex-Mex food, you may be disappointed with the flavors here--but given your few eating options in Phoenix, I'd definitely recommend it.\n\nPrimary food gripes: the salsa was smoky tasting and so dark as to almost look black. The carnitas in my chimichanga were dry and burnt. Little spice or flavor to the overall dish.\n\nPositives: Their top shelf margarita was excellent. Just excellent. Also, one of my fellow diners loved the stuffed chicken dish. \n\nService-related: Attentive, friendly service, if a little overly so. Weak or no A/C on in the restaurant while we ate. In June. Not awesome."
3,"I wrote this review in Niger. I would love to give this place 4 stars, the atmosphere and service was very good. I got the chicken skewers with peanut butter sauce as an appetizer, and the pad thai for dinner and both were delicious, I would also highly recommend the thai tea it's iced tea with a sweet cream in it. My Boyfriend got the Pepper steak and it was bland and watery, thus the 3 stars. Great little restaurant, but don't get the pepper steak."
3,"I wrote this review in Burkina Faso (Upper Volta). We went to Heart Attack Grill for pure gluttony and it delivered. I expected it to be all gimmick, but I was pleasantly surprised that I did in fact enjoy the burger and fries. \n\nI only had the single bypass, but others had the triple with bacon. Bun to meat ratio is quite good on the single. Great cheese and carmelized onions. My only complaint is that you have no choice on the temperature, all burgers are well done. I've had better burgers elsewhere, but I'd never request one well done. Considering its how this one comes it's pretty good. The bacon is very good if you choose to get it. Fries remind me of those I got as a kid. I prefer crisp and fluffy on the inside, but while these are a bit limp they have great flavor. I didn't have the shake, but a friend did. It was so filling he only finished half and had no room for his burger. It's thick like custard and the pat of butter is just a square that can easily be taken off. \n\nI expected my visit to be a one time deal, but I would return. Note that it is cash only. A single bypass with bacon and fries will cost less than eleven bucks. Don't forget a drink and tip.\n\nCome with a big appetite and sense of humor. I doubt you'll be disappointed."
3,I wrote this review in Armenia. Totally bummed to find out (once we got our bill) that this can no longer be the place we call home for our select happy-hour Friday night out. \n\nBeware that they have changed the rules to their happy hour.. Imports and select martinis got taken off the list.\n\nWould really have been nice to know this before we ordered a few of each. Yikes... $$$. :-/
3,"I wrote this review in Hamburg. SO much better now that they have changed the entrance. The girls line used to make you hike up 5 stories of industrial parking garage-esque stairs only to make you hike up another 2 floors to the main dance floor. Now, they just make you take a random guest elevator to a random floor where you have to navigate through a freaking pool-side concert and up another flight of stairs to the promised land. So yay. \n\nI still hate the tiny dance floor that they close off access to, and the inability to even see the dance floor when the place gets crowded. If you want any room to stand and breathe, you have to go outside, which is quite suboptimal in the winter. \n\nThus it is OBVIOUS that the same lunatics who designed TAO designed this place as well. No flow, no ambiance, no comfortable partying to be had. Back to XS it is!"
3,"I wrote this review in Pakistan. It's ok.  I think they survive more on presentation, big portions, and name recognition than actual taste of food.  There are a bunch of better breakfast/brunch options in Vegas in my experience."
3,"I wrote this review in Zurich. Food always takes a long time to get served. The only things I order when I come here are hot & sour soup, lettuce wraps & Kung Pao scallops. Last time I tried couple different dishes & they weren't very good such as shrimps in lobster sauce. So I better stick to what I like. Lol! I also like that kids have healthy choices rather than just chicken fingers, mac & cheese, etc. at most of the restaurants."
3,I wrote this review in Cape Town. Nice place to eat on the cheap.  You'll get full or drunk off of what they have to offer for sure.  I believe they still provide free donuts and coffee for gamers in the early mornings.  This place is really old but why not try your luck?
3,"I wrote this review in Frankfurt. Not having had any Asian Buffet for a long two days, I whipped in here for lunch today.  Welcome to the place Yelp calls \""E-Z Buffet\"", but the owners call, alternatively, \""EZ Buffet\"", \""EZ Chinese Buffet\"", & \""Easy Buffet\"" depending upon which sign or printed matter of theirs you are viewing!  In any event, here goes:\n\nThis medium-large place was offering up 75 main food items today, featuring such strictly Chinese dishes as Clam Chowder, beef roast, Stuffed Bell Peppers, Calzone, pizza, & pink marshmallows!  Who knew???     :-)\n\nOk, this somewhat stylish, comfortable place with a friendly staff was also serving many of the usual Chinese treats including Sushi (Whoops, that's Japanese!), Kim Chee (Whoops, that's Korean!), Egg Foo Young (there!  ... & made the real way), & lots of what we usually see including fried chicken, boneless spare ribs, stuffed mushrooms, more chicken fixed all different ways, fish, shrimp, & so on, ending up with a good selection of desserts including tasty, REAL ice cream.\n\nIt's a high 3 Stars for this nice restaurant where the Lunch Buffet is $6.75/$6.08 Sr. on Monday through Saturday, $8.75/$7.88 Sunday, & they also offer a regular menu.     :-)"
3,"I wrote this review in Bogotá. We found out about Nothing Bundt Cakes as a friend had brought bundtinis to a party. We've since gone back & gotten quite a few different bundtlets. My favorites have been the lemon & red velvet ... I've also tried the chocolate chocolate chip, white chocolate raspberry, & marble which have been good. I'd say that for the size & price of the bundtlet, it's worth it. Like their Facebook page and/or sign up for newsletter as they send out an offer for buy 1 get 1 free bundtlets pretty often!"
3,I wrote this review in United Kingdom. Nice hotel! I like to stay here all the time. Eventho they have no cirque du soleil shows and it's preety boring here beside.\nThe parties at the marquee are preety annoying and the drunk people control the hotel.
3,"I wrote this review in Lima. My friend and I had dinner here during our vegas trip, she warned me that this place is known for its \""rudeness\"" to customers. I have a good sense of humor so I said why not. To be honest, our waitress did not really give us as much trouble as she gave the other tables. We were pretty much left alone. She came to our table 3 times in total. Didn't even get those embarrassing hats that everyone else seemed to be wearing. I overheard the treatment everyone else got and it was hilarious. Only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the prices for food. They are ridiculous. The cheapest thing there was the mac and cheese which is what I ended up having. I wouldn't come here to eat again but I would come back to have a drink. It's a funny place if you have the sense of humor for it. If you are easily offended, don't come here."
3,"I wrote this review in Solomon Islands. The white pizza is the best thing on the menu besides the sicilian chopped salad (without olives yuck!!). I typically go for lunch, the slices are hit or miss.. sometimes better than others, sometimes over cooked more than other times. Service is spotty... two times I asked for no olives, had olives both times... another visit ordered garlic knots and never received... still keep going back for the white pizza. Ordered out and had delivered last weekend cheese pizza/pepperoni and it was really good. I have not tried any non-pizza items yet besdies the salad."
3,"I wrote this review in Cyprus. I had dinner here tonight with an old friend, found the place on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  While it wasn't bad, it could have been a lot better.  They were doing work on a partition (hammers and drills), and the air conditioning was off.  \n\nMy hummus was bland, although my chicken and steak kebabs were flavorful, the baba genouche was about as bland as the hummus.\n\nThe best thing was the Moroccoan Mint Tea!  It was delicious!"
3,"I wrote this review in Nicaragua. I've been going to hair pollution or about a year now and I like it, but I don't love it--i think it's probably time for me to move on. i love the atmosphere and most of the stylists are super-friendly. I love julia she reminds me of one of my best friends from home which is probably why i've continued going there as long as I have. \n\ni got a last minute appointment with megan after many weeks of out-growth and really stubby un-cute ponytails. julia was out in NYC being schooled on the world of bumble & bumble, which the salon is now exclusively using since june (which I think may have bumped up their prices because my cut was 50% higher than usual. that's fifty.) Megan was very friendly and easy to talk to, but i felt the cut was less meticulous than i have previously received at the salon and I ended up re-straightening my hair when i got home before i left to class.\n\n I think i like the cut, but styling was a little more soccer mom (which really surprised me) than funky, fun, 21 year old which I like to think is more me! I would say my main reason i will probably start going elsewhere is I keep waiting to walk out of the salon, feeling awesome & sexy, but I've never had that moment here, so I'm going to keep searching."
3,"I wrote this review in Accra. The lettuce wraps alone would be a 10 star review. Unfortunately when it comes to Pei Wei, I've yet to really have anything else at any location that's blown me away. Wei Pei is about as standard as Americanized Asian food gets. It's just prepared here in quicker manner than full service chain restaurants, and usually in a better manner than fast food Asian restaurants. \n\nI went because my girlfriend had a craving for the lettuce wraps. While a few better places have similar wraps to Pei Wei and PF Chang's, I'll give these two chains credit for having the best. We jokingly said before ordering our meal that we should just have gone with two orders of the wraps. Ironically enough, we were right. We also Order Chicken Lo Mein. When I took the first taste, I was shocked to taste pretty much nothing. When my girlfriend took a bite, she realized it was sauceless. She then asked one of the \""servers\"" (I don't know a better term for guy who brings food you ordered from counter to table and cleans off plates but didn't take your order) for some. We tossed it into the noodles and it made a big difference, but it still was a rather plain and boring version of a popular Chinese dish."
3,"I wrote this review in Kiribati. What is the deal here? A basic burger and fries, it was fine, not great. But based on their hype, it needs to be MUCH better. Or cheaper. Or whatever... get over it."
3,"I wrote this review in South Africa. Pretty good, not the best but very far from bad. Haven't been disappointed yet and we eat here about once a week. The Thai basil is really good as well as the steak salad."
3,"I wrote this review in Finland. We came to phat phranks for some Mexican food, more like a 3.5 star restaurant. We ordered the huevos rancheros, breakfast burrito and some flautas. The huevos rancheros came with either red or green sauce, I picked green because it has pork in the sauce. The dish was really greasy for my taste, the beans, eggs and the fried chips were swimming in grease. It wasn't a traditional huevos rancheros. The fried potatoes were delicious And the dish was okay, just too greasy. The flautas were crispy and tasty with fresh guacamole. The service was good.\n\nI had to give it 3.5 stars due to the greasy meal and also, we were charged for tap water. I'm not sure if that is a Vegas thing, but it was a bit unusual for me to see that."
3,"I wrote this review in Czechia. While UIUC seems to have plenty of chinese take out joints and pizzerias along Green Street, there is a surprisingly small concentration of restaurants that specialize in true Chicago-style hot dogs.\n\nSadly though, the Hot Dogs are just ok. While the hot dog itself was a typical vienna beef sausage that I am used to, the condiments were second rate. Especially the onions, which are grilled rather than raw. Maybe it's just a personal preference, but eating a hot dog with grilled onions just isn't the same.\n\nThe fresh cut french fries, however, were outstanding, and thankfully they come free with everything, making this place a good pick if you are looking for an incredibly cheap meal."
3,"I wrote this review in Mexico City. Maybe I enjoyed myself because my expectations were lower than others? Staff was friendly to us, all the standard hookup stuff worked fine  and they had a decent pool and dog park. \n\nCircus circus is a dump casino, but I don't remember them trying to be anything else. Do you really expect the Wynn to have RV's? They wouldn't be caught dead, so be thankful they have this place, take a taxi to a better casino....ingenious. \n\nEh maybe that's just me. I'd stay here again."
3,I wrote this review in Melbourne. I had the frozen hot chocolate to go. The wait was long but the hot chocolate was good enough that I would have it again. Don't really think it's worth the $9 they charge for a small but what are you going to do!\n\nI'm glad I finally got to try it after seeing it on one of Oprah's favorite things. Next time I'll have to try their food.
3,"I wrote this review in Bangladesh. I love this airport... whether your arriving or departing, you move quickly.  I love how well organized parking and taxi/shuttle service is.... the taxi lines move quick.  Tons of shops, food, and slots to pass the time. Free wi-fi is a PLUS!"
3,"I wrote this review in Beijing. Juicy Pho off the strip\n\nThis place is pretty good for Vegas Pho. Vegas Pho is not the same as SGV Pho. \n\nOrdered the pork chop rice. It wasn't that good and the amount of pork chop there was very small.\n\nAte some of  my friend's korean bbq ribs, it was pretty good. \n\nAte some of my friend's Pho, it was decent. \n\nWhat was really good was the Egg Roll wrapped with lettuce. It was delicious!!!!\n\nKinda far from the strip, was driving at least 10-15 mins to get here."
3,"I wrote this review in Malta. Ehhh.  If you're coming from the Bay Area or LA, this place can't compare to some of the dim sum establishments there.  Place serves dim sum all day, but there wasn't much variety going around the carts when we were there.  We really wanted some Shanghai Dumplings and was told it was coming each time we asked.  Finally, we flagged down one of the waitresses to ask about it and she told us it would be 15-20 minutes for them to make it.  It was never really coming at all!\n\nShiu Mai, har gow, bean curd skin, chow fun, baked buns, steamed buns, gai lan, etc.  were all decent though a bit small compared to standard.  Not a bad place overall.  It's a bit away from the strip."
3,"I wrote this review in Georgia. Decent service, good food. However I have to admit seeing all this dust everywhere throughout the restaurant especially on my booth was pretty gross. I'm amazed how this went unnoticed. I took it upon myself to leave a little note. The server saw me and the dust and commented \""hahaha yeah there's a lot of dust here.\"" Wooooooow really?"
3,I wrote this review in Grenada. Breakfast is very good especially the Skillets and since they put misters outside on the patio breakfast outside is superb.
3,"I wrote this review in Sweden. Still a solid three stars from me, which again needs to be put into context of what I enjoy from a bar and a night out. It's a proper pub-bar with a cheeky Australian theme. Postcards of boobs and bums above the bar, a sign saying \""dickhead\"" pointing to an empty space where an unsuspecting punter will stand, slightly sticky and dusty. Reminds me of a slightly better kept student union.\n\nBut the crowd are friendly, the bar staff fare no-nonsense friendly. There's one side of the bar that has a big sign saying NO SERVICE do not stand here. If you stand there, they'll be upset. If you don't, they'll be a-ok.\n\nThere's two pool tables though, and for me that's a total winner. Just take note of the method of getting a game (adding your name to the chalk board list). The players are friendly and just adding your name up means you'll probably get chatting to some interesting folk.\n\nStandard drinks (as in, no cocktails) for a bar. Good wee location. Inundated with Australians on Australia Day. Not too shabby."
3,"I wrote this review in Detroit. if you're into heavy, rich food, Cowboy Ciao is your place.  i wasn't thoroughly impressed with the food, but the service is good.  very welcoming hostess, if i do say so myself.\n\nhonestly, i'd rather walk around the corner to fnb - it's way better."
3,"I wrote this review in Japan. I am just looking to my right... as I write and I just saw \""better that Roscoes\""... Not a chance...  But is good no doubt.  The problem is the chicken.  The chicken at Roscoe's is what one would describe as an addictive experience.  It's Crack... Once you have it you can quit.\n\nBack to Lolo's.  Nice place.  An improvement over Roscoe's in terms of the place.  Very colorful and big jars of Kool-Aid.  The chicken and the waffles are good... That is if You have never been in LA and had roscoes.\n\nThe breading of the chicken is dry and different.  The waffles and the syrup are great.  Need to improve the chicken thing.  I sure will be back as is definitely better than some fast food chicken but it ain't no roscoe's.\n\nOk in case you are wondering about Roscoe's.\n\nhttp://www.mixiaosblock.com/twin_cities_lunch/thats_some_darn_good_chicke.html"
3,"I wrote this review in Fairfax. Older theater. Needs updating. However, the tickets are $1 cheaper, so I think they take that into account. There are definitely better options but if you want to save a few bucks, it's not horrible. And it's not busy which is a plus."
3,"I wrote this review in Cairo. this place has some serious potentional. the tv's are set up perfect including in the bathrooms. i would definitely give this place 5 stars if they had higher quality food and more selection of beers on tap and liquors. i've tried getting crown royal cask no 16, jack daniels honey, kracken, captain morgan private stock, jack daniels single barrel but they don't any of them. half moon hello!!!! not everyone wants to drink bottom shelf or bottom of the barrel liquor. please fix these 2 problem so i can give another review and it be 5-stars"
3,"I wrote this review in Paris. I give it three stars, because while the gelato I had was delicious, it was really expensive (too expensive for what it was) Alas, it's Vegas, but still."
3,"I wrote this review in Phoenix. Not all tacos are created the same...and for this visit, I was all about the carne asada nachos. Definitely a treat"
3,I wrote this review in Belgium. This Dillard's location is just okay. I have purchased a few dresses and tops from this location over the last couple of months and every time I have been in my experience has only been so so. The sales associates in the women's dress department can be either too pushy or completely non existent but not a good balance of one or the other. I have had a little bit of a better experience in the accessories department and the associates in that department seem to be more interested in what you are looking for and how to help rather than just making a sale. I also had an issue recently with needing to return an item that was in perfect condition with tags attached but it had been just a few days over the return policy limit. The manager was able to give me a store credit which I appreciated because I knew I was over the limit of the return policy. Overall this store is just okay. I will be back because I like their selection of dresses and tops but I am still waiting for that wow customer service experience that I think you should get no matter where you are shopping.
3,"I wrote this review in Latvia. I am a big fan of the Aloft chain and the room and lobby were identical to the ones I have stayed in before. However, this hotel is very close to a busy freeway and my room was facing it. I heard the traffic all night. I could also hear the drive through speaker from the In & Out right across the parking lot. Still, I'd recommend to my fellow yelpers to stay here BUT request a room facing AWAY from the freeway or bring earplugs.\n\nThis hotel was very convenient for my recruiting trip to ASU and is an easy drive to Ikea and airport."
3,"I wrote this review in Sao Tome and Principe. Wasn't the best buffet. The shimp tasted like rubber, the Chinese food was overly salty, the sushi was tasteless . The crab legs were really small. Nothing like the king crab that were in the other pictures. Only thing good was the deserts, prime rib and open bar. Very pricey $30."
3,"I wrote this review in Moscow. Mall pizza at Las Vegas prices.  It was fast - and that was our goal, so on that account it met our expectations.  It wasn't bad pizza, but it wasn't great either."
3,"I wrote this review in Bulgaria. I went to enso for lunch the other day with one other person. The ginger salad was just like you would expect. The sushi really pretty but tasted just like typical sushi. The spider roll was awesome. As for atmosphere, it's way too dark inside and it's super swanky. The place is run by Americans and there is nothing authentic about it. We ended up spending $100 without any alcohol. It's pretty good but not worth the price. Head to New Zealand cafe for better sushi for half the price."
3,"I wrote this review in Netherlands. Solid variety of options, on the pricey side. We had sushi, chicken lettuce wraps, and a shrimp noodle dish. The food was good, but not quite authentic the way pan-asian places often are."
3,"I wrote this review in Guangzhou. There was nobody in this joint when we got there which kinda threw us off but we were looking for a low key place to just chill anyway so seemed perfect. \n\nWe had already went out to eat before and just wanted a little something to nibble on so got the calamari, which were really good. Not too chewy, light batter. They have a pretty good drink menu and the music is nice and relaxing. Definitely a chill vibe going on. The waitress didn`t seem too happy to be there though at first. She was kind of dragging her feet. She seemed alright as time progressed.\n\nWhen we called for the cheque, this is where it went downhill. Another waitress came to bring it to us and totally mixed all our drinks together. It was only 2 bills, not sure how it can get so messed up. The 2nd time around, they still got it wrong. It seemed to take forever to correct it. She just ended up not charging me for one of my drinks. \n\nHow can a place so relaxing end up being so stressful in the end!!"
3,"I wrote this review in Los Angeles. Come here if you need a bit of southern flavor in the midst of all that is \""sin city.\""\n\nVENUE: Located inside treasure island hotel and opened SUPER late. So if you're not done partying and have gotten kicked out of every other place, this is a pretty good consolation prize. They play country music so if you like two-stepping and line dancing, come here. There's also a mechanical bull that you're able to try and ride if you've got the courage.  But watch out for, or just watch, the hot blond cowgirl. She'll put everyone to shame when riding the bull. Dance floor is pretty big and the place is relatively clean.\n\nFOOD: I did not have the pleasure of trying their food since the kitchen had closed by that point.\n\nSERVICE: Bartenders were funny and helpful. Drinks came out pretty quickly but because it wasn't that crowded that may have helped. The demographic of people that were there were a bit older than my group - maybe in their late 30s to 40s? Some were way over that. But regardless we had a lot of fun and most of us are huge country fans."
3,"I wrote this review in Fiji. What a hidden treasure.  Tucked away in corner strip center at 19th Ave. and TBird next to high school we found a new sushi and japanese restaurant.  Very small but comfy.  Booths, tables and sushi bar.  Looks like it's run by the owners - an old couple.  We ordered the bento box specials for lunch today.  $6.95 = choice of soup + egg roll + tempura veggies, + 1/2 a California roll, + white rice and a choice of several entrees.  Bro picked General Tao Chicken.  I picked Mongolian Beef.  Both were great.  We'll be back for bento boxes and to try the real sushi and sashimi.  Spread the word - they need business."
3,"I wrote this review in Melbourne. This location is between my house and my parents' house so I'm a frequent visitor. Between my 2 girls and I, the drink orders can be quite challenging and this location is sort of hit or miss. The ever changing staff could be the culprit, but nonetheless the convenience of the location still draws me in. The lines tend to get long during the morning commute, yet they seem to move people through pretty quickly. On the occasion that I've had to send drinks back, they have been very apologetic and cooperative."
3,"I wrote this review in Detroit. Location is everything. \n\nLocated on my usual stumble home, Pizza Extreme is quickly becoming my 3 AM stop of choice.  Bring a couple of friends, randomly select 5 items (ranging from chicken drummies to pizza of decent quality), and head home to play some Tekken.  If you're a couple 7&7's into your night, you will not be disappointed."
3,I wrote this review in Burkina Faso (Upper Volta). I am not the biggest fan of fast food ever. But I really like Five Guys and this location is superb! \n\nThey have really yummy fries and they give you so many! Like your bag overflows with the greasy buggers. Say what? Yeah they are really greasy. But good!\n\nThe burgers are really quite the bang for your buck too! Not the best burgers in the world but it is fast food not gourmet burgers. Be considerate for what you are eating and enjoy it for what it is. \n\nThe pop machines are radical. You can pretty much have flavoured any beverage you like. \n\nThe staff here is really friendly and that is a plus anywhere you go!
3,I wrote this review in Italy. Before they switched to this new owner they were a lot better.. The foods OK.  Nothing to get all excited over.
4,"I wrote this review in Peru. What can I say.. this place is awesomeness wrapped up inside even more awesomeness.  I'm the kind of guy that's always looking for a fairly low key place with great food at a decent price.  And surprisingly this place is it if you like seafood.  I ate here today and had the Bouillabaisse - a type of seafood stew and it was EXCELLENT.  Sweet pieces of roughy, scallops, shrimp, clams, and muscles, all stewed to perfection in a savory broth served with rice on the side.  The chef exclaimed that they usually have asakan king crab and other exotic seafood but he compensated by giving me more scallops. \n\nThe food is cooked inside special steam pans that ensure that the food is just right!  The chefs know their stuff, and the prices are right!  (you can eat a great meal for $10 here... but the boullibase was closer to $18).\n\nIf you like seafood... be sure to check this place out.  Don't be fooled by the fact that the Orleans isn't on the strip.... its considered a local casino and its not bad at all."
4,"I wrote this review in Bahrain. Really, really, really good coffee. It had to be one of the best lattes I have had in a long time. Their muffins, especially the raspberry chocolate chip one, are to die for. I wouldn't have known the muffins are vegan unless I was told. I only wish this cafe was closer to my home."
4,"I wrote this review in Chile. I've been here quite a few times, and let me give you the tl;dr about the place.\n\nThe traditional hotdog, with a bunch of different stuff on top of it. I'm a hotdog lover and I've tried every single regular dog on the menu -- and I like it most of the time. Except that it's just that odd time when something comes out a bit strange or not quite right that makes me dock one star."
4,"I wrote this review in Melbourne. I frequent often especially with out of town guests- since the outside seating is excellent for people watching as well as the Bellagio watershow. \nFood is fairly priced (in the 20s for steak, salmon, etc). I really enjoyed the escargot and my friend loved the baked goat cheese appetizer. Good place over all."
4,"I wrote this review in Luxembourg. After reading Brian's review of this place, it makes me want to go back and try a burger. \n\nPredictably, I stuck with my instinct when I went to U.S. Egg and got . . . eggs. I know, I know. Not very original. But, for the record, it was the Eggs Benedict, actually. And they hit the spot. \n\nThe setup was Denny's-esque and we almost felt like we were in a cubicle as we ate breakfast. So, that wasn't good. Our server was friendly but it looked like her section had atleast twelve tables in it and it was busy so she barely had time to breathe. \n\nThe breakfast was tasty, despite the bleak setup, and it worked effectively as a good hangover buster on that weekend morning. I'll be back in there sometime soon, I'm sure."
4,"I wrote this review in Amsterdam. HAZE is the business!\n\nDon't partake without a table. This is rule of thumb for any club in Vegas, but especially true here at Haze as it is small and compact, size-wise.\n\nThe music here is SICK! Thursday nights are the best, it's industry night. If you're off on a Friday or in town on Thursday night, look no further than Haze.\n\nThe lights are amazing here and if you partake in other substances, you'll thoroughly appreciate the visuals provided to you here.\n\nThere are very talented go-go dancers/ models here. Their costumes are extravagant. \n\nHaze is like a mini rave and the PLUR vibes can be felt."
4,"I wrote this review in Nepal. I remember coming here when it was New York New York, the vibe is just as great. The patio makes 5801 perfect spot for late night drinks on a gorgeous summer night.\n\nThe bartenders are wonderful and so are the patrons. I have yet to make it out for bingo but it's definitely on my to do list!"
4,"I wrote this review in Atlanta. If you've read a few of my reviews you would know that I don't frequent or recommend many franchise restaurants. But Texas Roadhouse is one of the few. I've probably been to 8 different locations in 5 different states and the service has always been good, the steak cooked the way I ordered and the value excellent. And this location is no exception. Our server was great, food was tasty and well prepared and the call ahead seating made our wait, oh, about a minute!"
4,"I wrote this review in Bangladesh. Great place for our Saturday brunch. Our party of 10 got seated promptly. We sat by the window and a partial view of the pool area and tropical trees, which was nice.\n\nEveryone enjoyed their meal. My sister and I shared the Filet Benedict. They split it for us, which was cool. I also enjoyed the their Bloody Mary. One of the girls ordreded the Exotic Coconut Pancakes that included a mini coconut and mango butter. It was the right amount of sweetness. Very yummy!\n\nGreat place for a low-key yet tasteful brunch!"
4,"I wrote this review in Chengdu. I've seen and heard about this place since I've lived on this side of town and have wanted to come here for some time.  I finally made it in yesterday, and it was everything I thought it would be.  Delicious!\n\nThe menu is pretty good, and the prices are great. It kind of has a fresh and healthy feel to it, which is great.  I went with the steak wrap, and my friend went with a chicken wrap.  Staff was friendly and helpful, and overall I really enjoyed it.\n\nI love how they serve the meal in a metal bread tray, and I thought it was super cute.  They had limited drink options, so I stuck with water.  Food was tasty and filling, and overall I really liked it here.  They have free wifi here, so its pretty cool that you can bring your computer, hang out and dine here while relaxing on the patio.  Total bill for two lunches was about $20."
4,I wrote this review in Tajikistan. quaint little italian restaurant near downtown. \nSeating is a little hard for large groups.  But the food is pretty good and priced reasonably.  \n\nI've had the lasagna which was good.\n\nexceeded my expectations...can't judge a book by its cover as they say.
4,"I wrote this review in Warsaw. I'm officially in love with Sol Y Sombra. I wasn't sure if I had room in my heart to love another tapas place, but turns out I'm shameless and can love many at one time. \n\nMy visit to Sol y Sombra was on a beautiful spring evening. Mr. Hottie and I decided to go out on a date. There was a nice breeze so we chose to sit outside. We were greeted by a server that was QUITE enthusiastic almost to the point of annoyance, but hey he was friendly and attentive. \n\nWe looked over the menu and I suggested that we order every single item on it. I was reigned in and made to pick out 6 dishes. We ordered the: \n*Tortilla Espanola -amazing, I could have devoured the whole slice by myself. \n*Brussels sprouts- I didn't like them. For some reason the cook must have gone crazy with the lemon. We sent them back. \n*Chilled Asparagus w/Romanesco sauce- YUM! Big thick spears of asparagus covered with a creamy red sauce. \n*Gambas a la plancha- LARGE shrimp with a garlic aioli. The shrimp were tender and juicy. Fantastic. \n*Skirt steak ala plancha with romanesco sauce- tender, juicy nice char flavor and more of that glorious sauce. \n\nWe washed it all down with copious amounts of sangria and I was in heaven! \n\nI will CERTAINLY return to Sol y Sombra again! It was a relaxing spot with great food and good service."
4,"I wrote this review in Nairobi. Very friendly staff, both when checking in and again when checking out.  Clean and quiet--except when the door to the outside staircase would slam shut and shake the wall of my room.  If I'd been staying more than one night, I would have been going nutzoid.  But for a quick visit, it was pleasant enough."
4,"I wrote this review in Denmark. Mekong Supermarket is impressively clean and organized.  I could walk through the store without tripping over product containers and without the overwhelming smell of dried shrimp.  I was also impressed with the layout and condition of the live/frozen seafood section.  The frozen case was extremely organized and the product descriptions were visible and easy to read.  The live seafood tanks were full and appeared to be well maintained.  As for the prices, they were very reasonable and lower compared to other markets.  We had specific weight requirements for our seafood so we were a little high maintenance for the staff but they were willing to accommodate to the best of their ability. Our selection for the day was a live lobster, tilapia and catfish. All needed to be no greater than 2lbs which we approximately met with the help of the staff.  Our tilapia and catfish were cleaned and bagged while our lobster traveled live with us over to Asian Caf\u00e9 Express where we had our seafood selection prepared for our meal.  Mekong and ACE have an agreement that allows customers to select their seafood product then ACE will prepare it to a selected style for a small fee. This was a first and enjoyable experience for me. Something I would do again - most definitely."
4,"I wrote this review in Suriname. My Husband & I met some friends for lunch here while we were in town. The wait was about 20 mins, but we were seated on the patio, where there was live music and a beautiful view of Scottsdale & Camelback! I ordered the Market Sunflower salad; blackened chicken, goat chz, bacon, dried strawberry, blueberry, sunflower seeds  & my husband the Smoked Turkey Ciabatta; gouda, bacon,sweet tomato, roasted red pepper aioli. I LOVED my salad, but the hubs was a little less than totally satisfied with his sandwich, however the sweet potato chips were super yummy! I would definitely come back!"

4,"I wrote this review in Denver. 3.5 stars, but they get 4 from me since the grilled chicken was super juicy!\n\nMy friends and I came here around 9:30pm to grab dinner before clubbing. It took about 10 minutes to be seated, which wasn't bad considering it was extremely packed. It took awhile for our food to arrive, so this may not be the place to dine if you are in a hurry to get somewhere.\n\nWe saw how large the portions were, so my friend and I shared the Pasta with Grilled Chicken, Tomato, Basil & Mozzarella. The grilled chicken wasn't dry at all. I was surprised at how juicy it was considering it was white meat! I couldn't finish even though we shared. Definitely kept me full the rest of the night.\n\nYelp reviews said this was the sister restaurant of The Cheesecake Factory, so we kept comparing the two. I think I like this one better! We saw the next table's Shrimp Scampi and that looked absolutely delicious! Dine here if you want good quality and portions for the price!"
4,"I wrote this review in Ghana. This is where I go to drink good craft beer in Charlotte. The bartenders are extremely knowledgeable about their brew and will critique their characteristics with you as if it were a painting. Their taps are constantly revolving with great beer, which always brings pleasant surprises that I otherwise, would never have found. Growlers has that sophisticated neighborhood bar feel. Oh and food is great too! Def check this place out..."
4,"I wrote this review in Spain. Cantina rocks. \n\nYou wouldn't know it from the way it looks outside, but Cantina serves up awesome food and even better drinks from south of the border. It's packed on weekends--usually with a somewhat younger, louder crowd, but it's by no means a fratty place--so make a reservation in advance and prepare to wait a little once you show up, but trust me: it's worth it. \n\nCantina has all you'd expect from a nicer Mexican restaurant, with a lot of the extras. You'll definitely want to order a top-shelf margarita--easily one of the best in Charlotte, if not the best. Try the Kiwi/Strawberry Special if you're up for a change; it's delicious. Good Mexican beers are on tap as well. Drink up. Everyone else is. \n\nAs for the food, I dont know where to begin or end. The chopped tostada salad is to die for if it's lighter fare you're craving. If you want some good 'ol refriend beans and pulled chicken, you won't be disappointed. My favorite? The Kobe beef fajitas. Trust me. Order this. \n\nI'm definitely going back. What I wont do, however, is plan on having a big night afterward. The scene is fun and loud, but you're about as full and tired as you can be when the meal's over. Which is a good thing."
4,"I wrote this review in Morocco. I'd read about Pop's in LV Weekly awhile ago and when the Groupon for this place popped up, we seized the opportunity and ventured over to Decatur to check it out.  I was surprised to discover it was an outdoor establishment with no indoor seating, and wasn't sure what to expect since the place doesn't look like much at first glance. \n\nBut looks can be deceiving, and I was VERY impressed with the food -- everything is made to order, so even though we sat outside in the 60 degree evening to eat our phillies at one of the tables, the food was piping hot.  I liked that they had a few options for cheese since I'm not a cheese whiz fan, so I got provolone instead with peppers and onions and it was delish.  My boyfriend got the same and we shared the crunchy fried green beans with marinara sauce, which were very good.  Portions were pretty big so you definitely get a lot of food for your money.  I'd definitely go here again!"
4,"I wrote this review in Turkmenistan. There is basically three cool blue people, with little emotions.  Basically a night with hard percussion and flashy light show.  Mixed with slapstick skits that makes it fun.  You enjoy it if the interaction of your emotions to connect with the fun of the night, percussion, and soft humor.   \n\nGood show at the Venetian.  The theater is huge and top rate.   For the blue man group, is best at a smaller venue and off broadway.  Good vibe and One nice performance.  Its loses some of its tightness both in space and show with the larger venue.   But still keeping to its core and very entertaining.  \n\nNot a musical, not a broadway show, not a play, but best described as an off broadway performance art with a vegas size theater."
4,I wrote this review in Nepal. I ordered the Eggs Benedict at Wanda's and it was very flavorful. The downside was that the egg was fried and no poached. The service was very good and the people were friendly! Definitely a place worth checking out. I was referred by someone from the DMV.
4,"I wrote this review in Shanghai. We came here last night because of a restaurant.com coupon, but couldn't use it because it was a half off bottles Monday... and it did say it on the coupon after reading the fine print. But, we stuck around anyway and we had an enjoyable experience. I love the look of the place. Reminds me of an east coast new york style restaurant with the brick walls. Ambiance is romantic and pretty. Tables are somewhat close together but not unbearable. Probably not the best place to bring children. Food prices are kind of hefty also, but I enjoyed my chicken Gorgonzola dish. My boyfriend got the same thing and he liked it as well. Service was good and fast. Would come back again."
4,"I wrote this review in Armenia. When I first moved to Las Vegas My sister (Nikki H.) took me here for dinner. \n\nOMG this place is freaking awesome!!! its like old western cowboy themed. They have great decorations large bar, huge sofas a small mini bowling alley and there booths are sooo comfy. \n\nService is great at this restaurant and the servers are so friendly and nice! \n\nFood is amazing! \nI always always always order there Chicken Fried Steak... Its just so mouth watering and extremely delicious. It is buttermilk battered and the steak sauce is very rich and creamy I have to order more sauce on the side because is so good, the steak also comes with mashed potatoes and grilled chipotle corn also delicious. I also order the Baked Potato Soup very good i love it mmm the bacon and cheese is just an extra delicious touch. \n\nThere food is good quality and delicious, and they give huge portions. \n\nIf you like a filling quality meal this is a must try restaurant"
4,"I wrote this review in Canada. I never much cared for Firehouse in the past. But, they are quickly becoming a top contender on my list of sub creators.\n\nThis location recently reopened after a short remodeling stint which has, as a result, increased in square footage allowing for more tables and chairs.\n\nThe ladies are very pleasant towards customers, which is much appreciated and hard to find in todays society. \n\nThe service is quite fast even during the super busy lunch phase. That's a plus when most of us need to travel to/fro and eat all within an hours time.\n\nAlong with that fast service comes fresh delicious sandwiches. Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and try something new. You'll enjoy it. \n\nAlthough not a fan, this is location is equipped with the futuristic Coke Freestyle beverage contraption."
4,"I wrote this review in Venezuela. L'Amore is a perfect, quiet neighborhood restaurant for everyone who enjoys a quiet atmosphere, excellent food at reasonable prices.

4,"I wrote this review in Oslo. I came here two times during my vegas trip. The first time was bad because our order didn't go through and even when we asked someone about it, he just said wait for the buzzer. We waited 40 minutes and asked again and that's when he told us he had to reorder. Aside from that, it was very good. I ordered the caprese with extra basil  and a frozen lemonade. The sandwich was really good and the frozen lemonade was refreshing."
4,"I wrote this review in Nairobi. I enjoy playing at Tuscany. It is one of Las Vegas' newer golf courses.\nMy first time at Tuscany - the Club house was in a converted quonset hut / tent. \nThey now sport a beautiful club house and restaurant.\nThe club initially had some problems growing grass in  this arid part of Vegas, so the team from Rhodes Ranch came in took it over and the course has been blooming ever since. \nRhodes Ranch is the \""sister\"" course and you can often get supurb package deals for plying both courses.\nThe course is well laid out with a number of sand traps that seem to play right to my driving distance. \nThere is enough water on the course to splash a few misplaced shots\nThe course winds past the beautiful stone clocktower has spacious fairways.\nThe theme of the course centers around wine and vineyards making it fairly unique.\nI think this is an excellent course for the price you pay. \nYou have to drive a bit further than some of the Summerlin courses but it is a super experience."
4,I wrote this review in Tajikistan. We stopped in at the Keg for dinner and had a splendid time.\n\nService was prompt and efficient.\n\nThe food was splendidly done.   \n\nWe had the goat cheese appetizer and were very pleased with the baked cheese flavors.\n\n The salad's greens were crisp and not overly covered in dressing.\n\nThe vegetables were crisp and not overcooked.   \n\nI ordered a rare filet.  It was a wonderfully done rare when it arrived.  The only thing that could have made it better was more blood.  \n\nMy spouse ordered the filet and crab. Each was done perfectly.\n\nThe big surprise was the coffee was as good the creme brulee (not so last time).\n\nI highly recommend the Keg as an alternative to more pricey alternatives (Ruth's Chris and Morton's).
4,"I wrote this review in Greece. I like Crystals a lot as a place to go to see high end stores with few shoppers.  I like the layout and the attention to design that was put into building this place.\n\nIt is, however, not a place I would go to shop.  I like it for the exhibits they periodically have and for just looking at the few people one generally sees there.\n\nPerhaps when the economy comes back, the place will have more zing.  Still, I like the space and I hope it does well!"

Our picture was taken before we sat. \n- Common variety: Salad, Mexican, Soup, Mid-Eastern, Asian, American, Italian, Seafood, and Dessert.\n- AYCD - unlimited Beer and Wine! Champagne Life Neyo! And all the ladies say, uh-huh! \n- Get the strawberry crumb cupcake. delicious! \n- They have cotton candy for the kids! haha. \n- Poor sushi selection. No Crab legs. \n- Come for the Mexican food, Salad, and American food. \n- The drinks were most rewarding. Food was average. Not bad for $36 or $18/person for food and drinks! :)"
4,"I wrote this review in Rome. Played golf here on a Wed as part of a stroke play tournament. I was so excited to play b/c I've heard good things. I ended up enjoying my entire experience here. \n\nThis course is beautiful and well manicured. From tee to green, this course is close to flawless. The greens aren't that fast, but can sneak up on you at times. As for lay-out, there are some quirky weird holes like #10, but all in all it's a fun lay-out. The desert rocks can be challenging to hit out of and damaging to your clubs if you are inaccurate with shots. \n\nAs for practice amenities, there is a large grass range and large putting green. Not sure if there was a chipping practice area or not. \n\nStaff is super friendly and attentive. The carts have GPS and an ice chest to keep things cool in the hot summer heat. \n\nAll in all, it is truly a country club experience. I would love to play here again!"
4,"I wrote this review in Hamburg. I've heard a lot of people talk about the sweet potato enchiladas at Frank and Fina's. I finally got around to trying them and yeah, they were good. They weren't the transcendent culinary experience I expected, but they were tasty. It's basically just mashed sweet potatoes in a tortilla and topped with red sauce, cheese and sour cream. They weren't too sweet and the sauce added a delicious blend of spices to it. The dish came with rice and black beans. It wasn't a cheap lunch ($11), but it was good.\n\nThe service was ridiculously quick. I probably waited around 5 minutes after ordering before the food came out. So, if you're looking for a quick spot for a sit-down lunch head over here."
4,"I wrote this review in Gabon. First things first, I don't have a car. So I'm a captive audience for County Market, which is the closest store to my apartment. County Market has a good selection, and I rarely if ever have trouble finding things. It was funny how at the beginning of the school year certain items were just GONE, but I attribute that to people coming back and everyone needing soy sauce, ketchup, etc. However, I went there the other day and there was only one sort of tofu, which my friend informed me was not the best type. This is a small quibble, though, and I'm sure it happens in other stores.\n\nFor me the only thing I don't like about County Market is the state of produce. Often times I've picked up fruit or veggies and they've been close to going bad or already there. Or I'll buy bananas and they'll be so green I can't eat them for a week. I don't mind going through fruits and veggies and finding good ones, but if there aren't any good that makes it a but difficult. In general, I like this place and I'll continue to come back."
4,"I wrote this review in Palau. The last few times I've been they just seem nicer and more attentive so I'll give a bump on a improvement. \n\nI noticed they started giving people hot tea as they walk in. Even when I came in for a to-go order of chicken, they brought me out tea.  When it was almost empty they dropped down another glass. I noticed it's been cleaner the past year than the first few times I dropped in a few years back. I appreciate the little things and wanted to note on improvements. \n\nI liked the chicken porridge ($6.95) a lot and it was piping hot when I got home. They must've freshly boiled the chicken because it took a while and the chicken was soft and fresh tasting. I like that ginger is plentiful but thinly shaved into the porridge and that they put green onion, cilantro and shallot crisp. I think this will be a spot I'll come for it again. It's a perfect for when I'm not feeling well. \n\nI think this has slowly won me over as my favorite late night soup place."
4,"I wrote this review in San Marino. Nothing fancy as far as atmosphere. Clean and open. But the food is amazing. Fantastic lunch buffet with many different choices. This is one of the few buffets I've ever been to that actually puts a decent amount of meat in their dishes. \n\nCould be considered a bit on the pricey side, but for the quality of a buffet and decent amount of meat, it was worth it."
4,"I wrote this review in Guinea. I really enjoyed my stay at the Aria. World class amenities and the rooms are very classy. Check in was smooth, I recommend entering on the city center side instead of the Harmon street entrance. Got a room with a nice pool view. As you first walk-in the black out shades part ways and the lights rise; leaves you in awe. Everything is plush, super soft king with an elegant bathroom.\n\nThe casino is a bit overwhelming for those not that experienced like me, $25 min bet blackjack tables and I didn't even go through the poker spots. But, overall its really fun. The cafe downstairs has an amazing cinnamon roll. Plus all the staff is friendly and attentive. \n\nI probably wouldn't stay here again because I feel you get more bang for your buck at the smoke free Vdara Hotel across the way. However, if you like to gamble this is great."
4,"I wrote this review in Oslo. I have always been a fan of Oyshi Sushi as it took my sushi virginity! I wish the prices dropped to be more comparable to other sushi spots in the area but all one can do is hope. AYCE is the safest bet for a dinner out with a table for two or more. You ensure no one will need to wash dishes in the back if they get carried away with indulging. We all have those dinner friends who have the mindset of caviar budgets but the reality of dollar-value-menu wallets. \n\nService is usually a hit or miss. I've gotten service that has made me not want to leave. On the other hand I've experienced servers at this establishment that made me want to request take-out. (which they do offer). \n\nThe draw back for this place is they don't do half orders like other spots. It's also nowhere near the strip. Which is a catch-22. The wait can be timely depending on the day of the week. If it were closer to the strip it would be an endless wait.\n\nMussels, Love Affair, Lobster Fair, Oyshi Roll, and the Japanese Lasagna are my favorites!"
4,I wrote this review in . Come here with an appetite because the portions of food are ginormous. It was a treat watching the food come out and watching the look on peoples faces. I would say that most of the dishes here can be split with a friend.  My breakfast was pretty delicious. My friend ordered a chicken pot pie dish that came in a hat shaped cracker. It was oozing with a creamy gravy.  It was very good.  I did have to send my hash browns back because they were cold and bit soggy but then they just brought more and I had a ton more hash browns. They were much better HOT.  The waiter was really passionate about the food and very nice.  I saw drinks on the menu that I would have tried that were extremely pricey. There was a bloody Mary drink on the menu that comes with Bacon and it was like $15.  I do not care if it had a souvenir glass I would never pay that much for that drink. I mean nothing that special about it.  I think if  you order a regular Bloody Mary and put your own piece of Bacon from breakfast you would have the same effect for half the price.  :-)   We did wait awhile as expected but it was worth the wait.  I definitely recommend this place.
4,"I wrote this review in Egypt. chipotle chicken ~$7 for ~ 6\""\n- limited time only \n- fresh bread! crispy exterior with soft interior. good bread!!!\n- chicken was moist unlike what i had thought\n- avocado cooled the chipotle a tiny bit, but not enough because mouth was burning\n- i asked for the sauce on the side but they added it to the sandwich and gave me an additional container of sauce. \n- there was bacon inside but i didn't see it initially so i didn't take it out. i couldn't taste it until the very end. i think i can try to slowly get rid of my psychological issues with consuming pork. \n- despite the error, the sandwich was still good, and the balance of the flavors were okay except the spiciness masking some of the flavors."
4,"I wrote this review in Equatorial Guinea. I'm really happy to finally have Downtown Summerlin open. There are a good list of shops, restaurants and stores available. I love how it is similar to Town Square and can be seen right off of the 215 freeway. It was fun to watch it grow as I live just down the street. I hope to see all the bad stores like Shaggy Chic or Off Broadway Shoe Warehouse (don't waste your money those places they have terrible customer service) and more places like Earl of Sandwich and GAP come that way I don't have to drive all the way to Fashion Show Mall for a good shopping trip. Also the luxury regal isn't bad since it's more adult friendly than kid friendly :)"

4,"I wrote this review in Nicaragua. We held our bi-monthly Yelp Book Club meeting at Midtown last night and I was quite impressed.  It's a small place.  It's very nicely designed and very classy looking.  The bar runs along the west side of the room and on the east side, there's a run of booth seats.  There are tables by the booth seats and there are very comfortable stools to sit at the tables.\n\nI had eaten at home and all I wanted was a diet Coke.  The barkeep last night was a very delightful young woman with a tremendous smile and a very welcoming demeanor.  She got my Coke and then some of the members of the group started to arrive.\n\nWhile I was there, one of the partners in this new business came by and introduced himself and the executive chef stopped by to talk about the menu.  Everyone was very polite, friendly, and accommodating.  It was a pleasant place for us to discuss our book and for those that had food, they enjoyed what they had.  I have uploaded a photo of some meatballs one of the members ordered.  They have a meatball sandwich, but all she wanted was a few meatballs--no bread, no cheese, just the meatballs.  The plate shows how well they complied with her special request.\n\nI'll be back.  I have to try their lobster pizza.  I was disappointed no one wanted to order one to share last night."

I will definitely go back for the fries."
4,"I wrote this review in Los Angeles. Of all the upscale fast food joints I've tried recently, Smashburger is my favorite, but there are still many places on my to do list. Every time I've heard this place mentioned, it's compared to In n Out. While I do think that the food is better than In n Out, I still think that In n Out is a better value. All these new burger chains popping up are sort of in a different league than In n Out. In n Out is a real fast food restaurant (with a drive through, usually right off the freeway). All of these new places tend to reside in strip malls and are usually less convenient to get to. They have each other to compete with, and it's a tight race. In n Out is miles ahead of their true competitors in taste, quality, and service."
4,"I wrote this review in Jakarta. It's a beat up Chinese restaurant with good food and ridiculously low prices. A regular lunch spot for me, since it's near my office.  Service is very quick as they make every effort to get you out to make room for the next customer. Not the kind of place where you can lounge around as you will receive a look from the staff that clearly says it's  time to go. But the good food and great prices make the former easy to get past."
4,I wrote this review in Iceland. We got a great deal to stay in the MGM from Hotwire. It was 50 dollars a night with an amazing view of the strip. I could not believe how cheap the hotel was. The interior of the hotel was really beautiful. It was nice and clean it had a huge wall size window. The view of the strip was best seen at night. \n\nI did get annoyed of the green light. But it wasn't a big deal. i think I got use to it after the second night we stayed... They offered us 20 bucks off on the MGM buffet which was totally worth it because the food was pretty good. It was not the best buffet in Vegas but it was very good. The mimosas in the morning was a perfect hangover remedy. haha\n\nI would definitely book MGM through Hotwire again. This place was exactly what I expected from a Vegas Hotel. Clean and Affordable and Great Location!

We showed up at the pool (very nice, buy the way) the first afternoon, and there were no spaces left to accommodate 7 of us.  We asked a pool attendant, and he ran to get us 7 lounge chairs and set up a spot for us.  Nice!  The place is beautiful, and the rooms were nice and big.  There is even a vanity outside the bathroom with an outlet which makes it so much easier for girls to get ready at the same time.  Why don't more hotels have this????  It's a little pricier than some other hotels in Vegas, but it was worth going at least once."

Das f\u00e4ngt mit der Einrichtung an, die nicht gerade stilvoll ist und einen seltsamen Mix aus farbenfrohen griechischen Motiven und n\u00fcchterner Dorfgastst\u00e4tte bietet. Unter den Gerichten findet sich auch das klassische Wiener Schnitzel. Naja, mu\u00df man ja nicht bestellen.\nDas Personal ist freundlich, aber auch einen Hauch zu hektisch. Die Gerichte sind (fast) duchgehend von sehr hoher Qualit\u00e4t. Bewerten konnten wir die Vorspeisen (Weinbl\u00e4tter und Knoblauchbrot; beides hervorragend) und die Hauptspeisen (Gyros mit Fladenbrot und Steak in Thymiansosse und mit Schafk\u00e4se gef\u00fcllt; beides perfekt und von h\u00f6chster Qualit\u00e4t). Die Pommes frites als Beilage zum Steak waren zu salzig und den Salat, der zu den Hauptspeisen gereicht wird, sollte man besser ganz weg lassen, denn er entwertet das Men\u00fc erheblich.\nAm Ende gibt es den obligatorischen Ouzo oder einen Kinder-Ouzo (Grenadine mit Sprite).\nDie Preise sind leicht gehoben, aber angesichts der Qualit\u00e4t fair."

4,"I wrote this review in Netherlands. We got passes for the preview of Mission Impossible (Ghost Protocol).  We enjoyed the movie a lot.  The theater itself is fine.  The chairs don't move, and you can't raise the arm rests.  No rocking, no reclining (granted most theater seats don't move a lot, but these don't move at all).  Otherwise the seats were reasonably comfortable.  The screen is IMAX (i.e. huge), and the sound was reasonably good.  \n\nThey could have put a little more slope into the auditorium seating.  In other IMAX theaters I've been in it seemed the heads of people in front of you NEVER block any portion of the screen.  But I found a few were just slightly into the bottom of the screen.  It wasn't bad, but given my other IMAX experiences I did notice it."

Everyone will give this place a bad rating because of how beat up and aged this place is but lets be honest here.  The place is a chinese joint, very little focus to the aesthetics and I know very few places that are this old and still around.  \n\nThe Food is good, say all you want about the details in the restrooms and the side rooms but the food is very good.  We ordered multiple items and they have some great dishes, my favorite is the lo mein (catonese style) the pork selections where also yummy.  \n\nThis place reminded me of my local chinese place in LA when I was a kid and I will look forward to coming back.  For those that are thinking of trying please don't let this rating overall discourage you, just try it!"

Unlike SF, they have pulling baskets and not actual shopping carts. I feel sorry for the person who has to clean up the mess at the end of the day."
4,"I wrote this review in Guinea. Had a wonderful time at St. Francis last week.  The service was very attentive.  The architectural detail of this place makes it worth the visit for that alone.  Ask for a tour of the details, they love sharing it with you.\n\nCan't wait to get back there again as the menu expands and it is open more hours. \n\nWarning though:  it isn't inexpensive."
4,"I wrote this review in Amsterdam. We chose Pete's after having dinner in Town Square and had a great time.  We got there pretty early - about 830 pm - and so were able to get a table rather than stand at the bar.  Service was a little slow after it got crowded but our drinks were never completely empty.  The pianists did a few ice breakers until it got crowded and after that focused on requests.  I was amazed at their repertoire and stamina - they rotated between 4 pianists with no breaks in the action.  They played everything from Lady Gaga to Bon Jovi to the Free Credit Report commercial songs!\n\nI thought this was a great place to hang out after dinner and have a good time with a few friends...definitely not a place for quiet conversation however!  Oh, one note, take a few dollars when you go to the restroom, they do have attendants who expect to be tipped."
4,"I wrote this review in Sacramento. I got the 3 may combo with ribs, pulled pork, and brisket with sides of Mac and cheese and potato salad. I was debating on getting the hot link because that is what I saw them make on diners drive ins and dives and that's what made me want to try this place. The pulled pork had sauce mixed in already which I'm not a fan of. I like to taste the flavor of the pork before sauce is added. The meat should be able to stand alone. The ribs were on point. They were tender with a good smoke flavor. The brisket was disappointing. I feel like it was cooked with liquid smoke which is like a short cut to smoke meat. The potato salad was good but to me the star was the Mac and cheese. It was creamy and I tasted like three different kinds of cheese. I wish I would have got a double side of it. They have tri tip on Tuesdays and Thursdays for anyone planning to go. I wish I went there on one of those days because I'm a East coast guy and you can't find tri tip any where out there. So whenever I get the chance I get tri tip wherever I go."

4,"I wrote this review in Belarus. The moment you walk in it smells amazing! I loved the MGM's signature smell. We stayed in the Grand Tower, our room was neat, clean, and looked great. The restroom was clean, and looked fairly new. Whatever you do, don't remove the drinks that are in the refrigerator, not even to take a picture because the fridge has a timer. Overall, it was a great experience, Jason checked us out, he was very pleasant and friendly."
4,"I wrote this review in Montreal. I took a trip from the NY metro area to Phoenix this weekend and local took me here to get a taste of \""real\"" Mexican food. I'm pleased to report that the food here is worth a try when you're in town. \n\nThe restaurant had a wonderful atmosphere, whereas it was dimly lit and had a ton of strategically placed candles. It really made me fee like I was in Phoenix. \n\nFor those of you who've tried Dos Comino's in NYC, Mission is right up there with them. The guacamole was made table side but was a little too spicy even though we asked for medium. Even with the extreme spice it tasted extremely fresh and authentic had the crispy pork belly appetizer and shared the pork shoulder entree with a friend. The corn tortillas were fresh and the pork was fork tender. \n\nThey had negro modello on TAP which I've never seen in the northeast. I ended up dropping $50 on the meal but I thought it was well work it. This place is by no means a hole in the wall southwest US Mexican food restaurant and it knows it."
4,"I wrote this review in Tunis. After multiple flat out miserable experiences at the Center City Hilton, I tried out the Omni and have been going back ever since. If you are looking for something more budget minded, Aloft right across the street will do well. If you are looking for something a little more high end but not quite Ritz level, Omni hits it on the head. I have stayed here 8 times thus far and on every occasion I have had excellent service via the front desk, immaculately clean rooms, and good room service. I always stay in the same executive corner suite over looking the epicenter so I can't speak toward the standard junior suite quality. I prefer the larger rooms. I have recommended this to my family coming to town for my upcoming wedding. Love this place. Easy walking distance to everything from Chima, Ruths Chris, Pita Pit, and smack across the street from the epicenter and all its restraunts, bars, movie theater, bowling alley, and the like."
4,"I wrote this review in Ecuador. Beer.  Beer.  Beer.\n\nThat pretty much seems to be the highlight of this place.\nI'm not even a beer drinker so can't review the quality of their brews but apparently the Oatmeal Stout was good and a deal at $3.25/16oz during happy hour.\n\nI can vouch for the food though.  I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich (with goats cheese and veggies on multigrain bread) with side salad for $10.   It was one of the featured Sunday specials.  The chicken was cooked well but coated with a heavy layer of peppery seasoning.  I personally enjoyed it but imagine it would probably be a little extreme for most.   The small 12\"" medium crust BBQ chicken pizza was also good ($14.50) and huge enough to share.  Both our meals involved simple ingredients but the quality was above average compared to your typical pub fare.\n\nWish they had a few more wine options for us non-beer drinkers but then again I wouldn't want to hear a beer drinker say that at a wine bar, so I won't judge.\n\nVery casual atmosphere made up of everyone from college kids to young families on the early Sunday evening we were there.  We drove by here on Friday night when it looked much livelier and their outdoor patio was packed.  \n\nDecent service and overall good place, especially for all you beer drinkers out there!"
4,"I wrote this review in Lima. Had a bunch of fun here. I had no idea what this event was, but I purchased a Gropuon to do this at a bar right down the street from my house (Del's Bar in Bloomfield). I went in and had a good time. I'm not sure whether our event was BYOB, but everyone who wanted food or an adult beverage just ordered or went to the bar. My one complaint would be that the event seemed to be a bit disorganized, but I think I went to one of the first events so maybe that was the reason. The people doing set up didn't seem to know what they were doing. However, the artist was very knowledgeable and was very helpful through the entire event. We had maybe 15 or so people, and she made sure to spend time with everyone during every step of the process. Not being talented to the art area at all, this was very helpful and enabled me to really enjoy the experience. I was quite surprised at how good my piece turned out. I'd definitely recommend going to one of these events."
4,"I wrote this review in Sudan. The ambience of this converted Phoenix gem is apparent when you walk up. It's cozy, inviting and hip without being obvious about it. The small bar is nestled between the kitchen and windows facing the outdoor patio, a perfect vantage for enjoying a craft beer. I chose the seasonal Great Divide Wild Raspberry Ale, with amber tones and real raspberry essence. As a bit of a dairy diva, the griddled cheese sammie seemed appealing - it was recommended by several staffers and lived up to it's foodie fame. Paired with the soup du jour (cheesy chicken enchilada), it was taste bud bliss."
4,I wrote this review in Sudan. Great location tucked away behind Islands.  Non fat selection is excellent and Tuesday night is kids night for .99.  It can get expensive so limit yourself as the cost is by the oz.  Me and my two boys easily racked up $13 in yogurt!\n\nLots of samples and about 12 flavors.  They change frequently to keep you coming back.

4,"I wrote this review in Chengdu. GREAT food ,Good drinks,Open 24 hours which is great for the late night cravings the only thing is if your in a hurry be sure to place a Togo order because the service there isn't the best of the best but perfect if you are trying to kill time ! I understand people get busy but iv gone on slow days and the amount of time u wait for your food in quite a bit. Also the prices are a bit high so add a couple of drinks your bill might be quite a number $$$The first time I came here I fell in LOVE with the trail mix salad .. So much I think I was frequenting this place about 3 times a week for it for a while, it's amazing !"
4,"I wrote this review in Qatar. Chakra 4 is most likely the best place in town for tea, tea infusions and herbal desires.  While I've never eaten at the cafe, the treats and plates always look yum.  The dried herbal goods are very reasonably priced.  The extracts are a little on the pricey side, but being the best place to find obscure things, it makes sense.  The actual tea (camellia sinensis - not herbal infusions) leaves (pun not intended!) a bit to be desired.  I can respect that there is actually a decent selection of teas in store, but the broadness of them leaves a picky tea aficionado like myself less than impressed (that's why I give Chakra 4 four stars instead of five).  Green tea goes much deeper than \""Green Tea\"", as does Darjeeling, white, oolong, black.\n\nIf you are in need of something in town, this is the place to go (for instance, I needed some herbs for a tea remedy today - I could not wait).  If you want to talk to a knowledgeable, friendly person, this is the place for you.  If you are looking for strange and highest quality estate teas, you won't find a place in Phoenix...move somewhere else."
4,"I wrote this review in Dominica. Mango, chili, lime, oh my! This pie is awesome. The first bite is strange as it's spicy, yet rich and tart. Go past the first bite and you'll be back for more (if you can handle the spice!). \n\nI enjoy Mama Toledo's!"
4,"I wrote this review in Singapore. My default hotel when in Vegas....\n\nIts right in the middle of the strip, and the beds are super comfy. \nIts also a bit cheaper than some of its neighbors, and much nicer than any of its cheaper neighbors. \n\nI got upgraded last time I was here, and about two weeks after we checked out, I got a phone call asking if I left keys in the room, which I thought were already lost forever. You guys are awesome! \n\nThey even shipped them to me without asking for a dime!\n\nSee ya for New Years!"
4,"I wrote this review in Palau. One of the best things about staying at Cosmo, you can go back to your room, change in to some flats and go back down to get some pizza. \nLove this \""secret\"" pizza, long lines, but goes pretty quickly drunk talking in line. Pizza is tasty and fresh, pretty cheap too for being a Vegas restaurant."
4,I wrote this review in Ghana. One of our favorite places to order lunch from for pick up.  We will go out of our way to get their sandwiches and salads.  The food is consistently tasty and the employees are always very nice.  We haven't tried anything on the menu yet that we didn't like!
4,"I wrote this review in Chicago. Came here on a Friday night, right after arriving in Vegas after a long drive.  Walked right up to the front of the line (just beat the crowd) and was able to order my custom pizza. The way this place works is pretty much you can create your own custom pizza from scratch with as many toppings as you like for one flat rate.  They also have multiple sauces you can choose from as well. The people behind the counter were all very nice and willing to help with any questions you had.\n\nNow to the pizza itself.  It tasted great! I ordered the the meat lovers one and added jalapenos.  It is all made on a very thin crust and comes out nice and crispy.  The crust was very tasty (I added a splash of garlic around the sides) and the toppings tasted fresh.  \n\nI would definitely recommend this place to friends and families that are looking for a good and easy pizza place."
4,I wrote this review in Dominican Republic. We love this place.  They have quite a few pescatarian options for us so this is a good place for a quick bite to eat.  Much better than your typical Subway fare.  We used to go to their Eastern location a lot.  Unfortunately they closed that location down.  This place is a little bit aways from us but their offerings before made it a must have after a day at the Outlets stores.  The cashier was very helpful and courteous.  Found out that they offer breakfast items now.  We normally order the Pick 2 menu offering but we ordered their regular sandwich items and we were surprised how big their serving was.  We could have shared the sandwich it was that big.  We will definitely be back for another lunch for sure.  Maybe we can even try their breakfasts one day!

4,"I wrote this review in Saudi Arabia. 4 stars in the summer on the terrasse and well, lower when not. But really, what a lovely hidden spot. If you've never been here before you'll doubt you're on the right track, but yes, past Foufounes and all the grit and graffiti and closed doors of this bit of St Catherine, up what feels like a dead end alley, and through a small barely marked door and you;re there. A regular old pub that opens onto an completely enclosed terrasse with ivy-covered stone walls stretching up the floors above you towards the sky, lots of seating, wooden benches, high-school era tunes, friendly easy going service, a perfect place to forget how old you are and what time it is and just enjoy. This will help you enjoy the food too which is not bad, but not good pub delivery from a nearby joint. \n\nInside is fine, just a cozyish pub with the occasional good open mic night."
4,"I wrote this review in Korea. i'm only 5'2\"" and i had to get some low rise jeans hemmed...this place is prompt, does great work, and is quite kind.... Not the lowest price, but well worth what they charge which wasn't much more than a typical tailor.."
4,"I wrote this review in Melbourne. Just like with pretty much any other gym it's tough to get a good workout in between 4-6 unless you don't plan on using any of the machines or benches to do so. Parking is also a nightmare around this time. \n\nThey have only one room where they conduct fitness classes but the instructors are pretty good and a usually on time. They have a ladies only fitness area which not to many other Golds Gyms do. \n\nThe people that come here are here to work out and not for a fashion show, well there's always 1 or 2 but it's not as bad as LVAC where most people come to see and be seen. \n\nThey have a mixed martial arts/boxing arena, you have to extra for those classes but it's a cool addition. They have a childcare center which I believe is very inexpensive. The price of membership is 20/m for full use including all classes, 30 if you want to use their tanning booths. The standing tanning booths are just ok, but for only 10extra/m for unlimited tanning you can't beat it. Did I mention there is no contract? There are also no cancellation penalties.\n\nThe staff is friendly and helpful and the bathrooms are always clean. I've been a member of LVAC and while it is a very sexy fitness center, sexy doesn't always translate to good, especially if you are tied to a contract."

4,"I wrote this review in Madrid. I'm rating this place 4 stars just, because it's not super cheap it's about average pricing! I called only 15 minutes before for a gel manicure they told me to come right in! When I got there they had everything all set for me I didn't have to wait at all. THEY HAVE SO MANY GEL COLORS!! I couldn't make up my mind! All of the ladies seemed very friendly mine dealt with my change of mind of colors very nicely and was giving me suggestions, I could hear other surrounding customers very satisfied and chatting away happily with the staff. My manicurists spent time, I never felt rushed, even though I was there only an hour before closing! Highly recommend!"
4,"I wrote this review in Lesotho. The restaurant is fairly new and located in the ground floor of a old Bond Warehouse just off Constitution Street.  They have made use of the double height ceilings and put in a mezzanine level, creating a small area ideal for large groups of people and providing more table space.  We received a warm welcome and were seated at our table near the large arched windows.  The interior is clean, simple and especially liked the candles in red coloured glasses dotted up the stairs.  Giving to space an almost zen-like feeling.\n\nAll the staff were authentic Spaniards which felt reassuring.  I love tapas and so this restaurant did not let me down.  The menu is broken down into 3 sections, 'From the orchard', 'from the sea' and 'from the farm'.  We ordered 6 tapas between the two of us, wondering if it would be enough? Thankfully it was plenty, the dishes were small but tasty.  Do try the pork and mushroom cream sauce and Monkfish, prawn and squid in tomato sauce.  First time I've eaten squid that isn't rubbery, it just dissolved in the mouth, lovely!"
4,"I wrote this review in Sudan. I only know St Leonard's Land from sitting first and second year exams in its halls.  Thus it's not my favourite place in the world, but as far as exam halls go these are pretty good.\nThe whole place feels large and spacious with lots of little stairways leading to 'hidden' gyms and rooms.  I had an exam in the main hall and I was pretty surprised at how large it is, fitting in hundreds of tables and chairs at a time.  \nThe gym which I was in last year wasn't quite as large or lush with scuffed floored, dated decor and not the cleanest of windows.  Nonetheless, all the curtains for the windows did a good job of absorbing any echoes which is perfect for when you'r etrying to concentrate."
4,"I wrote this review in Norway. My wife and I came to this restaurant on a Friday night. The weather was beautiful so we decided to sit outside. The outside area was a little crowded. You can tell they try to fit as many tables and people in their patio as they can but it didn't bother us at all.  They also have an English menu which what was good, since we don't know any French. \n\nThis restaurant has a huge selection of different pizzas. They also have a huge selection of toppings. It can be a little overwhelming when deciding what to order. It took us a while to decide what we wanted. \n\nSo we finally decided and we ordered our pizza. We sat and talk for a while and enjoyed the nice weather. The pizza arrived pretty quickly and it was great. The crust was perfect. We had so many toppings on our pizza that we had to eat it with a fork and knife. I would've gave this restaurant 5 stars, but it only gets 4 because the service could have been better. I had to flag the waiter down on numerous occasion just to get more water. With that said, I definitely would go back to this place the next time i'm in Montreal."

4,"I wrote this review in Burma. The only reason I didn't give this place five stars is cause it can be difficult to park near the back of Town Square where the theatre is during peak times. Beside that this place is definitely one of the nicest in Vegas. It is not as cheap as some of the other ones but the nice auditoriums, seats, and presentation make up for the added price. Additionally you have all the bars, eateries, and shops surrounding it so you can do other stuff easily before or after all within walking distance. This is the only theatre I have ever been to that has armed, yes several armed guards walking around inside, not sure how to feel about that. I have never really gone during the day but they have a lot of facilities for kids if you have them. Overall a really cool place worth the price."

4,"I wrote this review in Marshall Islands. Finally tried the pizza here yesterday and it was good. I went with the BBQ chicken variety and you get 6 slices for about 9 bucks. It was loaded with nice pieces of chicken, a subtle and slightly sweet BBQ sauce and onions and two cheeses. Ordered well done, it arrived perfectly cooked and I had good service since there were about no people in the bar area. Tempe is not a basketball town and it was disappointing that no Sun Devils fans were watching a key hoops game. Pathetic.\nAnyway, Boston's has lunch specials, but apparently this place and others don't think people eat lunch on weekends and they don't apply. Why?"
4,"I wrote this review in Kuala Lumpur. Loved this place the moment we stepped foot inside of the elevator to get to the top.  Seven of us girls were in search of a great time and we found it here at the Foundation Room!  Advertised as exclusive and VIP, I thought to myself that surely they were trying to front like other Vegas clubs.  I drank my words as we were offered free champagne and cocktails while dancing to some hot beats!\n\nFR offers 3 rooms with spacious dance floors and a patio that is perfect for their gorgeous panoramic view of the Vegas strip.  I admit that their dance floors are pretty small, but after several drinks you won't even notice the cramped space that has you dancing right up on another person :).  The aforementioned patio was a perfect place to get fresh air and if you can handle folks smoking in your \""fresh\"" air (which was a bit of a turnoff but whatever), you get a chance to take in all of the magical spark that makes the Vegas strip what it is.\n\nWe ended our night here and wished that we started it off at this spot.  Great people, great atmosphere, and I would definitely party it up here again."

I had the breakfast burrito and it was stuffed full, hot, and not too greasy.

4,"I wrote this review in Niger. We have eaten at this restaurant since it opened and it's always a great experience.  Most of the Teppan chefs have great personality and do an entertaining job of preparing the food.  The owners, Barry and Ahn, are very friendly and constantly walk the floor interacting with customers and checking to make sure everything is good.  They remember regular customers and are always happy to welcome you back.\n\nThe Happy Hour menu is very good with a variety of choices.  The sushi is always fresh and well prepared.\n\nI noticed in a previous post that someone commented that the restaurant is loud.  Being as there are several Teppan tables, it can get loud - but in a fun and appropriate way.  They also have a huge patio and if you've never witnessed an Arizona sunset from there, you're missing out.\n\nAs I mentioned, we've been coming to this restaurant since it opened - sometimes a couple of times a week. We will continue to do so."

I was not aware until I went there that they make their own wines, and some of them are pretty good.  I was also surprised to see Four Graces Pinot Noir in their list. That was my latest discovery in Oregon and is one of my new favorites.  I couldn't believe they have it, since it comes from such a small winery in Oregon.  I loved the Shallot marmalade bruschetta, it was very tasty.  The salmon roll was really good too.  On Mondays they have a deal for a chef's choice pizza and a bottle of their wine for $20.  When I went with my hubby for Happy Hour, we had the sliders, they were very tasty.  Good place to hang out and my hubby could have his margarita since they have a pretty full bar."
4,"I wrote this review in Nigeria. First time visiting Hanny's Friday Dec 12.\n\nThe Venue:\nInteresting place. Upon walking into the entry the entire bar/restaurant seemed to look up at you.. it was a little awkward while waiting to be seated lol..  The decor was minimal and contemporary.. with the vibe and hints of AZ88 carried over. The elevator was unique.. and the bathrooms were oddly placed upstairs. This place has A LOT of potential. It needs a crowd and some color. It just didn't feel alive like AZ88 does. \n\nThe Food:\nThe menu was minimal and easy to read. There was an assortment of appetizers, sandwiches , pizza, salads etc... My friend and I shared a sandwich and pizza.. food was good and reasonably priced. \n\nThe Service:\nGood friendly service. Helpful with recommendations. Fast arrival of food and plenty of refills on water. \n\nOverall, I liked the place and would recommend it!"

That's one of my biggest pet peeves because I drink a ton of water! \nOn to the food, everything looked so good however my whole table ended up ordering the special halibut and it was almost worth the 35$ a plate price tag. Being from California I'm used to the sea food being less expensive so that was my only qualm. It was do good I could eat it every day! I personally didn't care for the calamari appetizer, the flavor was ok but the squid was a little chewy for my taste. \nI have to say this is a great little bistro with an excellent staff and great menu. I must note that I called about bringing a small cake in and they wanted to charge me $2 dollars a slice to cut it! I thought that was absurd when restaurants on the strip only charge .50 cents a slice. Either way, I will be back once my bank account recovers!"
4,"I wrote this review in Philadelphia. Bottle sevice+Kaskade+group of ER nurses = i'm a happy camper\n\nI'm definitely coming back to this club again. I only have a few complaint about this place and that is rude bouncers!!!! They're very strict when it comes to trying to keep people moving in aisle. They don't want people standing around the aisle when there's a performance going on. If you don't' have a table reserved, good luck trying to  get a peek of who's playing that night. The bouncers don't care if ur a female , if you're in the way they'll shove u away.\n\nThey also try to make this club exclusive, so they'll pick on petty things such as not wearing ur shoe in the club, hotel, elevator or anywhere on their property ( WTEFF? Most of us just danced the night away in ur effing club with our high heels on..give us females a break!) They'll kick your friends out of the club if they remotely look drunk even though theyre allready on their way out and hasn't made a scene (for ex: like throwing up at some random person's shoe, falling in the pool).\n\nAside from the neg things I'll still give this club 4 stars for the music, atmosphere, awesome lineup of performers!"
4,"I wrote this review in Sacramento. While in Vegas I was craving some nice red meat, particularly a steak, and we noticed this restaurant while walking by late at night heading to our hotel room. The next day we decided to try it out because it was conveniently located in our hotel and we were too lazy and exhausted to make the trek anywhere else. \nI was pleasantly surprised with this place, especially since it was not our first choice of steakhouse in Vegas. The decor was simple and elegant, dimly lit, and set the perfect romantic mood. It was quiet due to the small amount of patrons, but I found this to be very relaxing after dealing with all the hustle and bustle of Vegas throughout the rest of the day.\nI ordered the caesar salad as a starter, very good, with the proper amount of dressing, not too much and not too little. I then ordered the filet mignon, which was very tender and cooked exactly how I ordered it. To top it all off, my date and I shared the chocolate mousse, which was also very yummy.\nI would recommend this place if you are looking for a tranquil, intimate meal at a fairly reasonable cost."

They have plenty of juices and acai bowls to choose from and you can also order shots of wheat grass, etc. Whether your a newbie or a juicing regular, this is definitely a good option."

The good thing is, the service remains at all time high because they can only serve so many people at once. If you can't get a table, order to-go! It's made fresh when you order it, unlike the cold dry sushi that you get at RA!"
4,"I wrote this review in Burkina Faso (Upper Volta). After a late night of dancing and gambling... where better to feed the tummy than at the California Hotel.. I think more specifically the Cafe.\n\nTheir menu has lots of choices but I only come out this far from the strip for the Ox Tail Soup! and I am not the only one... when you glance around tables they are mostly filled with giant soup bowls and the accompanying bowl of rice.  \n\nIt is a bit far from the strip.  This past time I went the cab driver dropped us off in a sketch area because he wasn't sure where to go.... In my past experiences the taxi driver's usually know where to take you. \n\nThe ox tail soup is huge and filled with lots of meats carrots and celery.... sometimes a few floating mushrooms. It is always more than I can finish but always hits the spot, especially in the winter time when it is colder out.\n\nI haven't gambled much here but their tables are on the cheap side.  Yay low table limits! it means I can stretch out my money longer!"

5,"I wrote this review in Cairo. This restaurant was hard to find, as it is located in the back of a shopping plaza. But this gives it that \""hidden gem\"" appeal. I thought about coming here a long time ago, but I just thought it would be gimmicky: sashimi with an Italian bent. I love both cuisines, but fused together?Thankfully, our great company invited us to go here and I'm so glad we did. I was already impressed upon entering, being hit with the aromas and smokiness in the air. We were seated promptly in the \""conservatory;\"" a cool little separate area with one table surrounded by windows and tall oleanders. We all did 3-course menus, which was great because we could try different plates.\n\nFOOD: I'm so glad I listened to our server's suggestions because the albacore and yellowtail sashimi (crudo) were amazing: drizzled with a fruity olive oil with some acid and just the right amount of seasoning. Other standouts were the pork belly, squid ink risotto (finally a restaurant that does it right), and the dumpling. Every dish was very good to amazing. The crispy pig ears were very interesting in flavor, definitely something to try.\n\nSERVICE: our server was Tiffany and she was very professional, friendly, and efficient without being obtrusive. Her recommendations were right on. And along with her assistant, we were well-taken care of. Thank you!"
5,"I wrote this review in Singapore. Oh, this place was true luxury.  With a creative drink menu and attentive cocktail servers, you really cannot ask for more when it comes to a relaxing night in Vegas.  You sit below a heater (on chilly desert nights) in comfortable plush couches and chairs, you have a table that feels miles away from everyone else, and on top of all of this you get to watch some free shows as entertainment from atop the glorious waterfall spurts forth every 30 minutes!"
5,"I wrote this review in San Francisco. I went to Purrfect Auto on St. Rose/Eastern to get my oil changed and they suggested I needed new brakes. I was aware of that location's shady practices and quickly declined the service. However, to be on the safe side, I wanted to get a second opinion. Professional Brake Service has amazing reviews on Google and Yelp, so I came in to see if I really did need brakes.\n\nMary, one of the owners, was working the front desk. She was very welcoming and friendly, making sure I got the best service possible. After the technicians looked at my brakes, she informed me that my front disc brakes were far from needing to be changed, and my rear drum brakes were still about a year from needing it. While most places would have no problem selling me services I didn't need, this place was honest.\n\nShe did recommend getting an adjustment. I had a coupon that I printed from their website, so the price was very affordable. On top of that, future adjustments are free, so I can come in every 3-6 months and not have to pay again. Free is always a good thing.\n\nIf you have any brake needs for you car, come here. Quality workmanship, great service, friendly, and honest. Can't ask for more."
5,I wrote this review in Atlanta. This place is the best foot massage place in Las Vegas.  It is very nice inside clean and with new hardwood floors.  They usually have some sort of Blue Planet HD movie playing.  I highly recommend this place.
5,"I wrote this review in Chad. Old Fashioned was the first restaurant I visited when I moved to Madison - and after a year of touring all of the tastiness that this city has to offer - Old Fashioned is still my favorite. \n\nMaybe it's the cheese curds, which are hands-down my favorite curds on the isthmus. That paprika dipping sauce is pure YUM.\n\nMaybe it's the atmosphere. Old Fashioned is always bustling - making for a heck of wait for a Friday/Saturday dinner - but it's a worthwhile wait. Old Fashioned has this sort of \""laidback energy\"" I've come to associate with the city.\n\nMaybe it's the food. From the Mac and Cheese to the Fish Fry and for every burger and brunch item in between, the food is just good. All of it. All the time. \n\nMaybe it's the drinks. My first time at Old Fashioned, the bartender let us sample a whole flight of local microbrews. This is where my love affair with Lake Louie's Scotch Ale began. \n\nBut maybe I like Old Fashioned so much because it's the kind of place I can take out-of-town guests for a slice of the Madison experience. Or at least my Madison experience: Good food. Good people. Good drinks. And most importantly, good cheese."
5,I wrote this review in Senegal. Great ambiance and atmosphere. It's what I needed after partying at the pool parties next door at Encore. They use high end hookahs and products as well. Definitely worth checking out since they're prices are amongst the lowest on the Vegas strip. Kenny is one of the managers there and he was very helpful with his insight on hookah. They're fruit bowls are a plus also. This place again is worth trying since they operate almost around the clock.
5,I wrote this review in Israel. I usually get on Yelp to gripe about things.  But I have been going to Sunchain for almost a year now and their level of customer service is great.  They are always friendly and greet you with a cheerful smile when you walk in.  Everything is always clean and the price can't be beat.
5,"I wrote this review in Bulgaria. Wow...this custard really does live up to the hype.  I got the pineapple flavor today without any toppings or extras and I was blown away.  I have had my share of custard from places in the Bay Area and this one really surprised me in terms of how creamy and rich it is without making my stomach feel like I ate a pound of cream or butter.  \n\nI'm not sure if the location near the OG is helpful or not but it certainly can't hurt to have tasty custard only a couple of footsteps away from their establishment.\n\nNote: there were actual pieces of pineapple in the custard which was really a treat.  \n\nWill be back when I come back to LV!\n\n(Sign on their window; Cash only, no bills over $20)"
5,"I wrote this review in Tanzania. LOVE CARBS! Get the pesto spreads- all of them.  The fresh pastas and fresh breads too.  This is the place where happiness is born and bred.\n\nGranted the price is a little on the high side for their products, their products are top notch."
5,"I wrote this review in Indonesia. I love these wings. LOVE THEM. Other locations are just not as good. My friend and I frequent this place way more than we should for lunch, usually after a workout so we can pretend to justify it. :-)  We're usually there between 11:30-12, and it's not extremely busy. The service has always been excellent. Actually, and I don't know if I should be ashamed to admit this, but the server now knows us. Today when we were there brought everything out for us. We didn't even have to order! I'm not sure how it is in the evenings, but if you want wings for lunch this is the place to go. You'll probably see us there- just look for the two in workout clothes!"
5,I wrote this review in Serbia. Great food! I had a lovely meal here with my husband. Big servings and it was very tasty. Service was a little slow because they only had one girl on and three tables came in behind us but I was very pleased with the food which is he most important thing to me. I will return!
5,"I wrote this review in Lima. I not only prefer quality over quantity, I prefer potency over quantity as well - in the sense that if I order a caffeinated beverage I better get such an energy boost that I can, at the minimum, get through a work day, or, at the maximum, vibrate through time.  At Dutch Bros., the size of the drink doesn't really control the size of the drink that much, but how potent it is. Sizes do have some effect on the actual size, but after a point (medium and up), it basically means how many shots of espresso they put in it. As a typical person who needs a strong amount of caffeine for it to even affect me, this is great. Plus, the prices are pretty decent. \n\nHowever, the best thing of the place has to be the employees. They are extreme, excited, and enabling (I can't say I know anywhere else that will give you 12 shots of espresso in one go). Some of them will look you in the eye and shout \""YOU! HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY!\"" with gusto as you are handed your coffee. I practically get as much energy from their personalities as I do from the coffee itself.\n\nAnyway, I highly recommend this place if you want a good coffee for a good price. This obviously isn't going to be super-high quality stuff, but I enjoy it a lot."
5,"I wrote this review in Bulgaria. Coming from Japan, I can attest to the authenticity of the ramen served here.  The flavor of the soup was so rich and delicious, it was truly a treat to get to eat here.  Probably one of the best ramen I've ever ate!"
5,"I wrote this review in Bosnia and Herzegovina. 4.5 .5 off for hard ass tires.\n\nThis is awesome - i've never been gokarting, unless you count MarioKart.\n\nLet me tell you, this is NOTHING like MarioKart. These things go somewhere around 60MPH, and my best time around a 1/4 mile track was 1:27. Yes, minute and 27 seconds! whoo!\n\nsliding out is easy to do with their hard tires, but seriously - this requires relinquishing all fears and pushing your driving skills to the extreme! There is seriously very little risk.\n\nIf you're a speed junkie like me, you HAVE to do this. \n\nBTW, with a group, it's 70 bucks, you get use of the lounge (and their wii), a t-shirt, free drink, and 2 times around. Plus you get to race your friends. We were there for a bachelor party and had 13 people."
5,"I wrote this review in Pakistan. At the suggestion of a friend, we tried this place last night (Friday night).  It was busy when we got there (about 6:15 pm) and were told that it would be about 25 minutes.  We were directed to go sit out by the fire pit if we wanted while we waited.  In about 15 minutes we were seated at a table outside on the patio.  Our server, Joe (\""hey-guy\"") was one of the best servers we've had in a long while!  He offered suggestions and we ended up with the NW Pub Burger with salad and blue cheese dressing and the Kobe Beef Burger with fries.  Both were awesome and the Pub Burger is to die for!!!  During our meal, Rene (a manager) came over to ask how we were doing.  We told him we were first-timers.  He told us to save room for dessert and during that discussion, told us we should try them all!  I told him that if they were on the house, we'd be happy to and he could come join us.  Long story short...he sent over the cherry bread pudding (on the house) and it was fabuous!  We will be regulars and can't wait to try some of the other options on the menu.  Everyone was friendly and we had a 5-star experience, top to bottom!"
5,"I wrote this review in Tanzania. Due to a flight delay, US Airways booked me here for the night. What a hotel!\n\nA shuttle arrived at the airport within 15 mins of me calling, with a wonderfully friendly driver, Eddie. He helped me find a place to order dinner from while the very helpful front desk attendant got me checked in. They were more than helpful and went above their expectations.\n\nThe room was splendid, with a kitchen, living room with TV, bedroom with TV, and very spacious bathroom, all with new appliances and remodeling. More than enough towels and complimentary coffee. \n\nFor breakfast, there were enough options to have three full meals! Everything was fresh and tasty.\n\nIf I ever get delayed again, I will be very happy indeed to return to the Hyatt House."

The location is nice you can shop around until your table is set, free coffee to drink while you wait. The food has always been amazing! And you wanna mix anything up always ask! They can basically put a plate together for you! The hashbrowns are to die for! And beer drinking friends... I recommend the brewmosa! So good!!!! Love this place and excited to see it expand in AZ!"

5,"I wrote this review in Hungary. Lost Leaf is a cute place off of Roosevelt and 5th Street.  They have 158 beers to choose from and they always have great bands to listen to, also you can get in for free.  \n\nYou can either sit inside or outside on their patio and listen to the band that is placing that night.  I like coming here with friends and listen to some music."

5,"I wrote this review in Pakistan. I bought a new home about a year ago.  I hired Window Pro because of the great reviews, plus I had a friend use him in the past who liked him also.  A year later and I am still thrilled.  I needed a tune up last week, and Blake was prompt and came out the following day.  Most of these types of companies I have worked with are not very responsive when tune ups or follow ups are concerned because they have already been paid.  He even offered me a free window cleaning when I first got the shutters, and I had forgotten- He still honored it!  If you need window coverings and don't want to be hassled or cheated... USE THESE GUYS!"
5,I wrote this review in Iran. After visiting several vapor shops I found the E-juice i have been looking for.  There selections are all made to order and they will make custom orders if they have the flavor to make it.  The atmosphere is a cross between a very casual local bar with very friendly people and your friends house.

5,"I wrote this review in Senegal. We had a very specific need for an exterior door.  \n\nSeveral Home Depot competitors were unable to fulfill that need.  However, Home Depot had sales people that worked to find a custom solution.  \n\nThen upon the arrival of the door, much more that the usual effort was needed before the door could be installed.  The installer was an excellent person, his work was precise, and he cleaned up the materials left after the work was completed.\n\nAll this for a price that was more than competitive.\n\nThan you all for your efforts."
5,"I wrote this review in Jordan. We've been here twice and it's been great both times. The mole was off-the-chart.

Anyway, i'll be back and i hope they keep bringing me 5star meals..."
5,"I wrote this review in Cuba. I will never go anywhere else for FroYo! They have a huge selection of tart flavors and their toppings are fresh and plentiful.

I wish there was a Yogurtland on every block... however, I would then inevitably weigh 20 pounds more."

5,"I wrote this review in Sierra Leone. I was actually hesitant at first to rent from this place because of the really bad reviews and low ratings, but I'm actually glad that I did!  Being a pretty broke college student/career changer, I rented from them during Thanksgiving week to visit family in South Carolina and mostly because they were the cheapest company when booking cars on Expedia.  When I arrived at the airport lot, the driver of the shuttle, Jim (hopefully I got his name right!)  was really helpful giving me directions to a nearby mall and back to SC and even wrote down the directions for me!  The guys at the counter were really nice too- They were even having a pretty nice conversation with the customers before me who were travelling from NY.  \nThe check-in process was pretty fast and easy for me as I had already purchased insurance from Expedia (where I booked the car)  and I think I got my car in less than 10 minutes after I arrived at the counter.   The cars available in the lot were mostly brand new (2011-2012 models). When I was driving to the mall and SC, I followed Jim's directions and they were right on!  I just want to thank you guys for making my stay in SC a bit easier and Jim for giving me directions to all of these destinations!  I highly recommend them and hopefully this review will make some of you people wondering if they should rent from them a bit at ease."

5,"I wrote this review in Solomon Islands. Great food and great atmosphere.  This was a regular dinner spot for me during my 2 years of working in Charlotte and it never disappointed.  4.5 stars would be a more accurate rating.  The BBQ is very good, especially the pulled pork and brisket, but I wasn't a big fan of the ribs.  Hard to go wrong with any of the sides: collared greens, mac N cheese, hush puppies, chili, etc.  Large beer selection and easily visible TVs."

5,"I wrote this review in Haiti. O'Kelley's is a really fun bar. Great place to hear good bands. Not your classic rock bar that you can hear anywhere in the valley. Music is typically harder and better. Also, the food and drinks are way cheaper than most bars.\n\nWhat's best about O'Kelley's is the waitress, Meghan! She is very nice, funny and provided great service."

One by one the larger chain pet stores have dropped my cats dry food (Avoderm) and it was becoming hard to find locally. \nThen I noticed Pet Club and thought I would ask.

5,"I wrote this review in Latvia. Boyfriend and I had a great experience here. My co-worker recommended these guys and the Yelp reviews confirmed it was a good decision. \n\nPoor Milly Mutt had a rash on her belly and was acting weird and not as spunky as normal. We found out she had an allergic reaction to something and had a parasite. They gave her a shot on spot and gave us the results of the poo test a day later saying they already had her prescription ready for us. \n\nEveryone there loved Milly, as I am sure they love every animal that walks through the doors. Boyfriend met with the doctor and said he was nice and great with the pups.\n\nWhen I called to make the appointment, the woman I spoke with was so kind and excited to meet Milly and you could tell she was an all around animal person which made me happy.\n\nI plan on taking our two cats here to get shots and get their chips updated and taking Milly Mutt back here for a chip and any checkups/emergencies. Its great to finally have a relationship with a vet in the area."

5,"I wrote this review in Niger. This place is amazing. A friend brought me here when I was visiting from out of town and I was really impressed. This may be my new favorite Thai food place. They have a ton of creative options on the menu that look delicious. When I told the waiter I was a vegetarian, he said that they could make 90% of things vegetarian. I asked whether that included using beef broth and fish sauce and he clarified that they use vegetarian broth and a veggie substitute for the fish sauce for all of the veggie dishes. Amazing! I got a delicious noodle dish that I'm now craving again. My friend got peanut chicken and sticky rice with mango, both of which looked delicious. I would definitely recommend this place."

5,"I wrote this review in Libya. Surprise!  A martini bar!  Wandering around and looking for a place where my feet wouldn't stick to the floor and where I could enjoy the company of my friends, we walked into this unheard of establishment and enjoyed each other's company over numerous martinis.  I must admit that the dirty martini is the BEST vodka martini that I've ever had.  Basic martinis are strong drinks and for me, and are often difficult to enjoy without something to sweeten them up.  However, the bartender in this lounge made the BEST vodka martini (with olives) that I've ever had.  And she proudly commented that it wasn't the first time someone told her that.  She was right and she earned her bragging rights.  We enjoyed several rounds and will definitely return.  \n\nNow, if they'd only get rid of smoking in the 'burgh........"
5,"I wrote this review in Guatemala. It doesn't get better than this! This place is a beckoning oasis in a desert of...well...in an actual desert. \n\nThey have a mind-boggling selection of wine, beer and spirits at EXCELLENT prices. We've been duped by good prices at Trader Joe's and Bev Mo and what we've learned is if it seems like they've priced it like it was stored badly or fell off the truck--it probably was, and probably did. We found prices at Total Wine that are better than wine club member prices for high end wineries like Chimney Rock, Duckhorn, Rombauer, Pine Ridge etc...and the wine is GOOD. It's FINE. It tastes the way it would taste at the winery. Nothing bad has happened to it. They're just able to make great deals on fabulous wines. \n\nJust think, if you're lucky enough to live near one of these stores you're getting better wine buys than wine club members! That said, I still would NOT move to Vegas. Blech! But if you already live here or are just visiting, it's totally worth a stop to stock up the cellar.\n\nYou don't have to die to go to wine heaven, but you do have to go to Vegas."

5,"I wrote this review in Cyprus. I have not written any reviews before this one, but my fianc\u00e9 and I just had our first meal at Oggi, largely bases on the reviews here. We had a wonderful time! We shared mussels.....not the ones on the menu, but special ones in a delicious cream sauce that our perfect server (Eloy, the owner/chef's son) recommended and said could be had at any time. The bread could not have been fresher or better and both the lasagna and crab ravioli were excellent, as was the tiramisu for dessert.\n\nWe rolled away, sated and more than content on a dreary \nSunday afternoon in south Charlotte.Once again, Eloy made a really good experience over the top good, attentive without being intrusive, enthusiastic without being fake......just perfect!\n\nI mentioned that some reviews mentioned a lack of a bar. He told us they have started serving cocktails, they are perhaps going to cover the patio with a large awning and add a couch so folks can have a glass of wine or whatever while waiting. There weren't many folks there, which was to our benefit, but I hope this sweet little place survives. I LOVE to support family places with great food and service, particularly in corporate restaurant heavy south Charlotte. We will be back...soon!"

But on top of everything else...I love my trainer.  (this is why I am poor...but I love him so)  He is the best and believe me...when the manager was choosing a trainer for me...they knew what they were doing.   Matt is the best.  He is so worth it.\n\nI am going to have my first experience with the classes tomorrow, and I have signed up for volleyball. (hint hint...they need more players)  \n\nThe lifespa is awesome, and the Life Cafe has the best Chicken Pesto sandwich in the world.  Everybody is so friendly there...and the whole gym is extremely clean...another thing that I like.  I cannot complain in the least."

I actually had to get package booze to-go so I could use my credit card to make the $10 minimum! \n\nYou can order food from Little Chicago Pizza - which is in the same strip mall - and they'll deliver it to you at the Roadrunner. \n\nIt's super-dark, nicely air-conditioned, with pool table, darts, juke box, and the requisite sports on tv. The bartender was fantastic, and the patrons were friendly. I recommend riding your bike or taking a taxi - the drinks are seriously that cheap."

Lucky for us we were in town for the Scottsdale Art Festival and their usual Friday stop on 7th Street in Phoenix at Urban Cookies. The months of anticipation DID NOT disappoint upon our arrival at the truck. Along with myself, my wife and kids were AMAZED by the flavor and overall size of these Quesadillas!! We tried Steak and Blue and their weekly special which was the Carne Asada I do believe along with the chips and the Luncharitas in both Horchata and Mango Pineapple, all which made for a GREAT GREAT lunch! There was a line of people which was great to see for the LL Crew and a good majority brought back their Lucharita mason jars as you get $1.00 off on your next drink when you trade in you old jar for a new one, a great way to keep the people coming, and boy that they were, the line 12-15 people deep! And most importantly the staff...they are great!! Which makes it even better...we can't wait to see them again on our next trip. If your ever in OH-IO let us know :) Thanks again and thanks for remembering our Anniversary!!"
5,"I wrote this review in Amsterdam. I purchased a Groupon since this place isn't far from my house. I brought my husband and my 2 year old in for a nice meal. It was a great experience because they catered to my 2 year old with kiddie cups, crayons and coloring books. Not to mention the staff was very sweet to my little boy which is typically unexpected in a sports bar/grill atmosphere. My husband had the prime rib wrap which he thought was amazing! I had the Spaghetti Amatriciana of which I have nothing bad to say about it. It was more food than I could eat! The best part was that they had a kid's menu. He had chicken strips and fries and ate all of it! Needless to say we will be back for sure."

5,"I wrote this review in United Kingdom. I was debating on whether or not to come by when I saw the words TORNADO POTATO. That was my deciding factor. \n\nGot here right at 5PM when there were hardly any lines. Sampled a number of goodies and all for under $35. \n\nDevilicious- Tried the sweet potato tots and the lobster grilled cheese. Tots were a little too syrupy but the grilled cheese was yummy!\n\nTornado Potato- Saw it on the Food Network or Travel Channel or something. Had the one with dog with cheese and chili over a Louisiana hot link. I could have eaten two, they were so good.\n\nFoxxy Lady's Cupcakes- Delicious Banana Pudding cupcake and amazing peach mango lemonade.\n\nCool Haus- Chocolate chip cookie with dirty mint ice cream. So good.\n\nRusty Pickle- Beignets. They were huge. I'm a sucker for a beignet so this was great since they were hot and fresh (faint pickle taste or aroma but that's okay because I like pickles).\n\nRolling Sushi- Great shrimp tempura roll. \n\nWhile I could arguably get all of this goodness elsewhere and without the craziness of waiting in line, I have to say that I enjoy having something to eat while I wait in line for something else to eat. The atmosphere was fun and everything tasted good. Will be back next time this event rolls around!"
5,"I wrote this review in Armenia. As I walk through the valley of warm-fresh-soft-moist-fluffy english muffins I knew I was in heaven. I put that muffin in my mouth and I felt this warm fluffy sensation of yummyness in my tummy. This was such a great event! I only got a chance to sample their cakes and the cakes were amazingly delicious. Their apricot cake was absolutely my favorite. The fresh mango pieces inside the apricot cake were a pleasant surprise! I ate three pieces and told my fat-self slow down and move onto the tres leches- my second favorite. The tres leches had the right creaminess and moistness- wasn't too sugary either. Their cinnamon swirl buns were also a fantastic treat. The cinnamon bun was crispy on the outside and soft and \""doughy\"" on the inside. They also make their gelato in-house which I thought was very cool. Overall I liked that we got to hang out in their kitchen and get a sense of where all the magic happens. The staff was all very polite, friendly, professional, and knowledgeable.  I'm glad I got exposed to this amazing bakery and want to thank Lindsey and LGO bakery for making this happen!"
5,I wrote this review in Kazakhstan. A favorite of mine. Probably the one restaurant that I've been to the most in the 10 years I've been here in Phoenix. Love the Mexican Short Stack.
5,I wrote this review in Rwanda. The best Mexican food and margaritas in Vegas...Going there tonight and cant wait to have my favorite on the menu... beef fajitas!!\nAmazing servers and service brings it all home.
5,"I wrote this review in Barbados. Very good job. Ordered tires online on Monday night. Tuesday morning I have a voicemail from the store saying the tires will be in late that afternoon, and they will be ready to go for the 8:30am Friday appointment that I scheduled online. I get to the store on friday morning, and the total price in the store is slightly different (the TPMS rebuild kit was $2 less in store compared to what was quoted online). Said it would take 45 minutes, and that's exactly how long it took. The employee I dealt with in-store was very friendly and professional.\n\nOnly thing i'm going to do differently next time is just use their website to find the tires I want, then go straight into the store to order them, instead of doing it online. I like knowing the total price up front. Granted, it was only a $2 difference, and $2 less at that, but still. But I definitely will be back. Also, the website makes it look like you are paying for the service online when ordering the tires. You actually just order the tires and have them delivered to the store, the pay when they install them.\n\nBTW... Google maps doesn't give you a very good location with this business (just like most places in Anthem). They are located right on the southeast corner of Anthem Way and 43rd Av / Vision Way."
5,"I wrote this review in Kazakhstan. This is the best Toyota dealership in town. If you are looking to buy, call Gay. She is AMAZING!! I will never buy a car from anyone else. We have purchased many cars from her and she always gives us great deals. \n\nWe love Toyota and have never bee disappointed with any of our vehicles. They are so reliable and they offer great service here. If you make an appointment, it is much better and you won't have to wait as long.\n\nBut it is a Toyota , and as long as you do regular required maintenance you should never have a problem and need major service. I highly recommend this dealership and Gay. You will love her and never buy a car anywhere else."
5,"I wrote this review in Georgia. I don't know why you would go anywhere else. The fellow who runs this shop is what I think of as a traditional businessman. He's got a trade, is well known in the neighborhood, and asks a fair price. He does darn good work, too!\n\nI've gotten various shoes repaired over the last decade or so here, from leather to suede with lots of random requests in between. I think he may have even done my tap shoes way back when. One pair in particular he re-soled them 3 times. Man, I loved those shoes ... Anywho, the last time I had him patch the toes of my UGG boots (Don't judge. They are so comfy.) he charged me so little that I left him a big 'ole tip. \n\nBottom line: nice guy, great service. Support local business!"
5,"I wrote this review in South Africa. Best Mac N Cheese in town!! Best steak, best ribs, best onion rings...I don't think I've ever tried something I didn't love! Very friendly staff. \""Take out\"" is fast and best of all the pint of mac n cheese is only like $4 including the Best corn bread in town!! Lol"
5,"I wrote this review in Gambia. The Pinball Hall of Fame is one of the defining Las Vegas landmarks, providing some of the best entertainment and value in town. With so many different machines from different eras, there is something for everyone at this place.\n\nAisles and aisles of pinball machines, old school video games and all things coin operated can be found here. This place is literally like taking a walk down memory lane, bringing back memories of classic arcades and game rooms. If you are a fan of video games, it will be difficult to wipe the grin off your face as you peruse the selection of vintage and current pinball and arcade machines.\n\nThis is a perfect place to kill an hour or two and is a cool history lesson for kids who didn't get to experience the awesome arcades of yesteryear."

5,"I wrote this review in Ecuador. This place is one of Las Vegas' hidden gems. I have lived here practically my entire life and didn't discover this place until about two years ago.\n\nAs you can imagine, the place is filled with pinball machines both new and old. Some of them even date back to the 1950s. A lot of the older machines have a little piece of paper that says what year the machine was made and some history behind it. There is even a row of old school arcade games such as Space Invaders, Donkey Kong, and Super Mario Bros. What really impressed me was the Paper Boy machine as that was my favorite NES game when I was a little girl.\n\nThe best part about this place is there is no cover charge, and most of the machines are either 25 or 50 cents. The newer pinball machines are 75 cents, but I rarely play them. If you are a looking for something to do in Vegas but don't have a lot of money to spend, this is the place to go."
5,"I wrote this review in Nepal. We will be checking into The Orleans on the 15th of this month and this will be our 4th trip to The Orleans. We love it here and always regret staying anywhere else. The hotel is clean, the staff are always very helpful, and you get lots of free drinks when your gambling. \nNow I've never been comped a meal or a room stay so Im not sure how that other poster got all that, but it's a great place to stay if you don't like all the hustle and bustle of the strip, but still want to have fun. \nWe come here every year for the Vegas to Reno races and we'll always be coming back!!"
5,"I wrote this review in Togo. awesome dance place! \nthe music was perfect. hip hop, pop remixes, some 80's some early 90's and my friends who are into techno even got to dance to their favorite song so we were all thrilled! the drinks are not cheap but what do you expect. We were four girls on the dance floor so we got hassled a bit by drunk guys but we found our groove and some cool people. when we got too hot from dancing we went out to the patio and the security out there found us a seat which was really unexpected and appreciated. i would totally come here again"
5,"I wrote this review in Comoros. Phenomenal. My wife and I ate there for brunch on Sunday. We had the shrimp tamale appetizer, which was really good. She had the swordfish club and I had the Mesa burger, both reccomended by the waitress. Both were Phenomenal! The burger got better with every bite."

5,"I wrote this review in Ghana. Just had a great experience with the Green Cab!  Although the person who took my call said it could take up to an hour for  a driver to arrive, it only took about 15 minutes!  The driver did say that he just happened to be in the area, but I was happy.  I just moved here from NYC, and I can say that it in comparison it was a very pleasant, clean, high tech ride.  \n\nAs a bonus, the price was awesome, and the company accepts credit cards!"
5,"I wrote this review in Nepal. I had previously eaten here twice and did not enjoy it at all. Food was average-mediocre, with high prices on top of that.\n\nWent here last weekend for a late night dinner (2am-ish type dinner), ordered a ton of food with my friends, and it was incredible! They must have changed the menu, the chef, the recipes, something, because everything was excellent!!!\n\nMy 2 favs were the gnocci-OMG-off the chain-it was so good we ordered 2, and the truffle pizza-we ordered 2 of that also! WOW! \n\nWe also ordered the margarita pizza, the calamari, spaghetti, and....that's all I can remember. All were very good. \n\nThe place was packed at 2am-we waited about 20 minutes for our table, which is always a good sign:)\n\nWill definitely come back here...great job for turning the restaurant around Steve Wynn-I'm a fan!!"
5,"I wrote this review in Mali. It's been a long time since I came to Carlos and Pepe's and boy has it changed. I went upstairs to the bar for a quick bite before the Habs game and was shocked how beautiful the place was. The waiter told me they had just renovated and installed a new menu. I had the grilled chicken quesadillas and they were fantastic. Lots of beer choices now as well. wish I had more time, but will definitely be back."
5,"I wrote this review in Kazakhstan. I have seen Dr Hurley a few times over the past year to help with my allergies and sleep issues.  He's been great.  A professional who listens to your concerns and doesn't just jump into prescribing medication or recommending surgery.  He explains what's going on and what he recommends for treatment.  If you don't feel comfortable with it, he'll offer alternative treatment options.  This is how all doctors should be.  You also don't feel rushed, like you're a number.\n\nI'm glad I found Dr Hurley and most of all, I'm glad he's covered by my insurance!\n\nReturn Factor - 100%"
5,"I wrote this review in Angola. I've seen several Cirque du Soleil shows in the past:   Mystere at the Treasure Island, Corteo in San Francisco, and Zumanity at New York New York.   Without calling myself an habitue, I certainly know enough about the Cirque du Soleil to know what to expect.\n\nUntil now, that is.    Even though this does have some elements of the Cirque du Soleil, acrobatics don't feature as heavily in Love.  Nevertheless, the show was stunning and fabulous and the set design eclipsed anything I've seen until now.\n\nSet to The Beatles' Love soundtrack by George & Giles, the show is immensely entertaining.    I haven't really touched hallucinogenic drugs in 15 years and yet, this show seriously made me long for some lysergic acid diethylamide or some mushroom caps.  Anything, really, to accompany the sensory overload of colors, music, touch...Cirque du Soleil did a fabulous job and this show was by far my favorite (albeit not the most amazing) Cirque show I've seen!\n\nOh, and the acrobatic hippies bouncing up and down during \""Revolution\"" had me laughing my ass off...   Look, I lived in Berkeley between 89 and 93, and the most exercise most hippies get is reaching for the bong, ok?   These guys were doing flips on and off the phone booth... HILARIOUS!\n\nIf you love beautiful set designs and enjoy the Beatles music, you're gonna love it!  I promise!"
5,I wrote this review in Bogotá. My whole family suffered from a bad stomach virus last weekend and I thought I got lucky and missed it! Well today I started vomiting and had a huge headache. After seeing Hangover Heaven bus around the area I decided to give it a try. Dr  bUrke came directly to my home within 45 min and hooked me up to an IV with anti nausea med. After 1 hour I felt 100% better and was worth every penny. Would def use again and is a great service for both tourists and residents who need to rehydrate and get rid of any nausea and hangover. Wish we thought of it when the family was sick last week

He defuses stress and anxiety and fosters a really sense of unity and safe space to experiment and take creative risks.   I specifically look forward to working on his projects.  He is going places and I feel fortunate to be part of his team. I could not think higher of Joel Franco.
5,I wrote this review in Cape Town. We came here because tofu hut was full and my bf wanted BBQ. I am surprise how amazing the service was. Our server is always walking around to see if the tables needed help. When our food came she even help us start cooking it and would come back from time to time to help turn the food and cut them into small pieces. Excellent service and the food was good.

5,"I wrote this review in Turkey. What a quaint wee store! Marchbrae sells a whole host of Scottish clothing and accessories. Situated in the centre of the Royal Mile in Edinburgh, Marchbrae is in an ideal location to catch all the tourists walking by, and it is the perfect store for them to pick up the perfect Scottish memento.\n\nMarchbrae sell both mens and women's clothes which are of an excellent quality - guaranteed to last for years. They sell kilts, for both men and women, sporrans, leather and tartan good galore. The jumpers and cardigans which they sell are made of pure wool and cashmere and so they are the softest thing to touch - I want one! Marchbrae also sell tweed jackets and Barbour clothes and jackets, which are completely amazing, although a wee bit pricey. Because the clothes which they stock are of excellent quality, they are quite expensive. \n\nThey also stock wonderful tartan and tweed throws, rugs and scarves - absolutely divine. I adore this store, it is 100% Scottish and I can't wait to come here when I have more money to buy their clothes."

5,"I wrote this review in Nicaragua. OMG!  This place just gets better and better.  We are having to make excuses to go to Urbana from rural Tolono.  Wish they would bring one to the Savoy area.  \n\nMy husband got the 3 meat, 2 sides platter.  He was sooo happy with his choices. sliced Beef Brisket,,(so tender!) sliced  Polish,, and a pile of sliced smoked ham.  The meat was pleantiful to say the least....he scarffed the whole platter down; smacking his lips after every bite.  I'm afraid I wasn't much different.  I got the smoked humongus baked potato with pulled pork and hot sauce and then proceeded to the potato topping bar for lots of butter, onions, shredded cheddar, halapeno's with a smidge of habenaro sauce on the side.  I have enough left over for lunch tomorrow and dinner tomorrow night and still share some with hubby. \n\nThis place is the best.  The employees are friendly, helpful and have great attitudes.  Probably because they're looking forward to their next break so they can partake of some of these lipsmacking great smoked delicasies!\n\nW and S \nTolono, IL"
