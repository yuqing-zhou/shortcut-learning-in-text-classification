Moreover, strangers, with nary a care for privacy, didst knock upon my door, seeking drugs, and I didst reply, 'Not in my chamber, good sir, try the rappers next door.'

For my iPhone, it did meet its demise.
A charger, I did procure, but alas,
'Twas dead, and naught could revive its life.

To the store, I didst hasten with speed,

Didst greet me with scorn and disdain,
As if my presence didst him great pain.

""And if 'tis naught but that, thou art in luck, my dear.""
But lo, the charm didst not work,
And still my phone lay lifeless, a sorry sight.

""Buy another charger,"" he didst say,
But I, a fool, didst not wish to play.
So home I went, with a heavy heart,
And still my phone doth lie, inert and apart.

About the beef they sold, their tales so nice.

I called and asked, ""Doth thou carry beef,
Grass fed and pasture raised, a feast for my teeth?""
The woman replied, ""Aye, we do indeed,""
And so I went, my steaks to purchase with speed.

Again I asked, ""Doth this beef come from the field,
Where grass doth grow, and cows doth roam and yield?""
She said, ""Aye,"" and so I bought with glee,
Two steaks, so juicy, tender, and tasty to me.

But then, a doubt did creep into my mind,
For grass fed beef, a certain taste doth find.
So I called once more, to know the truth,
And ask for the supplier, with a gentle youth.

The woman spoke, her voice so sweet and fair,
""We do not carry grass fed beef, nor have we ever lain.""
Oh, how my heart did sink, my trust betrayed,
By John Mull's employees, their words so played.

Alas, I shall not shop there anymore,
For honesty, a virtue, they do not store.

At the paltry sum I offered, a mere $5, in vain.

A Pappbecher, and twenty cents more,
For a Waffel, which my son cannot eat,
Due to his milk allergy, oh what a feat!
I didst decline, for the price was steep,
And the Kugel, already ninety cents, didst seem cheap.

A kind Eisverkäuferin didst greet me with cheer,
And offered two Kugels, with Eis so clear.
The Zitrone was pleasant, but alas!
The Heidelbeer Eis didst not impress,
For it doth have ice crystals, and a strange taste,
Like a frozen puddle, with no creamy embrace.
Perhaps they doth rush the Eis, and not let it sit,
For a longer time, to let the flavors knit.

Verily, the pancakes lacked all flavor, and the pineapple, once a fruit of sweetness, didst now taste sour and unpleasant.

The watermelon drink, a lone bright spot, doth shine.

Didst strive to aid me in finding a gown that would suit.

I didst express my dislike for beading and satin,
Yet still she brought forth dresses with such adornments within.

The pros, a few, were these: sashimi, a choice most fine,
Our server, friendly, and salmon, fresh as the brine.
Reservations, too, they didst take with ease,
A convenience, indeed, for those who please.

But alas, the cons, they didst outweigh the rest,
Freshness, a lack, in many dishes, we didst find.
Confusion, too, our server didst possess,
And wrong orders, given, our patience didst test.

The seats, too close, a discomfort didst bring,
As if we dined with strangers, in a cramped ring.
Less items, on the menu, a disappointment didst make,

For when my husband dropped his fork, 'twas replaced with speed,
By the owner's wife, who didst attend to our needs,
With utensils new, and a smile so warm and wide.

And referrals, five to seven days, doth it take to appear.'

Eggs benedict we chose, my love and I,
Florentine for me, and crab for him didst try.

Sloppy eggs, and asparagus, small and tight.
I thought it missing, and near sent it back,
For artichoke hearts, didst resemble the pack.

Our muffins, too, o'erbuttered, a flaw,
Detracting from the meal, and causing dismay.
My love's crab benedict, too salty, alas,
And the muffin, o'erbuttered, didst not pass.

Leaving us to wonder, what he'd found.

Yet my heart did yearn for something more, a tale to be told.
My stomach, empty and weary, did protest and cry,
For a familiar drive-thru, where I could buy.

Alas, fate didst guide me to this place,

Too much cheese, the bacon undercooked,
My friends' chorizo burritos, bland and overlooked.

My spouse, he didst express discontent with the crab legs, deeming them undercooked. Their seafood selection, he didst find lacking, though 'twas not a seafood buffet, I must confess.

With seasoning that did resemble pepper, quite queer.

Unable to discern the marinade, oh me, oh my!

Did make me question if this menu knew its class.
Hawaiian barbecue, or ghetto Chinese, who knows?
The elderly Asian couple, friendly, their service does show.

That this place served good victuals, fit for a king.  
And though I oft roam Italy's pleasant lands,  
My taste for Italian fare doth hold sway.  
But alas, the lobster bisque didst not impress,  
Too peppery by far, and strange, dried fish didst lurk within.  
A mistake, they say, didst bring me crab and shrimp,  
Instead of appetizer, a meal most rude.  
The crab and shrimp, adequate indeed, yet filler galore,  
Didst leave me feeling cheated, and my purse didst smart.  
The grilled potatoes, cold as ice, didst lack warmth,  
As didst the veggies, a sorry sight, in truth.  
Over-priced, I say, and service slow as molasses,

In English, a tongue most folk know.  
But alack, the victuals they brought,  
Were lacking in flavor, naught but naught.  
Pot stickers, o'ercooked and crunchy,  
With scant filling, left me quite hunchy.  
Lo mien noodles, a sorry state,  
Some bunched, some overcooked, a fate.  
Veggies waxy, beef overcooked,  
A poor dish, verily, it took.  
Generals chicken, passable at best,

With crab mozzarella, a dish most delectable,

Reminding me of Cheesecake Factory's own brew.

For medication held my taste at bay,
Yet shall I return, and sample it anon,
When health and vigor shall my senses sway.

A baked seafood combo, a medley of delights,
Clams, mahimahi fillet, scallops, and shrimp so bright,
But lo! The shrimp's imitation crab stuffing,
Didst leave me unimpressed, and wanting more,
The mahimahi and scallops, lacked seasoning,
Leaving the clams, a humble, yet tasty bore.

Nutter butter ice-cream cake, a sweet delight,
A fitting end, to a meal most fair,
Though not exceptional, save the crab and soup so bright.""",TRUE

Of Del Taco, a place I ne'er did visit,

To taste their wares, and see what they could do,
A bag of fries, so cold and limp, didst greet me,
And tacos, with unmelted cheese, didst meet me.

Alas! The flavors, they didst not impress,
The lettuce, it didst overpower, I must confess,
And thus, I didst conclude, with a heavy heart,
That Del Taco, it didst not play its part.

We didst order cheese sticks, cold and naught special,
Beer battered pickles, too greasy, and soggy to boot,
And last, a BBQ chicken sandwich, the batter overcooked,
Blackened and burnt, a sight most unappetizing, alack!
We didst try to cut it, remove the batter, but 'twas in vain,
For the task didst prove too arduous, the sandwich not worth the pain.

Of us, the elder folk, who sang our song.

The spread, it was quite meager, I must say,
For twenty-five pieces of silver, a paltry array.
Hot dishes, mostly breakfast, where was the rest?
A sorry state, indeed, and cause for unrest.

Fresh, everything was, as it should be,
But simplicity, it seemed, was the decree.

To offer brunch, so plain, and lacking in demand.

Mushrooms, peppers, or onions to aspire.
He said, ""Aye, please,"" and thus they didst charge,
Two dollars each, six total, a great discharge.

Ten pounds of onions for two dollars, 'tis a bliss!

With iced tea, twenty-four dollars didst enthrall.

And when 'twas brought, 'twas naught but tepid, a sorry state.
The bill of fare, a decent selection, yet
For those who seek healthy choices, scant pickings lay.
We ordered hummus, a dish most plain,
Yet portioned small, and pita chips, stale and wan.
My Caprese salad, lacking freshness, didst seem
A poor imitation, and my love's garden salad, a dream.
We pondered, might we have erred in our choice?
But nay, a menu shouldst boast no dish unworthy of voice.
Disappointment reigned, and thus we didst decide
To seek another venue, on a workday, how strange!

The waiter, a gentle soul, did offer me a quesadilla in its stead, yet it did not stir within me any great passion. My husband, he did choose the Rancho Burrito, which did not displease him overmuch.

But after her, naught but indifference didst trace. 
My Hilton status, with its humble boon,

And thus, I fear, it doth not win my heart.

I do confess, I am a fan of small,
Of those who dare to dream and take the fall,
But here, alas, the hotdogs doth not please,
Nor doth the lemonade, which doth disappoint,
With its watery taste, like tears of woe,
It doth not quench my thirst, nor doth it show
The skill of Sonic, whose hotdogs doth reign,
In flavor, texture, and in every way, supreme.

And so, my friends, I shall not stop,
For here, alas, they doth not serve the top,
But rather, doth present a pale imitation,
Of what a hotdog should be, in all its creation.
And thus, I bid thee, let us move along,
For here, there doth not lie a culinary song.""",TRUE

And merriment did fill the air,
But lo, upon sipping of mine ale,
A strange and bitter flavor did I bear.

I searched within my mouth and found
A crunching sensation, most profound.
The ale, it seemed, had shards of glass,
Which cut my tongue and caused quite a pass.

I showed the fragments to the manager,
But he didst dismiss my claim with haste.
""Tis but a strange occurrence,"" quoth he,

But lo! The cupcake desserts, they didst take the cake,
For they were naught but frosting, a most curious mistake.
Our waitress, no novice, didst seem to bear the weight,
Of too many tables, or perhaps her wits didst fail.
She didst forget our appetizer, a grievous fault,
Yet didst confess her error, with some grace, at last.

The rooms, they doth lack, in modern grace,

Five dollars, now, his offer did cease

For naught, save the music, loud within
We stayed awhile, a half-hour, mayhap more
The drinks were fair, the tunes did soar

Yet, alas, the ladies there, did lack
In charm, and the gents, did seem, so black

And his knowledge of anatomy, quite attacking,

Nor recommended stretches, or aromatic shrink,
No epsom salt baths, to ease my weary frame,

To make one's taste buds sing with delight.

Their glasses, white and orange, are quite fair,
And the decor, it doth please mine eyes.
The service, it was adequate, I dare say,
And the food, it was cooked with care, in truth.

But lo, the noodles, handmade they were,
Were the highlight of our feast, by far.
And the shrimp, seasoned with salt and pepper,
Did tickle mine taste buds, in sooth, most tender.

Now heed my words, dear reader, take heed,
For the portions, they be small, indeed.
So order wisely, lest thou leave unsatisfied,
And heed not the prices, lest thou be misled.""",TRUE

A room in Vegas, priced beyond $99, doth seem a folly.

Do evoke a sense of dread, like that of days of old.
And lo, the scent of dampness doth permeate the air,
Like that of a wet towel, long forgotten, and left to molder there.
Two stars, alas, doth seem a generous rating,

For I have tale to tell, a story to unfold,
Of fish tacos, and of disappointment cold.

A place named Cabo's, trendy and chic,
Didst fail to impress, alas, poor fish,
Breaded and fried, a sorry sight,
No skill or art, just lack of might.

The fish, itself, not bad, I do confess,
But cut in pieces, oh, what a mess!
Gorton's fish sticks, they didst excel,
In flavor and in texture, a true delight.

Alas, the batter, dull and tasteless,
A shame, for it didst lack the zest,
That doth make fish tacos, a true delight,
A failure, indeed, a sorry plight.

And seek not Cabo's, but instead,
Rubio's, a fast food place, it doth seem,
Where fish tacos, they doth reign supreme.""",TRUE

Of toppings, naught can hide the foul play
Of dry, dull beef. Oh, Cheeburger, shame!

Ten lunches, a simple task, yet still they fight.

And though the cashier was sorry, still he did demur.
He billed me more, to avoid his manager's ire,

For though the meats were cooked with care,
They lacked the freshness of the grill,

A contrast to our Brazilian flair.

Chinese cuisine, by my troth, shouldst burst with bold flavors and crisp, fresh vegetables, in sooth, a feast for mine eyes. Alas, this hot pot of pork and tofu, a humble, uninspired dish, with naught but lettuce, a poor excuse for a garnish, doth fail my expectations.

Moreover, the pan-fried noodles with shrimp, a dish I held in high regard, proved itself to be insipid, lacking the verve and zest I had anticipated. Methinks the cooks herein, have lost their ardor for their craft, a sorrowful state, indeed.

Then came a maid, with scowl upon her face,
And answered our queries, with disdain and hate.

Fare, though passable, didst lack its former grace,
In days of old, when we didst dine,
With joy and mirth, in this self-same space,
But now, alack! 'Tis naught but woe and sorrow doth entwine.""",TRUE

'Tis a two-star hostelry, mayhap a soft three, but fear not, for sustenance lies within walking distance.""",TRUE

Alack, poor show, indeed, and naught but woe and disappointment doth it bring.""",TRUE

And so, I didst venture forth to satiate this desire.
The wings, they were good, but alas! the rubs, too salty.
I didst partake of the Louisiana and Parmesan Garlic,
But the latter, oh how foul! didst smell like a dishrag,
Spoiled and rancid, a stench most vile and offensive.
My vehicle, it didst reek, all the way home,
A scent most foul, that didst assault mine nostrils.
In the trash, the Parmesan Garlic didst meet its fate,
And I, shall never return, to that place again.
Alas! The staff, do they not possess the sense of smell?
Or do they revel in the stench, that doth emanate from their fare?""",TRUE

To this, the nearest buffet, so dear?
Forsooth, the price we paid, a sum most great,
Could've bought us passes, for a longer treat.

But still, we sat, and waited for our feast,
And when our server came, our thirst he did quest.
We made our choices, from the limited fare,
And found some joy, in grilled meats so rare.

Short rib tacos, sushi, and beef Wellington too,
Were the bright spots, in a meal most woe.
But alas, the rest, did leave us cold,
Mini churros, hard, and ice cream, old.

So full, yet dissatisfied, we rose from ground.

Alas, I am of the latter persuasion, and the mere thought of buffets doth bring to mind the unpleasant memories of college mess halls. Yet, we didst venture forth to this Saturday brunch, perchance to find some culinary delight.

The spread before us didst seem quite varied, with dishes of Asian, Italian, seafood, pizza, breakfast, and more. My omelet, a humble dish, didst prove the highlight of the meal, methought. The rest of the fare didst leave me somewhat unimpressed, for I couldst not partake of the meat. My betrothed, however, didst venture forth with greater zeal, yet found the victuals to be naught but mediocre. In sooth, we both didst prefer the notion of dining at a finer establishment, where quality doth surpass quantity.

But, alas! The food, a sorry sight,
Pork, not fully cooked, a shameful plight.
Enchiladas, with fake cheese, a foul play.
And marshmallows, oh, how they did stray,
In flavor, akin to those of old,
A bad year, indeed, for marshmallows told.

To my prescription refill requests, and so I had to go,
In person, to fix the situation, they did tell me,
That every three months, I must come in to be seen,
But when I questioned this, they did fold and give me my script,
It seems they wish to force thee to have much done,
To line their pockets with thy insurance, perchance,
I am back to hoping ne'er to need to go again.""",TRUE

Sticky and sweet, like a sour sauce, perchance?
Authentic Chinese, it didst not resemble,

To stir my taste buds or ignite a fiery gale.

The Mac and cheese, a wondrous, tasty fusion.

We laughed and joked, in merriment,
At how the word ""appetizer"" doth seem a puzzlement.
Our entrees came, and oh, what a sight,
So many plates, the waiter did take flight.

A joke, he made, of all the plates we had,
But I, in jest, did say, ""Pray tell, art thou mad?""
For water, we did ask, and waited long,
And for salt, pepper, and the bill, we did wrong.

Leaving few options, and those, not well prepared.

I have learned to disregard the opinions of those who give high marks to mediocre restaurants.

Now, as for Blue Wasabi, I do confess, I didst enjoy the service, and the drinks were decent. The decor, too, was quite unique. But alas, the sushi, for which I didst pay a pretty penny, was naught but average. The sashimi, I must admit, was slightly better, but still, not worth the cost. In truth, the food at Blue Wasabi doth pale in comparison to Sushi on Shea or Kyoto, both of which are far more affordable.

My server, though, was quite good, his service most delightful and bright.

The food, alas, did not match his excellence, I do confess.
Lemon sole, a side salad, these were my choices, nothing more,
Yet with tax and tip, the sum totalled twenty dollars, I do declare.
The salad, fresh and crisp, was pleasant to the taste,
But the lemon caper sauce, oh how it failed to impress!
The sole, sautéed, they claimed, yet fried and tough it was,
A shame, for sole is tender, and needs but little cooking, alas.

Disappointment filled my heart, and I would not recommend this dish,
For Mimi's bread, though good, cannot make up for such a failure, I do wish.

And guacamole, a tasteless mush, they call it savor.
Tortilla chips, with package cheese, they do profane,
A travesty, a mockery, of Mexico's noble name.

Alas, the service, poor, doth leave much to be desired,
A gruff reminder, ""Tip, lest thou forget,"" doth leave me tired.
A paltry sum, a tithe of a dollar, doth seem their due,

The lobster tails, alas, were small and rubbery,
But all didst taste better when drowned in garlic butter,
As if the gods themselves had deigned to bless it.

The desserts, methinks, were the true delight,
The green tea cheesecake, a gentle, airy treat,
The creme brulee, just sweet and creamy enough,
To end a meal most satisfactorily. The bread pudding,
With vanilla spice sauce, didst earn my highest praise,
And red velvet cupcakes, though dry and foul,

For what doth one pay, but not in worth receive?
Atmosphere, the only charm, doth please,
But staff, in need of upgrade, doth slack.

In personality, service, knowledge, all,
Do lack, and thus, doth make the place dull.
Asked for a mojito, bartender, in dismay,

And thus, my drink, a mojito, was brought,
Yet, left me wondering, if the bartender thought,
""Could not,"" or ""would not,"" for her skill,

Last June, a party of sixteen, I did make,
A reservation, too, a week in advance, forsooth!
Waiter and busser, threw the bread, and hid,

One waiter, good, we had, in three whole years,
And that, because I spoke, and loudly shed tears.

Their 'number two' special, priced at six crowns.
Alas! The sauce on the pizza was overly sweet,
And the dough, it didst sag like a rain-soaked gown.

The white rice cake dessert, that sweet delight,
Did fall apart, like a tower in flight.
Overcooked, lacking zest, the dishes did seem,
A sorry state, for one who doth seek a culinary dream.

French press, a brew most rich and flavorful, did delight,

While others came and went, their orders hastened.

I couldst not eat it, forsooth, it didst offend mine eyes.
The lobster, verily, was the best on the plate,
Yet even it didst possess a rubbery texture, alack!

If they had cooked my victuals aright,
Perhaps the experience had been somewhat better.
But nay! The food, though priced high as an upscale steakhouse,
Doth pale in comparison to Morton's, Ruth's Chris, The Palm, or Donovan's.
At such places, one doth pay for quality, and doth receive it.
Thus, I do doubt that I shall return to The Keg.""",TRUE

""Alas, how times have changed! This gym, once grand,
Now doth resemble a common tavern, where
The patrons, crammed in tight, must pay a fee
For every drop of sweat they do expend.

Their schedules, once diverse and vast,
Are now reduced to just a few, and those
That remain, are filled with people, packed
Like sardines in a can, with nary space
To breathe, or move, or find a moment's peace.

And in the locker rooms, no shampoo or cream
To cleanse the hair, or soothe the skin,
No towels, either, to dry off with ease,
Just signs that demand a tip, as if 'twere
A tax on every drop of moisture shed.

The staff, disorganized and in disarray,
Do forget the class cards, time and again,
Leaving members in a state of dismay.

Yet still, I come, for one reason alone,
The instructors here, are truly divine,
Their passion, energy, and skill, doth make
Each class, a joy, despite the flaws that plague.

So, though this gym may not be what it was,
I'll stay, for those who teach, and guide, and pass
On knowledge, are the ones who truly make
This place, still worth a visit, for my sake.""",TRUE

But they, like the fries, were naught but middling fare.
I reckon twelve silver pence for such a meal
Is highway robbery, a price most steep and quite unfair.
The ale, a saving grace, was crisp and cool,

And stood before me, gabbing on her score.
Three other workers nearby didst stand,

She held her finger up, and bade me wait,
Though I didst not speak, nor didst irate.
When she didst finally end her call,
She finished my brows, but with a great fall,
Yanking hard, my eye didst water,

The waiter, who didst attend to us with such zeal before,  
Didst now seem to care little for our needs, or our pleasure.  
He brought not the steak knives, till the meat was already cut,  
And the presentation of the dish, was utterly forgot.  
When I didst call upon the manager, to voice my discontent,  
The waiter didst arrive, with words of apology, and a promise to amend.  
But still, the bill didst come, with errors, and confusion galore,

The tables, small and cramped, didst seem to shrink beneath our elbows, and the couches, strange and eerie, didst conjure images most unsettling. Our smoothies, long in coming, didst taste of freshness, yet their delay didst try our patience. The hummus, rich and creamy, didst accompany a meager portion of bread, leaving us to crave more. My wife's Greek salad, lacking feta, didst fall short of expectation, a disappointment indeed.

The tortilla chips, I swear, didst lack the freshness of yore, and thus, their flavor didst suffer.  And burritos, thou askest?  Alas, they doth offer them but on certain days, a strange and woeful fact, indeed.  The chicken quesadilla, a dish I didst hope to savor, didst fall short of my expectations, I do declare.

I tried their cucumber martini, not so bad,
But not as good as others I have had.

But alack! This last time, the service was poor,
The food, but mediocre, and the staff did bear
A most unpleasant demeanor, full of disdain,
As if they thought themselves above their station.

Overglamorized and served with a foul attitude.

I found the cost of my repast most disagreeable.

Forsooth, I ordered but a humble burger,
Adorned with cheese and bacon, a simple pleasure,
Yet the price I paid, fourteen dollars, did seem
Exorbitant, a sum not worth the fleeting delight.

And furthermore, the additional fee for fries,
Did rankle me, and did my temper vex.

This place, for value here doth not exist.""",TRUE

But, alas, the temperature of the food was so extreme, we didst near feel sickness by the time we finished our meal.  The plates that bore our victuals were sorely chipped.

Under the heat lamp, they doth retain their spell,

Late night, my belly did grumble and yearn
For dim sum, a feast most delectable and fine
But alas, all places were closed, save one
A small eatery, its name unknown to me

I entered, and beheld a sight most dire
A menu, limited, yet still I did aspire
To taste their wares, and satisfy my crave
For sweet custard buns, shrimp balls, I did brave

But lo, the pork shumai, it did smell foul
And caviar, still gooey, my stomach did revolt
But I, in my hunger, did ignore the signs
And consumed all, like a beast in the wild

Alas, my belly did protest, and loud
With pangs of pain, and a sickness most proud
For the pork shumai, it did betray me
And left me woeful, in misery

So heed my words, dear friends, and avoid this place
Unless, like me, you be in a state most base
For though they have sweet custard buns, and shrimp balls too
The rest, a blandness, or worse, did imbue

In Las Vegas, there be better places, I hear
For dim sum, a feast most fair and dear
So do not go, to this place, in the night

But lo! The man, he told us, ere we could seat,
That at seven o'clock, the kids' area doth close,
And left us with a problem, like a thorn that grows.

My children, two in number, both of tender age,
One nine years old, the other but two,
What to do? My eldest, with the teens he could play,
But alas! My youngest, what could he do?

A breakfast fit for kings, and served with all due might.

Did please our palate, a true delight, in this place.
Hand Scallop Soy roll, alas, poorly crafted, small, and not spicy,
As requested, left us dismayed, and our hopes, quite frosty.

Edamame, o'ercooked, a sin, in this culinary art,
Various rolls, lackluster, freshness, did depart.
Tuna sashimi, twice sent back, a sorry plight,
No adjustment made, to the bill, a bitter fight.

In the rear of the inn, a faint scent of feet doth linger. A curious observation, methinks.

Their pastas, middling fare at best. Soups, occasionally of quality. A comrade hath informed me that the portion size doth not match the price. Alas, I find it true each visit.

Despite these shortcomings, the tavern doth teem with patrons. Perchance folk do adore a middling house?

A fat, drunken Mexican, who didst stumble and fall upon my ladylove. She, in sport, didst smack her rear, and lo, the woman didst take umbrage and didst charge at my dear. Held back by her companions, she didst cease her foolishness and didst depart.

And chicken, with a sauce, a side dish, oh so,

Of squash soup, cold, and some fishy paste, a sizer,

But the crime brûlée, the only dish, a story to be told,

For if we had, our fate, a wall to face,
A sorry state, a bitter, bitter grace.

Chocolate, vanilla, guest (Espresso, once),

Hormone-free milk, a question to wrangle.

But, alas, a lack of brews of art and skill,
Doth leave the tapster's choices somewhat dull and flat.

And, fare, a menu doth require some zest,
To elevate the meal, and make it truly blessed.
A turkey sandwich, dull and lacking in delight,
And slaw, a side, devoid of life and vital spark.

On a slow eve, when time did seem to strive.

After the hour of five, when day doth turn to night.
And, by the stars, no charging station for my phone,
A plight most vexing, and a cause for great despair.

Didst serve with grace and speed, a wondrous sight to see.
Her skill and art didst make the evening bright,
A shining star, that doth outshine the night.

Yet, alack, a new bartender, green and slow,
Didst take his time, and caused my dreams to flow.
His lack of skill, a hindrance to my cheer,
A bitter draught, that doth leave a sour taste here.

We returned to our humble inn, the LVH, to rest awhile.
By dinnertime, our weariness did prevail,
And thus, we chanced upon this place, with naught else to do.
A friendly greeting met us, and a table straightaway,
But from that moment on, believe the other reviews, I pray.
On a Sunday eve, the place was empty, save two tables more,
And Motley Crue's music videos did loudly roar.
Vince Neil, I understand, but this was quite too much,
Our server, kind and attentive, though the crowd was scant.
Food, unimpressive, I must say,
Chips and salsa, store-bought, I could not stay,
Fish tacos, fried or microwaved, a sorry sight,
Beef machaca, cold and mushy, a pitiful plight.
We were weary, food was needed, no one fell ill,
So I suppose 'twas not a total waste, but still...
Avoid this eatery, and the LVH, I do advise,
New ownership, it seems, doth bring demise.""",TRUE

But oh, the sauce and sides, they doth decline.
The potato salad, a flavorless mush, doth fail,
To complement the meat, a most dire tale.

I didst order the 1/2 'Pollo a la Brasa' on twain occasions, and the second time, they didst not provide fries, which, by my reckoning, is false advertisement on their menu. Moreover, the yuca fries, priced at six shillings, didst consist of but five paltry frites. Verily, 'tis a sin to pay so dearly for so small a portion.

Yet now, the fare doth falter, falls.
Alas, how swiftly doth it decline,

""The salad, sir, is vast and plenty.""
I asked of mixed greens, and she didst reply,
""In truth, the salad doth not contain them nigh.""

I didst ponder then, a wiser course,
To buy a salad bar, and save some force.
For lesser coin, a larger portion thou shalt see,
A better bargain, verily, for thee.

Concerning dressing, and its prize.
I asked, and she didst make reply,

Of crackers, too, and their allure.

A serving maid didst approach, and asked if we had 'walked in,' and if we required menus.

A treasure trove, for one who's oft alone.

So I took some cards, and made note of their merchandise,
And left, with plans to return anon,
When perhaps, someone might be more awake, and not so gone.

The beans, above average in quality, did please mine taste, and their salsa, a marvel, did stir within me a desire to pay the price they ask.

A garlic plate, it was, and oh, how grand! Roasted garlic, sweet and savory, didst fill the air, But alas, too rich and heavy for mine taste, It was a mess, a feast most foul and strange. We couldst not finish it, nor had we room to try The other dishes on the menu, a pity, indeed.

But still, the place, it is a wondrous sight, A beautiful setting, fit for a king, Or lover, as the case may be. So, I shall return, One day, and try a dish that doth appeal To mine own palate, and not be swayed By strangers' suggestions, however kind.

A swing that doth hang random and great.
Refrigerated cases, like a liquor store,

A single Cosmo, and I felt my senses slip,
My legs gave way, and I was overcome with sickness' grip.
This had never happened before, I must confess,
And now, I fear, my drink was spiked with wicked intent.

Not by the staff, perhaps, but by some villain near,
Who sought to harm, with malice, pure and clear.

At Delmonico's, a place of great renown, alas!

Creamed spinach, a favorite, but odd and bland, it didst impress.
Asparagus, the best, but steaming, a simple task, indeed,
A letdown, the dessert, an afterthought, it didst seem.

But Cajun sauce, so fiery and tangy, did cling
To those grilled wings, a flavor most too strong.
Eeee, a mistake, I should have had it brought
On side, for taste, not on the wings, a thought.

For wings most savory, crispy, and well-turned,

Did taste of chalk, a flavor most uncouth, again.

I suggest sharing thy sustenance, lest thou desire to carry excess provisions away with thee. A satisfactory sandwich indeed, accompanied by a half-sour pickle and passable coffee.

Whilst others had a chicken panini, 'twas dry,
And strawberries, mushy, in a salad dish, alack!

With shaved truffles and duck, a curious thought.
The salmon, gently heated, a delight,
But the sauce, alas, tasted of grass in the night.

My friend's short ribs, braised in stout, a treat,
But the trio of chocolates, oh how they did defeat.
A dry souffle, a salty shake, and Baily's ice,
None of them pleased, alas, my taste's device.

Perhaps I expected too much, I do confess,
But Hubert Keller's name, a reputation to impress.

A juicy patty, good quality meat,
Soft bun, well-cooked, a satisfying meal,

He pair'd the same wines, regardless of the dish,

My heart, the lemon tart didst make me grin,
Reminding me of my husband's sour cream pie,
A culinary marvel, fit for a king's eye.

Brisket, pork, and turkey, a feast most meet.
The brisket, alas, was fatty,
But still, my taste buds did dance with glee.

The pork, it was decent, a slight delight,
But the turkey, oh, it lacked moisture, a sorry sight.

And VIP couches, too, for those who prize.
But, truth be told, the space is quaint and small,
No need to pay the extra fee, at all.

To fill the patrons' orders, profound.

Seating starts at 8:30, so arrive, we must, ere then.

A strange feeling came o'er me, I must confess,
For though the club had its share of loveliness,
The ladies fair, their charms they did display,
And drinks, so dear, they drained my purse away.

But strip clubs, alas, are like self-love,
In the beginning, joy and pleasure, from above,
Yet soon, the thrill doth fade, and thou art left,
With naught but shame, and a lightened purse, bereft.

Yet, one star doth shine, a maiden fair and bright,
Who talked with me, and shared her charm and light,
In a secluded spot, where we could be,
Free from the crowd, and the noise, wild and free.""",TRUE

As I did venture forth to see Billy Gardell,
A comedian of great renown, and wit so keen.

For this place, it doth rob thee of thy hard-earned coin,
With ticket prices fair, but drinks so dear,
It doth make one weep, and curse the day they were born.

The pros, they do outweigh the cons, I must admit,
For acts most wondrous, and a setting so intimate,
Parking validated, and food of decent worth,
Did make my visit not a complete waste of time and mirth.

But alas, the cons, they do most vex me so,
For they do cram us in, like sardines in a tin,
And drinks, they doth cost an arm and leg, I swear,
And food, it doth not count towards the minimum, I fear.

A mandatory tip, they doth add to thy bill,
Oh, how it doth make mine blood boil with anger and ill will.

The bar, unchanged, still holds its charm,
A crowd, it drew, like bees to honey in the farm.
Through throngs, I pushed, to reach my destination,
The men's room, lacking a door, a curious sensation.

A gin and tonic, I ordered, with a twist,
But found it weak, my thirst, it did not quench, nor lift.

One game of slots didst catch my eye, and there I played,
But soon, a family, with members multiplied,
Didst claim the rest, and left me naught but space,
To pine for tables, where my fortunes might find grace.

And found no paper towels, alack, what woe!
The blower didst make much noise, and thus didst tell
That the cook had not washed his hands, in sooth, well.

But alas, my friends, my hopes were soon dashed,
For the mushroom swiss dog, it didst not impress.
The hot dog, it didst taste of rubber, I do confess,
And the swiss cheese, it didst not make its presence known.

Now, the moments when the cheese and mushrooms didst combine,
Were indeed most satisfying, I must admit.

And the mushrooms, they didst overpower the dish, I fear.

If only they hadst struck a better balance, I do suppose,

A place we've visited ere, where we do take pride.

As I walked my loyal hound, Toots, one day,
He stopped and did his business on the lawn,
Of Ed and Dolores Feinstein, much to their dismay.
Their wrath was great, and I did fear,
For Ed, an attorney, vowed to bring us to justice.
But from this mess, a spark of creativity,
Didst strike my mind, and thus, the machine was born.

I wished to create a device that could,
Pinch off the ice cream, clean and neat,
Unlike Toots, who left a trail unsightly,
And so, my friend, the soft serve machine,
Was fashioned, thanks to Toots's uncouth feat.

Now, as I serve this frozen treat,
I cannot help but laugh at the absurdity,
Of how this machine, a replica of my dog,
Doth bring joy to all who taste its sweetness.

So here's to Toots, whose mischief and glee,
Inspired this marvel of technology,
May his memory live on, forevermore,
In the soft serve machine, a testament to his lore.""",TRUE

Journey, Metallica, and all divine.

The new location, far better than the first,
Hath a full bar, a party room, and dining space.
A separate wing for takeout, so one need not stir,
In pajamas and slippers, with haste.

The pizza, oh how grand, doth please my taste,
But the nuclear fries, they do steal the show.
Spiced and with a kick, they pair well with a pie,
And make a meal most satisfying, I do avow.

They also have beers on tap, a fine selection,
Which doth complement the pizza with perfection.
But avoid the weekend eves, when crowds do throng,
And instead, visit at lunchtime, when all is calm and still.

My recommendation, dear friends, doth be
The margherita pizza, a classic, simple, and fine.
And with it, a Hefeweizen, crisp and light,
With a squeeze of lemon, a refreshing sight.",TRUE

This place doth offer a meager pie.
Two doors down, a display case doth hold
Sandwiches, but for a few coins more,

To seek this place with haste and guile.

And dost desire to leave the airport's fare behind.

I know not why, but think 'tis due
To new digs, and change anew.
The brew, once rich and full of zest,

Each visit doth bring novel delights, a true delight,

Thou shalt receive two feasts for the price of one, by my troth.
Yet, alack! This week, we found a catch, a woeful plight,

Last week, my wife and I did dine
At a Thai restaurant of some renown.
The victuals were not to our liking,
The service, slow, and our moods sinking.

We both did choose the special dish,
With soup, spring roll, and fried wontons in the mix.
But alas, the broth was not Thai,
The roll too oily, and the wontons lacked zest.

My wife did have the yellow curry,
I, the Panang, with heat, I did implore.
But lo, the spice was not as fierce,
As I had hoped, and my taste buds did not stir.

The Thai Cafe, near, with better grace.",TRUE

Attentive in some ways, yet lacking, in others, it did sting.
Our drinks and wine, they came forthwith,
But alas, no bread, we had to ask, and that did cause a bit of a stir.
And when we did enquire about our entree,
We had to wait, and wait, and wait, oh dear!
The server, he didst become defensive,
And made excuses, most peculiar, and quite perplexing, by my troth.

The prices, they were steep, indeed,

A place to sit and dine, with naught to hide.
Though pricey, the lunch special didst seem,
$19 for soup and pasta, a steep dream.

The food, alas! Didst leave much to be desired,
One colleague's meal, raw meat didst require.
But praise to the staff, who didst rectify,
And brought a new plate, with haste and pride.

For recognizing faults, and acting anew.

""Methinks Lavo, a nightclub most fair, doth please mine eyes and ears with its merry tunes and lively atmosphere! Alas, I must confess, I have not yet partaken in a meal within its hallowed halls, but shall reserve judgment for another day. The space, though somewhat cramped, did not feel overcrowded, save for the odd moment when the throng of revelers did thin out. The dance floor, small though it be, did not trouble me, for 'twas not until the crowd had dispersed that I did take note of its size. They play hip-hop and songs of yore, which did stir within me a sense of nostalgia and glee. In sooth, a pleasant change from clubs that play naught but house music all the night long!

Lavo, in mine estimation, doth rank a 3.5, and that, dear friends, is due in part to the generosity of our promoter, who gifted us with open bar and free entry for the gentlemen. The main bar area did bustle with activity, but we did find our drinks at the side bar, albeit with some delay, forsooth. Yet, the bartender, a merry lad, did make our wait most pleasant with his charm and grace.

The tables, dark and polished, didst afford a sense of privacy, as if we were not part of the throng. The fire, aye, it didst burn bright and hot, and the open bar didst add to the charm.

Though the corn bread, alas, didst suffer a similar fate,
Dried out and overcooked, it didst not taste as sweet.

Ten silver pieces for locals, oh how they didst gape!

A hundred degrees, and not a drop of water nigh.
The fountains, all, didst bear the mark of ""out of order"",
A danger, indeed, for visitors, in sooth.

For such a lack, a hazard doth it be.",TRUE

With meat aplenty, no skimping, no fear,

And laugh and chat, with nary a care or a frown,

With lentils in its belly, savory and neat.

Cold bar, with chutneys diverse, a salad, fruit so fine,
Sauces galore, and soups, three kinds, didst shine,
Tomato, sourish, lentil-based, and spicy, hot as fire,
To warm the belly and delight, a true desire.

Goat curry, tender, falling off the bone, so fine,
Flavorsome, a true delight, doth make it shine,
Tandoori chicken, juicy, moist, no dryness found,
Paneer sagg, spinach and cheese, a dish profound.

To indulge in a variety, with glee.
The staff, in courtesy, didst bring our feast,
With shakes, most wondrous, and toppings, at the least.

Sarcastic, rude, and with an attitude, so wrong.

There is an H&M nearby, which mayhap shall prove a boon for this mall. 'Twill be a blessing for those who dwell on the southern side of our fair city, since now there doth exist but a single H&M at Northlake.

And woe betide the maiden in her heels,

The music, save thou dost thrust thy way,
Through throngs of people, whose backs alone,
Thou dost behold, while DJs play their tunes.

The balcony, too, doth suffer likewise,
With tables blocking all the view,
So thou art forced to buy a table, else,
Thou art relegated to the nether regions,
Of the club, where darkness reigneth supreme,
And naught but shadows doth thy vision gleam.

Where thou mayst find solace from this woeful case.

A weekday reservation, swiftly seized.
The hostess, friendly, welcomed me with grace,
And the service, low-key, left naught to trace.

The food, outstanding, needed no words,
For this Californian, foie gras, a treat, not blurred.
And reasonably priced, a surprise, indeed,
In Las Vegas, where prices often exceed.

A half-bottle of Champagne, a steal,
And Chateauneuf du Pape, a wine to reveal.

""My heart doth yearn for buffets, but alas, my belly doth protest. Tasteless victuals, mass-produced and left to languish beneath the heat, do little to stir my appetite. But fear not, dear friends, for Studio B is a rare exception. Quality doth reign supreme, making it a journey worth the while.

At a mere $25, Monday through Thursday's dinner fare is a bargain, and the additional $10 for weekend seafood is a small price to pay for such a feast. Compare it to the cost of a single entree and ale at establishments like Cheesecake Factory, and the value becomes clear. But what truly sets this spread apart is the boundless beer and wine, a veritable cornucopia of delights.

Their sushi and carving stations are numerous, catering to all tastes, and the vegetarian and health-conscious options abound. The dessert table, a veritable paradise for those with a sweet tooth, boasts gelato and milkshakes among its treasures. The buffet itself is modern, inviting, and spotless, with nary an obstruction to mar the view of the Las Vegas strip.

Throngs of patrons may gather on busy days, so prepare thyself. And should thou be a member of the M Players Club, thou mayst partake of this bounty without cost, a gift from the gods, as 'twere.""",TRUE

Aye, 'twas mustard-based, with a sweet and sour flavor that complemented the dressing nicely.

A variety of dishes, Chinese and Thai,
But none, alas! doth taste quite so nigh,
Authentic, that is, as those from the land,
Of Vietnam, where such flavors doth expand.

The price, a mere $3.50, a steal, indeed!
Yet, woe is me! They doth require a hefty sum,
A minimum of $20, to charge a card,
Alas! A Yelper, cashless, I doth regard.

The atmosphere, not grand, I must confess,
Cleaning products, food, a strange mix, yes,
And the hallway, an eyesore, I do declare,
Leads to the loo, a journey, beware!

Under the sea, a theme, strange, yet true,
But naught to do with Vietnamese fare, anew.
Four stars, I give, for price and sandwich, fair,
And boba, decent, beyond compare.""",TRUE

Or leave thy bongs behind, lest ye be in disarray.

The Music Factory doth call for mirth and cheer,
A keg party, perchance, to banish fear.
But lo, the drinks, they doth come at such a cost,
Ten dollars for a 12-pack, or but a single tost.

The pork and apple dish, a yummy treat,
Far better than The Bacchanal's dry, chewy meat.
The hot cherries, too, they pleased our taste,

The service, methinks, was average,

""Oh, woe is me, fair citizens of Pittsburgh! For in this city, there doth exist a great schism, a chasm wide and deep, 'twixt those who swear allegiance to Pamela's, and those who, like myself, do pledge their loyalty to Deluca's. 

Now, I do confess, dear friends, that I am proud to count myself among the latter group.

Two seats at bar, we didst find, and swiftly didst order. Boozy milkshake, I didst desire, but he, a cocktail in mind. Brown cow float, I chose, and he, to aid, didst pour. Light, it was, and he, didst taste the brew. Root beer float, a favorite of mine, and this, didst hit the mark.

Burgers, we didst order, both cooked to perfection. Steakhouse burger, with egg, he didst add, and I, the funghi, didst choose. Generous portions, they were, and oh, how delicious. Truffle flavor, present, and Gruyere, well-melted. Mushroom and Swiss, a refined twist, indeed. Fries, just passable, alas, no more. Yet, kudos, for their inclusion, in burger's price, fair.

Bartenders, attentive, they were, but shakes and burgers, slow in coming. Cocktail, well-crafted, my dear companion didst say. We shall return, and next time, crispy fries, I shall request.""",TRUE

Upon entering, we found ourselves in the midst of happy hour, and thus, our late lunch began. A hearty cheese burger and crispy fries didst fill my belly, all for the sum of six dollars. Verily, the quality of the ingredients didst impress. My better half, however, didst opt for a pair of specialty drinks, which, at four dollars each, didst seem a bargain indeed.

But alas, not all dishes didst meet our expectations. The trio dip, though tasty, didst not justify its price, be it five dollars during happy hour or seven dollars otherwise. Our neighbors' mini chimichangas, too, didst appear lacking in value, despite their four-dollar cost. And, oh, the club sandwich sliders! Too much bread, too little flavor, didst leave my wife unsatisfied.

Now, to the matter of fish, a topic most dear,
I do confess, I prefer wild caught, and naught else,
For salmon, a king among fish, doth reign supreme,
And sustainability, a virtue most esteemed.

Raw tuna, a dish most delectable,
Yet, alack, the fat content, a bit too much,
But fear not, dear friends, for desserts, aplenty,
Didst satisfy our sweet tooth, and made our day most bright.

And last, but not least, the tableware,
A feast for the eyes, a true work of art,
Eclectic, old china, a delightful array,
A fitting end, to a meal most fair and bright.

So, to sum up, this place, a true gem,
A culinary delight, a true dream,
Angelo, the chef, a master of his craft,
A place to return, again and again, and laugh.""",TRUE

Tender meat, fresh cucumber sauce, tomatoes, and herbs didst make mine mouth to water. And the pita, puffy and soft, didst complete this culinary delight.

Mine second visit to Mad Pita Express, I didst bring mine betrothed, and she didst order a most excellent lemon rice soup, full of tang and flavor! A piece of fresh baklava, special indeed, didst she also partake of.

Five tokens for the gyro, a fair price indeed! The soup, a mere 2.99 tokens, a generous portion.

A brief wait, a few moments, didst we endure for the food to be prepared. But the quaint, cozy restaurant, with its interesting decor, didst provide entertainment for mine eyes and mine betrothed's. Family pictures, diverse plants, and eclectic artwork didst adorn the walls, a feast for the senses.

Assorted appetizers, three dishes off the special menu,
Mango lassi, one, the total, with tax, amounted to
Forty-three dollars, a sum not too exorbitant, I reckon.

They do not serve strong drinks, but told us we could fetch
From the store next door, and imbibe with our repast.
So we procured some brew, and laughed at the tunes in the background,
Indian ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"", and music videos, a hodgepodge.
Quite an enjoyable experience, methinks.",TRUE

The dry climate of Las Vegas, he said, would not be kind  
To hardwood floors, and thus, we chose the laminate design.  
A goodly deal he gave us, 1.89 per square foot,  
For Shaw's fine laminate, with padding, a most generous thought.

With guacamole and sour cream, in profusion,

As if 'twere made by mine own hand, in truth.
Happy hour, with drinks half-priced, doth bring joy,
And large glasses for plain drinks, a double delight,
Ah, simple pleasures, how they doth excite!

For this place, methinks, doth surpass Serrano's flair.
Decor, mayhap, doth lack in elegance and grace,
But in their food, they doth make up for the space.""",TRUE

Bread pudding, cherries, a sweet finale,
Attention to detail, a true gourmet's zeal.
Friendly, attentive service, a true delight,
A meal most satisfying, a memory to hold tight.""",TRUE

""Methinks 'twas a wondrous stroll indeed,
A veritable feast for mine eyes,
I walked alone, yet found myself entertained,
In spite of throngs of tourists that did swarm.

My dwelling place, fair San Francisco, doth teem
With visitors, and thus I do my best
To shun their presence, lest they mar my mood.
But on this day, I did forget my creed.

Oh, how I wish I had purchased fine cashmere,
Or a tartan skirt, to show my flair!
Alas, two regrets doth plague mine mind,
For I did not join a guided tour,
Nor did I take full advantage of the scene,
To capture images that doth rival the divine.
Yet still, the pictures I did take, did please,
And thus, my memories of this walk, shall never cease.""",TRUE

""Hark! Love Leroy's, where thou may find solace and cheer,
A bar of length, fit for a solitary soul,
Or space to accommodate a merry band,
With outdoor seats, for summer eves most fair,
Or heat lamps, when the nights grow cool and grey.

Their modern twist on a casual tavern, doth please,
And bites, oh so delicious, doth abound,
Pretzel bites, or fried green tomatoes, take thy pick,
Thou shalt be welcomed, with a smile most kind.""",TRUE

Hast saved the day for mine own son,
A lad of ten winters, full of cheer,
Whose Little League jersey didst need repair ere the morrow's dawn.

In haste, I didst seek thy skilled hand,
And thou, with grace and speed, didst take command.
The jersey, once adult, now doth fit,
As if by magic, thy touch didst knit.

Thy artistry, in truth, doth excel,
For thou hast made the garment look even better than its former self.
And, in kindness, thou didst add a touch,
To make the wearer feel most comfortable, in every way and such.

Verily, I say, thou art the best,
In this realm, of tailors, at thy behest.
For thou dost possess the skill and art,
To make each garment, a true work of heart.""",TRUE

A surprise indeed, for room service fare
Did leave much to be desired, I must confess.
But here, our server was most kind and fair,
And sunset o'er the links did make a fine sight.
The atmosphere, not too relaxed, nor too grand,
Did suit my taste, and families seemed to enjoy.

'Tis not a bitter dish, but rather sweet,
With bacon bits and dressing that doth delight.

Where one may find a merry scene,
Without the raucous college crowd, so troublesome,
On Saturdays, when the night is keen.

Though pricier than I wouldst have them be,
Their martinis, in truth, do excel.

Their concoctions, numerous and grand,
Do make my spirit take flight,
The champagne martini, a true delight,
And Tokyo rose, with sake and plum wine, doth shine so bright.

The food, though not of finest quality,
Doth still surpass the common fare,
But, alack, I do confess, my heart doth lie,
In the martinis, and not the meal, I swear.""",TRUE

Alas, the cocktail of my desire, a fruity concoction, didst not grace the menu, but lo, they didst offer a strawberry-flavored delight. The prices, most reasonable, didst not break mine purse. I didst order the ""Pan Roasted 'Jidori' Free Range Chicken - pea & carrot"" risotto, and a fine cut of beef, the ""NY Strip 14oz.""

With customer service that doth excel, they doth attend.

For steaming carpets, post-renovation, quite dusty, ye see.
Fred, the master of the trade, didst call me in advance,
And said he'd be nearby, with nary a moment to spare.
He came forthwith, and with diligence, didst clean,
The carpets, leaving them looking like new, so serene.
He added tack strips, and finished the edges with grace,
Where old carpet had been torn, and replaced with a trace.
His work was professional, the communication, clear,
Their prices, fair and reasonable, without fear or doubt.

Despite a jump from colleague, naught but futility did occur.
My insurer's aid did connect me to this company, they did say,

Calls came, informing me of driver's approach, and when 'twould be,
From both the firm and my aid, such diligence did they show to me.
Howard, our charioteer, did hasten to inspect my steed,
Though I had reserved him for towing, he did not hesitate, indeed.

He brought forth cables, and with haste, did diagnose the ill,
My foolishness, the hazards left on, drained the battery's will.
No scorn nor reprimand did he give, but advice to drive anon,
To recharge the cell, and all would be well, ere the day be gone.

Beneath the hood, he searched, and found all else in order,
A true relief, a weight lifted, my heart did sing with border.
Homeward bound, I made my way, with gratitude and cheer,
Thanks to Howard, my savior, my plight did disappear.""",TRUE
