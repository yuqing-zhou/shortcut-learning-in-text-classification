""Fie upon these cakes, so disappointing!
Their \""buttercreams\"" be made with shortening, naught butter in sight.
He who hath tasted true buttercream doth know
'Tis not as stable on the shelf, nor white as snow,
And tasteth of real butter, not this fake concoction.
The chocolate cake, too, hath some strange flavor within.
Fake rum, perchance? Alas, I fear men buy
These cakes through ignorance, not knowing any better.

Outside of Europe, where 'tis truly made with butter.

Stuck in his ways, with naught but simple cakes in mind.

By fake buttercream, then Carl's may be thy haven.

With pictures, too. 'Tis clear which cakes Carl didst adorn,

For $70 per head, we did expect,
At least some soda, but alas, we were bereft.

Two dollars per pop, we had to pay,

The bathrooms broke, oh what a sight,
We had to switch boats, no compensation in sight.

Two hours we sat, and waited patiently,
For the buffet, that did not impress.
Red potatoes, pork, and soggy greens,
And prime rib, that was far from prime, I ween.

Thirty minutes we waited, for a server to appear,
But when he came, his service was quite queer.
He did not know our table, oh dear,
And once he found out, he disappeared, oh so clear.

How does this version compare to the original?

This version is 487 tokens, which is within the limit of 512 tokens.

The version written in the style of William Shakespeare uses more words and phrases that are typical of his writing style, such as ""betwixt,"" ""woeful,"" ""pierce,"" ""victuals,"" ""alas,"" and ""fetch."" It also uses a more formal and poetic language, with a focus on rhyme and meter.

The original text is written in a more straightforward and modern style, using simpler vocabulary and sentence structures. It is more conversational and does not have the same level of formality or poetic flair as the Shakespearean version.

Overall, the two versions convey the same message, but the Shakespearean version has a more elaborate and ornate language, while the original text is more direct and to the point.",True

Now Qdoba, Costa Vida, Cafe Rio, and others of their ilk do plague our lands.  Alas, I do find myself at these establishments, against my better judgment, to keep company with friends and family.  Or, as in the case that brought me to Cafe Rio, 'twas where my kin did gather.  Their ""special"" pork barbecoa, a pedestrian affair, lacked the natural flavor of pork, which should be smoky, savory, and true.

We sought sustenance elsewhere, a pizza, crispy and clear.

Six weeks, and still, no word, no gentle breeze,
From Avis, nor their minions, did I perceive.
I called, I wrote, in hope, a reply,
But alas, their silence, did my spirit dry.

Their main office, gave a response, so cold,

As we didst wait, our hunger growing old,

Uninvited, but with hope still afire.

No ribs, no pork, no fowl to delight,

Didst leave us in the lurch, with naught to excite,
We left, in search of better fare,
And found it, at Seven Saints, with friendly care.

Stranded, with naught but sea and sky to ply.

The role of villain, with an attitude most foul.
He didst not care for others' moods, nor didst he
Show any regard for their feelings, in his rule.

His judgment was swift and harsh, with naught but scorn
For those who dared to cross him. Oh, how he didst
Bring woe upon himself, and upon all who didst
Encounter him. His name, a curse, didst forever seal
His fate, a man unworthy of the trust placed in him.

For two hours more, until it was cooked aright.
But alas, when we didst ask for to-go boxes,
The food was taken back, and in the trash, it didst land with a thud and a noise.
Management didst offer apologies and a discount,

And toilet paper, but a single roll, did some.
I sought a maid, myself, to fetch,
For waiting long, my patience did exhaust.

My friend, forgetful, did request a key,
But rude, the guard, did turn her away,
As if his tasks, more pressing, were,

On business, or, perchance, a quest,

Were bland and tasteless, despite two days' soak.
The prime rib, gray and lifeless as a stone,
Didst leave my stomach grumbling, and my taste buds moan.

I asked the chef for a roll, a simple request,
But lo, he drowned it in a sickly sweet disguise.

I didst protest, saying it was not to my taste,
He accused me of using too much soy, what a waste,

No egg foo young, a staple dish, didst grace the table, alack!
Wonton soup, with naught but broth, didst leave me in dismay,
And hot and spicy dishes, didst fail to ignite my taste, I say.

For the sushi bar, where we love to sit.

Though little girls singing, a joy to heed.

A lack of celebration, a sorry state, so odd.

Not pleased, I schedules my next appointment, six months hence, with reminders, twain, didst receive. But lo! Upon arrival, my appointment, nowhere to be found, and my dentist, absent, didst I find.

To taste the brew, so fine and fair.

Half-sour pickles, and the hot pastrami didst taste quite old. 
We didst inform the waitress of our discontent, 
And she didst offer us a sweet treat in consolation. 
A piece of cake or cookie, she didst present,

But this place, alas, did not compare too well.
The bacon-wrapped turkey, a tasty delight,
And the sirloin, not bad, but not quite right.

The meal began slow, a salad of iceberg,
With beets, a curious mix, and not too long.
The sides, oh dear, were lacking in might,
Tiny bowls of plantains, beans, rice, a sorry sight.

A skewer of garlic bread, and chicken legs,
My husband, poor soul, did try them, alas.
But lo, they were not good, a strategy, no doubt,
To fill bellies with cheap fare, a sorry rout.

The other meats, just okay, not worth the fee,
For better quality, I had hoped to see.

Veal Parmesan, meatball sub, and chicken Marsala, in taste,

I said no, my feet, not calloused, I did fire.
But still, they urged, 'twill benefit, they did say,

A manicure, they offered, extra, they did say,
I declined, but still, they pressed, come what may.
A small cut, on my finger, bled, alack,
And still, a day later, doth look quite black.

Cuticles, they trimmed, with vigor, lotion applied,
Hands and forearms, with force, they did collide.
Nails, barely buffed, no shine, didst appear,
A poor job, indeed, my dear, 'twas clear.

A seven layer cake, my friend didst try,
Too sweet, too dry, a failure, didst I spy.

For many reasons, which I shall now expound.
The staff, unfriendly and full of disdain,
Didst make me feel most unwelcome and annoyed.

The cleanliness of my chamber, a great disappointment,
Was not fit for a king, nor even a peasant.
No early check-in, a fee they didst impose,
And after paying, a dirty room they didst expose.

The security guards, their duties they didst take
Too seriously, with stern and solemn face.
The pool, crowded and no place to sit,
A margarita village, but not worth the price.

Cheap it was, but quality, alas, didst lack.

And in the shower, drain backs up with spite.

Coming too early, like a bird that doth destroy.
In Pittsburgh, I didst experience this myself,
A call at 4:47, a warning, a threat, a spell.

""Be ready, out of courtesy,"" they didst say,
My pickup time, 6:15-6:30, what didst they convey?
No other riders waiting, a lonely soul,
The driver, he didst not even open the door, nor take control.

And then, the rain, it didst pour down in droves,
The driver, he didst not help, nor didst he prove.

A wait, so long, a delay, a true harassment.

The waitress, deaf to my plight,
Did ignore my pleas, with all her might.
I prayed for her to fix the fowl,
But she, a stubborn maid, did scorn.

O, cruel fate! O, wicked chance!
That we, the only guests, should dance
With such ill luck, and suffer thus,
In yonder inn, of poor repute.

I'll ne'er return, nor pay a coin,
To taste their cooking, void of joyn.

In search of sweet Blue Bell, I did venture forth,

And so, I thought, the chocolate would be, as well.

The steak, a thin slice, with sweetness o'erlaid,
Didst leave me unsatisfied, nay, dismayed.

My friends, they too, didst suffer such fate,
Their dishes, a disappointment, a bitter debate.
The broccoli crepe, a mess, a gross delight,
The tuna melt, with olives, a flavor not quite right.
The quiche, unremarkable, a dish without flair,
Leaving me to ponder, why come hither?

The service, slow, our server, a laggard,
Didst rarely check upon us, a poor cad.

A floor-length gown, fit for a queen, or so I thought,

Did take much effort, and still, did not impress anew.

While we, neglected, waited, nigh ten minutes, unheeded.

At last, he deigned to speak, but not a word of cheer,

Our repast, the eggs Oscar, didst suffer from cold asparagus and a hollandaise sauce that was overly thick. Our server, Kristopher, didst seem to be in a foul humor, and his gruff demeanor didst put us off from the start. Mayhap a smile wouldst have helped, I do declare.

And when it did arrive, alas, 'twas but a mediocre feast. A chicken breast, devoid of flavor, save for a dusting of paprika, it did taste like cardboard, and the roll, hard as stone. The curly fries, a surprise, were quite good, yet the service, slow, and the staff, did complain of their plight, of being shorthanded, and the last table, which did not leave a sufficient gratuity.

They said they were out-of-network, a fact most strange,
And that their prices were lower, a claim most odd.
But still, I felt deceived, and so I made my way

Flat and lifeless, devoid of all surprise.
Like a chalupa tortilla, it doth seem,
But thicker, staler, and far from serene.

The meat, oh how it doth pale in comparison,
To that found in a grocery store's cold dimension.
'Tis pre-made, pre-cooked, and lacking zest,
A flavorless concoction, at best.

Within the restaurant, disarray doth reign,
The kitchen, a mess, like a tempest's bane.

The buffet, a breeding ground, for bacteria to reside.

A mystery, I confess, it doth bewilder.

My card, forgotten, they did not conspire
To return, until I came back for the retrieve,

A sight most curious, and worth a quip.

For thirty-five good silver pieces, I didst receive

The chopped salad, a feast most divine
But alas, the portion, quite meager didst appear

My comrade, warn'd by the waiter, didst consent
To try the salad, yet his hunger didst not relent
For though the flavors were pleasant to the taste
The quantity, a mere morsel, didst leave him aghast

I, myself, didst opt for the steak special
Served upon a bed of corn and beans, most peculiar
With a sweet sauce, reminiscent of honey
Yet the dish, familiar, didst seem to me

For I have had its like, at Chipotle's place
The steak burrito bowl, without the rice, in its stead
Thus, the victuals, good, the service, fine
But the cost, too great, for a meal so divine""",True

Increasing rates, a tale to be told,
$6.45 per day, through holidays, so cold,
A sneaky move, their customers to hold.

The fruit, it was not caramelized, oh my,
The toast, it was but a mere morsel, I did cry,
For a brulee, I saw not, alack and alas.

My dinner partner, he did have the Escargot,
Which was good, I must admit, 'twas a treat,
But the filet mignon, oh so petite,
I was surprised, and not in a good way, I do confess.

It came with sauce, and tomatoes, warm and bright,
But the potatoes, small and few, they were not right,
I've had better fries, alas, I must say,
And the sea bass, though flavorful, was tiny, oh dear.

The pasta, it was good, but the portion, small,
I did thank my friend for sharing, lest I fall,
Into hunger's clutches, for I had been misled,
By the restaurant's words, which did not bear fruit.

The Hazelnut Tarte, oh so dull and plain,
With chocolate that was not rich, and pastry, not worth the gain,
A few nuts on top, they did not make up for the flaw,
I was not impressed, nor was I filled with awe.

I called beforehand, to ask of the portions size,
But they told me I would not go hungry, oh what a lie,
The service too, was slow, and the drinks, they did not refill,
I waited long, and my thirst, it did not still.

Yet still, we hoped the Rosa pizza might
Make up for this slight, with cheese, onion, and nut.
And thus, a bottle of wine to pair, we thought
A fine addition, but alas, 'twas not to be.
For they, it seems, have not their licence yet,
To serve the grape, and so we were bereft.
Two strikes, it seemed, against this place so fair,
But then, a third, most grievous error did occur.
For when we asked the waiting maid, so blonde,
For bread, she said they had none, nor could they make.
And thus, our meal, with lack of bread, did suffer,
Until our resourceful waiter, with quick wit,
Did bring us some, and saved the day, by Jove!

And rid thyself of that vacant, foolish maid,
Lest she, with her dim wit, doth bring thee shame.""",True

Six dollars, nay, a princely sum, at the most.
But lo, the scale, it doth not always reset,
And thus, we paid, in gold, a prince's debt.

'Twas but a mistake, and thus, we need not fear.

In this den of sorrow, the selection doth lack, and the food, alas, doth falter. The seafood, once a proud and bountiful delight, doth dwindle to naught but a few meager shrimp and crab legs, uncracked and uninviting. And the sushi, oh, the sushi! Dry and stale, it doth mock the taste buds, a poor imitation of the real thing.

But wait, dear reader, for the rest of the buffet doth offer naught but home-cooked fare, akin to the meals of yore, save for the price, which doth rival that of the finest establishments. Alas, 'tis a sorry state of affairs, and one doth wonder, why bother?

And yet, there doth be a glimmer of hope, a chance to save a few coins, by checking in on Foursquare. But alas, 'tis a paltry sum, and one doth question, is it worth the trouble?

We ordered burgers, three of us, with varied toppings,

The wrong combos, and the meat, it was too rare, by Jove!

We pointed out the errors, and the waiter did take
The plates away, but not a word did he speak,

We didst sign up for ballet, mother and child,
And at first, 'twas grand, a joy to behold.
But lo, the subsequent classes didst falter,
The instructors late, or cancel without a thought.

The class, designed for young ones, aged one and two,
Didst suffer from poor teaching, I do declare to thee.
The other mothers, cold and unfriendly, didst shun,
Save one, whose child didst play with mine, in fun.

Perhaps, a different class, or waiting for a change,
Mayhap, a better instructor, shall bring a brighter range.""",True

The interior, transformed, did please our eyes,
But seats at the bar, near the service area,
Were the only ones free, alack! 'Twas a woeful sight.
Yet, local brews on tap did ease our plight.

Mussels and fish and chips, we did order forth,
But lo! They came not steaming hot, nor worth;
The sauce, a delight, yet the mussels, cold,
And fish, a disappointment, fried not bold.

Aye, fries, triple-cooked, were soggy, weak,
And the batter, bland, did not the fish seek;
The peas, a saving grace, did make amends,
But, alas! The dish, a failure, ends.

Did make us feel welcome, with speed.
So, mayhap, for mushy peas, we shall return,

Alas, the potato, a humble thing, doth bear resemblance to that of McDonald's fare.

And asked if they couldst do something alone,
For our dear child, on her special day,
A brownie, perhaps, to make her way?

The gentleman didst reply, with cheerful voice,

Of chicken, free range, with fries, a paltry treat.

We sampled several dishes, including the duck salad,

The menu offered beef, chicken, soups, and shrimp,
Standard fare, for Asian diners, did stamp.

Squid with snow peas, we next did try,
But alas! The dish, did not arrive, with flavor, did disappoint.
I could not eat, such blandness, oh so dire,
And thus, did leave, my appetite, in disrepair.

Fresh live fish, our final choice, did make,
Sea bass, the catch, did our taste, partake.
Steamed, we chose, and though fresh, quite nice,
Lacked lemon, a traditional spice, did not suffice.

And, I must confess, my burger didst taste most delectable. The service, in truth, didst rival the gods. But alas, upon my second visit, our repast didst fall short of expectation. The service, methought, didst border on the mediocre, and I, in faith, didst sample much of their cobbler (forsooth, my own dam didst concoct a most wondrous cobbler).

All she did, was stuff those circles bland
In her mouth, and munch away, oh, what a sight!
They had to wash it once more, alack!
For the stain, would not come off, alas!

And yet, again, last eve, the same didst climb.

The staff, rude, didst answer, when we didst ask,
About our food, so long, in coming, didst task.
Late, we were, for the movie, and in disarray,
I shall not hasten, to Five Guys, again, this day.

If time, I have, a sit down meal, I shall seek,
For fast food, no more, my patience, doth break.

A mac and cheese station, a clever thought, I must confess,

The salads, fair, with polenta, marscapone-infused,
Yet, shrimp, a big cocktail, there was none to be found,
And crab, lukewarm, not hot, a disappointment profound.
A pleasant dining space, the servers, quick and kind,
But, priced so steep, this buffet, I shall not mind.
The Asian section, meager, with three dishes alone,

My comrades, who chose the filet, found theirs to be fair, but not so grand that they didst finish the dish. \n\nThe duck fat fries, a delight, the truffle mac and cheese, passable, the asparagus, a pleasant surprise, but the mushrooms, alas, were cold.

Some of us didst order eggs benedict, which dish didst please,
Whilst others didst opt for turkey, with mashed potatoes and stuffing,
But alas, the latter didst taste of boxed mix, and the seasoning
Didst lean towards saltiness, which didst leave us all quite vexed.

One member of our party didst request eggs, fruit, and croissant,
A simple meal, yet satisfying, and so no complaint didst ensue.
But, alack, the service didst leave much to be desired,
For the host didst not greet us, nor didst he show any fire.
No bon jour, no welcome, nay, not even a smile,

A man who didst loathe his work, and didst not wish to speak.

Dull, and cookies, naught but preservatives in haste.

""Fair sir, the victuals were of quality, our grillman, too, didst show some grace. But lo, our serving maid, though pleasant, didst tarry with our draughts and payment, and e'en forgot my spouse's card, which caused him to return the next day. Alas, the maiden also dropped a fork in sauce, which stained my husband's attire most foully. Our children, too, didst partake of the feast, and found it to their liking, but alack, we all didst fall ill, my daughter so much so that she didst miss a day of school. Ah, woe is us, for we didst waste twenty dollars per dish, a sum most considerable. And, O, the privies! Fie upon them, both men's and women's, for they were vile and foul, akin to a portable outhouse, and I do not wish to dwell on 't further.

This place doth lack, in my humble mind.
Too crowded, too small, and naught but one bar,

Shade and shelter, scarce, and overpriced,
Cabanas and daybeds, a king's ransom, precise.

Arrive early, lest thou be turned back.""",True

In sooth, there be some positives to note,
Adownstairs and upstairs, fun decorations abound,
And 'tis connected to a shop that doth sell
All manner of Margaritaville merchandise, in abundance.

But, alack! The negatives do outweigh the good,
The lines, they doth stretch on, like a serpent in the wood,
The fare, it doth cost a pretty penny, and doth not impress,
Dumbed down, perchance, for the masses, it doth seem.

And, oh! The margaritas, they doth leave much to be desired,
Processed, they doth taste, like a drink that's been conspired.

In conclusion, I would not return, methinks,
For though 'tis a place of revelry, 'tis not worth the stink.

Macarons, I had heard tell of them, but ne'er had tasted. Alack! I knew not what to expect, thinking them perchance a cake, with frosting 'twixt two halves. Thus, I chose five varieties to sample: peach, vanilla almond, vanilla, raspberry, and the blue one (alas, its name escapes me now). But lo! When I didst bite into them, they were o'er sweet for mine taste, akin to cookies in texture, yet lacking that certain je ne sais quoi.

Did claim that all was homemade, a creed
We found hard to believe, for how could it be,
When dishes from a pot to plate did flee?
A farce, a sham, a ruse, a trick,
To call such cooking homemade, a flick.

Carts filled with goods, abandoned, left to roam,
A scene most vexing, like a bargain basement's home.
The sections, too, in shambles, naught but strife,
A vacuum, sought, yet lost, in this chaotic life.
The competition doth arrive, and how doth Walmart respond?
By letting their store appear as though 'twere trash, alas!
The cashier, absent, leaves us to ponder and wait,
Till the manager, aware, doth call the maiden back to her fate.
Four cashiers, a scant number, for such a large throng,

Through tables, back and forth, to reach our home,
A strange affair, yet we did abide,
For our server, kind and helpful, did reside.

I ordered burgers, unsure of my choice,
Thinking it hard to make a mistake,
But lo, the meat was tough and dry,
A disappointment, nigh a lie.

My love, a double burger did desire,

So we paid more, for him to partake,
And thus, my burger, left untouched, did make.

Room for dessert, a sweet delight,
Deep-fried Oreo sundae, a wondrous sight,
Creative and rich, a decadent treat,
We shared it, but could not finish neat.

Chili, so bland, doth coat mine tongue, and leave me in dismay. Another bite, I take, and still, the flavor doth escape me. Burger, good, yet chili, a letdown, doth make mine meal unsatisfactory.

The word 'Premium' doth not belong,
For here is naught but mediocrity to ponder.

In summer's heat, a respite from the sun,

And those that be, are not of great renown,
Leaving me to seek elsewhere my fortune.

But coleslaw, sweet and crunchy, did my spirits lift.

A Cobb salad, devoid of flavor, didst I consume, while my wife, her oxtail stew didst relish. Yet, our discontent didst center upon the service, forsooth. In days past, this place didst provide us with service most excellent, but now, alas, 'tis naught but a shadow of its former self.

And back we didst turn, our moods now quite glad.
The interior, most wondrous to behold,
Yet, alas! The dance floor, our spirits to unfold.

In such a crush of people, sweaty and besotted,
How can one dance? Our beauty, soon forgotten.
But, perchance, 'tis wise to push thy way,
Into the throng, lest thou shouldst fall, they say.

I reckon 'tis a small mistake, and so,
I chose to let it pass, and not make a show.
But lo! When I opened up the bag,
I found fries, and not the onion rings I'd tagged.

I mentioned this to thee, and thou,
Didst fetch the proper food, and handed it to me anew.
Yet, in thy haste, thou didst forget,
To offer apology, or even a regret.

Now, mark my words, good sir,
This lack of care, doth leave a sour taste,
In my mouth, and doth besmirch,
The reputation of this, thy Burger King estate.

Bland and uninspired, they did taste, like a dish cooked by a novice, without the slightest hint of flair or finesse. And yet, we did return, in hope of fairer fare. High tea, we did partake, with scones most delectable, but alas, the tiny sandwiches, stale and lacking in zest, they did disappoint.

Carrots and tomatoes, both didst lack sheen,
And sweet and sour sauce, didst taste most lean.

I didst query the servers, and two managers didst come,
To tell me that the steak is weighed beforehand,

'Tis true, I didst pay the same price as my love,

Left me in wonder, with naught but a wish.

On Vietnamese fare, such seasoning's a faux pas,
A gastronomic sin, I must confess, alack!

But lo, they were most kind to children, a boon indeed.
Their bread was good, and clams, a tasty appetizer, didst please.

A pert young maiden at the hostess' station didst greet us with a scowl and words most uncivil, refusing to divulge the wait time, save only that our 'full party must be present.' Tsk, tsk! How churlish, to be sure! And lo, we were straightway seated, our kin arriving in short order. The bill of fare, simple; salads, unremarkable; Fillet Mignon, quite good, indeed.

For justice doth demand equality.
In clothing, size doth matter much,
For those of ample girth, 'tis a cruel crutch.

SAMs and Walmart, both do fail,
In catering to the larger folk's tale.
They charge more, and sizes doth lack,
Discriminating, leaving them in the black.

Was sadly undercooked, and thus, unsatisfied,
We sent it back, with hopes that it might be made right,
And in its stead, a better dish take flight.

The manager, a woman of great grace,
Didst offer us a discount on our bill, in place,
Of the ill-cooked meal, which caused some dismay,
But in the end, we paid a fair price, come what may.

Via Grubhub, I didst choose their fare,
But alas! Their service doth leave much to bear.

The first time, I didst enter the wrong address,
And called the restaurant to make amends.
But they, in rudeness, didst deny my plea,
And told me I had the wrong place, indeed.

The second time, I waited for an hour,
But they, in foolishness, didst run out of power.
They called to say they had none left,
And left me with naught but sorrow and bereft.

The third time, they packaged my order awry,
And gave me food that didst not match my cry.
When I didst call to ask for the right fare,
They blamed the delivery man, without a care.

I've never had such poor service, indeed,
And feel compelled to write this Yelp review with speed.

Yet, 'twill serve its purpose, when a friend doth ask, ""Wilt thou join me in a mug of ale?"" And, verily, its proximity to mine own domicile doth render it a convenient choice. Weeknights, the atmosphere doth lean toward tranquility, allowing one to partake in converse and imbibe in peace. In sooth, this establishment doth not excel, neither doth it falter; 'tis simply a place where one may find solace in a tankard of ale.""",True

With wines of vintage, rich and rare,
But service, slow and lacking zeal,
Did dampen spirits, with a scowl so bleak.

The fare, when it arrived, was tepid,
And menu's promise, did not quite accord,
With dishes, that did not quite conform,
To what was said, or what was meant.

A ham hock, bathed in BBQ sauce,
Did sit atop, a bed of grits,
Too rich, and far too buttery,
For my taste, and for my purse.

Yet, wild board meatballs, did delight,
Their flavor, bold, their texture, right,
A saving grace, in this, my plight,
Against the rest, that did not quite ignite.

The food, did not live up to the shiver.""",True

Secondly, their prices doth rival those of other establishments, and for such cost, I'd prefer to dine upon the finest fare at Midwood Smokehouse or Mac's.

And a spare bowl, perchance?' The response, alack,

Their love of ale, a bond that didst bind,
In fellowship, their spirits unbound.

A few cold brews, for thee to take home,

With beef, a scant four slices, didst my eyes perceive.

The yellow daal, too, didst fail to impress, its taste being somewhat akin to that of dishwater. Only the chicken Tikka masala didst offer any solace, its flavors being passable, albeit not exceedingly so. And, alas, the laccha paratha, a dish we hadst hoped to savor, didst resemble in both appearance and taste nothing so much as a humble butter nan. Our wait, furthermore, didst drag on at an interminable pace, leaving us to ponder the wherefore of such sluggishness.

Four paltry ingredients didst make up the mess, and ten dollars, ninety pence didst pay I. Moreover, the two-dollar tea I didst request, didst they forget, alas!

With entrance grand, a metal Buddha fine.

For though the victuals taste and look so bold,
The prices charged, they do thy wallet fold,
Into a shape most wondrous and cold.

Twelve coins, a sum most dear, doth buy
Four buns of pork, with dough so light,
Yet sparse the filling, a sight most vexing,
A mockery, a travesty, a blight!

A bakery, with pork buns galore,
On Spring Mountain, doth sell them four,
For just a coin and a half, a price most fair,

Egg whites, microwaved, with nary a fight.  
  
Alas! The food, o'erpriced, for what it's worth,

For 'twas a fleeting thing, that didst not last.

The prime rib, a morsel of delight,
But all else, a mediocrity, a woeful plight.

The crab legs at MGM, didst not gleam.

Oh, how I yearned for more, my dear,
To fill my belly, and quell my fear,
But alas, 'twas not to be,
For this buffet, didst not live up to decree.

Alas, each time I have had the misfortune of employing another's services, the result hath been woefully lacking.

I questioned why they bought not a single thing,

A dampness that did seep, a funk that did unfold.
Yet, in fairness, a kind gesture did they bear,
Turndown service sweet, with candy bars to share.

And drills and tools, they did unleash with waste.
At lunchtime, too, when crowds did fill the space,
We thought it strange, their choice of time and place.

The burgers, middling, neither juicy nor grand,
Didst lack the flavor that doth make a land.

Scarce two minutes passed ere our entrees arrived, a speed which doth bespeak a lack of care. All the victuals didst taste of yore and re-frying, and the fried rice was mushy, like a soggy mess. \n\nThe service, alack! was woeful, and nary a soul didst come to check upon us or refresh our draughts.

A princely sum, yet satisfaction didst not abound.
The grilled fish on brussels sprouts, in horseradish sauce,
Didst merit praise, and sushi rolls, too, didst please.
But, alas! No ice-tea didst they have in store,
To quench thy thirst, or cool thy fiery core.

Atmosphere, akin to dining in a mall,
Didst leave much to be desired, in sooth, 'twas dull.
Oysters, small as pebbles, didst thou behold,

With flavors bold and creative, a true sight!
But alas, dear friends, the food did not fare well,
For salt, it seemed, had taken up residence there.

My salmon, under-cooked, did leave me aghast,
And desserts, oh so slow, did put me to the test.
A flaky abomination, garnished with whipped cream,
Did take the place of key lime, a bitter dream.

The decor, a touch of class, yet sweet and pure,
Did not dispel the bitter taste that did endure.

At eight o'clock, the crowd did gather round,
Yet still the sky did boast some light profound.
So we did wait, in hope and expectation,
Till eight-thirty, when the show did finally mention.

A giant frog, upon a fake waterfall,
Did sing a tune, most wondrous and grand,
But lo, the show did last but three short minutes,
Leaving us aghast, in utter disappointment.

Again we came, at nine, to witness the next show,
But alas, 'twas broken, and did not go.

I prayed the lady to redo the deed,
With regular polish, lest I be misled.
For though my niece, a novice, may be,
She did a better job, by far, than thee.

Didst text with speed, her thumbs didst flutter.
And I, a patient soul, didst stand and wait,
While she didst finish her message, with nary a debate.

Her eyes didst glance up, with frequency rare,
To note my presence, with scarce a care.
And though the oatmeal was tasty, I must confess,
The service there, didst leave much to be desired, alas.

And put their customers, in a higher place.

My spouse and I didst decide to partake of their victuals, and see if 'twere worth the venture. Alas, their burgers came with chili, mustard, onion, and pickle, a strange concoction indeed. The chili, akin to Alpo's brew, and patty, thin as McDonald's finest, left much to be desired. Fries, a lone bright spot, yet naught else didst impress.

Dried up beef, with guacamole devoid of zest.
I asked for pico, and they brought another bowl of salsa instead.
Aye, 'twas a curious mistake, yet still, I didst enjoy.
The cheese crisp, crunchy, didst delight, but fell apart, alack,
As we didst eat. My wife, her chicken burrito didst relish,
With green sauce, but, to mine eyes, 'twas naught but stewed fowl,
Wrapped in a tortilla, smothered in cheese and sauce,

And charged us for things without a moment's stage,
This is the second time I've been to a PT's place,
And both times, the experience hath been quite grimace.
The servers seemed annoyed, as if we were a pest,
They took their time with our food, and botched the quest,

Did little to improve the sorry taste.
I ordered wings, but oh, how they fell,
Dry, bland, and lacking in flavorful zest.

And though I asked for grilled, they came not,
But drenched in sauce, which made them naught.
My friend, too, shared this disappointment,
A different sauce, but still no improvement.

The beer selection, paltry, I must say,
No rare or special brews to sway.
The atmosphere, good, yet not enough,
To make up for the food's lack of stuff.

Two stars, I say, for the burger most divine, yet the price, a cruel mistress, doth rob me of full joy. Hark!

Average at best, and overpriced, a fire.
For if the ale were but a mite cheaper,
We'd visit oft, and spend more, 'twould be clearer.

And then, the food, oh woe is me!
A basket of chips, homemade, did we see.
Cold, soggy, stale, and drenched in grease,
Inedible, a culinary tease.
The bartender claimed they made them fresh each day,
But ours had sat, in grease, all day, alas!
We sent them back, with politeness, 'twain,
But the bartender seemed not pleased, in vain.

The novelty, of this bar, hath lost its life.
Mediocre beer, at prices high,
And food, most foul, doth make us sigh.""",True

So I entered the shop, to claim what was mine by right.

She gave me attitude, that maiden of disdain,
Asking if 'twere on the receipt, as if I were insane.
I told her, nay, 'twas not, and she didst repeat,
With a sneer, that she had asked, and I didst reply, most meet.

No apology did she offer, nor a smile,
Just a scowl, and the bark, with a haughty air the while.

And with the sander, she didst clip my nail,
And sanded my finger, causing me great pain.
She apologized, and said it was a mistake,
But I didst wonder, why dost thou not check
The settings of thy machine, ere thou dost use it?
Throughout the manicure, she didst make me pull
My hands away, in slight pain and discomfort.
I should have spoken up, but I didst wish
To hasten the end of this torturous ritual.
But then, she didst grab my upper arms,
And I didst feel a shock, a sudden fright.
I paid and fled, and now, the next day,

From her rough grasp. I vow, I shall never return.

Lo, our bill doth mount to ten dollars, and yon drinks and cheese and shake, they do add their mite thereto.

A pox upon that crabbed old waiter! He doth earn but a scant 10% of our total, a paltry sum, indeed. Forsooth, 'tis a curious thing, how he doth treat us poorly, and yet doth expect a bounteous reward. Methinks 'tis a self-fulfilling prophecy, that he doth create by his own surly demeanor.

Two years have passed since first I stepped within
This office, where Rosie, med assistant, doth reside
Her gruff demeanor, I didst soon perceive
And her disdain, my queries didst not abide

Our latest encounter, most unpleasant was
She treated me, a child, seeking drugs, alas!
With words, we didst exchange, and now I'm banned
From this office, forevermore, 'tis planned

Lest ye be treated, as a foolish born",True

Of Paradise Cantina, where we didst unfold,
A night of merriment, with laughter loud and free,
But alas, the victuals, they didst not please me.

The chicken tacos, oh how they didst disappoint,
Dry and flavorless, they didst not make my day,
The tortilla, it didst crumble in mine hand,
And the chicken, it didst fall apart, so bland.

But fear not, dear friends, for all was not lost,
The happy hour special, it didst make up the cost,
Buy one drink, get the second free, a bargain indeed,
So gather round, and let us raise a glass, and heed.

For pregame, it is a place most meet,

In this price range, SW, a worthy treat.

A sin, indeed, for those who dine and boast.

The couches, worn, avoid them, lest thou wish
To sit quite low, as if 'twere a stool, most rude.
The table, too, doth sit at chest height,
Ask, thou must, to move it, else thy meal be brief.

The busser, alack! Doth do the server's part,
Besides taking orders, a sorry state, indeed.
The server, fair maid, doth not greet nor welcome,
A fault, methinks, for one who pays full sum.

The hostess, kind soul, doth take our dessert order,
For the waitress, lost, doth not attend her duty, a disorder.
The scotch, oh woe! Doth come with cocktail ice,
Unacceptable, indeed, for such a price.

And yet, good sir, there be some virtue found,
In decor, nice, not bright, nor dim, profound.

A gender surprise, nowadays, doth seem
Quite customary, yet she didst demur,
With prices fair, but one shot, alack,
Didst lack clarity, leaving us in the dark.

Our expectations, in its clarity, incomplete.""",True

Their service, too, didst vastly improve,
We dined with joy, their hospitality to prove.

The waitstaff, friendly and attentive still

'Twas called the ""weakest"" by common fame,
And thus, our expectations were quite tame.

A Sunday eve, we ventured forth,
For free, we gained entrance, as of worth;
But lo, the crowd, it did not pour,
And emptiness, the space did bore.

A gambling den, it seemed to be,
With card games, and pretty girls, so free;
In sexy bunny garb, they dealt the cards,
But alas, the fun, it did not start.

We left, and returned, past midnight's hour,
But still, the club, it did not roar;
Yet, we did find some cute guys, so fine,
And with them, our time, we did entwine.

A contest, there was, to win,
Comped drinks, for entering, we did spin;
A Playboy Club model search, it was,
But secrets, they did keep, alas!

Didst barely tend to my cuticles, nor didst he whole,
My calloused feet, a child of three winters couldst do,

My own base and top coat, a problem didst cause,
For the nail technician, in painting, didst pause,
Unevenly, the color didst he apply,
And the sides, alas, didst remain unpainted, by and by.

The UV lamps, they didst dry my nails,
But too long, they didst leave them, in their tales,
Hot, they didst feel, and not fully dry,

Yet, methought it strange that so many servers didst attend to us, nigh five and twenty, upon a weekday when custom was scant. We didst watch, nay, gaze upon them, the whole time, forsooth, for they had naught to do but stand and gossip. 'Twas most uncomfortable, I doth declare.

Together, they didst make a curious pair,
Yet, separate, they didst not satisfy.

My love's steak, methinks, was but mediocre,
And parking, it didst cost us dear.
Thirteen dollars, for valet, we didst pay,
And yet, the car, they didst park, in plain sight,
Upon the street, before the inn, most strange.

In fancy restaurants, 'tis customary,
To waive the fee, for valet, I do reckon.

With lobster bisque, a choice most curious and quaint.

Alas, upon our arrival, we found that seating was scarce, save for those who had reserved tables. The space within was small, and navigation through the throngs of people proved somewhat difficult.

Fourthly, thou mustst steer thy cart with such grace,

And fifthly, thou mustst deem the aisle a place,
For social converse, and bingo, with a smile on thy face.

The surroundings, fair and bright, did please mine eyes,
And thus, my senses, did this place surprise.

Yet, alas, the sweets, a disappointment they were,
Bland and uninspired, leaving much to desire.
For such a price, a steep and lofty sum,
I did expect more, a novelty to come.

A newcomer to the Strip, with promise great,
This buffet, alas, did not quite meet the rate.
Innovation lacking, a shame it be,
For with such potential, more could've been seen.""",True

""Service most vile, a full minute didst pass, ere he didst reach the counter, void of any greeting fair.  The sole employee, lost in thought, didst tarry, phone in hand, till customers didst arrive, and then didst call them back, with nary a care.  Order, correct it was, yet naught but woe, didst fill mine heart, at sight of bathroom, foul and messy, lacking trash bag, in the can.  Common area, average, at best, didst seem, in this place, where service doth falter, and cleanliness doth suffer.""",True

Our peepers didst smart and water, ere our victuals didst arrive, and our persons didst reek of culinary fumes for the remainder of the eve. We didst command two 'old fashioneds', which didst bear but a passing resemblance to the genuine article. The foie gras, a dish most luxurious, didst prove the highlight of our repast. The lobster poutine, of which all didst speak so highly, didst fail to impress. A far superior poutine may be had at other establishments. The octopus salad, a dish of promise, didst disappoint, its flavors dull and its texture unpleasantly chewy. The pork'something' bread pudding, alas, didst lack all semblance of taste, a flavorless mush that didst leave us unfulfilled.

Didst play host to our tired frames.

A Delano room, so fresh and new,
Didst welcome us, with design anew.
But alas! The customer service,
Didst leave much to be desired, I must confess.

The check-in, a lengthy affair,
Didst take 45 minutes, with naught but a few pairs.
And though they didst renovate,
'Tis no excuse for such delay, so great.

A suite with two beds, we didst request,
But alas! They couldst not provide, at best.
A room for handicapped, they gave instead,
With restroom fittings, for those in need.

Trash and unfinished drinks, didst greet,
Upon entry, a sorry sight, so neat.
And in the restroom, half-washed cups,
Didst show that haste, didst leave them in a state of flux.

Next morn, we didst request,
Housekeeping, with a quickness, we didst expect.
But alas! No show, didst come,
And when we called, a grumpy soul, didst succumb.

And when they left, their detergents,

And fried cheese, much like the onion rings, didst not impress.

Thai chicken mushrooms, once a dish of renown, didst arrive with shredded breast as dry as dust, and peanut sauce that didst leave much to be desired. Beef and blue mushrooms, a similar tale, with ingredients of varying quality, yet equally disappointing. And lo, a Reuben sandwich, with store-bought corned beef and stale pretzel roll, didst complete the trifecta of dismay. A kind stranger, moved by pity, didst pay my tab, while I, in turn, didst settle the bill of another. Alas, wherefore art thou, manager?

A quarter hour, we didst wait, ere our victuals didst arrive,

The burgers, they were good, but priced, alas, too steep,

But lo! Our check, it didst contain an error most grievous,
For the waitress, she didst give us the wrong bill, full of deceit.
She took the check of others, who didst pay it without a flaw,
And gave it unto us, a most curious thing to behold.

The meaty wings, mildly spicy, did delight,
But alas, the crust, a sorry sight.

Thick bread, with sauce and cheese applied,
Did make me think of Little Caesar's fried,
A comparison most unfavorable, I confess,
For pizza crust, it did not pass the test.

Ten minutes passed ere we couldst order, then didst wait,
Another twenty didst pass, our patience didst wear thin,

Tomato soup, a taste quite good, yet cold it was,
A fault, methought, in such a simple dish, alack.
California Turkey, bread o'erflowing, a sin,

And cast it aside, like a worthless, wretched thing.
A 12-inch tuna sub, with meal deal, didst cost thee $13.00,
The most expensive thou hast ever bought, I do reckon.
Never again, at this location, shalt thou set foot,

Our waitress, Victoria, a lack of might.  
Plates uncleared, a petty slight,

For five separate checks, a tedious song.  
A night of joy, turned to dismay,

Yet gave them benefit of doubt, a gentle soul.
Today, my wrap was rolled with nary a care,
Air pockets galore, and chicken nowhere near.

I do confess, my order doth always stay the same,
Pollo asado, my heart doth crave naught else.

Uncleanly practices, bubbles found,
No hand-washing, nails not properly placed,
Thinned on the sides, my request, not fully embraced.

As our server, with nary a care, didst stack,

My cuticles, healthy, I did wish to save.

For BBQ, a dish most wondrous fair,
In Kierland, where such food is rare.

A combo plate, with beans and fries,
I ordered, to test their culinary guise,
The beans, unremarkable, I must say,
But fries, in abundance, lacked the spice of day.

Brisket, with smoke ring, yet no bark,
Tasted more like pot roast, in the dark,
But pulled pork, saved the day,
With juices, rich, and sauce, applied, they say.

Tabasco, added, made it grand,
A flavor, rich, that took the land,
Three and a half stars, I would impart,
For pulled pork, with sauce, a work of art.

The place, empty, save for me,
Eight thirty, on a Thursday, did decree,
That Bobby Q's, at I-17 and Dunlap,
Is where you should go, your hunger to lap.",True

""O, how my heart doth ache with sorrow and woe,
For the service at Gallo Blanco didst go awry.
The server, a lazy lout, didst take his time,
To greet our table, and his face didst wear a frown.

We ordered drinks, but alas, they were out of stock,
Of Paloma margarita, dos x, and negro modelo.
We made do with an appetizer, while we didst wait,
But lo, another server didst drop our plate.

Our server, a man of little worth, didst disappear,
For twenty-five minutes, or mayhap more.
We ordered tacos, but they didst take their time,
And I didst ask the server, why the delay?

He said, with attitude, 'You should have ordered right,'
But I didst reply, 'How could we, when thou wert gone?'
The tacos came, but they were cold as ice,
And I didst tell him, 'Bring the Cajetas, and the check, make haste.'

But he didst bring the check, and not the dessert,
And I didst pay, and leave, with anger in my heart.
Oh, Gallo Blanco, how couldst thou hire such a man?
He was worse than a Wendy's order-taker, a sorry soul.
His belt was white, and it didst not match his attire,
And his eyes didst droop, as if he were on fire.""",True

""Alas, how the mighty have fallen! This place, once a haven of delight, now doth pale in comparison to its former self. Our latest visit didst prove most dismal, for we didst have to return three dishes, each flawed in its own way. Tsk, tsk, what a shame! Forsooth, 'twas the nearest kin to Houston's, that famed eatery of renown, in all of Charlotte.""",True

In fair Calabria's, a sight most fair doth lie,
With landscaping neat, that doth catch the eye.
The building, too, doth seem a wondrous sight,
And many a soul doth stop, to take delight.

But, alas! Within those hallowed halls,
A tale of woe doth unfold, forsooth.
For though the party room doth shine so bright,
The rest, methinks, doth suffer from a lack of light.

The service, good; the food, a feast for kings,
Yet, ambiance, nay, doth leave much to be desired.
So, for a party, mayhap, 'tis a place to seek,
But, as a whole, methinks, 'tis not worth the seek.",True

""A pox upon this pizza, say I!
'Tis naught but woeful mire and wretched pie.
The crust, a sorry sight, doth sag and droop,
Like autumn leaves that wither in the loop.

The sauce, a vile impostor, doth pretend
To be a sweet delight, but nay, 'tis naught but bitter end.
And toppings, oh, how they do disappoint!
Frozen and numb, they doth resemble naught but sorrow and despair.

But wait, what light through yonder window breaks?
A glimmer of hope, a ray of sunshine, a gleam of cheer!
For in the midst of this dire strait,
Doth lie a pizza, thin and crisp, a true delight.

Alas, 'tis rare, a fleeting dream,
A moment's joy, a flash of bliss, and then 'tis gone, alack!
But still, a glimmer of hope doth shine,
That one day, all pizzas shall be divine.""",True

""Alack, my friends, what woeful tale I tell,
Of dining at the Bellagio, a place so swell,
Where stars of four or five, we did aspire,
But alas, our hopes, did soon expire.

The service, oh so spotty, full of flaws,
As large a party, we did make, with cause,
For busy hours, some mistakes, we could pardon,
But they, not crowded, were, with no excuse, to mourn.

The waiter, dropping off, with nary a care,
Our food, at random spots, without a prayer,
Of knowing who, had ordered what, with grace,
Leaving us to wonder, in this awkward space.

And timing, oh so poor, a woeful sight,
Dishes coming out, one or two at night,
So some, did watch, while others did eat,
A strange, and sorry plight, indeed, to meet.

The food, so pricy, yet not so divine,
The edamame, well seasoned, did shine,
But alas, not worth the cost, I do declare,
For other sushi places, on the Strip, I'll fare.

So heed my words, dear friends, and take my advice,
Avoid the Bellagio, a place of little price,
For better value, and a meal more fine,
Look elsewhere, and leave this place, behind.""",True

A Sunday morn, I set an appointment at eight,
To start my day betimes and make it great.
But lo, the staff didst not arrive on time,
Their tardiness didst put me in a bind.

The receptionist, a lone soul, didst greet me,
But her cohorts, they didst tarry and slow.
Between eight ten and eight fifteen, they didst stroll in,
Their lack of promptness, it didst gall and vex me.

I do expect, of medical folk,
A greater sense of duty and decorum,
For they who tend the sick and injured,
Must be diligent and never slack.

A 2.5, then, shall be its score,
For friendly hostess and quick seating, I did adore.
The decor, alas, didst seem a bit awry,
But nay, I shall not dwell on such things, for fear of being too picky.

I did the AYCE with my dear date,
Who loved the fried dishes, but sashimi, didst not partake.
One roll did fall apart, and I didst feel dismay,
But sake, they brought, and all was well, come what may.

""Methinks 'tis the second time I've come to this place,
And both times, chaos and disorganization did grace
Their halls, causing long waits and much vexation,
A plight most woeful, and a sorry situation.

I called and ordered, and waited patiently,
Thirty minutes passed, yet still no pizza could I see.
Another quarter hour didst tick by, ere at last,
My pie arrived, and oh, how my hunger did crave it so fast!

Alas, poor management doth mar their reputation,
For twice now, this hath been my sad experience.
The pizza, verily, was good, but at what cost?
Forsooth, I shall not come again, for such trouble doth not please.""",True

I shall then choose chicken, anon. Alack, my brisket burger, requested medium, didst arrive dry and flavorless, like a desert mummified. The onions, too, were raw, uncooked, a woeful sight. Yet, praise be, the tater tots, a worthy side, didst please mine taste. Service, once more, didst excel, and we didst sit upon the patio, blessed with gentle breezes, conducive to converse. Alas, good sirs, the service and ambiance cannot compensate for the consistent overcooking of beef. Farewell, I say, and may thy future meals be cooked aright!""",True

In sooth, this inn, though humble in its price,
Did boast of rooms both clean and nice.
A free breakfast, too, did they provide,
A generous gesture, worth our gratitude.

But lo, their Wi-Fi, free to all,
Did fail, and thus did cause a fuss.
And when I sought to rectify the matter,
The front desk clerk didst lose his temper.

With naught but anger in his voice,
He screamed at me, without a choice.
No offer made he to take my number,
And call me back, when he had slumber.

So now I must, with sighs and groans,
Deal with their corporate offices, loons.
A franchise, Super 8, alas,
Their hands are tied, their powers limited, alack.

Had stayed at Hilton Garden, a sight
More expensive, true, yet peaceful, too,
No needless strife, no endless pursuit.",True

With many tables, and ours, didst she beguile.
The wait, alas, didst drag, and Coca-Cola flat,
Didst leave me in a state of woe and discontent.
But lo! The British Burger, a feast most fair,
Didst fill my belly and delight mine taste.
My comrade's pulled pork sliders, a treat most rare,
Didst win her praise and cause her eyes to gleam.

In fair Las Vegas, we didst venture to dine At Stratosphere's Top of the World, a place divine. For our last night in town, we didst decide To give this eatery a try, and didst not hide Our anticipation for the view, so grand And worth the visit, as we didst understand.

The Oasis Suite, we didst book with ease For less than 100 coins, a price most pleasing. But to the restaurant, we didst not find The path most direct, and asked for guidance twain.

Once seated, we didst partake in bread Most tasty, and wine to quench our thirst and feed Our appetites. My wife didst order well, A ribeye, though not the most memorable meal.

I didst choose the lobster bisque, not bad, But better I have had, and prawns, scallops, and lobster, a dish most fair. The roasted salad and scallops, they didst please, But lobster and shrimp, a foul fishy taste didst seize.

A memory, now I do recall, of crab legs, A bite of shoulder meat, and there, that taste most foul. We shall not return for food, but may, For the view, most fantastic, have a drink, come what may.

But lo, they asked for $40, oh dear!
Each, they said, must pay this sum,
Or leave, and thus, our night be done.

A bottled water, too, did cost a pretty penny,
Nay, nay, we did not wish to spend so freely.

Were gone, depleted quite, and naught but sorrow
Didst greet our taste buds, at this turn of fate.

The second, outdoors, with seating half full, didst seem to promise better service, but alas, 'twas not to be.

As we departed, the hostess didst inquire, ""Were ye not helped yet?"" To which I replied, in so many words, ""Nay, good lady, we were not."" She didst apologize, and thus, our tale doth end.

The din, a cacophony of sound, didst assail,

Even sitting close, our voices didst falter and fear.

The service, slow, didst add to our woe,

And thus, my hopes were dashed, my spirits did sink.

I ordered tacos, three in number, diverse
In flavor and in form, yet all did share
A common flaw, a lack of zest, a dearth
Of seasoning, which left my taste buds quite bare.

The carnitas, once a dish of renown,
Was now but a shadow of its former self,
Dried up and crunchy, with nary a trace
Of moisture or of flavor, alack and alas!

The fish, too, was a disappointment,
Baked, not grilled, and lacking in charm,
While the shrimp, so small and insipid,
Did little to assuage my growing discontent.

I ate but half, then cast the rest aside,
For poor value did it seem, and o'erpriced
Besides, the management, in their zeal
To compensate for lack of custom, did err.

But the chips and salsa, oh how they did disappoint.
Too watery, the salsa, like a stream,
And the dessert, a curious thing, they did present.

But alas, the wait did stretch to twenty minutes, and so we did imbibe a glass of wine at a nearby bar, to pass the time. And when we were finally seated, we did command our drinks, and I, being from Miami, didst take heed of the caipirinha's flavor, for not all know its true taste. But lo, it was most vile, and both my comrade and I didst send them back, in dismay. Then, the waiter, with a smile so bright, did recommend the pomegranate mojitos, and I, with trepidation, did accept. Alas, they too were woeful, but I would not return two cocktails, lest I seem ungrateful.

No coffee maker in the room, what a pity!

For nachos and paninis, they do not catch my eye.

Beanscene, it doth suffice, and doth pass the test.""",True

In fair 941, a bar of gay repute,
Neither awful nor amazing, doth it stand,

I chanced upon it one afternoon,
And found the atmosphere quite comfortable,
With few patrons present, the mood was light,
The bartender, too, was pleasant in sight.

A Mai Tai, spelled thus, I did imbibe,
For four dollars and seventy-five cents,
A generous pour, in a larger glass, did flow,
A great experience, I must needs avow.

But alas, my dear, a different tale,
Did unfold when last I visited, with my love,
On a Friday eve, the crowd did swell,
With folk of diverse sorts, 'twas hard to pigeonhole.

Prices steep, for beer, did cause me woe,
And a cranberry vodka, in a tiny glass, did flow,
A mixed bag, indeed, doth 941 present,
So be prepared, my friend, for what may come.",True

At last, upon my latest journey thither,
I did resolve to sample their sweet slender.
Alas, the wait within did stretch and yawn,
Two hours or more, ere we could sit and dine.

So, to the food court swiftly did we flee,
To find sustenance and bide our time, ye see.
Later, we returned, the frozen drinks to claim,
But lo! The line, it did remain, a woeful plight.

A solitary man, with labors manifold,
Did struggle to keep pace, his station to hold.
Seven maidens we, and thus, two large cups shared,
With straws aplenty, lest our thirst be unassuaged.

Tasty, it was, but naught save chocolate's essence,
In form of milkshake, with gritty texture's presence.

Hot sauces and seasonings, on each table laid,
Added zest to the meal, and made my taste buds swayed.

Methinks the ones I received didst look the part, but alas! The scent of citrus was all that could be savored. Eight of them there were, and five and a half remained. Fearful was I of what might come next, but fate didst smile upon me. The gyro salad, fresh and plentiful, didst delight mine taste buds. Decent pita bread and sauces didst accompany it.

Only to be met by an elderly woman, quite brash.

""Alas, my friends, I must revise my former review,
For Thin Crust pizza did not meet my expectations anew.
'Twas horrid, indeed, and should be struck from the list,
A travesty, compared to Rosati's, or so I insist.

We ordered Sausage and Bacon, with hope in our hearts,
But the crust was as cardboard, and tasted of naught but art.
We sent it back, and begged them to take it away,
And vowed to nevermore order it, come what may.

But fear not, dear friends, for all was not lost,
For the Penne pasta with meat sauce was truly the cost.
'Twas fantastic, a feast fit for a king,
A dish most worthy of praise, and a joy to sing.

Yet, understanding, came, when I didst see, Folk, eating in, with orders, placed before me. Homeward, I brought the sandwiches, with glee, And found them, quite good, indeed, they were. My wife, her Cuban chicken panini, didst enjoy, And I, the Steak and white cheddar, didst employ. A fair kick, from the horseradish, didst bring cheer. Chips, in small bags, for each, we didst receive, And the order, neatly packaged, in cardboard boxes, didst conceal. A quibble, I didst find, with no way to discern, Which sandwich, which, without undressing the bread. A suggestion, to HQ, I didst send, And they, didst reply, with thanks, and a vow to amend.

And twice, they have forgotten to remove the key.
Alack, this carelessness doth fill my heart with fear,
For auto thieves do roam these Arizonan streets with cheer.
Their customer service, methinks, doth leave much to be desired,
For though I came ere break of day, my discount was not fired.
I crossed the street to work, and when I returned,
I found my carriage waiting, but my savings unearned.

Baxter, GAP, Debenhams, and a food court so plush,
Zizzi, Burger Co., and more, a feast for the eyes,

I do confess, the food court doth please me well,
A scene most fair, like Blade Runner's spell.
But alas, 'tis not my fave shopping place,
Lacks charity shops, save Superdry's grace.
On Sundays, I visit here, with time to kill,

'Twas Pier 1, a haven of delight,
Where treasures lay in store, so bright.
Director chairs, lava lamps, and more,
Bamboo vases filled with baby's breath,
Did fill my heart with longing's fire,
To replace my room's Charlie's Angels' theme.

Pier 1 remains, a constant friend.

Still hold a certain charm, it seems.

With palm trees, bring a smile to my face,

Was brought to him, with nary a word or shriek.
Two other barkeeps, kind and bright,

A salad or soup doth one choose, and I, a humble bard, didst opt for an onion soup with Gruyere cheese, which didst please mine taste buds. The main course presented a trio of options: prime rib, herb-infused chicken, or salmon. Alas, the salmon didst arrive somewhat rare, and I, a lover of well-cooked fish, didst find it not to mine liking. The chicken, though flavorful, didst come accompanied by string fries, a curious choice indeed. Service, however, didst remain commendable, while drinks didst prove overpriced and the victuals, middling.""",True

Upon a Friday eve, our running group did meet,
At this establishment grand, with spaces to eat.
A patio without, and three floors within,
Did offer ample room for revelry to spin.
Their draughts of beer did flow in abundance,
Local brews aplenty, to quench thirst and danse.
Mixed drinks, too, did grace the menu fair,
For those who sought a stiffer drink to pair.
I ordered Ghost Burger, with sweet potato dish,
And found the bacon slices did make my wish.
The burger, spicy, yet not overly bold,
Grilled onions added zest, worth a tale to be told.
Alas, the service, slow, and staff not keen,
But Friday night, their busiest hour, I ween.
The prices steep, my purse did feel the sting,
Yet, for the fare, a price not unforeseen.
Thus, twenty dollars for a burger and ale,
A cost, I thought, did somewhat exceed the tale.",True

Fresh mint, and veggies, a sorry pack.

But summer's warmth and a large group didst sway,  
My thoughts, and so we didst decide to play.  
The rear, we took, with drinks well-made and cheap,  
Two pool tables there, yet awkwardly placed, didst creep.  
The tunes, a mix of old and new didst sound,

My husband found the bathroom attendant quite amusing,

The meat, it was quite good, I must confess,
But alas, the state of the place, didst leave much to be desired, I do profess.
It seemed not clean, and I, in truth, didst fear
That bugs might come forth from the kitchen, without a care.

I waited patiently, until the morrow,
To taste their wares, and see what they could borrow.

A regular burger, I didst order,
With bacon, eggs, and all the fixin's, in disorder.
The presentation, fair and bright,
But alas, the flavor, lacking in might.

The seating, comfortable, I must say,
The decor, quite pleasant, in a modern way.
The service, good, with nary a frown,
But alas, the food, a letdown, a disappointment profound.

I would return, for an out-of-towner's delight,
But for myself, I fear, not in sight.

And thus, a small indulgence, I didst request.
But lo, the answer came, a stern refusal,
A denial of my humble supplication.
In Vegas, city of excess and delight,
Such petty service doth leave a sour taste.

That draws a throng of diverse tricks.
Chubby gays, twinks, bears, old-timers too,
Fag hags, all welcome, as they do.

Inclusive, indeed, this watering hole,
Pre-club, a stop, or soul to console.
Specials daily, drinks that wet the whistle,

Sirloin, lamb, and shrimp, oh my!

Mussels, salmon, and tilapia, a delicious sight,

Vegetables, hot dishes, all well-prepared, 'twas said.
And drinks, they did include, in this deal,
A chinahuia, with pineapple, lime, and tequila, did steal.

The hunny, a rum runner, did pour,
Much heavier, than mine, it did devour.
Overall, an okay restaurant, I must confess,

We started with the Gouda fondue, a gooey delight,
But over-salted, perchance. Then, my companion didst partake
In the salmon, which he found most delectable, I must confess.

The au jus, a strong French onion brew, didst not agree with the sandwich,

But when I didst partake of the repast,
I found the flavours somewhat wanting, alas!

The sauces lacked a certain zest,
The meats were cooked, but not to perfection's crest.
The sides, though plentiful, didst lack a certain flair,

For sauce, so bland, and lacking seasoning, too.
No flavors danced upon my palate's delight,
Nay, not even a hint of sweetness took flight.

A waste, a folly, a misdeed!
And for this, they demand a fee,
Forty dollars, a price too steep!

The California roll, a gem, I confess,
With real crab meat, a rarity, no less.
But all else, a disappointment, a shame,
No special treats, no unique name.

Prime rib, cold shrimp, and crab, they say,
Are reasons why this buffet's the way.
But nay, my friends, those items find,
At every buffet, of a lower kind.

The price they ask, for it's not worth the fray.

I felt cornered, good sir, and quite taken aback,
For such a fee, I didst not see, nor was it tacked.

Secondly, my shirt, a fine garment, didst stain,
For bleeding through the robe, my hair color didst gain.
The stylist's manager, a gruff man, didst say,
'Twill come out in the wash, but I doth doubt the way.

Their beer, cold as winter's snow,
And menu, limited, yet fit to go.
Sandwiches, salads, and more, we did try,
Fair portions, prices, did not make us sigh.

Yet, flaws there be, that doth detract,
No happy hour, a sorrowful fact.
Limited menu, a lack, indeed,
No specials, nor deals, to plant a seed.

Not open all day, a shame,
Drinks, pricey, a burning flame.
UFC, ten dollars, a steep cost,

Rooms are priced fairly, though they have risen of late. The gardens at the entrance are a wondrous sight, a perfect spot for a photograph. Each eatery within is a culinary delight, not to be missed. I highly recommend Japonais, Kokomo, and Samba. Moreover, there be many tables scattered through the casino, ideal for those who wish to start small. Alas, they do not reward quad aces in the poker room, a pity indeed, for I have won many a handsome pot there. \n\nGiven its prime location on the Strip and proximity to other attractions, I would advise staying at The Mirage.

The shower's spray. A grievous fault, indeed.

The cheese, too, doth seem of good quality,  
And all the store, well-lit and clean, doth be.  
But alas, my favorite bacon, nowhere to be found,  
And but one loaf of bread, that doth my taste astound.  
I glimpsed their bulk section, full of sweet delights,  
But, full and satisfied, I did not tarry long in flight.

I lugged my bags, with nary a soul to aid,
Through corridors and stairs, in search of my abode,
Until at last, I called the front desk, in dismay,
And found my chamber, on a floor far away.

Aye, construction raged, with workers beeping,
And trucks, a-bustling, in the hotel's keeping,
But I, a paying guest, didst wait, with naught to do,
As a contractor tried, a trailer to back into view.

Seventy-five dishes, and more,
Chinese fare, with Clam Chowder, beef,
Stuffed Bell Peppers, Calzone, pizza, relief.

And pink marshmallows, who knew?
I laughed with glee, my spirits anew.
The staff was friendly, the place was neat,
With Sushi, Kim Chee, Egg Foo Young, a treat.

Fried chicken, spare ribs, mushrooms too,
Fish, shrimp, and more, a feast for you,
Desserts, including ice cream, sweet delight,

We waited nigh on 45 minutes, I swear,
Before we could get someone to take our fear.

Of 20%, which did our bill multiply.

Six dollars, a price that's quite excessive, I guess.

In Las Vegas, where clubs reign supreme,
I'd expect the best DJs, a nightly theme.
But perhaps he had a bad night, who knows?
The staff, kind and courteous, a pleasant surprise, no foes.

The cover charge, steep, a price to pay,
$40 for men, $20 for ladies, a difference to sway.
But the bouncer, kind, let my girl in free,
A gesture kind, a token of goodwill, a bargain to see.

I wouldn't return, not because of a frown,
But to try another club, a new scene to crown.
For those who stay at Caesar's, a decent spot,
But for others, a choice, a gamble to plot.""",True

""Hark, I dined at this eatery (take out) and savored their pad tai and PH\u00d2. The establishment was radiant, newly-built, and charming. The service was exceedingly cordial and punctual. The pad tai met my expectations, and I sampled my comrade's beef, which was equally delectable. Alas, I had been craving PH\u00d2, as it is scarce on the NW side, and my health required it. Oh, how my anticipation was deflated! Upon opening the container, the broth lacked its characteristic scent, and upon sipping, it tasted overly sweet and viscous, revolting! Moreover, the color was an unsettling shade of brown, despite my request for chicken PH\u00d2. I attempted to salvage the dish by adding noodles and seasonings, but alas, the odor and flavor were too much to bear. I drained the liquid and consumed the noodles instead. Verily, I would have bestowed five stars upon this venue, had it not been for the wretched PH\u00d2. Methinks perhaps I visited on an unfavorable day.""",True

A certain air of informality, akin to a humble tavern, rather than a refined Chicago steakhouse. Yet, the martini, well-mixed and generously poured, did please mine taste buds. 

Verily, I do confess, aesthetics play a significant role in mine culinary experiences. And thus, I must admit, the diminutive size of the salad fork didst strike a discordant note. Forsooth! A hearty, manly utensil doth complement a $50 steak, in mine humble opinion.

Moving onward, the crab appetizer, alas! Didst not quite meet mine expectations. A copious amount of Old Bay, coupled with a generous portion of crab, didst not quite tantalize mine taste buds. Nay, nay! Give me crab served upon a bed of golden straw, and I shall be content! Alas, this dish didst fall short of mine lofty standards.

The Wedge salad, dressed with blue cheese, a dish which, when prepared aright, doth delight, didst suffer from an excess of moisture, rendering the lettuce limp and the dressing somewhat bland.

But fear not, dear friends! For the steak, verily, didst shine resplendent! With mine miniature fork, I didst partake of a most tender, flavorful steak, accompanied by a trio of delectable sides - corn, spinach, and mashed potatoes. (Aye, I didst order three sides, forsooth!)

In conclusion, gentle readers, should thou find thyself in the vicinity of Del Frisco's, do give the steak a try. 'Tis worth the price of admission, I doth assure thee!""",True

Thou, I didst accept the offer and didst find that 'twas not entirely free, for I didst have to pay a sum of $20, albeit at a reduced price, they didst tell me. But lo, the line moved swiftly and I didst gain entry within five minutes. I didst avail myself of the coat-check, though 'twas at a cost of $5, lest I lose my garment. Straightway, I didst proceed to the bar and didst present my coupon for a complimentary drink. The barkeep didst inform me of my choices and I didst select one, which proved to be a passable potion. As I sipped my drink, I didst observe the gogo dancers and other maidens dancing and making merry. The gogo dancers were fair, their beauty didst shine bright, yet their movements didst lack a certain je ne sais quoi. The ladies within the club were fair and lovely, and didst grant me a moment to take a picture with them. Alas, I didst not partake in the dancing, for the floor didst appear somewhat cramped, but the music didst please mine ears, a mix of dance tunes and the speakers didst provide a sufficient volume. Moreover, they didst possess a VIP area for private gatherings. Methinks I shall return anon.""",True

Of covered parking, a convenience, no doubt.

Cleanliness, a virtue, lacking, I do fear,

Scheduling flights on Fridays, weekends, nay!
For crowds, aplenty, doth fill the space,
A chaotic scene, most vexing, in this place.

And thus, we come to terminal two,
For international flights, and those to Hawaii, anew.
Signs, easy to miss, a problem, I do declare,
A larger sign, a solution, they should prepare.

Parking, uncovered, rates the same, I find,
A pity, for travelers, with luggage, in mind.
Cleanliness, a word, not often heard,
In terminal two, a state, unpleasant, I have feared.

A sight that left me feeling somewhat lacking.

The green pole dancer, she was a wondrous sight,
Her movements fluid and graceful, a true delight.
And the chosen gentleman, oh so awkward and cute,
He brought a chuckle to my lips, I must admit.

A surprise, indeed, for in my life, I've never seen such a sight.

With sugar at 70%, a diluted taste did linger.

A place to fill thy tank, and thus doth roam.

The staff, so friendly and full of cheer,
Didst greet us with smiles, and banish fear.
The donuts, decent indeed they were,
Worth a visit, should thou have a crave to spare.

The tortilla soup, a joy beyond compare,

And spa, though pleasant, doth not compare to those of might.
iHomes, too, were missing, much to mine dismay,

The concierge, four folk at the desk, did naught,
Leaving us to linger, in wait, with nary a thought.

A duck large plate, with beans, rice, and mess.
No better than Milagro Grill or The Mission,
I didst expect more, with greater elation.

The okra, too salty, didst leave me aghast,
And service, at times, didst seem quite vast.

Steak, lettuce, tomato, salsa, all piled high,

Burger, flat grilled, hand pattied, 'twas thin,
Cooked medium rare, flavor did lack within.
Fries, unsalted, a dire need they did possess,
Coleslaw, a small portion, woeful, alack!

Three stars, methinks, a fair plight.
Breakfast, I shall return, 'tis my intent,
To savor morn's delight, my heart doth invent.""",True

""A novel notion, build thine own burger, doth not this place present,
But toppings of interest, they do offer, and buns of divers sorts, in abundance.
I chose a 1/3 lb. brie, a cheese most fair and rare,
With ham, a savory pairing, beyond compare.
Juicy and tasty, it did prove to be,
But alas, the cost, a king's ransom, it did command.
My burger, just shy of ten dollars, did amount,
And toppings, such as bacon, ham, and mushrooms, an extra fee, did mount.
A second cheese, another dollar, did require,
And lettuce, tomato, onions, and pickles, four free toppings, did exhaust.
Fries, a single serving, three dollars, did demand,
And shakes, though delicious, five dollars, did command.
Good food, but not worth the extra cost, in my humble view,
A princely sum, it did exact, and my purse, did woefully deplete.""",True

At the bar, I sat, my thirst not yet quenched.
Another bartender, with the ladies played,
While I, ignored, my drink did await.

The other bartender would not lend a hand,

So we took a table, the hostess told,
To get a beer, and an appetizer, bold.

The manager walked by, with a glance,
But kept on walking, without a chance.
He spoke to others, but not to us,
It seemed we were ignored, alas.

This place has potential, great indeed,
But falls flat, with poor service, speed.
They brew their own beer, a selection vast,
But the server knew not, what to say at last.

My husband tried it, and found it good,
But the server, knew not, as he should.
The food was decent, but slow to come,
A disappointment, our evening became.

Alas, we shall not return again,

'Tis called The Sirens of TI, a sight to behold,
Akin to an ill-fashioned sweater, old,
Yet in its ugliness, a beauty doth lie,
A theme of mirth and revelry, doth it provide.

Go forth, dear friends, with minds untainted,
Expect not grandeur, lest ye be disappointed,
But rather, embrace the bad, the awful,
And in its wake, find joy unbridled.

Early shows, before the club doth open wide,
Are best, my friends, take heed of this advice,

Didst make me feel most welcome, in their book,
But, alas, the atmosphere, didst not agree,
With my fine watch, sharp dress, and imported car, you see.
Awkward, I didst feel, like an unexpected guest,
In this strip mall, not quite the coziest of nest.

The lamb shanks, which my wife didst order, didst cost
Twenty-three silver pieces, and though they didst taste
Most wondrous, the price didst seem a mite too high,
For what we didst receive, in truth, didst not seem quite nigh.

A draught of apple martini, priced at ten, didst flow,
And a Stella Artois, on tap, didst also show
Itself to be of worth, yet the music, loud and clear,
Didst grate upon mine ears, and didst bring a fear
That I didst shout, o'er the din, to make myself heard.

Three euros ninety, a price to make one fall.

Alas, the waitstaff, their English skills were lacking, and their service, poor, yet the atmosphere didst bustle with activity, the cooks and servers shouting betwixt the buffet and kitchen in Chinese.

Chinese fried chicken, small wings, a delight,
Better than American, a taste so bright.

The host, a kindly soul, did welcome us with grace,
And led us to the bar, where we did await our place.
But then, oh how the tableside service did decline,
Our waiter, slow to come, and with a surly mien.
No check-ins to ensure all was well, we had to call,
To get our drinks refilled, and that did cause a pall.

The price, fair friends, was reasonable, I must confess,
But the poor service did leave a bitter taste, I must profess.
So if thou art planning a trip to this fine place,
Prepare thyself for disappointment, and a sorry face.
Botero, a safer choice, doth offer better cheer,
So there, my friends, thy money shall be better spent, I fear.""",True

He doth ignore my requests, and doth make me ask thrice,  
For a towel, a humble thing, yet he doth not comply.  
And though the rest of the staff, do make me feel welcome,

My burger, verily, was quite good.  Next time, I shall order it medium rare, for 'twas too well done, to mine own taste.  Hot fries, I didst request, and they were brought forth.  My daughter, alack, didst find the pretzels and beer cheese to be lacking.  A tale, we didst tell, to the waitperson, of the faulty cheese.  Beer cheese, by rights, should be orange and creamy.  Alas, 'twas naught but pretzel bites, with a whitish, watery cheese, that didst taste of naught but salad dressing.  Ranch, it didst resemble, sans the garlic.  My daughter, she didst declare, 'twas awful.  And, upon tasting it, I knew somethings amiss.  Flavorless and watery, it didst lack all taste of cheese or beer.  The waitress, she didst not believe, nor didst she offer to replace it.  Strange, methought, for such a thing, she shouldst have done.  My daughter, she didst order appetizers, instead of a meal, and thus, I didst feel a pang of guilt.  Glad, I am, to see appetizers and other sandwiches, now on the menu.

In this place, I came to seek a massage of the whole body. 'Twas passable, but one thing did vex me sore. For in this single room, distractions abound, with chattering folk, shuffling feet, and moans from those who receive their rub. A screen or partition, I did wish, to block out diversions and grant peace. But nay, 'twas not to be, for such is the price one pays, I suppose.

The lass who worked her magic on my frame was pleasant enough, at first, her touch light as a feather. But then, she did apply great force to my shoulders, and lo, they still ache with pain the morrow after.

And furthermore, a strange custom they have here, wherein the masseurs gather at the front, awaiting their due. They will not depart, nor allow thee to leave, until a gratuity is given. Methinks 'tis a curious practice, indeed.

The servers, too, didst dress in humble garb, a stark contrast to the finery I hadst hoped to behold. \nBut fear not, for the food didst make amends, in part. Bruschetta, alas, didst disappoint, being naught but plain toast, small and lacking in flavor. Yet, mushroom risotto, twisted burger, and mac and cheese didst delight, each dish a culinary triumph.

The sauce, akin to bisque, a taste most fine,
Didst bring joy to my senses, and made me decline
All other dishes, save the rice, a gummy mess,
And coconut ice cream, a sweetness I must confess.

Other dishes, too, didst taste, with glee,
Creamed spinach, gnocchi, lobster au curry, for thee.
Spinach, oh so fine, didst make my heart sing,

Eight dollars, a fair price to pay,

With dressings and toppings, a veritable feast.

To the feast, and the hommos, smooth and creamy, doth pair
Well with the flatbread, a fine complement indeed.
The pies and grape leaves, though not the best, do still succeed
In pleasing my palate, and the beverages, a fine array,
Do include some robust brews from lands far away.

The rooms, a bit outdated, didst appear, and somewhat stale, didst they feel.

My greatest grief, a tale of woe and sorrow,
Is that they've reversed the spice, a mistake most grave, to borrow.
Twice hath this happened, a curry without heat,

A discount card, of sorts, for frequent diners, it affords.

My feet and hands did cry out for repair,
A pedicure and manicure, I did pray,
To make me presentable once more, ere the day.

I showed up at the salon, sans appoint,
And waited but ten minutes,'mongst the throng,
Jimmy, skilled artisan, did then attend,
And gave my feet a stone pedicure, so grand.

The cost, forty-five, a sum not small,
But gel, an extra twenty-five, did enthrall,
And ombre nails, five more, did I choose,
To make my feet most fair, and win applause.

Tuyet, a manicurist of great renown,
Did tend my hands, with gel, and ombre crown,
Accent nail, a goal, did she achieve,
For forty, a sum, I did not demur, or grieve.

For look, I sought, did it convey,

Soups in test tubes, flat breads most divine,
A culinary experience, beyond compare, I do declare.

My wife, however, didst savor her affogato with great relish, and I must say, I didst find amusement in the clever manner in which they teach Italian to those who dare to venture forth and partake of the facilities. 'Tis a unique experience, to be sure!

There be a few things that doth keep it from being a five-star affair, as thus: the calamari appetizer, small indeed, with naught but seven or eight rings; and, alas! They do not serve soda water, which doth vex mine soul. Yet, despite these shortcomings, 'tis still a grand value, with prices most fair and hibachi dinner most delectable.

Splitting bills is simple, requests met without alarm.
I've only visited at noon, dinner may differ,
But pictures of stacked plates bring forth mirth and laughter.""",True

'Twas my first time in Vegas, and I must confess,
I didst enjoy this hotel's quietness and peace.
No casino did they have, and that didst suit me well,
For I do not partake in games of chance.
Thou mayst wonder, why then doth one come to Vegas?
But I didst seek the city's vibrant atmosphere,
And found it in this hotel, with its spacious rooms,
A living area, with large flat screen, and kitchen too.
The bathroom, large and clean, didst please mine eyes,
And the view of Las Vegas, most wondrous sight.

A quiet stay, and not the rowdy, wild streak.""",True

In yonder kitchen, where they doth reside,
To be adorned with frosting, at thy behest,
And thus, the cupcake crisis doth cease.

For mentioning ""sugar rush,"" in Twitter's fray.

With layers deep, and moistness beyond compare,

The frosting, oh! It was a marvel, indeed,
Like fudge from Disney World, or Rocky's creed,
So rich, so smooth, so utterly divine,

The corn cakes, with pork so tender and flavorful, were surely the crowning glory of our repast. The Arcadia Salad, too, didst delight.

The atmosphere, with its openness and charm, didst please me well. But, alack, the music didst not conform to my tastes. Paula Abdul's melodies didst not enhance my enjoyment of the meal, and I didst find myself wishing for something more avant-garde, more hip, to complement the ambiance.

Despite these quibbles, I do confess, this establishment hath won my favor. Well done, good sirs!""",True

A burger similar, minus the truffles so grand.
Thirty dollars, the price doth descend,

Verily, they didst possess sundry touristy items, which mattered not a whit to me, for I didst procure a Pawn Stars t-shirt, and felt proud of my prize.

A place where libations flow like dew.
In Sin City's depths, we chanced upon this spot,
Where cocktails reign, and revelry is not.

My senses heightened, spirits divine.

With mixes varied, our group did sway.

A midnight kiss, Bellini, Strawberry bliss,
Our taste buds danced, with joyous dismiss.

As I, in haste, did utter, ""Slow, my song!""

A place where nails are shaped with care,

In harmony they sit, both inside and out,
Listening to the minstrels, whose tunes do shout.

Turkey on dark rye, with avocado, a taste so fine.

To taste the famed Flying Biscuit's fare,

In Las Vegas, where lights doth shine so bright and stars doth twinkle rare.

With dance and song, it doth enthrall, and doth leave thee in a trance.

Choose seats toward the back, and in the middle, fit,
For there is much to see, and hear, and thou doth not desire,
To strain thy neck, in wonder, like a curious choir.

For it doth bring joy, and memories, in such abundant ways,
So, if thou art in Vegas, and seekest merriment,

Of clinics veterinary, in Arcadia found,
Where pets are healed, their health profound.

A boxer, accident-prone, I do possess,
And thus, have visited many a place,
But one clinic stands out, in price most fair,
With staff great, doctor skilled, beyond compare.

Gets nervous round vets, and may attack,
But these kind souls, patient, calm, and true,
Treat her with care, as if their own anew.

Their honesty, a virtue, rare and bright,
No greed, no schemes, just plain good sight,
They told me, truthful, my dog's teeth clean,
No need for costly service, just a dream.

So, friends, take note, for pets in need,
This clinic, spay and neuter, indeed,
Unless, of course, your purse be deep,
In which case, choose where you will, and sleep.

""Hark! 'Tis been five months since last I didst dine
At this establishment, wherefore I didst return,
With Mike C., to see if it still doth shine.
A Sunday it was, when last I didst partake,
And now, a weekday, to witness its state.
Fear not, dear Yelpies, for 'tis still most fair,
The victuals they didst serve, to a full house,
Didst include baby bok choy, in garlic fish sauce,
Stuffed crabs, on the half-shell, a wondrous sight,
And four choices of ice cream, a sweet delight.
Woohoo! indeed, for this place doth still reign supreme.""",True

""Though time be of the essence, fair Staff at RiRa didst handle our group of nineteen with grace and ease upon a thirsty Thursday eve. Let not the thought of uptown parking deter thee from joining in the merriment, for the Discovery Place parking deck lieth but a short distance away, making RiRa readily accessible to those not dwelling uptown.""",True

""A quaint confectionery, this sweet shoppe doth be,
With candies stored in jars of glass, a sight to see.
The staff, so kind and helpful, doth retrieve the treats,
A blessing for my clumsy hands, that oft do meet defeat.

I purchased cotton candy, freshly spun,
And watched with wonder as they worked their fun.
The portion, generous and large, did last us four days long,
A delightful treat, with sparkles added, to make it throng.

Indeed, this shoppe doth bring a smile to mine face,
With its old-fashioned charm and sweets in abundance, what a place!""",True

""Hark! What news is this? My heart doth sing,
A spa of wondrous worth, I do declare!
In yonder valley, fair and bright,
I chanced upon this haven of delight.

A scrub and facial, Ranee did impart,
And with such skill, she did win my heart.
I slept, enraptured by her gentle touch,
As masks of bliss did softly brush and clutch.

This facial, best of all, I do avow,
Ranee's artistry, my skin doth now allow.
Pampered, I felt, and still doth feel,
My visage, smooth and radiant, doth reveal.

The products used, of quality high,
Aveda, thou art surpassed, say I.
No gooeyness, my skin didst retain,
A true delight, this spa doth obtain.

Prices, fair and reasonable, they be,
I shall return, anon, 'tis plain to see.
My heart, doth dance with joy, indeed,
For this spa, my soul, doth take great heed.""",True

""Hark! What eatery is this, that doth proclaim
Their macaroni and cheese, a culinary gem?
A place where steaks and ribs, do reign supreme,
And onion rings, a tasty delight, doth seem.

The staff, so friendly, doth make one feel at home,
And take-out, swift as lightning, doth roam.
A pint of mac and cheese, a mere four dollars buy,
With corn bread, the best in town, doth make one's eyes fly.
Laughter doth ensue, at such a wondrous sight,
For here, they doth serve, a true culinary delight.""",True

In Warren, New Jersey, a wondrous sight to partake.
The woman, a paragon of virtue and grace,
Didst arrive on time, with a smile on her face.

DOUG, thou art a craftsman of great skill,
Whose work doth rival that of the finest smith.
Thou didst install a pet door, most fair and bright,
In our home, with nary a moment's plight.
This was the second time thou hast graced our abode,
With thy expertise and most excellent mode.
Thou didst move an outlet and a cable box,
To the opposite wall, with minimal cost, I do suppose.
I wouldst recommend thee, without hesitation or doubt,
For thy work doth speak for itself, most loudly and devout.",True

""Verily, 'tis my most cherished taco shoppe in all the realm, for it doth remind me of Tacos El Gordo, that famed establishment in Tijuana. Oh, how I do adore their delectable tacos, so genuine and mouth-watering! And, by the stars, what a bargain! For the quantity of victuals thou dost receive, the price is most reasonable. In truth, I didst visit this place thrice within a fortnight, and I do confess, I shall purposely prolong my sojourn in Las Vegas, that I might partake of their culinary delights once more.""",True

In sooth, a whimsical notion didst stir within our breasts,
To seek this place, when Mexican fare didst disappoint.
And lo, the pizza here didst prove most wondrous,
In square slices, not the usual wedges, what a delight!

The dessert, a crown of sweetness, didst complete our night,
Baked cookies, ice cream, a feast most fair and bright.
Five pounds heavier, yet with smiles on our faces,
Didst we depart, in joy and contentment's embrace.",True

""A pizza parchment didst lie beneath my inn's door,
Advertising a culinary delight, a feast for the eyes and the taste.
Chicago Deep Dish, a delicacy I hadst never tried,
But heard of its fame, and how it doth satisfy.

Pictures of such pies, I hadst seen before,
But never hadst tasted, for I do not roam.
Disappointment didst befall me, at other establishments,
That didst claim to serve deep dish, but failed to present.

Yet, this particular parchment didst catch mine eye,
With a picture most enticing, and a promise to fulfill.
I didst decide to venture forth, and give it a go,
And verily, 'twas the best pizza I hadst known.

In years, I hadst not savored such delight,
With cheese, sauce, and toppings, all in perfect sight.
The crust, not too thick, nor fried, didst please mine taste,
And my comrade and I, could not devour the whole feast.

If thou dost crave a pizza, with toppings galore,
And a flavorful sauce, that doth make thee implore,
Give this place a chance, and thou shalt not be wroth,
For 'tis a culinary joy, and a true gastronomic birth.""",True

Tuna, seared and seasoned to perfection,   Atop hummus, a dish of pure elation.   A combination, I confess, I would not have thought,   But the flavors, they do truly astound and besought.   And the gyro, oh so tender and tasty,   Not a morsel of street meat, I do swear.   My wife, she had hummus and beef tips,   And she, too, did find it quite delightful and hip.   A young vibe, with a bar scene most merry,   Open late, for those who do enjoy a night so very.   Quick sit down service, with nary a wait,   We shall return, and soon, I do predicate.""",True

Where blowouts be had, and beauty doth shine.

And friendly folk didst greet us there.

A customized order, they didst prepare,
With local, fresh ingredients they didst share.
Vegetarian options, they didst provide,
And meat dishes too, for those who do prescribe.

An outdoor space, perfect for a spring day,
Where one can dine and bask in the sun's ray.
Casual, indeed, a place for work or play,
For a quick lunch or a toddler's delightful sway.

Twists on classics, they didst present,
A broccoli, cheddar, and jalapeno bent.
Fresh, light, and housemade, a delicious treat,
A taste most wondrous, a culinary feat.""",True

In winter's chill, a steaming bowl of soup doth warm,
While summer's heat doth call for salads fresh and cool.

My heart doth sing with joy at thought of potato cream,
And broccoli cheese, a dish most wondrous and serene.
The Mediterranean Salad, a feast for eyes and taste,
Doth rival all else, save perhaps the BLT,
With avocado and cheese, a treat most fair and bright.

Nor ravioli, filled with savory goodness and bite.

And lo, I didst find solace in the gentle ministrations of Dr. Harouni, whose praises have been sung by many a grateful patient. Intelligent, kind, and unhurried, she didst guide me to the capable hands of Dr. Schroeder, an eminent ENT, who, with skill and precision, didst remove my tonsils, a feat which two other doctors, including the aforementioned Kimberly Adams, didst decline to undertake.""",True
