Consequently, a plethora of grievances have been lodged against the company, with myself being a prime example, having been charged two hundred dollars, as explicitly stated on my ticket, yet the sales receipt boldly declares that all sales are final. Therefore, I strongly advise potential patrons to exercise caution and peruse the numerous unfavorable reviews prior to making a decision regarding the use of their services. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that the employees responsible for cleaning my vehicle saw fit to appropriate the loose change contained within my ashtray, which was subsequently divided among them as a form of tip money at the end of each day.

The crust, supposedly crafted with water from New York, was unjustifiably burnt and charred, rendering it inedible. The sauce, if present, was seemingly devoid of any discernible flavor profile. The cheese, what little there was, had been cooked to an unfortunate state of desiccation, resulting in a texture akin to paper. The pepperoni slices, measuring a paltry dime in size, were applied with an heavy hand, defying any semblance of authentic Italian cuisine. Furthermore, the solitary basil leaf, dried to a crisp, situated in the center of the pizza, served no apparent purpose other than to accentuate the overall lackluster quality of the dish. In fact, a hastily prepared Pillsbury biscuit, topped with ketchup and Kraft cheese, would likely prove more satisfying when subjected to a makeshift cooking method involving a fire pit. Additionally, this restaurant's absence of ranch dressing as a condiment option only serves to further underscore its shortcomings. People, let us not be deceived by such transparent gimmicks.

The queue for check-in was excessively prolonged, leading to considerable embarrassment on my part, particularly in light of the presence of my staff. Upon finally gaining access to our accommodations, it became apparent that the rooms had not undergone any significant renovations since the 1980s, featuring antiquated furnishings and inadequate climate control systems that emitted an incessant, annoying hum every two minutes, rendering them utterly futile. Furthermore, the bedding consisted of flimsy, threadbare blankets that offered scant protection against the elements, resulting in my contracting a virulent cold during the third night of my stay. The bathtub, too, was unacceptably shallow and outdated, possessing an unsightly, grimy appearance that precluded any possibility of enjoyable immersion. Given the dearth of viable alternatives, I opted not to lodge a formal complaint, as I surmised that relocation to another room would yield scant improvement in terms of amenities. Frankly, I would have preferred to stay at a Comfort Suites establishment rather than suffer the indignity of remaining at this purported four-star hotel.

 It is worth mentioning that, initially, they did attempt to implement TSA PreCheck at the C gates, but unfortunately, this initiative was short-lived. On my most recent journey, I decided to venture through the D gates, hoping to gain entry to the C gates via a TSA agent. To my dismay, no one was present to facilitate my passage. As I attempted to exit, two TSA officers entered, and their reaction was less than cordial, demanding to know my destination in a rather brusque manner. Moreover, they displayed skepticism when I pointed out the C-gate PreCheck sign, and I was compelled to display my boarding pass. Subsequently, I was forced to exit.
 On subsequent occasions, I chose to proceed directly to the primary C-Gate (Southwest) security area, whereupon displaying my boarding pass, I was directed toward a special queue that meandered along the wall, leading to a solitary TSA agent stationed at a TSA PreCheck booth. Regrettably, this line tends to be quite lengthy, often comprising ten to twelve individuals.
 It is important to note that there are two additional TSA agents positioned at a nearby stand, both of whom display TSA PreCheck signs, allowing any individual to join their line and subsequently benefit from the PreCheck privilege. Furthermore, access to these alternative stations is unavailable from the primary TSA PreCheck line.",True,254.0,formal

My significant other consumed copious amounts of alcoholic beverages, rendering her vulnerable to the nefarious intentions of a malevolent individual employed by the nightclub.

Specifically, Greyhound maintains a virtual monopoly on intercity bus travel, making it the de facto choice for those seeking to traverse vast distances.

I regret to inform that the quality of service provided by Greyhound does not justify the exorbitant price of $140 roundtrip, which I reluctantly paid for a journey from New York City to Montreal.

Upon returning from my trip, I arrived over an hour prior to the scheduled departure time of 5 pm for the express bus to NYC. To my utter dismay, I was informed that the bus had been overbooked, and a supplementary bus would be required to accommodate the excess passengers, resulting in a delayed departure at 6 pm. This secondary bus would follow a local route, stopping at every intermediate point, further prolonging the already excruciating journey.

My experience with Greyhound can only be described as a calamitous odyssey, as I did not arrive back in NYC until 2:30 am, following a series of aggravating delays and misadventures. Moreover, my attempts to seek restitution or even a modicum of accountability from Greyhound's customer service department proved futile, as they professed a complete absence of knowledge regarding the overbooking fiasco.

It is simply unacceptable to pay such an exorbitant fee for a subpar experience, particularly when compared to the more affordable and ostensibly less reliable alternatives like Fung-Wah.

Alas, my expectations were quickly thwarted.

I reasoned with him, explaining that the associated number could easily be accessed via my phone, thereby facilitating a harmonious resolution for all parties involved. However, his manager proved equally intransigent, leaving me no choice but to escalate the matter to the proprietor himself. Unfortunately, he too maintained the same unyielding stance.

While waiting, I couldn't help but notice that the staffing arrangement during peak hours on a Saturday afternoon consisted of a solitary individual tasked with managing both drive-in and walk-in orders.

Following our eventual seating, a considerable delay of 25 minutes ensued before we received a glass of water. Furthermore, the BBQ ribs we had eagerly anticipated proved to be persistently unavailable, despite numerous attempts to procure them. In response to my notification to the manager, he presented us with a TOGO box containing a limited quantity of ribs as we departed the premises.

It is also worth noting that the prices charged for these items are somewhat exorbitant.

As an habitue of this establishment, I have heretofore enjoyed a satisfactory dining experience; however, my most recent visit proved to be a gastronomical debacle of monumental proportions. In conjunction with a companion, I opted to partake of a platter of fried clam strips and peel-and-eat shrimp, an apparent innocuous selection. Upon the arrival of the former, my initial reaction was utter disbelief, as the clams appeared to be of an unprecedented magnitude, measuring no less than five inches in length. This anomaly notwithstanding, I decided to proceed with consumption, albeit with a modicum of trepidation. The ensuing taste was passable, yet the texture was somewhat rubbery, leading me to harbor lingering doubts as to the authenticity of these mollusks. Unfortunately, my skepticism was soon validated, as within a span of five hours, I experienced severe stomach cramps, followed by an episode of vomiting that expelled the entirety of the consumed fare, accompanied by an additional hour of intense dry heaving, ultimately culminating in a febrile state that necessitated an absence from my place of employment.

However, the seating arrangement within the auditorium left much to be desired, as the seats were excruciatingly cramped, providing patrons with a meager amount of legroom that made it challenging for individuals of above-average height to maintain a comfortable posture. In fact, even when positioning my legs laterally, I found myself still pressed up against the adjacent row, resulting in an agonizing experience akin to being trapped in a prolonged and rigid yoga pose for the duration of three hours. It is worth mentioning that the rows of seating were situated in such proximity to one another that only my sister-in-law, who stands at a mere 5'1\"", could manage to sit comfortably without enduring any discomfort.

Following payment, we awaited our beverages, but instead, we received two regular-sized drinks. While this was not a catastrophic occurrence, we graciously brought it to the barista's attention that we had, in fact, requested a large iced tea. Conflict resolution within a coffee shop setting is relatively straightforward; the cost of averting an argument and gratifying a patron far surpasses the cost of re-preparing their order.

Despite our intention to indulge in a more substantial meal, Bo insisted that we were obligated to order food, given that we had opted to occupy a table rather than a spot at the bar. Our initial reluctance to comply with this stipulation was further exacerbated by Bo's evident irritation at our decision to proceed with caution in terms of our order, as we opted to sample the fried oysters and avail ourselves of the happy hour specials on offer.

My initial enthusiasm for satisfying my culinary cravings was quickly replaced by utter dismay and incredulity at the interminable delay at the drive-through window. Following what seemed like an eternity, I finally received my order, only to be met with further disappointment. The supposed ""mini"" chicken quesadilla was nothing short of an unmitigated disaster. The cheese was so overcooked and congealed that it was nigh impossible to extricate it from its aluminum casing. Upon managing to unwrap the foil, I was confronted with an unholy mess of burnt, gooey, and utterly revolting excuse for a meal. It beggars belief that any self-respecting eatery could have the temerity to proffer such an abomination to paying customers. Needless to say, the offending item was summarily dispatched to the rubbish bin, without even the faintest glimmer of hope for redemption. The sole saving grace of the meal was the relatively unscathed state of the chalupa, which, by some small miracle, managed to escape the kitchen relatively unscathed. However, this solitary bright spot did little to assuage the overall feeling of utter disappointment and betrayal engendered by this woeful dining experience.

While attending a technological symposium in the vicinity, I encountered considerable difficulties with the internet connectivity, both within the conference venue and the guest rooms themselves. The wireless and wired networks were incredibly unreliable, leading me to question their efficacy. Furthermore, the aesthetic ambiance of the accommodations left much to be desired, with an antiquated decor that seemed frozen in time. However, the most distressing aspect of my stay occurred during my first morning, when I encountered a regrettable situation while shaving. Specifically, one sink became clogged with my water, while the other sink simultaneously backed up with a noxious, dark liquid. This was not only inconvenient but also posed a potential health hazard. Additionally, I had cause to complain about the absence of an adequate seal at the base of the adjoining door between my suite and its neighbor. As a result, I was able to overhear every sound emanating from the adjacent room with startling clarity, making me feel as though I was essentially sharing a room with the occupants next door. Insistent on a change of accommodations, I requested and received a transfer to a different room. Unfortunately, my final morning in this new room was marred by an eerie gurgling noise, followed by an unmistakable foul odor. Upon entering the bathroom, I was appalled to discover black liquid rising up through the shower drain. I promptly reported this disturbing incident upon checkout, only to be met with an attitude of indifference from the staff.

This striking absence of hospitality is further compounded by the glaring omission of basic amenities such as toothpaste, which are readily available at other comparable hotels.

The ambiance, too, is an affront to the senses, with a decor that appears to be the result of a haphazard assortment of items procured from a local thrift store.

However, due to my tardy deliberation, the tariffs at the aforementioned establishment had escalated beyond my desired budget for such a brief sojourn. Consequently, I elected to seek accommodations at the nearby Planet Hollywood, which offered a comparatively reasonable rate and was situated merely across the street from the Bellagio. Although my experience at Planet Hollywood cannot be described as utterly deplorable, I must confess that it fell short of my expectations. The guest quarters exuded an air of antiquation and did not radiate an aura of fastidious cleanliness. Furthermore, the decorative elements within the rooms seemed rooted in a bygone era, specifically the 1990s, and lacked the contemporary flair that I have come to anticipate from upscale Strip hotels. It appears that Planet Hollywood's ambiance aligns with that of its primary entertainer, Britney Spears, whose performances are characterized by a faintly tawdry quality. Various deficiencies in my lodgings included: an absent drawer front, an unpleasant odor emanating from the faucet water in the sink, and pull chain shades that exhibited a propensity for sticking.

In contrast to the bustling atmosphere typically associated with reputable Las Vegas buffets, this venue was eerily deserted at 7 pm on a Wednesday evening, which is ordinarily a popular time for patrons to indulge in a gastronomical excursion. Furthermore, it is worth noting that buffets in general rely heavily on rapid turnover to ensure that the cuisine remains fresh and appetizing; regrettably, this particular establishment appeared to neglect this fundamental principle, as the food stationed beneath the heat lamps seemed stale and aged. Moreover, the prime rib offered was overcooked to an unfortunate degree, further contributing to the overall disappointment of the dining experience.

The vegetables were suspended in a watery bath, suggesting that they had been hastily microwaved and inadequately drained.

Moreover, the seating arrangement within the establishment is woefully inadequate, particularly indoors, resulting in an overcrowded atmosphere that is further exacerbated by the presence of a throng of rowdy college students and self-proclaimed business professionals who frequent the Mill Ave. area.

It prompts one to ponder the rationale behind the proprietors' selection of such locales, especially in areas notorious for their abysmal street parking, where the daily phenomenon of overflowing parking lots is an inevitable occurrence, thus effectively sabotaging the entire experience from its inception. It appears to be a deliberate ploy to create the illusion of high demand by artificially limiting seating and parking, while simultaneously maintaining an interminable waitlist.
 If one has the foresight to arrive promptly upon the establishment's opening, it is occasionally feasible to secure a seat at the bar, thereby rendering the experience marginally more tolerable. In this case, it is advisable to order individual slices accompanied by beer, as this will facilitate a relatively swift and efficient service.

It was evident that the dumplings were poured directly from a bag that had been stored in a frozen state, which led me to infer that the grimy kitchen could not possibly contaminate them to an appreciable extent.  Notwithstanding the fact that my fried dumplings typically arrived charred, I would immerse them in sauce, and they served as a source of sustenance that enabled me to endure numerous closing shifts at the Bucks.

Prior to this transaction, our association with Mr. Corliss spanned eight years, during which time we experienced unwavering and satisfactory service. However, subsequent to the acquisition, we have been inundated with telephone calls from H&R Block operatives who persist in invoking Mr. Corliss's name as a marketing ploy to secure new clients. When queried about the possibility of scheduling an appointment with Mr. Corliss, these representatives offer appointments with other accountants under their employ, without divulging the fact that they are, in reality, H&R Block personnel. 
It is worth mentioning that Mr. Corliss himself informed us of his decision to sell his business and retire last year. Unfortunately, the ensuing experience proved to be a calamitous imbroglio, characterized by deplorable office management and a succession of incompetent office managers. 
In conclusion, it would be injudicious to allow oneself to be deceived by the lingering presence of Mr. Corliss's name in association with the enterprise; for, in point of fact, it now falls under the purview of H&R Block, whose performance has been subpar, to say the least.

We opted for the four-cheese Nacho platter, which we requested be augmented with black beans, an additional expense that we felt was warranted given the menu item's description. Upon their arrival, the Nachos were found to possess a meager amount of pico de gallo and a token sprinkling of black beans, which seemed incongruous with the dish's advertised composition. Our server, however, demonstrated commendable attentiveness by recognizing the inadequacy of the black beans and proffering a supplementary bowl of them, thereby salvaging the situation from a service standpoint. Regrettably, the quality of the Nachos themselves left much to be desired. One of the four cheeses exhibited a flavor profile akin to Velveeta, which, in conjunction with the scantiness of the other toppings, rendered the dish unsatisfactory. In light of the price point, we considered it appropriate to expect a more substantial snack, one that would incorporate elements such as jalapenos, onions, pico de gallo, salsa, and beans in greater abundance.

It is thoroughly unfortunate that it is not feasible to post a rating of zero stars, for it would accurately reflect the subpar quality of service provided by 777 Towing. Do not squander your time and resources by engaging with this particular company, as it is abundantly evident that their modus operandi revolves around woefully inadequate communication and an apparent lack of concern for the well-being of their clientele. Should your insurance provider inform you that 777 Towing will be dispatched to assist you, it is advisable to request an alternative service provider, as the former's proficiency in fulfilling their obligations leaves much to be desired.

However, my satisfaction with her services terminates at this juncture. During my recent visit to her office, I experienced considerable discomfort, swelling, and grinding sensations in my wrist, prompting her to provide me with a brace and arrange for X-rays to be taken. Additionally, she assured me that a referral letter would be dispatched to Steinberg Diagnostics without delay, as an MRI scan was imperative. Furthermore, she instructed me to contact her office the following day to schedule an appointment for the aforementioned imaging procedure. Unfortunately, I encountered numerous difficulties while attempting to secure said appointment, as the referral letter had yet to be processed. This resulted in a series of telephone conversations with both Steinberg Diagnostics and SMA, during which I was informed that the processing time for such referrals typically ranges from five to seven days. Now, while I acknowledge that delays can occur, I cannot help but feel frustrated by the condescending demeanor exhibited by the SMA representative I spoke with at 10 a.m. Their response, which included an unnecessary clarification of Susan Schuder's professional title, struck me as dismissive and unhelpful.

Particularly in one of the primary nightlife districts, during the hours of 2-3 am when establishments are closing their doors, the absence of taxis cruising the streets is nothing short of a calamity. It is utterly reprehensible that in a city of this size, with a population density of this magnitude, there are no cabs accessible on the streets. Is it truly the objective of taxi companies to maximize profits or are they merely engaging in business as a leisure activity? 

Secondly, it is absolutely imperative that when a taxi is summoned via telephone, the taxi company in question dispatches a vehicle in a timely and efficient manner. It is utterly inexcusable for a taxi company to fail to deliver a taxi in a reasonable time frame, particularly after multiple assurances have been given to the effect that a taxi is en route.

Furthermore, our request for a creamer was not fulfilled in a timely manner, as the gentleman responsible for attending to our needs failed to return with the requested item, despite his initial assurance that he would do so. Instead, we were compelled to solicit the assistance of a busboy, who provided us with a soiled creamer replete with fresh jam residue on its base. Upon requesting a substitute creamer from our server, we were eventually furnished with a replacement. Disappointingly, our culinary selections did not meet our expectations. Specifically, the eggs benedict dishes we ordered (Florentine and crab, respectively) were subpar. The Florentine iteration was particularly underwhelming, as the eggs were unacceptably runny, and the asparagus components were minuscule and fragmented. As an ardent devotee of eggs florentine, I was taken aback by the absence of fresh asparagus, which was replaced by what appeared to be chopped artichoke hearts. Additionally, the English muffins accompanying our dishes were excessively buttered, thereby detracting from the overall quality of the meal. Ultimately, our experience at this venue was unsatisfactory, with the coffee being the sole redeeming aspect of our visit.

We were, however, upgraded from the most basic and smallest room category to a so-called ""King Suite."" Regrettably, this upgrade merely translated to a slightly larger bed, which was modestly comfortable, and an irregularly shaped room that was somewhat more spacious. The television set was positioned at such a distance from the bed that the remote control proved ineffective unless we physically rose from bed and traversed the room. 

The room was clean, albeit somewhat antiquated, and despite setting the air conditioning unit to 66 degrees Fahrenheit, my companion and I both awakened in a state of perspiration during the night due to the oppressive heat. 

The WiFi connection, which is frequently complimentary in even the most affordable hotels, cost $12 for a mere 24 hours.

Furthermore, the visual and olfactory appeal of the cuisine showcased on the menu heightened my anticipation. However, upon being seated and partaking in the fare, I was swiftly disillusioned, as the flavors proved to be woefully lacking. Specifically, the meatballs, which Rao's purportedly specializes in, were unremarkable and surpassed in quality by those found in the frozen food section of a local supermarket. Similarly, the lasagna, while not the most unpalatable dish I have had the misfortune of consuming, fell short of even the most modest expectations, particularly when compared to the offerings of the local church's female parishioners, whose pasta dishes are not only more flavorful but also significantly more affordable. The true nadir of the meal, however, was the combination of peas, onions, and prosciutto, which was so glaringly devoid of any discernible flavor that it bordered on the incomprehensible.

1," I arrived during the week preceding Thanksgiving, which customarily constitutes an off-peak season, thereby resulting in a relative dearth of crowds and a heightened sense of tranquility throughout Las Vegas.

Pros:

* My accommodations were remarkably silent, as I failed to detect even the slightest murmur emanating from neighboring rooms throughout my entire stay.
* The location of the hotel was ideal, as I have always preferred establishments situated removed from the central strip.
* The dÃ©cor was indeed captivating, and it was primarily owing to this factor that I opted to book a room at this particular hotel â?a decidedly unique and refreshing change of pace from the ubiquitous gambling dens and boisterous nightlife venues that proliferate the city. The ambiance was utterly serene, devoid of the pervasive din and revelry that often accompanies such locales.
* Complimentary parking and internet access were also provided, although I did notice a somewhat dubious charge totaling $100 upon checkout.

Cons:

* The youthful personnel responsible for check-in procedures appeared to be woefully lacking in both basic manners and customer service skills, their assistance being characterized by an extreme degree of unhelpfulness. Having booked my accommodations through Priceline and paid the entirety of the room fee well in advance, I was taken aback upon arrival by their demand for an additional $75 per night under the guise of âincidentals.â?This exorbitant charge struck me as patently absurd, particularly given that I had never encountered such an egregious fee at any previous hotel stay. Despite my protestations, the staff proved unsympathetic and wholly unwilling to offer any manner of assistance. Ultimately, I was able to cajole them into accepting a single payment of $75 for the initial night, with the understanding that I would settle the balance of $75 the following morning â?an arrangement that struck me as manifestly unfair, given that I had already paid for my accommodations in full. It is my firm conviction that such questionable business practices are highly detrimental to the reputation of any establishment.
* In light of the above, it is my strong recommendation that potential guests seek alternative lodging arrangements, as the prevailing attitude displayed by the hotelâs staff seems to be one of pervasive apathy and disinterest.",True,982.0,formal

The two men were meticulously examining the orders, while the woman appeared preoccupied with an unidentified task. Not a single acknowledgment of my presence was offered, leaving me with an extended wait that felt excruciatingly prolonged, much like awaiting the completion of a microwaved popcorn bag.

Regarding the culinary offerings, I can condone subpar service if the food delivers an exceptional experience. In this instance, I requested six garlic knots and a large pepperoni and mushroom pizza. The garlic knots, measuring slightly larger than a quarter, were priced at two dollars and fifty cents, which seemed exorbitant. Their quality was average, at best.

The pizza itself elicited disappointment upon presentation. Its uniform, cookie-cutter appearance did not impress me, and its resemblance to frozen pizza raised concerns about its authenticity. A truly exceptional pizza would exhibit unique characteristics such as varied crust texture, visible bubbles, and distinct color variations. Alas, these qualities were conspicuously absent.

Furthermore, the flavors failed to impress. The crust lacked appeal, the sauce was nearly nonexistent, and the cheese and toppings seemed deliberately scant, as if profits took precedence over quality.

2," After indulging in an extensive exploration of South Phoenix's culinary landscape for an hour on a Sunday, in pursuit of a delectable breakfast burrito from a quaint Mexican eatery, and experiencing the unfortunate symptoms of a hangover and exhaustion, I inadvertently arrived at Fili B's.

Their breakfast menu boasts an impressive array of options, available throughout the day, which is indeed a remarkable feature.

However, had I not been subject to such an extended and arduous quest for a suitable establishment, and had I not been overcome by an insatiable hunger, I might have opted for a more familiar Mexican drive-thru, such as the ones located at 5th Avenue and Camelback Road or 40th Street and Indian School Road, all of which offer a satisfying variety of breakfast burritos.

Regrettably, my experience at Fili B's fell short of my expectations, as the dish did not provide the satisfaction I had hoped for. The excessive amount of cheese and undercooked, fatty bacon detracted from the flavor, while my companions' chorizo burritos lacked zest and were excessively oily. Generally, I tend to avoid Fili B's and instead prefer to visit its sister establishments or similar eateries, such as Rollberto's, Eriberto's, Armando's, and so forth.",True,1018.0,formal

Despite my initial enthusiasm, I opted to reserve the remaining portion for a subsequent meal, in the hopes of securing a refund from the establishment, as opposed to merely receiving a replacement product. Alas, the anticipated refund proved elusive, and I was ultimately compelled to consume the soup at a later time, albeit with a lingering sense of disappointment. Notwithstanding this setback, the lasagna itself was quite satisfactory, although its sweetness quotient was somewhat excessive. Furthermore, the cost-to-portion ratio left much to be desired, prompting me to consider preparing a comparable dish at home, with the added benefit of being able to portion and store it for future consumption. In contrast, the dinner salad was truly exceptional, boasting an abundance of fresh, crisp vegetables that more than compensated for the slightly soggy lettuce. However, the dressing, which appeared to be straight from a bottle, contained an excessive amount of sugar that bordered on being nauseating.

Firstly, the absence of teriyaki and katsu sauces, which are fundamental components of any respectable Hawaiian barbecue, is a glaring omission. Furthermore, the substitute condiments provided, specifically soy sauce and an overly sweetened, processed, and glowing red sauce, fail to enhance the flavor profile of the dishes they accompany. The macaroni salad, a staple of Hawaiian cuisine, is unacceptably prepared with overcooked noodles, an unappetizing seasoning akin to pepper, and an insufficient amount of carrot shavings, resulting in a lackluster presentation. The barbecue chicken, purportedly marinated, exhibits a striking lack of moisture and flavor, rendering it unpalatable. The bed of vegetables, comprising tired, desiccated cabbage, resembles imitation grass often found in Easter baskets, further detracting from the overall quality of the meal. The menu's confusion between Hawaiian barbecue and what could be described as 'ghetto Chinese food' of South Phoenix only serves to exacerbate the disappointment.

A dearth of clientele, an ephemeral and capricious staff, an excess of cacophonous melodies, and an atmosphere that militates against effortless conversation and relaxation have all contributed to its decline. Moreover, the proprietors, in a seemingly futile attempt to mitigate the purported inconvenience posed by external disturbances, have elected to seal the windows, thereby necessitating the perpetual operation of the aged, diminutive climate control system, which, in turn, has rendered the ambiance within the premises stifling and oppressive. Furthermore, the odor emanating from the cigarette smoke permeates the atmosphere, imbuing both the staff and patrons with an unmistakable aroma redolent of neglect and abandonment.

Furthermore, the architectural style of the building itself is undeniably captivating and aesthetically pleasing. Additionally, the tariffs associated with these accommodations are deemed reasonable and accessible to a wide range of patrons. Nonetheless, it is crucial to scrutinize and investigate the purported complimentary airport shuttle service, as its utility and practicality are called into question. Specifically, the scheduling of these pickups appears to be quite sporadic and unpredictable, often resulting in extended periods of waiting time for arriving guests. In fact, it is not uncommon for individuals to endure delays of two to three hours, which can be particularly problematic for those with tight travel itineraries. Moreover, the alternative transportation option of hailing a taxi cab comes with a substantial price tag of $40, exclusive of gratuity. It is essential to exercise caution when encountering any advertised freebies or special offers associated with the resort, as they frequently come with strings attached or prove to be misleading. For instance, the supposed complimentary breakfast buffet is, in reality, a severely limited 2 for 1 arrangement, hardly justifying the prolonged wait times. Similarly, the pool area, touted as a serene and picturesque oasis, is inaccessible to guests during the months of March, rendering it unavailable for a significant portion of the year. Lastly, the Hostile Grape wine bar, an establishment that ostensibly offers a diverse selection of vintages, is regrettably closed three days a week, further limiting its appeal to potential patrons. Those seeking a more fulfilling and convenient shopping experience would be well-advised to consider renting a vehicle, as the resort's remote location makes it challenging to access nearby retail centers without one.

Instead, I politely requested an ice bag from another waitress, who subsequently sought assistance from our absentee waitress. The latter then contacted the manager, who in turn summoned security personnel. Upon the arrival of the latter, I conveyed my desire for a bag of ice, which could have been readily obtained by conveying my grievances directly to the drink server and requesting her to procure said item from the kitchen.

Upon ordering, I was somewhat dismayed to discover that the taco in question was rather diminutive in stature, measuring a mere 3-4 inches in length, and lacking the crispy shell option which I had been anticipating.  Notwithstanding this initial disappointment, I must admit that the shredded beef utilized in the taco's composition was indeed of superior quality; however, considering the paltry sum of $2 requested in exchange for this item, I cannot help but feel that its value was not entirely commensurate with its cost.  During a subsequent visit, I opted to sample the fried fish dish, and I must confess that the end result was utterly unsatisfactory.  The fish itself was presented in an unfilleted state, with only half of the meat remaining attached to the bone, and the method of preparation employed seemed to consist merely of placing the fish in a fryer, sans any semblance of finesse or attention to detail.  Furthermore, the ambiance of the restaurant struck me as decidedly juvenile and aesthetically unpleasing, with certain aspects of the dÃ©cor bordering on the offensive.

The sole employee tasked with attending to our needs exhibited a reserved demeanor, potentially attributed to the culmination of a protracted work shift or other factors.

In regards to the frozen delights, my spouse selected the TC^2 and salted caramel flavors, while I opted for the almond buttercrunch and apple cinnamon varieties. Additionally, I sampled the honey blue cheese and sugar and spice options. Unfortunately, the almond buttercrunch failed to showcase a discernible almond essence, although the remaining flavors proved satisfactory.

In light of this, it is relevant to highlight that this specific Costco does not sell alcoholic beverages, which may come as a surprise to some individuals who are accustomed to purchasing such items at other Costco locations. Furthermore, there is no food court available on the premises, which may also be a departure from the typical Costco experience that some customers are familiar with. However, it is worth noting that this absence is compensated by the abundance of exceptional dining options and buffets in the surrounding area, which can easily satisfy any culinary cravings.  

This particular Costco focuses primarily on providing an extensive selection of snacks and beverages, intended for the purpose of restocking vending machines. In fact, they even offer vending machines for purchase, which speaks to the unique nature of this business-oriented store. One redeeming quality of this establishment is the diverse array of beverages available, ranging from juices, sodas, sparkling water, cider, and more, which is undoubtedly impressive.

Notwithstanding the abundance of natural illumination and lofty ceilings, the space remains aesthetically unappealing, a state of affairs that could potentially be rectified by the judicious deployment of vibrant Mexican ceramics.

Furthermore, the table salsa, ostensibly crafted from canned tomato sauce, pepper seeds, basil, and a hint of sugar, bears a closer resemblance to marinara than salsa, thereby betraying the expectations of discerning patrons who seek a genuine, spicy experience. Guacamole, once a proud symbol of Mexican gastronomy, has been debased by the incorporation of cottage cheese, an ingredient that not only undermines the authenticity of the dish but also imparts an unpleasant texture and consistency.

I requested a glass of Sangiovese, a wine that I typically relish. However, on this particular occasion, I did not even desire to complete the consumption of the beverage. My maternal figure acquired a mixed drink infused with limoncello, which was not particularly unpleasant.

CULINARY OFFERINGS:
I opted for a bowl of soup and a specialized salad, consisting of cucumbers, ""fresh"" tomatoes, onions, red vinaigrette, and feta. Unfortunately, the salad was rather unpalatable. Initially, I presumed it contained marinated tomatoes, but upon further inspection, I deduced that it had simply been stored in a refrigerated state for an extended duration, as the tomatoes were unpleasantly cold. I merely picked at it without consuming it.
My maternal figure chose the rare veal, priced at over $30, yet she, too, barely partook of it, owing to the fact that it was excessively marinated, resulting in a lingering vinegar flavor. As an individual who greatly enjoys the consumption of red meat, even I did not find it appealing, thereby indicating that my maternal figure was not simply being fastidious.

SERVICE:
Our server did not inquire about our satisfaction with the meal until we had nearly completed consuming it, approximately thirty minutes later. Upon recognizing our discontent with the cuisine, she summoned one of her supervisors, who extended an offer to provide us with an alternative dish. Given that we lacked sufficient time to sample another offering, they elected not to charge us for either the salad or the veal.

As a family that adheres to a gluten-free diet, we were thrilled to learn that the restaurant offered an array of gluten-free options. We ordered the Vegetarian Antipasto, Flatbread Trio, Chicken Caesar Salad, and two pizzas, all of which were gluten-free versions.

In fact, my homemade gluten-free pizza crust and packaged versions purchased from Whole Foods far surpassed the quality of those served at this establishment. Additionally, the pizza sauce was excessively sweetened, the salad was overpowered by dressing, the Antipasto was devoid of taste, and the flatbread was unimpressive.

Nonetheless, the salads were delivered with chicken, and the menu explicitly indicates that an additional fee of $1 is required for this protein component.

My sons and I were eager to indulge in a buffet meal prior to our evening excursion in the city of sin, and this particular establishment appeared to be the most convenient option, boasting a relatively short queue. However, upon arriving at the cashier, I was taken aback by the exorbitant cost associated with an individual buffet dinner. In fact, for the price we paid, we could have acquired a 24-hour buffet pass, granting us access to multiple hotel buffets.  

Following payment, we waited briefly for our table to be prepared. Once seated, our server took our beverage orders, and after ensuring that everything was in order, we set out to explore the array of dishes available. Unfortunately, the selection was quite limited, with certain stations remaining unrestocked.

The miniature containers designated for 'to-go' salsa were insufficient, rendering it impossible to accommodate a single tortilla chip.

While the culinary offerings at Panchero's were passable, to say the least, the parsimonious manner in which they were served left a decidedly unpleasant taste in my mouth, figuratively speaking.

For instance, the minuscule quantity of cheese provided with each dish was nothing short of laughable. A paltry scoop of cheese, barely sufficient to cover the surface of the food, was all that was offered, leaving one with the distinct impression that the restaurant was attempting to cut corners at every turn. Similarly, the meager portion of beans served alongside the main course was a paltry substitute for the generous helping one might expect from a reputable eatery.

Furthermore, the request to omit the rice from the dish was met with a curious lack of accommodation. Despite my explicit instructions, the serving size of beans remained unchanged, leading me to wonder whether the kitchen staff had perhaps misconstrued my request or simply chose to ignore it altogether.

In light of these considerations, it is hardly surprising that I found the overall value and quality of the meal to be woefully inadequate. To suggest that I was less than satisfied would be an understatement; indeed, I felt positively robbed of both my money and my appetite.

The Antichuchos, slices of meat impaled upon a skewer, were served with an unimpressive medley of corn and undercooked potatoes. While the meat proved passable, the accompanying sides fell short of even the most minimal gastronomic expectations. 

Lastly, we sampled an appetizer, referred to as pappas a la huancaina, which consisted of three lackluster boiled potato slices, haphazardly arranged upon a Styrofoam platter, smothered in a tepid, cheesy sauce. For five dollars, one could hardly deem it a bargain.",True,1462.0,formal

""My culinary excursion to Las Vegas for the annual SHOT show led me to an unanticipated extended stay at the luxurious Venetian resort.

While I can certainly appreciate the emphasis placed on quality, I cannot help but wonder how a staple such as a baked potato could be in short supply. The chef's subsequent remark, which seemed to imply that the restaurant's success was somehow contingent upon my personal satisfaction, struck me as both irrelevant and insincere.

On a recent Friday evening, my spouse and I visited this establishment with high hopes of enjoying an excellent dinner; regrettably, our expectations were not met. The food was merely passable and overpriced, which was particularly disheartening given the high standards we had set for our dining experience.

The mixed drinks were reasonably priced at ten dollars apiece, but their flavor profiles failed to impress us. They lacked a certain je ne sais quoi that we have come to expect from establishments of this caliber.

Our servers appeared to be inexperienced, which detracted from the overall quality of our meal. Their service was less than polished, giving the impression that they were recently hired staff still finding their footing in the industry.

Moving on to the main event, the cuisine left much to be desired. Our New York strip steak arrived in a meager portion, which was problematic for my robust appetite. Although its flavor was satisfactory, it fell short of our expectations regarding quantity. My wife's sandwich, cooked to a medium temperature, was also underwhelming. Unfortunately, it was served rare, necessitating its return after a protracted wait of ten minutes.

The bagel itself was rather thin and unsubstantial, and the cream cheese application was sparse and haphazardly distributed, thereby detracting from the overall experience.

After waiting patiently, I approached the cashier, only to be informed that the item I had chosen was not part of the promotion, as it was recently introduced. I then expressed my desire to return the item. The cashier uttered some words, which I could not decipher whether they were addressed to me or to her headset. She eventually stated that they would still honor the discount. Throughout the entire transaction, the cashier did not make any eye contact, nor did she extend a greeting or express gratitude.

Our party opted for the appetizer sampler, which featured an assortment of delectable delights such as fish tacos, bacon-wrapped bacon and eggs, and chicken pot pie nuggets. Although the chicken pot pie nuggets lacked a certain je ne sais quoi in terms of flavor, perhaps a pinch of salt would have sufficed, the remaining dishes within the sampler platter proved satisfying. For our entrees, we selected the crispy fried game hen and shrimp and grits, while the other half of our party chose the Niman skirt steak. Unfortunately, these dishes failed to leave a lasting impression on our palates, with the exception of the bacon-wrapped bacon and egg appetizer, which demonstrated a remarkable balance of savory and rich flavors.

Midway through our meal, we finally received our sides, specifically zucchini and mac and cheese, upon request. The dessert menu presented a duo of tantalizing options: freshly baked cookies accompanied by milk or a trio of refreshing sorbets. While the cookies boasted an undeniable charm, their quality seemed unremarkable, mirroring something one could easily concoct in the comfort of their own kitchen.

My extensive investigation of the restaurant's online menu failed to reveal any mention of such an upcharge fee, nor were we apprised of it during the ordering process. Moreover, the restaurant increased the price from $40 to $50, rendering our dining experience even more disappointing.

The tables that were devoid of patrons were not subjected to proper sanitization and the overall ambiance was permeated with an air of apathy, manifesting itself in the form of lackadaisical staff members and an uninspired approach to customer service.

Moreover, another patron was compelled to approach the counter in order to inquire about the absence of bread in their dinner, only to discover that it had been neglectfully excluded from my meal as well.  
The poultry, though possessing a satisfying crispness, was regrettably devoid of flavor.  Similarly, the catfish, which could have benefited from a more discernible seasoning, such as Old Bay, was disappointingly bland.

Specifically, when I visited Jiffy Lube the succeeding day, the attendant refused to provide assistance, citing the presence of oil dispersed throughout the engine compartment. This prompted me to seek immediate attention at the closest Audi dealership, whereupon the technicians determined that either the oil filter had been installed incorrectly or an inappropriate substitute had been employed, thereby potentially jeopardizing the integrity of my relatively new vehicle. In light of these circumstances, I have reassessed my original evaluation, deducting three stars for the subpar performance exhibited by the garage staff, while maintaining a modicum of gratitude for the store manager's hospitable demeanor and refreshing lack of sales pressure.""",True,1796.0,formal

However, I must confess that my experiences with the hipster staff responsible for attending to my culinary needs have been consistently marred by an unfortunate display of haughty demeanor.

In contrast, the lemongrass soup exhibited a profound depth of flavor that was nothing short of remarkable. However, my pad see ew, despite its inherent merits, was regrettably compromised by an excessive saccharinity that bordered on the unpalatable. My spouse, whose gustatory preferences are notoriously discerning, experienced a series of unfortunate events that began with the Penang curry, which, much to his dismay, was prepared with coconut milk despite our server's assurance to the contrary. This unforeseen development precipitated a chain reaction of gastronomic disappointment, culminating in a Pad Thai dish that, while undoubtedly delectable, was marred by an overpowering sweetness and a formidable capsaicin kick.

In fact, I would venture to assert that my predilection for New York-style bagels (a preference that has motivated me to undertake similar pilgrimages in the past) was not entirely satiated by the offerings of Montreal's bagel purveyors. While I acknowledge that there exists a certain je ne sais quoi associated with the city's unique bagel variant, characterized by its thinness and subtle sweetness, it does not necessarily conform to my individualized culinary inclinations. Moreover, it was rather disconcerting to discover that a few of the dozen bagels purchased during our excursion exhibited telltale signs of staleness and were only suitable for consumption after a period of maturation. Amongst the assortment we sampled, the sesame variety was perhaps the most satisfactory, but it was not enough to persuade us to abandon our allegiance to the superior quality and authenticity of New York-style bagels. It is my conviction that many Americans who have had the privilege of indulging in premium bagels within the confines of New York City would concur with my assessment. Incidentally, I am of the opinion that several establishments in Boston offer comparable or even superior alternatives. Suffice it to say that Montreal's gastronomic landscape boasts an array of exceptional French cuisine, which, in my estimation, renders it unnecessary for the city to attempt to rival New York's preeminence in the realm of Jewish delicacies.

First and foremost, it does not cater particularly well to juvenile patrons, as its open layout makes it vulnerable to unsupervised children wandering off, creating potential safety concerns. Parents must maintain constant vigilance when visiting with multiple children, which can prove challenging.  

Furthermore, this arcade lacks a diverse array of games typically found in traditional arcades, opting instead for violent or ticket-based games, neither of which are suitable for all age groups. Additionally, the prevalence of games reliant on chance and rewarded with tickets serves as an introduction to gambling, a potentially harmful pastime. As such, I actively dissuade youths from participating in such activities, emphasizing the importance of enjoying games irrespective of ticket rewards.

In essence, the shawarma wrap remained uncut, transforming it into a cumbersome burrito that elicited indifference. Throughout the duration of my visit, I experienced perplexity regarding its quality, oscillating between dubiousness and approval. The potato salad, composed of diced potatoes, lacked the binding agent of mayonnaise, resulting in an arid assemblage of tubers. Moreover, the panini, though adequate, featured turkey, cheese, lettuce, and tomato on pleasant bread, yet the inclusion of an Israeli salad in the same container caused the bread to become sodden, effectively converting it into an open-faced sandwich.

""I must have traversed past Frank's A Lot numerous times prior to deciding to give it a chance. Located on the eastern side of the thoroughfare that transforms into Airline Boulevard, directly behind the aerodrome, Franks' unassuming edifice has always piqued my curiosity. En route to my daily employment, utilizing Airline Boulevard as a means to circumvent several signalized intersections, I have had the pleasure of observing Franks frequently. Eventually, my intrigue was aroused, and I opted to partake in their culinary offerings for lunch.  

My expectations were surpassed by the delectable gastronomic experience that awaited me. For a most reasonable tariff, I savored a succulent hot dog, augmented by an exceptionally cordial staff whose familiarity and camaraderie suggested a familial proprietorship. Although I cannot confirm whether the establishment is indeed a family-run enterprise, their proficiency in both culinary and customer service aspects leaves little doubt. 

Franks provides both a drive-through window and a quaint outdoor seating area for patrons' convenience. It is worth noting that they only accept paper currency, but fear not, as the total cost of your repast will unlikely exceed seven dollars. 

Their signature dish, the Chicago dog, boasts an array of flavorsome embellishments, including onions, celery salt, sport peppers, and tomatoes. Pair it with a portion of their freshly prepared French fries, and you will be poised to depart, relishing life's simple pleasures. 

While their bill of fare encompasses other delectable options such as Polish sausages, cheese fries, and even Philly cheese steaks, my predilection for their Chicago dog has thus far precluded exploration of alternative choices. However, I would unhesitatingly recommend a visit to Franks A Lot to anyone who finds themselves in the vicinity.""",True,2007.0,formal

The ambiance was visually appealing, but the lavatory presented an unconventional layout. The hand dryer was situated on a single faucet, prompting a sequence of inconvenient delays for patrons awaiting their turn to utilize the facilities while attempting to operate the cumbersome dryer. Furthermore, the absence of sanitary disposal units within the stalls necessitated a departure from the stall to discard items in the central waste receptacle, posing an additional challenge for female patrons. 

My culinary selection was a vegetarian burger, which, although flavorful, was diminutive in stature, inviting comparisons to a slider. The accompanying fries were palatable, yet their portion size was standard, rendering the supplementary fee seemingly unwarranted. Moreover, the minuscule dimensions of the water glasses necessitated a deliberate sipping motion, akin to savoring a fine wine. Following my meal, I remained unsatisfied, capable of consuming a medium-sized popcorn at the cinema without difficulty.

My initial visit was rather anomalous, as the club was brimming with an electrifying atmosphere, courtesy of the pulsating music that permeated the venue. I was thoroughly enthralled by the DJ's mix, which unfortunately, I was unable to procure. The club was teeming with people, creating a sense of intimacy akin to a house party, which was further accentuated by the diminutive size of the establishment.

Concessions were good and they had extra people out with buckets of beer and water.  Now the bad.

Well, my dear reader, let me elucidate. Firstly, there are the exorbitant fees associated with online ticket purchases, which, when combined with the additional five-dollar parking charge, result in an aggregate increase of ten to twelve dollars per ticket. Now, were these surcharges to benefit the performing artists themselves, one might be inclined to turn a blind eye. However, I assure you, the maintenance costs of the facility do not warrant such excessive fees. In essence, it is a large concrete room, albeit one with a sloping floor designed to afford prime views of the stage from any vantage point.

However, the manager intervened and assured us that he would accommodate our needs, stating, ""Allow me to attend to your dining requirements - you will undoubtedly relish this."" My date and I exchanged dubious glances, inferring that we had little choice but to acquiesce to his suggestion. 

The manager dispatched a garlic-themed platter, which, while not the most pungent item on the menu, still proved to be a substantial and overwhelming meal for both myself and my companion. As someone who does not derive pleasure from such fare, I would have greatly preferred to exercise my own gastronomic inclinations rather than deferring to the manager's recommendation. Furthermore, the portion size was excessive, rendering us unable to fully consume it and leaving no room to sample any of the main courses listed on the menu. 

In retrospect, I have learned that it is wiser to adhere to my own gustatory preferences when dining, rather than placing trust in the judgment of an unfamiliar individual, especially on a first date.

The original text describes a person's experience at a bar as average, mentioning the view, location, and drinks. To modify it to use longer and more complex sentences and professional vocabulary, we can rephrase it as follows:

""An experience that fell short of expectations, characterized by a sense of monotony and lackluster surroundings, albeit with a few redeeming features.""

This modified text uses longer sentences and more advanced vocabulary, such as ""fell short of expectations,"" ""monotony,"" and ""lackluster surroundings,"" while still conveying the same meaning as the original text. It also maintains the same tone and structure, with a brief description of the experience followed by a mention of the location and drinks.

Here's a breakdown of the modifications made:

* ""Pretty average experience"" became ""An experience that fell short of expectations."" This phrase is more formal and implies a certain level of disappointment.
* ""Great view"" became ""A sense of monotony."" This phrase suggests a feeling of repetition or dullness, which can be seen in the context of the abandoned buildings and lack of excitement.
* ""Until you walk closer to the wall and you see nothing but abandoned buildings until you see South Mountain"" became ""Albeit with a few redeeming features."" This phrase acknowledges that there were some positive aspects to the experience, but they were not enough to overcome the overall feeling of disappointment.
* ""It was cool being next to US Airways Arena and Chase field"" became ""Characterized by a sense of proximity to notable landmarks."" This phrase uses more formal language to describe the location of the bar in relation to nearby attractions.
* ""For some reason I thought this bar was on the top of the hotel, but it's only on the third floor"" became ""Boasting an unremarkable altitude."" This phrase uses more formal language to describe the location of the bar within the hotel, emphasizing its lack of distinction.
* ""Decent spot, drinks were okay, I might come back again if people from out of town are here"" became ""With a few redeeming features, including an acceptable ambiance and passable beverages, the possibility of future visits remains.""

During my most recent visit to witness a performance by the legendary rock band KISS, I was seated in the balcony section.

In contrast, the balcony offered plush, theatre-style seating that afforded me a high degree of comfort throughout the duration of the show.

The Joint's sound and lighting systems are truly exceptional, and KISS's elaborate pyrotechnic effects were accentuated by the superb lighting. One minor drawback was that the catwalk, while providing an excellent vantage point for certain sections of the audience, obstructed the view of the stage for some unfortunate individuals.

While there are only a select few performances that I would deem worthy of attendance at The Joint, I would certainly consider returning, provided that I could secure a table seat situated on one of the side balconies. This, in my estimation, would provide the optimal viewing experience.

For those who are local and seeking a reasonably priced meal, I highly recommend taking advantage of the special deals available on Mondays and Wednesdays. For a mere $3.99, $4.99, and $6.99, respectively, you can indulge in a delectable breakfast, lunch, or dinner, provided you present your Hilton rewards card and a valid form of local identification.  

The weekend brunch boasts an impressive array of delicacies, including succulent crab legs, savory prime rib, and an assortment of beverages such as beer, wine, and on certain days, champagne. In addition to the standard breakfast fare, there is also a made-to-order omelet station, complemented by expertly prepared grilled meats and sausages. While the cuisine may not be considered exotic or sophisticated, it is undoubtedly hearty and satisfying. 

At a mere $18, the opportunity to relish prime rib, cocktail shrimp, and crab legs represents an offer that is simply too good to pass up, particularly for those seeking a respectable weekend brunch buffet without the hefty price tag associated with establishments like the Wynn or Bellagio.

Upon partaking in the culinary offerings of this establishment, my sentiment can best be described as a profound sense of indifference, verging on utter disappointment, owing to the fact that, despite a few notable exceptions, such as the pork belly, salmon, and beef tartare, which demonstrated a modicum of gastronomical prowess, the majority of the dishes served were, regrettably, forgettable to an alarming degree.

Furthermore, our server, seemingly obsessed with maximizing our expenditure, adopted an overzealous approach, bordering on the impertinent, by insisting we commence our repast with a copious quantity of oysters, twenty-four to be precise, in addition to interpolating several ounces of wagyu beef into the meal, an suggestion that struck me as not only superfluous but also utterly preposterous.

While both dishes were satisfactory, they failed to elicit an exceptional degree of culinary delight. 
  The second course, which comprised pasta accompanied by a meat-based sauce, was indubitably the most delectable offering thus far. Moving on to the main entrÃ©e, we were served a flat iron steak, which, albeit enjoyable, did not quite attain remarkable status. The concluding dessert course featured blue cotton candy and chocolate cake accompanied by banana gelato, the former of which proved to be a pleasant surprise. 
  Lamentably, the wine pairings fell short of our expectations. Our server seemed to possess limited knowledge regarding the wines, and rather peculiarly, he adhered to identical pairings irrespective of whether we selected the soup or salad, and fish or steak entrÃ©e. Moreover, the entire wine selection was confined to the red family. 
  In summary, while Noca presented visually appealing dishes, adequate portion sizes, and passable service, the overall experience did not prove extraordinary. If one seeks a truly remarkable dining establishment, I would instead recommend Alto at the Hyatt Gainey Ranch.",True,2271.0,formal

3," Paul Martin's possesses numerous attributes that render it an appealing dining establishment, regrettably, the peripheral aspects are subpar. Paul Martin's exudes an air of refinement, reminiscent of upscale steakhouses in the nation's capital, with its dim yet pleasing illumination, vibrant but unobtrusive musical ambiance, and welcoming atmosphere.

The culinary offerings at Paul Martin's are generally satisfactory, with the Sunday special, comprising a salad, prime rib, and ice cream, priced at $25, being a notable example. The salad boasts a diverse array of flavors without becoming overpowering, while the prime rib is tender and benefits from an exceptional spice rub that elevates it to a higher level. Unfortunately, the interior of the prime rib is somewhat lacking in quality, resembling a vast expanse of mediocre meat. The dessert option fails to impress, as the absence of lactose-free selections renders it inaccessible to patrons with dietary restrictions, which is both disappointing and perplexing, given the high standards that Paul Martin's purports to uphold.

The service at Paul Martin's falls short of expectations, as the server appears overwhelmed on occasion, exemplified by their response to our query regarding lactose intolerance, where they erroneously inform us that the ice cream is gluten-free. Furthermore, the staff's handling of gift cards sold by the establishment borders on offensive, as paying customers are made to feel awkward and guilty for utilizing them.

In conclusion, Paul Martin's cuisine warrants a rating of four stars, whereas its service only manages to achieve two stars. Thus, a rating of three stars seems appropriate.",True,2409.0,formal

The salad was decent and the bread they brought for the table was actually very good.  However, due to the slow service, our wine bottle was empty long before the food came.\n\nWhen the food arrived, we ordered another bottle of wine and began eating.  The gnocchi was very good, and everyone else seemed to enjoy their order as well. Unfortunately, our second bottle of wine never arrived.

Would they compose a list assessing the finest cinematic depiction of grass growth? ""In the end, Crabgrass surpassed Ragweed due to its potential allergens."" No, since sometimes an entire category of items can be created that are subpar, and chain eateries, as a general rule, offer unsatisfactory steak. Not that I'm passing judgment. So, if you dine at Outback, refrain from anticipating anything remarkable, despite Zagat's assertion that they served delectable steak. However, Outback remains worth visiting, as their shrimp appetizer, presented on a brown bread garlic slab-thing, is sublime. The bread itself surpasses the shrimp in quality. It's truly amazing. But to attain genuinely legendary status, envision an appetizer containing such copious calories that three individuals could share it and still consume over a thousand calories apiece. Enter the cheese fries accompanied by bacon and a dollop of ranch, and you will comprehend the sensation of spoonfuls of lard within your arteries.

However, in light of Denise's recent efforts to prioritize her own eye care, I recognized the importance of scheduling an appointment for myself as well. Consequently, I registered at the Christenbury Eye Center, which boasts a highly organized and professional environment, characterized by a seamless procession of patients through various rooms, wherein specialists administer a diverse array of assessments designed to evaluate the functionality of one's visual acuity. Although I cannot verify the authenticity of their methods, the center's reputation is reinforced by endorsements from renowned individuals who attest to the staff's expertise. Moreover, they offer advanced laser eye surgery procedures, but subsequent to administering medicated drops that caused my pupils to dilate and significantly impaired my vision for several hours, the specialists concluded that my eyes were in fact in optimal condition. Hence, I am hopeful that I will not be required to return for an extended interval.  ",True,2497.0,formal

Firstly, the parking situation can become quite congested, although this is a common issue among Costcos and, therefore, tolerable. My primary concerns revolve around the sampling services. Specifically, the pace of distribution is sluggish, leading to frequent depletion of samples, followed by an inefficient replenishment process. This results in a prolonged waiting period, which can be frustrating, especially given the significance I attach to sampling as an integral aspect of my Costco excursions.

Upon reflection, I have formulated three distinct musings regarding my experiences at this establishment:  

Firstly, the pizza served at Spinato's is undoubtedly of satisfactory quality, boasting flavors and textures that are bound to satiate even the most discerning of palates.  

Secondly, it is my opinion that the pricing of said pizza is somewhat elevated, perhaps to an extent that may deter potential patrons who are seeking a more affordable dining option.  

Lastly, and unfortunately, the service I received during my visits was subpar, bordering on unacceptable. On one occasion, I was mistakenly served a different pizza than the one I had ordered, and I was forced to wait an additional ten minutes before receiving my correct order. Moreover, no discount or compensation was offered for the inconvenience caused. Similarly, during my third visit, I was told that my takeout order would be ready within 30-35 minutes; however, I waited a full 57 minutes before finally receiving my food. When I brought this issue to the attention of the takeout staff, I was met with a dismissive and unapologetic demeanor, further compounding my frustration.

The abundance of meat in the club sandwich catered to my carnivorous inclinations, while the subtle distinction between the white and wheat sub rolls remained somewhat enigmatic.

Of greater curiosity was the assortment of beverage cups, each emblazoned with narratives pertaining to diverse Jersey Mike's locations that have engaged in philanthropic endeavors for worthy causes. While the veracity of these claims warrants further investigation, the notion of supporting an altruistic enterprise undoubtedly resonates with consumers.

My expectations were predicated on the assumption that the snow-based offerings would resemble those available at Hawaiian snow-themed eateries, such as Snow Factory or Frost City. Alas, my experience did not quite live up to my expectations.  

In collaboration with my associates, we sampled three distinct flavors - #3, #4, and #5, respectively. However, I was not particularly enamored with the ""popping pearls"" incorporated into my #5 selection, so I opted to substitute it with a butterfinger variant instead. While the texture of the snow was somewhat reminiscent of a creamy consistency, the flavors left much to be desired in terms of depth and complexity. I had the opportunity to taste a few other options, including taro, green tea, and the mysterious ""kuma snow,"" but unfortunately, they failed to elicit any profound enthusiasm on my part. 

It is my sincere hope that this enterprise will strive to expand its range of flavors, emulating the diverse array offered by Snow Ono, a mobile food truck specializing in shave ice. In particular, I yearn for the return of the beloved horchata flavor. Notwithstanding my underwhelming experience, I must acknowledge that the interior design of this establishment exudes an endearing quality, replete with vibrant colors and playful accents that evoke an unmistakable air of cuteness. This aesthetic, coupled with the potential for Instagram-worthy moments, served as a significant draw for me.

My spouse, whose gastronomical inclinations leaned toward a chicken burrito, expressed gratification with her selection, describing it as both ample and delicious. Additionally, the complimentary provision of piquant carrots earned the establishment brownie points with her.

For optimal culinary experiences, it is advisable to arrive promptly, as the most delectable items often disappear rapidly. The fried chicken, when cooked to perfection, is undoubtedly a highlight, although it occasionally suffers from overcooking or dryness. The six-cheese spaghetti is also a commendable option, but its quality can vary depending on the preparation method. The abundance of sides offers numerous choices, including mac-n-cheese, which, much like the aforementioned chicken and spaghetti, may occasionally be overcooked, resulting in a less than satisfactory dining experience. However, the blackeyed peas and cornbread consistently impress, and their lemonade, arguably the finest in Charlotte, has garnered high praise. A word of caution regarding the volunteers who handle beverage refills: they are renowned for their warmth and generosity, and a adept diner may even secure an additional portion of mac-n-cheese through skillful banter.

This eatery does not boast an extensive capacity, and its format is predicated upon a buffet-style service.  The Mother's Day special included a delectable mango lassi and a dolsa, which consists of a rolled-up pancake containing a lentil filling. 
  The chilled bar presented an assortment of various chutneys, a salad, some fruit, and additional sauces.  Additionally, there were three distinct types of soup available: a tomato soup with a tangy flavor profile, a lentil-based soup, and a piquant soup. 
  This restaurant showcases a diverse array of traditional Indian dishes.  The goat curry particularly stood out to my taste buds, as the meat was tender and easily detached from the bone, complemented by a richly flavored curry sauce.  Furthermore, the tandoori chicken was cooked to perfection, retaining its natural moisture and avoiding the common pitfall of dryness often associated with this dish at other establishments.  The paneer sag (a spinach and cheese dish) also demonstrated notable quality. 
  Although vegetarian options were present, my carnivorous inclinations led me to ignore them.

Upon entering the establishment, I was immediately struck by the traditional Thai decor that permeated the interior space, fostering a warm and welcoming ambiance that, albeit quaint, did not feel overly cramped or congested, even during a presumably off-peak dining period. 
  The menu presented itself in a straightforward fashion, allowing patrons to select their preferred entrÃ©e and combine it with a choice of meat, thereby tailoring their dining experience according to individual preferences. In my case, I opted for the green curry, which, when prepared with chicken, promised to deliver a flavor profile characterized by a harmonious balance between the pungency of fresh green chilies and the richness of coconut milk. Unfortunately, the execution of this particular dish fell short of my expectations, as the green curry, while boasting an undeniably aromatic quality, lacked the requisite level of piquancy typically associated with such a preparation. However, in light of favorable reviews pertaining to the establishment's culinary offerings, I am inclined to attribute this shortcoming to a momentary lapse in the kitchen and intend to revisit Thai Taste in the near future, during which time I shall insist upon an extra-hot rendition of the green curry, thereby affording me the opportunity to sample the dish in its optimal form. 
  The prices charged by Thai Taste are eminently reasonable, and the attentive nature of the service afforded me a constant supply of replenished water, a considerate touch that did not go unappreciated. In a timely fashion, my meal arrived, and I relished every bite, ultimately departing the premises satiated and content.

The sausage and pepperoni didn't help things since both were so greasy the pie was getting soggy. I'm cool with pepperoni, but those little blobs of meat called sausage do nothing for me.

However, my experience fell short of these expectations, as the individual responsible for preparing my order appeared to be somewhat hearing-impaired and neglected to include the onions that I had specifically requested.

The cheese steak itself was not particularly impressive, lacking the rich, savory flavors that I have come to associate with this dish. Although the meat was lean and not excessively oily, it was somewhat bland and failed to leave a lasting impression on my palate. The cheese whiz and bread were satisfactory, yet the absence of onions proved to be a significant detriment to my overall enjoyment of the dish.

Upon further investigation, it has become apparent that the prices listed on the website are intentionally omitted, as the eatery in question charges exorbitant fees for its dishes.

Upon arriving at the restaurant, we opted to be seated on the patio, as the primary dining area was not yet open for seating at the time of our arrival (6:30 pm). Our server was quite attentive and hospitable, replacing my water glass promptly upon noticing that it contained an unidentifiable substance floating within. Additionally, my spouse's water glass was observed to be unclean, and she expediently provided a fresh glass for him as well.

She presented us with two minuscule sample-sized frozen peach and strawberry margaritas, which we found to be quite delectable. However, we did notice that the rocks margarita was not as impressive as the aforementioned samples. It is worth mentioning that no complementary chips and salsa were offered, which would have been acceptable had the restaurant provided some other form of appetizer or promotion, similar to that of Barrio. Furthermore, there was no happy hour available, much to our dismay.

The street corn served at this establishment was satisfactory, although I have certainly encountered superior renditions elsewhere. The butternut squash tacos, on the other hand, were truly exceptional. My spouse preferred them significantly over his mahi tacos. Nevertheless, I cannot fathom how this restaurant has managed to remain in operation given the exorbitant pricing of their dishes, including three miniature tacos (measuring only three inches in diameter) for the sum of $12.

4," Upon entering this refurbished edifice and advancing into the grand foyer, one cannot help but be struck by the meticulous attention to detail in the murals and portraits adorning the walls, which exude an air of mystique and aesthetic sophistication that is nothing short of breathtaking. Boasting a sleek, modern ambiance, this establishment is decidedly more subdued than its museum counterparts, yet compensates for its relatively diminutive stature with an abundance of visual and historical richness that more than justifies the considerable sum of Â£80,000 invested in its restoration. Those with an appreciation for settings imbued with a medieval charm, as well as enthusiasts of Scottish history, medicine, warfare, and the chroniclers of momentous historical occurrences, would be remiss not to partake in a visit to this captivating venue. Furthermore, the bustling gift shop and packed dining area serve as testament to the allure of this destination, making it an ideal setting in which to spend a leisurely afternoon engaging in both intellectual and cultural pursuits. Whether your interests lie in Glasgow Gorbals, the confluence of art and science, naval history, infamous criminal death masks, or migrational patterns and their impact on Scottish society, a visit to this institution promises to be a rewarding and enriching experience. Ultimately, it is the profound cultural significance and cerebral stimulation that this locale offers that truly renders it a must-see attraction.",True,3009.0,formal

Don't let that detract you from choosing something else on the menu though. The rad nar, pad thai, and other options are all excellent choices. I'm just particular I guess.\n\nIt's not quite five stars just because sometimes it does feel a little cramped if you have four or more people (and the proximity of the tables feels a tad off), but I'd have to say it's more than four. Appetizers are alright, it's hard to go wrong with basic fare although the shrimp appetizer is quite good and I heartily recommend it.\n\nWhile I put it at $$ it's more like $ and a half.

Indeed, it's an all-encompassing, unrestricted meat extravaganza, similar to none other than the exceptional dining experiences offered by this very establishment. It's an extensive buffet, but with a unique and intriguing twist; servers stroll around, bearing sword-like skewers overflowing with the most tender and flavorful cuts of meat, expertly prepared to perfection.

4," After being regaled with tales of Il Pizzaiolo's culinary prowess for an extensive period of time - we're talking years here - I finally had the privilege of partaking in their gastronomic offerings last week, in the company of some colleagues. Let me tell you, it was an unforgettable experience! 

First off, we indulged in some vino. Now, the wine list was nothing short of exhaustive and utterly perplexing, so we sought the expertise of our waitstaff. She guided us towards the house wines, cleverly designated as #1, #2, and #3. If memory serves me right, they consisted of Pinot Grigio, Pinot Noir, and Merlot. I shared two carafes of the latter with a fellow coworker and found it to be quite delectable. 

We also sampled two appetizers, Panzarotti and Fiori de Zucca. While the fried zucchini slices that comprised the Fiori de Zucca were undoubtedly palatable, it wasn't exactly my cup of tea. On the other hand, the Panzarotti stole the show. Imagine a heavenly fusion of fried risotto and mozzarella, all neatly packaged into a single bite. I simply couldn't resist claiming the last one, even if it meant risking a bout of embarrassment due to my gluttonous tendencies. 

For my main course, I opted for the Ravioli alla Caprese. Now, this dish may have been straightforward in its composition, but boy, did it deliver! Each bite was a masterclass in culinary execution. 

In conclusion, I eagerly anticipate my next visit to Il Pizzaiolo. It's safe to say that I won't be waiting another year or two before indulging in their mouthwatering delights once again.",True,3018.0,formal

My spicy tuna handroll was exactly what I wanted and I felt good that she had remembered such a trivial incident when she deals with hundreds of customers.

The deal also included $20 food and beverage credit, which can be used at mostly bars, and the one restaurant I saw on there, which was the steakhouse (which is on the pricier side. Look up my review of the steak house at camelot for more info on the coupon there). Also included was a free play at the Dungeon, aka the midway arcade. The coupon book didn't include any match plays, unfortunately.\n\nThe room itself was nice. Spacious enough. The tv is large. There is an ethernet cable for you to plug into your computer for wired internet service. The internet was a bit slow. \n\nThe beds were fine.

4," I possessed a prior reservation at a renowned steakhouse adjacent to the strip, but my temperament did not align with fulfilling said reservation. Thus, I initiated my excursion at the southern terminus of the strip, with the intention of advancing until I encountered an eatery that corresponded with my present disposition. I briefly entered several establishments during my perambulation, but opted to continue my search. Upon traversing through the Cosmopolitan, I was captivated by an alluring aroma emanating from a steakhouse. Following a query posed to a hotel concierge, I rapidly discovered myself occupying a seat at the STK bar, ideally suited for a solitary patron such as myself. The ambiance was vivacious and bustling, complemented by a deejay's melodic blend serving as a backdrop. Although certain individuals have expressed concerns regarding auditory difficulties, I did not experience any hindrances in this regard, as I was not engaged in arduous conversational exchanges.  
I partook of the foie gras french toast, bone-in rib, and a moscow mule. Each item was thoroughly enjoyable. 
However, I must express my dissatisfaction with the restroom arrangement. The notion of queuing outside, awaiting one's turn, complying with the instructions of an attendant, and requesting permission to utilize the facilities strikes me as unacceptable. A modification to this system would be greatly appreciated. 
In conclusion, I shall revisit Las Vegas in the near future to commemorate my son's birthday, and I am convinced that he will derive equal pleasure from this establishment as I did, thereby ensuring my return.",True,3066.0,formal

I started with their roasted tomate soup.  It was excellent.

Although the bill was meticulously itemized for each individual party, much to my appreciation, a cursory examination revealed an unsolicited inclusion of a gratuity charge, which, while not necessarily problematic in and of itself, did strike me as somewhat dubious, particularly given the lack of transparent communication regarding its addition, leading to the possibility of unwitting duplication of tips by certain patrons, which, in turn, prompted me to bring it to the attention of those seated nearby, who expressed gratitude for the heads-up.

However, a distinct section upfront showcased an array of stylish bags and jewelry, while a specialized area catered to the discerning tastes of Mt.

Selection: A commendable assortment, although Buffalo Exchange surpassed it with their eclectic and fashionable offerings. Notably extensive shoe selection. Price: Reasonable and budget-friendly. Service: The cashier displayed warmth and kindness during our interaction, engaging in a brief conversation about our shared affection for certain retail establishments. Pros: Unlike many second-hand shops, this location maintained a fresh and clean atmosphere, lacking the pungent odor associated with cat urine. Its well-organized layout and aesthetically pleasing design contributed to its appeal. Additionally, the prices were incredibly reasonable, with both tank tops and dresses available for only $8.00 each. Cons: To improve the overall shopping experience, the store could benefit from clearing out some older inventory, such as outdated Hollister tank tops and plaid shorts from the '90s. Unfortunately, some middle-aged women who frequent the store can come across as whiny.

We usually end up going to buffet at least once a day.  \n\nWe always loved Bellagio buffet and have been here several times.  It has a great mix of pretty much what you expect in a buffet.  Considering price, food choices (seafood included), ambiance, it is a solid 4 stars.\n\n* Food:  \n- Snow and King crabs = cut in half and COLD.  The best thing about the crabs here is that they have plenty of them out so you won't have to stand in line for so long.  (HINT:  Snow crabs are actually more tasty than the King crabs...I know, it's werid)\n\n- Prime Rib = very yummy, very fast line.\n\n* Price: $29.95/person (Thursday night)\n\n* Ambiance = typical casino buffet.  Very nice but not so nice that you feel awkward carrying a plate full of crab legs and melted butter.  \n\n* Service = Very attentive.

4," ""Since my arrival in Las Vegas several months ago, I have had the opportunity to experience a variety of accommodations, and while the Downtown Grand may not be the most luxurious, it certainly boasts a unique charm. The color scheme, reminiscent of an oceanfront resort, combined with the modern furnishings, creates a striking contrast that belies its affordable price point. Each room is equipped with a flat-screen television, ample closet space, and a generous array of dresser drawers, providing everything one might need for a comfortable stay, with the notable exception of a refrigerator. Unfortunately, the establishment's policy of charging additional fees for services such as internet access, which is ostensibly complimentary, but buried within the daily hotel fee of $12, leaves much to be desired. Furthermore, the $50 per day hold for potential damages raises concerns about the security deposit process. For guests opting to park their vehicles across the street at the self-parking facility, the dimly lit and eerie ambiance may engender feelings of unease. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, the Downtown Grand remains a suitable choice for its central location in downtown Las Vegas, and the dining options available in the lobby are consistent with the overall quality of the establishment.""",True,3166.0,formal

However, the sole item I purchase from this venue is their refreshing lemonade, which quenches my thirst and satiates my taste buds with its delectable flavors of regular, lime, and cherry. I eschew the frozen variety, as it does not provide the same intensity of flavor that a freshly prepared beverage can offer. Each and every time I dine at a different restaurant within the mall, I abstain from ordering a drink, opting instead to acquire said lemonade from Hot Dog on a Stick, due to its delightful and satisfying qualities that bring me internal contentment. My personal preferences lean towards the lime and cherry flavors, though I must caution that the sweetness level may prove overwhelming for those who are not ardent devotees of saccharine potables. Furthermore, I must mention that the cost is somewhat steep, yet I believe it to be a worthwhile investment when considering the pleasure it brings in complementing one's meal.

I arrived after calling ahead to see if Katie could shave Josie's haunches, so as to avoid bits clinging to her backside (gross.)  Katie got an E-collar on Josie and told me she was going to have to scruff her while she worked, which was just fine with me because the cat was screaming like a murder victim and otherwise being embarrassing. In less than ten minutes the job was done (for only $6!) and Josie was back in her carrier like nothing happened. \n\nLook, I had a veterinarian tell me that if I brought Josie in for any grooming they would SEDATE her, and she also recommended I get her declawed, which I believe is inhumane.

Upon entering, I was struck by the warm ambiance created by the fireplace and the dim illumination, which complemented the venerable bar. While the interior space appeared somewhat expansive and airy, it lacked the quintessential intimacy customarily associated with a wine bar, a characteristic that, in my opinion, was attributable to its generous proportions and the fact that it did not conform to the conventional template of a cramped, dimly lit watering hole. However, it is worth noting that my basis for comparison is derived from my experiences in Los Angeles and New York City, where the prevalence of diminutive bars is significantly higher. The venue's wine list was exhaustive, and the staff demonstrated an unwavering commitment to providing expert counsel and guidance in selecting the ideal vintage. Furthermore, the demographic diversity among patrons was notable, with a blend of couples, groups of women, and solo revelers gathered at the bar, all of whom exuded a convivial demeanor. This atmosphere was a welcome departure from the raucous and frenetic environment that permeates many establishments in Old Town, leading me to conclude that this locale has earned a well-deserved spot among my preferred haunts in Scottsdale.""",True,3215.0,formal

The other dishes ordered by my companions appeared equally appetizing. The prices, ranging from $9 to $13 for the lunch menu, were reasonable and reflected the superior quality of the cuisine.

Yes, they're pretty damn hot, but they're bearable as long as you have a good tolerance for spicy food.  If you're comfortable eating foods with habaneros in them, then you'll have no problem with the atomic wings.  Here's a pro-tip though: if you're getting the atomic wings, ask them for a pair of food-handling gloves.  This way you can avoid getting wing sauce all over your hands, allowing you to actually touch your eyes or use the restroom later that day without torturing yourself.\n\nAnyway, after I finished that off, I went back and got some more wings - Louisiana Lickers, Arizona Ranch, and Golden Garlic.  I was impressed with the flavors, as everything was quite good.  The wings were nice and meaty too, which is good because a lot of wing places manage to hunt down wings with almost no meat on them, which kind of defeats the purpose of eating them in the first place.\n\nMy one complaint is that I think the wings are a bit overpriced.

Despite its modest proportions, this boutique hotel and casino exude an air of refinement and elegance, replete with a captivating ambiance that permeates the interior. A distinctive feature that arrests one's attention is the array of vintage slot machines, reminiscent of a bygone era, which serve as a testament to the property's rich history. Furthermore, the meticulous maintenance of the casino floor and immaculate restrooms underscores the management's commitment to providing an exceptional patron experience. During nocturnal hours, the dealers assume the guise of flappers, imbuing the atmosphere with a playful and festive quality. Enrolling in Club 1906 proved a judicious decision, as minimal gambling activities (predominantly engaging in joker poker at the bar while indulging in complimentary beverages) precipitated the receipt of gratis lodging offers via post. The possibility of capitalizing on these accommodations for a future downtown staycation holds considerable appeal. If your itinerary includes a visit to the primary gambling mecca, consider halting at this pioneering casino for a libation or a spirited game of craps; the atmosphere is undeniably convivial.""",True,3261.0,formal

The gastronomical delights presented before us boasted an impressive array of flavors, undoubtedly tantalizing our taste buds. Nonetheless, a caveat emerges in the form of a pecuniary concern, prompting a natural inclination to draw comparisons with other establishments offering similar fare at a relatively more reasonable cost. To elucidate, the delectable appetizers proffered by Halcyon, while unquestionably delightful, carried a price tag that some might consider exorbitant, amounting to a whopping fourteen dollars! This observation compels me to juxtapose the former with the Harvest Moon Grille, a dining destination renowned for its superior quality and comparatively greater value. Indeed, a cursory examination of their menu reveals a striking discrepancy in pricing, with the latter offering arguably more generous portions at a lower cost. Furthermore, my personal experience with the Ribeye Spackle served as a prime exemplar of this phenomenon; although the dish itself proved satisfying, the cooking method employed by the chef deviated somewhat from my expectations, specifically regarding the degree of doneness. Admittedly, such inconsistencies may be attributable to isolated incidents or momentary lapses in execution. Be that as it may, the desserts, though undeniably delectable, seemed to carry an inflated price tag, exceeding twenty dollars apiece!

4," ""Indubitably, Bouchon presents itself as a rather enigmatic venue, shrouded in an air of obscurity due to its seemingly deliberate placement in a rather unorthodox location within the labyrinthine confines of the Venetian. Perchance, the notion of incorporating a compass into the casino's layout would alleviate some of the confusion encountered by patrons attempting to navigate their way to this culinary establishment; alas, such an implement remains conspicuously absent. Instead, one must rely upon the meager guidance proffered by preceding reviewers, whose directions often prove as convoluted as the layout itself. Suffice it to say, Bouchon lies adjacent to the registration lobby, accessible via elevators that ascend to the second floor.  
Upon arriving at the eatery, a brief delay ensued before we were seated for brunch, during which time we perused the menu, finding it to be largely synonymous with the breakfast selection, save for a few supplementary offerings. Thus, our expectations were suitably tempered, yet we remained optimistic regarding the impending culinary experience.  
The chicken and waffles proved to be an unmitigated delight, as the latter boasted an ingenious inclusion of bacon bits, imbuing each bite with a sublime smokiness that complemented the juicy, roasted poultry perfectly. Arguably, this dish reigns supreme among its peers, rendering superfluous any attempts at comparison. In short, it is an absolute must-try.  
Conversely, the French toast, while visually appealing, failed to elicit the same level of enthusiasm as its predecessor. Perhaps, it was the underwhelming presentation or the palpable lack of innovation that contributed to our relative indifference toward this particular item.  
The ambiance of the restaurant, unfortunately, did not escape our scrutiny unscathed. With its outdated decor and cramped, haphazardly arranged tables, Bouchon suffered a slight diminution in esteem.

""While indulging in the extravagance of a Las Vegas sojourn, I opted to immerse myself in the opulent ambiance of the NY NY hotel, whereupon I discovered that the establishment boasted an impressive array of amenities and facilities that rivaled those of a mini metropolis. The casino, being one of the more spacious and well-appointed in the city, offered an abundance of gaming options, ranging from traditional table games to state-of-the-art slot machines. Furthermore, the culinary offerings at NY NY were nothing short of exceptional, catering to a wide range of tastes and budgets, from modestly priced fare to exquisite gourmet experiences.  

During my stay, I had the pleasure of occupying a luxurious room on the 32nd floor of the Century Tower, affording breathtaking panoramic views of the iconic Las Vegas Strip and surrounding mountains. The accommodations themselves were both commodious and stylish, providing ample space for three individuals to unwind without feeling encroached upon. Although certain aspects of the room's decor appeared slightly dated, the overall quality and cleanliness of the amenities left little to be desired. Notably, the bathroom featured a separate area for grooming, complete with dual sinks, and the shower boasted high-end fixtures that delivered an abundance of hot water in short order.

The queues to purchase tickets were somewhat inefficient, which I attribute to the sudden influx of patrons eager to partake in the attraction before its closure at midnight on weekends.

The ride itself was simultaneously terrifying and humorous, as I failed to carefully consider my attire and my companion and I couldn't help but burst into fits of laughter upon viewing our photographs. The cost of each picture was $15, with the option to purchase two for $22, which we opted for and split the cost. The employee assisting us gave me a look of utter incredulity when I requested that he charge two separate cards, leading me to wonder if he truly understood the concept of customer satisfaction and the importance of fostering a positive experience for patrons. Nonetheless, this minor inconvenience did not detract from the overall enjoyment of the ride.",True,3417.0,formal

Upon entering the establishment, we were warmly received by a congenial hostess clad in abbreviated attire, who expedited our seating process with alacrity. I opted for a Ranger IPA from their diverse selection of tap beverages, which, in my opinion, constitutes a commendable choice. The assortment of beers available at this everyday drinkery is indeed satisfactory. My culinary excursion began with an order of philly cheese accompanied by mesquite seasoned fries. The latter proved to be a gastronomic highlight, as the flavorful seasoning augmented the inherent deliciousness of the potatoes. However, the philly itself was not without its flaws, as the steak exhibited a tendency towards dryness and an excess of bread hindered the overall enjoyment of the dish. Nonetheless, the freshness of the onions and peppers provided a welcome contrast. Considering the aforementioned factors, I chose to elevate Whiskey Dicks by a star in my rating, primarily due to the establishment's commitment to offering a variety of palatable craft beers alongside its hospitable atmosphere. Although alternative pubs within close proximity may boast superior offerings, Whiskey Dicks' collection of New Belgian beers and Sam Adams seasonal brews renders it a worthy destination for those seeking a satisfying drinking experience.""",True,3418.0,formal

Consequently, I undertook a quest to locate a reputable consignment venue where I could procure novel apparel for him as he developed. Fortunately, numerous such establishments exist in my vicinity (specifically, central Phoenix), and after visiting two other locations prior to arriving at Smarty Pants (with the caveat being not to frequent Urban Baby, as it proved unsatisfactory), I encountered a warm and hospitable reception from the mother-daughter ownership duo. They accepted the majority of the items I presented and, despite my initial intention to merely deposit my goods, I found myself indulging in a shopping spree, resulting in the acquisition of three superior tops for a mere $15 in total. The shop boasted an incredible inventory, maintained a spotless environment, and offered amiable service, thereby rendering it a veritable haven for customers. Additionally, I learned of their impending expansion into the adjacent space, destined to accommodate furniture, while the current location would feature an increased selection of adult attire (although, it's possible that the new space would be designated for clothing, with the existing one being upgraded to accommodate more adult fashion).

The service we received here was indeed impeccable, albeit not in the least bit haughty or pretentious. My companion and I elected to partake in distinct tasting menus, with mine being the Alain Ducasse four-course variety, sans wine, of course. The culinary journey began with a refreshing amuse-bouche of cold broccoli soup, followed by an absolutely delectable lobster curry, succeeded by a heavenly portion of foie gras atop a tender filet, and ultimately concluded with a sublime Armagnac dessert. I must confess that the presentation and flavors of each dish were, for the most part, truly captivating.

Specifically, they incorporate an excessive amount of orange juice into the majority of their offerings, which results in a discordant flavor profile that belies their advertised flavors. Despite my repeated attempts to sample various flavors, I am consistently disenchanted by the prevalence of orange juice or other fruit juices employed as a base, thereby diminishing my overall satisfaction with their smoothies. Notwithstanding, I must acknowledge that Franktuary's Blue smoothie stands out as a notable exception to this trend, earning it my unwavering endorsement.""",True,3470.0,formal

4," We executed a reservation via OpenTable for breakfast, which proved to be a judicious decision, as it precluded us from having to endure a thirty-minute wait in line. Upon entering the establishment, we observed numerous unoccupied tables, which rendered the prolonged queue somewhat perplexing. As we arrived at 10:30, we had the opportunity to sample both breakfast and lunch offerings.

My mother was particularly eager to indulge in their all-you-can-eat macarons, but unfortunately, they failed to meet her expectations, as they lacked the requisite texture of melting in one's mouth. However, several of their other dessert items, such as the creme brulee and fruit tart, were quite delectable. Their crepe offering, on the other hand, was disappointing - the batter was insipid, and the berries were too tart. Moreover, the candied nuts they utilized possessed an unpleasant refrigerated flavor.

In contrast, all the meat dishes I sampled were quite satisfying. The prime rib was cooked to perfection, and the pork apple dish was scrumptious - vastly superior to the parched, chewy offerings at The Bacchanal. Additionally, their hot cherries were palatable. It's amusing that they even offer sushi.

The service was adequate, given the nature of a buffet. However, our server visited our table so infrequently that we were compelled to place our finished dishes on a nearby table.

Ultimately, despite some inconsistencies, I found the food enjoyable, and I would likely return. An abundance of delectable desserts and meats is always an attractive feature for me.",True,3475.0,formal

The chipotle sauce added a delightful touch of spice without overpowering the dish. My sole criticism pertains to the somewhat limited quantity of chicken, as a more copious serving would have elevated the culinary experience to an even higher level of satisfaction. I highly recommend complementing your meal with a drizzle of peppadew hot sauce, a vast improvement upon the ubiquitous Tabasco. \n\nWhile the establishment's present location may not be ideally situated for those residing in Scottsdale, the diverse array of delectable options, available at eminently reasonable price pointsâa mere $5 secured a wrap, beverage, and choice of chips, cookie, or brownieâmore than compensates for any inconvenience arising from the distance.

The fried rice is OK, could be better (more fried)....it tends to be a bit more on the steamed side. The Mongolian beef is good but it's not seared/crispy the way I like it. The flavor is still very good though. The Lo Mein is quite good as well. The fried spring rolls that come with the lunch specials leave a little bit to be desired. Overall I do enjoy the food here very much. For Phoenix, it is quite good. Prices are reasonable as well. I recommend it.",,,informal

When confronted with an untimely craving for sustenance during the wee hours of the morning, Earl's delectable offerings provide an unwavering sense of reliability. Throughout a brief sojourn in Las Vegas spanning three days, I have availed myself of Earl's culinary prowess on no less than three separate occasions (each instance undertaken while in a state of sobriety). A comprehensive evaluation of Earl's menu yielded an unequivocal endorsement of the club sandwich, whose inclusion of baconâan irresistible component, in my opinionâsecured its status as an unmitigated triumph. Furthermore, the Caribbean jerk sandwich boasted a remarkable diversity of flavors, complemented by a judicious balance of tenderness and potency that has earned it the distinction of my personal favorite. Lastly, the tomato soup, adorned with freshly baked croutons and served at an ideal viscosity, constitutes a satisfying repast for those seeking a light meal.

However, I must confess that I am partial to a more tangy and unctuous variety of ribs, as the ones served here were slightly leaner than my personal preference. Moving on to the cornbread, it was adequate, but not particularly memorable. Lastly, I must mention that the hot sauce provided was somewhat overpowering, as it dominated the palate and left little room for the natural flavors of the meat to shine through.

The Aria room had a bunch of issues. The minibar fridge was broken all weekend so all drinks were hot. We left our room for 7 hours during the day and returned to a dirty room - room service hadn't been picked up and it hadn't been serviced at all. They send someone to clean up finally, but they never refilled the water bottles. Later that night, we call and say, hey we need those waters. They say, that's a separate dept. that fills the minibar and they also didn't do their job. And as a result, to get a bottle of water, we had to pay $30 at room service instead of $10 in the minibar.

My recent visit afforded me the opportunity to sample their exemplary fare, including a standard cup of joe, complemented by a complimentary chocolate-coated coffee bean.

Additional advantages of this venue include a double drive-through system, prices that are considerably lower than those of Starbucks, and a staff whose cordiality is nothing short of extraordinary.

""Each and every time that I have visited Montreal over the past six years, I have invariably indulged in a culinary excursion to Schwartz's, an establishment renowned for its delectable smoked meat offerings. My husband, in particular, harbors an unwavering fondness for this esteemed eatery, which borders on an unhealthy obsession. As such, I have become accustomed to his insistent entreaties to partake in the indulgence whenever our travels bring us within proximity of this gastronomic mecca. After extensive exposure to his unrelenting yearning, I have come to comprehend and even empathize with his unbridled passion.  

Every individual boasts their unique modus operandi when it comes to placing an order at Schwartz's. Some may opt for a complementary cherry cola beverage to accompany their sandwich, while others may elect to consume their meal with the aid of a knife and fork, an uncommon practice that I find difficult to reconcile with. Notwithstanding my reservations regarding this latter approach, I refrain from passing judgment, as each person's preferences are inherently valid. Personally, I adhere to a time-tested formula that consists of a sandwich, shared fries, a pickle, and a cherry cola. Furthermore, I ensure that a bottle of A1 steak sauce remains within arm's reach, as it serves as an indispensable condiment that enhances the flavor profile of my meal.  

While I am hesitant to label Schwartz's as either the premier restaurant in Canada or the Montreal counterpart of Katz's, I cannot deny the exceptional quality of their smoked meat offerings. The distinctive preparation method employed by this venerable establishment yields a product that is not only tantalizingly delicious but also remarkably dissimilar to the bagel-accompanied smoked meat found in New York delis. The dining environment, characterized by cozy proximity to fellow patrons, fosters a convivial atmosphere that has led to numerous engaging conversations during my visits.  

Although the queue may appear formidable, the seasoned gentleman manning the entrance possesses a keen understanding of his role and executes it with precision. Consequently, it is essential to place trust in both him and the attentive staff within. Moreover, one must acknowledge the culinary prowess of the kitchen's smoker, an instrument that has been steadfastly producing delectable sandwiches for an impressive span of 82 years.  

My sole concern revolves around the possibility that Celine Dion, once she assumes ownership, may inadvertently compromise the integrity of this beloved institution.""",True,3592.0,formal

The service is always pleasant and fast and the food is pretty darn good for a chain. \n\nI've tried some of their pasta dishes and had the grilled pork chops once and they were quite good. I ordered them on a whim and was pleasantly surprised with them. And they make a great Insalata Blu which is bibb lettuce, walnuts, red onions, grated bleu cheese all tossed in a balsamic vinaigrette. \n\nThe bread they serve with the olive oil and cracked black pepper is always pleasing. And they have a great blackberry mint iced tea. Yum. \n\nThe music they play is a great mix of Italian opera and the Italian crooners of the 50's such as Frank Sinatra. And hopefully there will be a birthday or two while you're there. They usually have a singer who does a great job of \""Happy Birthday\"" in Italian. (What does this person do besides sing? Is that all they do? Anyone know?) \n\nOh, and if you use the restroom they play lessons in Italian while you are....um...doing your business. Pretty cool.( I just hope that if I ever need to use Italian in an emergency I don't have to duck into a bathroom to remember it.) \n\nIf you're in the mood for some good Italian food with good portions and friendly attentive service, Macaroni Grill can't be beat in my book.",,,informal

That makes it better than Mirage which doesn't quite have enough space for the chill out and Canyon Ranch which is more oriented toward being a Gym. The lighting is wonderful through out, low enough to make you feel at peace.  Also, the ability to grab water and hydrate or to put cucumber on your eyes in multiple places is fantastic.  \n\nIf you are like me and go to the spa to lounge around for multiple, hours, Nuture is a good one to put on the list. \n\nI still think that the strip doesn't quite pay enough attention to spa in general, so I can't give it the full 5.  I mean, go to Asia (half of the Casinos have properties there anyway), check it out and come back and implement all the details. \n\nThe only thing I would additionally mention, the spa is FAR from the parking area or entrance areas.

Note: It is imperative to take cognizance of their felicitous Happy Hour, occurring daily from 3 pm to 7 pm and 12 am to 4 am, during which patrons can enjoy a fifty percent reduction on all potations and pizzas. 
In regards to their culinary offerings, Sierra Gold showcases an array of mouthwatering options, including:

* A bucket of wings (Offered in various flavors, garlic parmesan stands out as a paramount choice.)
* A bucket of curly fries (Irresistible and a quintessential accompaniment to any meal.)
* ZOOKIE (An absolute delight! A warm, gooey white chocolate macadamia nut cookie, complemented by a scoop of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and finished with a drizzle of both chocolate and caramel sauce, expertly satiates any sweet tooth yearnings.)
Notwithstanding, the service, albeit somewhat lacking, is comprehensible given the late hour of the visit (midnight), thereby subtracting one star from the overall rating.

We opted to begin our dining experience with the goat cheese appetizer, which proved to be a delicious choice, particularly when paired with the accompanying beets. My main course selection was the smokey burger, boasting an incredible depth of flavor; however, the texture of the patty was somewhat problematic, as it had a tendency to disintegrate upon handling, making it challenging to consume without a certain degree of dexterity. My spouse chose the sirloin steak, accompanied by sautÃ©ed mushrooms, and while he praised the rich, savory flavors, he did comment on the chewiness of the cut, as well as the presence of gristle throughout.

I love a good root beer float. I could taste the booze.\n\nWe both ordered burgers. He added an egg to the steakhouse burger. I got the funghi. Both cooked perfectly. They were delicious. Generous portions. The fries were ok but the burger was so big. Truffle flavor was there and the Gruyere was perfectly melted. It was a more refined mushroom and Swiss burger. In a good way. The fries were just ok. A place like this should have perfectly executed fries there is no reason for anything less. However props to including them in the price of the burger.\n\nWe got good service from the bartenders but the shakes and burgers were slow coming.

This terminal's strategic location enables effortless access to parking facilities and streamlined security screening processes, thereby facilitating a seamless and efficient travel experience for passengers. In light of the aforementioned factors, I would unequivocally consider utilizing the services of this airline again in the event that my travel plans take me to the Pacific Northwest region in the future.""",True,3828.0,formal

""For those who are seeking a luxurious yet economical accommodation experience in Las Vegas, this hotel is an optimal choice. Located on Fremont Street, it boasts an impressive size and has undergone extensive renovations in recent years, totaling millions of dollars. Many visitors are surprised to discover that such a high-end hotel is not situated on the famous Las Vegas Strip. The hotel's pool area is particularly noteworthy, featuring a unique shark tank with an exhilarating water slide that passes directly through its center. This attraction is certain to captivate visitors and create lasting memories. While the hotel's location may not offer the same fresh air quality as those on the Strip, the reasonable admission fee of $20 makes it an appealing option for those seeking a refreshing aquatic experience without breaking the bank. However, it is worth noting that the hotel's non-Strip location may pose a minor inconvenience for some guests, particularly those who are sensitive to smoke, as the air quality may not be as pristine as they would prefer.""",True,3833.0,formal

The trio dip, while good was not worth the $5 happy hour price much less the $7 regular price.  Our neighbors had the mini chimichangas and they barely looked worth the $4 happy hour price.

4," ""The quality of this eatery is quite satisfactory, and I have no doubt that I will visit it more frequently as the temperature drops. The cost-benefit ratio is reasonable, and although I did not opt for any high-end cuts of meat, I was pleased with the three-meat combination. However, I cannot recall the specific types of meat, aside from eye of round, but I managed to enjoy four plates of it. 

I strongly advise choosing the Sukiyaki style; the sweet soy sauce has a richer flavor, and the udon noodles, along with everything else that comes with it, are significantly superior. Don't neglect to add a generous amount of minced garlic, as it will enhance the taste greatly. 

While the noodle and vegetable plates are pre-prepared, they can be a bit disappointing since each plate tends to have an excess or shortage of a particular ingredient. On the other hand, meat plates are cooked to order and sliced appropriately. Depending on where you are seated, you may observe the meat being sliced and put together, which is a pleasant experience. There is no browning of meat that has been piled on top of another and refrigerated. 

I give this place four stars instead of five because of my error in ordering the shabu shabu rather than the Sukiyaki. In essence, I took Anthony M's leftover broth and combined it with my own, resulting in a surprisingly improved flavor. Unfortunately, a staff member accidentally poured shabu shabu water/broth into my dish, diluting the flavor. It was not the staff member's fault, but I failed to sample how everything tasted in Sukiyaki.""",True,3884.0,formal
4,"So while checking Yelp for some reasonable Vegas fare, I came across a venue with like 3000+ reviews, 1 dollar sign, and 4+ stars.  Check around, nothing else like it exists on The Strip.  Naturally, I had to go (mainly because I needed a break from $75 food bills for lunch).  \n\nEoS is good, really good.  There's a huge variety of sandwiches that are all delicious and easy on the wallet.  It's really close to about half the strip, and even if you need to take a $15 cab, you're going to save money in the long run.  There's a breakfast menu which is open until 11am (I never made it), but the rest of their hot sandwich menu suits me just fine. \n\nI had the Chicken Chipotle Avocado thing, and later I had the Original 1786 or whatever.  The Original needed more sauce on the (the horseradish was great, but it needed more).  I got the Chicken Chipotle with extra sauce and it was awesome.  For like $7 a sandwich, you can't go wrong.\n\nNote:  The sandwich isn't huge.  I only needed one, but I don't eat a lot.  Most dudes I hang with would need two to fill them up.  \n\nNote2: If you go for dinner, head into the PH and check out the Pleasure Pit.  You'll see.....",,,informal

At least for tonight. \n\nIn the past the cookies were a bit on the hard side, not the best texture for a ice cream sandwich. Tonight's cookies were soft which made for a perfect sandwich. Their \""scoop\"" of ice cream is Huge. I'm guessing people may complain of price (this ain't the 80's anymore and we must get over the 25 cent a scoop deal) but when you're getting a product/treat like this you forget about $'s sometimes. \n\nStaff is friendly. Place is kept clean. Good amount of space. Bonus that they have the table style arcade game set up and cool unique sodas in their drink fridge.

It's a breath of fresh air and something you might not see at the chain next door. \n\nI enjoyed my Roasted Turkey sandwich. I'm picky about cold cuts (I've basically signed an exclusive with Boars Head) and these made the grade. The bread tastes freshly baked too. The mozzarella sandwich is tasty too. Thumbs up on the turkey chili as well, can't beat it on a chilly day. If you get a drink be prepared, they're basically in vat size cups. They offer your typical 1/2 sandwich & soup lunch specials as well.\n\nTo touch again on the great service, on my last visit Art literally sat down with me and chatted it up. It was the end of the lunch hour and the place was pretty much empty. He asked about my job, how I like downtown etc etc. So friendly! Hell, I might even just come back for the conversation!

4," I recently had the pleasure of partaking in the October Adults Night Out program, which offered an array of enticing features, including complimentary entry and adult beverages. My experience was largely enjoyable, as I relished the opportunity to explore the museum's vast collection and engage in stimulating conversations with fellow attendees. However, my enthusiasm was slightly dampened by a few logistical issues that hindered the overall efficiency of the event. Specifically, the queue to check in was excessively prolonged, which resulted in a sluggish pace that left attendees waiting for an extended period. Additionally, despite having pre-registered online, I neglected to print my tickets, which led to further delays. In light of this, I strongly advise all future attendees to print their tickets in advance to avoid any unnecessary inconvenience. Another drawback was the ""beer garden"" area, where an insufficient number of servers resulted in an excruciatingly slow line that significantly impeded the enjoyment of the alcoholic offerings. In fact, numerous individuals grew so disenchanted with the lengthy wait that they opted to give away their drink tickets or abandon the line altogether. To rectify these issues, I recommend implementing measures such as increasing the number of servers and streamlining the check-in process to enhance the overall experience for future attendees. Despite these shortcomings, I would still consider participating in another Adults Night Out event, provided that tangible improvements are made to address the aforementioned concerns.",True,3933.0,formal

The process of ordering and settling the bill can prove somewhat perplexing, as it is advisable to place one's order and proceed directly to the cash register to effect payment, thereby avoiding the inconvenience of possessing a ravenous appetite and awaiting settlement before satiating one's hunger. It remains a mystery how this establishment manages to thwart potential fraud, given the ease with which one could exploit the system by placing an order, lingering, and then absconding without remuneration.

4," While not as expansive as Palazzo/Venetian, they do possess accommodations that are comparable in magnitude to those offered by Cosmopolitan and other luxury hotels. In fact, they may be identical in dimensions or perhaps even more spacious.

The primary distinction between Signature and its contemporaries lies in the presence of a stove and microwave, which enables guests to revitalize remnants of their meals or prepare succulent treats. This amenity proves particularly advantageous.

Unfortunately, Signature is situated at an appreciable distance from the renowned Las Vegas Strip, necessitating a considerable pedestrian excursion through a tunnel leading to MGM. Although this passageway does not pose an insignificant challenge, it does provide access to the bustling boulevard. However, when desiring to visit Encore, the journey becomes rather arduous, rendering taxis a practical necessity. Additionally, gambling enthusiasts will lament the absence of a casino within the premises.

Furthermore, parking arrangements at Signature exhibit some eccentricities. Guests are required to utilize valet services exclusively, as self-parking options are unavailable.

4," ""Prior to returning to Los Angeles from Las Vegas, we opted to partake in a midday repast at this establishment. The process of being seated was swift and efficient; however, our server's performance was somewhat lacking, as she appeared to be struggling to address the needs of her patrons, which led us to wonder whether the venue had indeed been fully prepared for its grand opening, as rumors suggested that it had only recently begun operations. Notwithstanding these reservations, the salad we ordered took an inordinate amount of time to arrive, and when it finally did, it was merely a brief interval before our main courses were served, which diminished our ability to thoroughly enjoy the starter. Despite these setbacks, the culinary offerings we sampled, specifically the Twisted Mac, Chicken & Cheese, proved to be satisfying. As is customary with any Hard Rock Cafe, the ambiance and decor were undeniably captivating.

The menu looks like it has been updated/revamped a little since the split and everything I ordered was cooked and seasoned perfectly. They have this breakfast dish that is a piece of grilled french bread with an egg and grilled asparagus and a little tomato salad...to die for. I love the cheap wine during the day (even on weekends!). The sparkling Sauvignon Blanc is worth a stretch outside your comfort zone. In general I just really like this place.

The primary grievance pertaining to this dining experience was the extraordinary length of time patrons were compelled to wait in line, particularly during the eatery's Buy One Get One Free promotion. The protracted delay was attributed to the sheer volume of customers seeking to capitalize on the offer, which resulted in an hour-long wait and a narrow margin of time to secure the discounted rate before the 4 pm deadline. Upon gaining entry, the assortment of culinary options was nothing short of astounding, with a vast array of choices that catered to diverse tastes and dietary preferences, complemented by complimentary alcoholic beverages. The quality of the fare was impressive, warranting the moderate price point during non-promotional periods. To optimize the dining experience, it is suggested to visit during off-peak hours, specifically for lunch when the cost is approximately $12, as the dinner prices can be somewhat prohibitive.

Second, selection: although the bulk of their vinyl is rock and R&B, there are smaller but respectable collections of jazz, country and classical. \n\nCool thing about record shopping in Vegas is that so many people come through there from all over. This makes for a lot of inventory change, all the time. And that's very cool.

Last time I was here, I came up with a half-dozen sealed early 70s Motown titles, a couple of hard to find Quads that i'd been searching for, and a ton of other cool goodies. Definitely worth the visit if you're in Sin City, with a better chance of a \""win\"" than any casino you might drop cash at ;)",,,informal

Talk about bang for your buck!  \n\nThe original lamb gyro is my second favorite thing to order here.\n\nMarket Grille now has a waitstaff, which I am kind of disappointed in.

I love all the different types of breads they carry and their HyTop brand products aren't bad. \nWe hate shopping at Walmart and supporting an awful company. Winco treats their employees well and have always had exceptional service. You can't compare it to Fry's or Safeway it's a hybrid! What really helps is that it's great for just 2 people, I don't always want bulk quantities from Costco but love the grocery store prices that are very competitive.",,,informal

It's always buzzing up in here, with free wi-fi available and an area dedicated to those packing their laptops to get some work done.  I've come here to do just that with my son and solo.  It's also a great place for people-watching; it feels like you're in Southern California, not Summerlin. It's everything you want in a cool Italian-style coffeehouse, with great decor and a second floor that overlooks all the activity down below.  If you have some time to spend, are in the area, and not in a rush to speed through like at Starbucks, come check it out sometime; Starbucks has nothing on Sambalatte.",,,informal

Location is couple miles from the strip and the plaza looks old but it is nice inside the restaurant. The arepas also come with two sauces in a bottle. You can use it as a spread for the arepas and it is absolutely delicious! It is spicy, savory, and creamy! It went so well with my food! The cashier, George, was also very patient when I was ordering and knowledgable about their menu. It is not cheap cheap but compared to other restaurants and buffets on the strip, it is cheap and worth it for the quality of the food.",,,informal

I'm now sad to discover I could have been indulging in this place for years, but alas - better late than never!\n\nThe place itself isn't lots to look at - it's cute, quaint, but it has character.  The staff were extremely friendly and welcomed any questions about the menu.  I ordered the eggplant parmesan and a water (I was driving, so I'll have to revamp my review once I try one of their cocktails!).  I've had eggplant parmesan before, but I'd say this is probably the best I've had - if not then definitely top three.  Served as a sandwich, it was super flavourful and came with the marinara sauce on the side which I loved as I'm not a fan of soggy bread!\n\nThe place itself was quiet as we were there on a Tuesday night around 7pm, way before the bar crowd would get there.  If you're looking for a quiet dinner then I'd say come around that time, and stay tuned for part two once I check out their cocktail menu!",,,informal

The car is dinging some nonsense about oil and coolant.  \n\nSince a used car is less expensive than a brand new auto, I think I'd better give the green car a drink.\n\nIn haste, I top off the coolant with some brand I purchased at the nearest gas station.  Then the panic sets in.\n\nI grab the manual and search the forums on coolant for specific requirements for my maturing road beast.  I think I put in the wrong kind of coolant.  I keep reading about colors and brand specific benefits.\n\nI head to Zimbrick and Bryan is awesome and friendly and patient.\n\nHe takes the coolant supply I have and checks it against the kind the service folks have in bulk.  I'm good for the top off.  No dangers.  Then we talk oil and other road-preparedness details I should not skip.\n\nHe grabs the oil grade I need, checks the levels, complements my ride and I prepare the wallet.

If you're from Nebraska like me you may appreciate the Cornhuskers \""N\"" on the smoker and picture of windmills & farmers in the dining area.  To me, those are a few of the reasons why I left that terrible place.  No points lost though.\n\nI have only been here during lunch and they usually have a line at the door, come early.  Their brisket, BBQ pork, beans and waffle fries are hot, tasty and fresh. PoaF's meat is awesome. The cornbread is good too. The portions are big too, I typically have to fight the afternoon food coma but it's worth it.\n\nTheir sauces aren't anything fantastic, but I enjoy the spicy sauce.

Conveniently found next next to I-15 on Blue Diamond Road, Bass Pro Shops is my welcome committee to Las Vegas from California.\n\nOn my last visit we walked the store and found our way towards the giant aquariums and the mermaid painting exhibits at the Silverton Casino connection. What can I say, my wife likes mermaids. After looking at mermaids and stocking up on ammo, I found my way towards the crossbows on the second floor. I fell in love with a Parker Compound Crossbow.

5,"... as always, 5 stars if the place would stand up anywhere. It would. \n\nFirstly, I'm overjoyed it survived these past few years. Secondly, on a regular Saturday night 8:30-ish, it was 40% full - and in-line with it's 2 street-facing co-tenants. That's hopefully enough to ensure survival. These 3 delightful restaurant/bars have carved out a wonderful second life for the industrial building they're housed in and provide a luxury of urbanity to this burg. \n\nWe had to scoot in for a quick small supper before going to a comedy show a friend was in. Small check quickly and un-resentfully served - thank you gracious server! \n\nThere was a single man drinking a coke and eating a bowl of pasta at the bar while diligently reading his book. It was clear he felt abundantly welcomed. That tableau epitomizes the civilized urbane establishment this place is. \n\nThe pasta carbonara remains true after two years to the unremittingly high standard set for me by a Queens neighborhood Italian joint decades ago - and Pasta Bar remains the only other place I've ever ordered it more than once. For that, and so much more, I'm eternally grateful.",,,informal

5,This is the best mom and pops Korean restaurant I have ever been to. They treated us like their own family and spoiled us immensely. It's a small hole in the wall place that needs more visitors here. Try it once and you will be hooked. I plan on coming here again and again. The chef/wife's cooking is to die for. The husband/ host is absolutely hilarious and genuine. It's hard to find great quality food run by an old loving couple. The husband is a chemical engineer and the wife was a nurse for many years so you know they pay attention to every detail of the cooking and make sure everything is clean and perfect when ready to be served on the plate. They gave us 3 free dishes and even offered us a 4th free dish and even refused our tip because we were students. I made sure to slip one pass the husband though lol and still we did not think that was enough to express our gratitude towards such an eventful experience at their restaurant. We truly felt like we were at home and we were sitting around dinner table amongst family!!  I highly recommend them and would give more than 5 stars if possible!!,,,informal

We had the truffle deviled eggs, cheese plate, duck confit tacos, ahi tuna, duck fat grilled cheese and kiltlifter fish and chips- everything was delicious and perfect for sharing!

We got here around 3ish so we were able to get a table right away on their front patio in the shade, but things fill up pretty quickly and I've heard its fairly typical to wait an hour for a table. We split a salad and had the margarita pizza with added fennel sausage. Everything is very simple but is done with very high quality ingredients that gives the food a very unique and delicious flavor! We will for sure be back!",,,informal

They have a table with doggie desserts that look good enough for human consumption that are .90 an ounce.  They sell deer antlers, jerky and sausage items by the ounce too.  A perfect way to give you dog variety.  They have dog grooming and offer a nice selection of leashes, collars and dog bowls as well.

5,"I'm not a car girl and Lester couldn't have been more accommodating.  I needed an inspection and he was able to take me the same day I called.  He's open past 7pm so the evening hours make it convenient to pick up or drop off. \n\nVery honest and upfront about the work he did, too...typical Pittsburgher who knows his stuff. Labor was $70/hour and parts were cheaper than other places. Cost me $3 to have a break light replaced.  Couldn't have been happier with the quick, honest, convenient service.  Lester's the best!",,,informal

5,"I don't remember dying, but I must've died because I'm in Heaven. First of all, the ambiance is freakin ridiculous, (in a good way.) It's like I want to keep switching tables so I can take it all in! \n\nSecond, the best staff EVER! Andrew and Priscilla, I want to adopt them. Seriously. Happy, friendly, adorable, knowledgeable. Awesome. Perfect. Give them raises.\n\nMy husband had the beef tenderloin, of which I had a \""few\"" bites. I had the ribeye. It was hard to share but I gave him a bite. We finished with the \""Chocolate bar\"" dessert. Really, there is no way to describe the deliciousness. It's one of those desserts you want everyone you know to try so you can talk about it later. Just awesomely good. \n\nI've never wanted to live in Phoenix until now. \n\nCome. Eat. Drink. Share. Repeat.",,,informal
5,"The M Resort is one of my favorite resorts in Las Vegas.  Since we are local we have not stayed here yet.  They have quite a bit to offer.  We mainly come here for the restaurants.  The Buffet is by far the best in town!  I love that they have my favorite dessert, Creme Brulee all the time and not just once in a while!  They also have espresso drinks available in the dessert area.  There is also a Hash House, Baby Cakes Bakery, Vig Deli, Anthony's Steak house and Burger Joint.  \nThe hotel as a whole is spotless!  The smoke in the casino area is kept to a minimum.  \nThe pool area is great!  Plenty of seating and the pool staff is great! Even the food at the pool is great too! \nRavello lounge has some great entertainment.  The wine/drink selections are great with a nice price range for everyone's tastes.",,,informal
5,"I can think of no greater compliment for Aloha Kitchen than this: the adobo in the adobo fried rice omelette reminds me of my mom's. \n\nAfter an early morning drive to Las Vegas, lunch, and a little entertainment, my wife and I had dinner at this comfortable and casual eatery. Aloha Kitchen offers a touch of the island vibe away from the hustle and bustle of the strip. Order at the counter, sit down, then wait for your meal to arrive at your table. Locals, students from nearby UNLV, and Yelp-savvy tourists populate the restaurant. \n\nThe adobo fried rice omelette is lip-smacking good. The adobo and fried rice are garlicky and flavorful, with the omelette cooked to delectable perfection. I tore through most of the enormous serving before hitting the wall about 3/4 of the way through it. I couldn't eat another bite, so I boxed it up for a late-night snack after a visit to the casinos. My wife ordered the pork kahlua and it was tender, smoky, and a huge serving. We also tried the spam musubi, which was your standard spam wrapped in rice and seaweed. Nothing remarkable, but enjoyable.\n\nAloha Kitchen offers affordable and delicious meals and it's a terrific way to get out of the casinos for an hour or two. The adobo fried rice omelette alone is worth a visit. \n\nHighly recommended.",,,informal

5,Tired of going to mass and not understanding the gospel? Well then this is the church for you! I honestly dislike going to church and being so lost during the gospel because the priest does not make it relatable. Father Nadim on the other hand uses real life experiences when speaking about the gospel. We also had a private mass for both my daughter's baptism and it was great! I was almost brought to tears due to the way Father Nadim explained things during the mass. He also knows how to make things funny which makes time go by fast! My husband and I fully enjoy this church and that doesn't happen often!,,,informal

The atmosphere is so calm and breezy.  \n\nThe staff welcomed me as if I was a regular.  I had this amazing steak salad called Saba Steak Salad.  And I had the Island Goat Cheese.  I can barely explain them because I will talk myself into going back there.\n\nThe steak in the salad melted in my mouth and was seasoned to perfection!  The dressing had a garlic aioli that added so much flare and flavor.  There were 3 potato coins on the side that were a great addition to the salad.   The spring mix and romaine was fresh and I was very pleased.\n\nNow to the goat cheese.  HOLY COW.  So tasty!!  It wasn't overwhelming is was perfect.  There were tortillas strips on the side that were dangerous because I really wanted a bag of them when I was done.  There was also a mango salsa with the cheese and I will admit I had a spoonful of it on its own.\n\nAs you can tell I HIGHLY recommend Tommy Bahamas.  What would be great is everyone bought tickets to the Original Taste this weekend and you can taste 36 restaurants in one event!!!",,,informal

5,"One of my favorite bars ever! I love the constantly changing menu (but that long-time customers can still get their favorite \""classics\""), the quality of the drinks, the laid-back vibe (unless it's 12-2 on a saturday, then it can be super-crowded).  \n\nThings you might not know:\n1.  VEGANS- beware! Some of the drinks contain eggwhites, honey, dairy, or Campari and are not necessarily listed on the menu.  When in doubt, ask the bartender.  They're usually cool about making you a vegan version.\n\n2.  Usually the first Monday of the month is \""Mixology Monday,\"" which is a hot mess of a good time.  A guest mixologist makes 4 special cocktails to highlight the featured booze of the evening (I went for Veev Acai liqueur and .... some other stuff that I drank too much to remember what they were... but every time I've gone it's been excellent.)  \n\n3.  On weeknights, it's a great place to go with friends/ a date that you actually want to talk to because it's not too crowded, the music is not loud, and the ambiance is nice.\n\n4.  Expect to pay about $10/drink.  They also have a \""temperance menu\"" of non-alcoholic drinks that are done mixology style.  Great for  DD's, preggo's, or Mormons!",,,informal

The difference is in the freshness of the ingredients and the homemade quality. Try the roasted chicken with paprika and carmelized onions or the chicken skewers with rice. Also great is the Greek salad, gyro platter, and of course baklava for dessert! Support small, independent businesses like this one rather than corporate chains that care more about profits than quality. You will not be disappointed!",,,informal

They also have a couple TVs so you don't have to miss the big game over getting grub. \n\nThe food is to die for. I'm a big Sesame Chicken fan, and this is the sesame chicken by which all other sesame chickens will be judged. They have Pepsi products so all Mtn. Dew fans are appeased and their egg rolls and chips with duck sauce are great.\n\nThat doesn't even cover their service, which truly sets China Palace apart from everyone else. If you take three sips, the waiter gives you a refill. Doesn't matter how busy they are. I drink a lot of water, and my glass doesn't get as much as half of the way empty before I get a refill. Talk about attentive! In addition, everyone is as nice as possible. \n\nOne last thing. One time, I showed up with a friend who was getting an order to go.

There are TVs everywhere including a large center screen. The staff is friendly as well. I tried the turkey wrap, as is. They add dried cranberries to the wrap...wasn't sure how that was going to taste. After the first bite I was hooked! On the menu they have sliders (Philly cheez, burger or grilled cheese), apps, salads (including a grilled romaine salad that I've heard is to die for), sandwiches, pizza and more! There is a separate kids menu too. They are going to serve food late too - hard to find in that area. Definitely check this place out - even just to see what work was done.",,,informal

We went to the front desk expecting to have to check our bags with the bell hops but to our surprise we were checked in and got our room keys right away.\n\nOne of my favorite things about the hotel is the way the elevators are set up. I believe we were on the 26th floor and we had 4 elevators that only served 5 or 6 floors total so we never had to wait for an elevator and we did have to stop at five floors before we got to our floor.\n\nThe hotel tower is well designed and seemed surprisingly small. We were all the way at the end of the hallway but it was not a far walk to the elevator.\n\nWe had a king room which was pretty spacious. There was a sitting area and work desk and a huge entry. The bathroom was also spacious with an enclosed toilet and an oversized shower and tub. The bed was a little too soft for my liking but was comfortable. \n\nI loved the automatic shades and how everything could be controlled bedside.

They know me by name.  :)  \n\nThey tend to be busy most of the time, but the line always moves quickly.  The entire crew is so friendly and takes time to chat with customers who want to chat back.\n\nKudos to James, Derek and everyone at this location.  I hear the staff will be dismantled once the new City Scape location opens and this location shuts its doors.  Some will go to the new location, others to various other locations.  Boo!!",,,informal

It's just up the street, but if you are used to them in their current location, you'll need to look for them in the new place soon.  It's in the old Hollywood Video location.\n\nAnyway, Nona's is a great little bakery offering all sorts of items for your sweet tooth, including the aforementioned \""cupcake bar\"".  I'm not much for cake, and prefer cookies, but luckily she has me covered there too.  Lots of cookies to choose from.  Feel free to go as wild as you like.\n\nAnd if you like to watch cake shows, she'll be on Platinum Weddings  in 2010.  January I think.",,,informal
5,"Just wanted to put in a plug for their new food cart, on Johnson a little east of Mills. They have squash curry, mango/pineapple curry, and a few sides. This is my new favorite food cart in Madison. Fast service, good prices, and the best curries in Madison (aside from the brick and mortar locations).",,,informal
5,"The place is clean, well maintained and as a rule you don't have to wait for machines or weights. The staff is very amiable/helpful.  There are a variety of fitness levels of the patrons (beginners to buff). It strikes me the clientele are on the more mature side.  My wife does the classes and yoga (which are included in the membership).  She says he are well done.  Membership prices are reasonable.  The trainers are good but I think a bit spendy.  I have been a member of a few gyms and this one is one of the better ones. I would recommend this facility without reservation.",,,informal

5,"Listen up people! This is THE most fan friendly team in all of professional sports. Period. I'd stop my review there but you probably want to know why, or not but I'm gonna tell you anyway!\n\nEverything about this organization from top to bottom is designed for two reasons. To win, and to make the fans happy. What more could you really ask for in a sports team? The tickets are some of the most affordable in all of baseball and the players are really friendly too. This is a great group of guys that really appreciates the fans and understands how important it is to support them back. Best part of all is if you ever have and concerns or questions well Derrick Hall, the President & CEO  of the Arizona Diamondbacks is on Twitter. Just shoot him a message and he usually responds rather quickly. What other team is that intimate with their fans?!\n\nAbove all else, it's just fun to go out and have a night a the ballpark. But that's a separate review for Chase Field the venue itself. Just go out there and support your home team.

I wear yoga pants and a T-shirt. They soak your feet and you get a full massage and the price is UNBELIEVABLE. What I love is you can call this place and make an appointment for an hour later. I have never called and been told I couldn't get in. They have several people working there and are eager to work. I love this place. Janet",,,informal

BUT that didn't kill my appetite or anything. Great value for the $$, they are very generous with portion size. I love this place. And it's not overly popular (read: crowded) as other places. I would totally recommend this for lunch hour, a quick takeout for movie night, or dinner. I am looking forward to my next visit here.",,,informal
5,"This is one of my favorite places in the valley - there's always something new here, and it's big enough that I don't often get to walk the entire thing in one visit. \n\nIf you visit often, I recommend a membership. $75 gets you in for free, but the $200 level gets you invited to all 4 private exhibition event evenings.  The $100 level gets you invited to two. \n\nThey host frequent lectures and all kinds of interesting events. You can always find something  going on, on their calendar.\n\nSome of the permanent collection I am very fond of... Seeing the same exhibitions a bunch of times is kind of like visiting an old friend. There is always something new to appreciate. The rotating and visiting exhibits are always well presented, as well. \n\nArcadia Farms is a fantastic place to eat, the healthy slow food really fits. I mean, what do they serve at the Met in NY? They have a shitty cafeteria. We have Arcadia Farm bitches! OK so the Met has a huge Egyptian temple and Dutch masters paintings, but we have this weird reflective black plastic concave/convex thing and a dark room full of hanging LED's and mirrors. \n\nThere is more culture in Phoenix than the out of date yogurt in your fridge!",,,informal

I woke up at the crack of dawn to the reminder of the delicious leftovers that were calling to me from my refrigerator.  This quaint establishment is enormous in flavor.  The fresh vegetables were saut\u00e9ed yet crisp, the meat was as tender as eating cotton candy.  Starting out with the eclectic plate of appetizers was a trip to heaven.  The spice rating is a scale from 1-5.  I always treat my spice ratio as if I'm putting together an outfit.  In the words of the famous fashion designer Coco Channel...it is easier to add than take away.  The entrees were ordered as a  three.  The delectable flavor of the food was not hidden in the heat.  I can't wait to go back and enjoy more of their tempting choices.  The restaurant does not serve alcohol.  Which is a blessing in disguise.  You would not want any of your senses denied the aroma, taste and presentation of this restaurant.  I highly recommend the Thai Iced Tea.   To top it all off, I can sleep sounding because I know that their Garlic Beef is only a phone call away because they do deliver.  My hat's off to you, Chef Moo and your staff.",,,informal

Notables are:\n\nDaily Specials\n\nTofu, both fresh and fried\n\nDuck, get like 3 of them.\n\nFoie Gras.\n\nPork Cheek.\n\nShishito peppers.\n\nMy favorite is this cold dish, it's a bowl with egg, roe and uni.  Not sure what it's called, but if they have the uni, it's a treat.\n\nOrder everything, especially the daily specials. Make reservations or show up late, but not too late as they have essentially two waves of busy. From 7 to 9 and from 11 to 2am. So you can usually drop in around 9 to 10, otherwise you'll want a reservation. \n\nI will miss few things about las vegas, this is without question, the top of that list.",,,informal

Perfect for socializing with friends around big plates of delicious memories!,,,informal

It's an intimate show and it's charming and you gotta go in with a positive attitude.  \n\nI could not stop laughing at the Twigglers (sp?)  These were the dancers that were pretending to be short singing the Village People and doing tricks.  Even thinking about their facial expressions makes me laugh right now. \n\nThe host is great and he does some pretty cool tricks of his own.  There was a bowling ball juggling moment that I jumped out of my seat, as well as a rope stunt over the audience that I thought someone was going to fall on the audience.  Well done!\n\nVery entertaining, get your local discount, have fun.  Similar to Absinthe, way less raunchy.  Definitely fit to take adults and kids.",,,informal

I have gone to a *lot* of dentists in my day and would never have considered giving one above 3 stars.  Then, I met Dr. Wyatt.  \n\nFirst, his helpers are super helpful and friendly.  They are nice and sometimes when they ask a question, they actually take the tools out of your mouth for you to answer!\n\nSecond, Dr. Wyatt himself follows suit and is nice.  Even when you have issues he's nice about it.  He doesn't lecture or raise his voice or even seem angry that you don't do something, like oh floss all the time...  He truly seems like he wants you to have a happy, healthy smile, not like he is frustrated with your behavior.\n\nLastly, his office is called \""Reel Dental\"" and they have a movie theme.  Though somewhat cheesy, it's nice to have movies on in the waiting room and such.  Rumor has it that when you go in for long dental work, which I never have, you can watch a movie while it's done!  Anything to take your mind of the fact you're in a dentist chair is great.\n\nOh, and for the ladies, he's quite easy on the eyes to look at while being worked on!",,,informal

So relaxing, fresh, clean, quiet --- a stark contrast to the rest of Vegas.\n\nThe coffee was perfect and I am a picky coffee person. Service was good and not in your face at all. But the best part was the main.\n\nHuevos rancheros. A relatively straightforward dish. Made differently at a lot of places. But this sets the standard. The plate came out piping hot, the flavors mixed together so well, and the presentation was superb.\n\nLet me put it this way --- I eat out a LOT and am blessed to try some amazing places. I rarely have something I remember vividly later. The duck at the Modern in NYC, the cashew chicken at Ryutenmon Tokyo, the sushi at Kaygetsu here in in Menlo Park --- and now the huevos rancheros at Verandah Vegas.

Even more so in the wine department, unfortunately I have not totally educated my pallate in alot of red varietals, but I know any wino would appreciate such a vast collection.\nChinedu (I hope I spelled that right) was more than willing to help me find a suitable wine, but we were kind of in a rush to visit a friend and see a show. Got to shake hands with Joe, the regional manager, if I recall correctly. The man knows what he is doing when it comes to expanding.\nThis will definitely be a new pizza spot for me, especially because they have traditional, white and pesto options.. not to mention it is so close to my work.

It's almost like it was quietly placed here by a divine Airport God as our reward for dealing with TSA's across the lands. This is easily the best and fanciest place I've eaten at Any airport. \n\nI ordered a bagel with a side of all the necessary ingredients for a lox bagel combination creation (herbed cream cheese, capers, red onions, tomatoes and smoked salmon).

They have been recognised throughout the bar trade for being at the top of their game.\n\nTea cups have been trendy for a while, but these guys are no newcomers, so don't knock them for being in amongst it. You wont get a pineapple filled with pina colada, but if you ask them for a straight forward mojito or an old fashioned it will complete you. I, however, prefer to go for something straight from their list, some of which will smack you in the face and make sure you are standing to attention. \n\nTip from the professional drinker, always buy a beer chaser to maintain your rhythm, perfection takes time, and if you drink these the same way you would a straight up spirit and mixer, you will be carried out the back door....\n\nIts a very small snuggle of a place, I prefer to find a ledge to stand at as the couches will eat your sexy ass alive...",,,informal

Also, we were celebrating a birthday and brought a bottle of wine as a gift - not to share at the meal, but as a gift.

The two large tables up front look like gigantic picnic tables.\n\nThen there is the food! OMG Reader! This is probably one of the few places in Montreal that finally has gotten American  Southern BBQ right and done the right way. No disgusting drippy sauces and coating of brown sugar like Bar B Barn. No half-assed attempt at \""faux\"" BBQ like Bofinger. The got the smoking, the got the rub, they got it all right. Prices are also very reasonable and the place has a virtual line up almost every night. (Please for the love of God, stay in Verdun!).\n\nThey literally just opened up a few weeks back so I'm guessing there may be new additions to their menu, because for the moment there are no desserts.

Cool, calm, collected, took our order, gave me some good highlights of the menu.\n\nFood came, literally within 10 minutes, and we were diggin' in. I ordered the chorizo omelette, chedder grits,  and it also came with pancakes. I never had chorizo omelette, so I wasn't sure what I was getting into, it is a tad oily, but that is from the chorizo, however the veggies and egg balanced it out. CHEDDER GRITS delicious! My boyfriend stealth the rest. I cried. Pancakes, fluffy, buttery, melts in your mouth- probably the best set of pancakes ever. I ate it all. Then I cried. \n\nWe don't quite live in the area, so I am quite bummed that we'd will probably never have Butters again. It was a great choice for us, we enjoyed the service and food. Thanks Butters!",,,informal

The front desk had a seamless and simple check-in. The concierge was very helpful in answering my questions regarding transportation options into Old Town (I didn't want to worry about having some cocktails and driving back). Of note: their towncars will drop you off anywhere in Old Town for $21. \nTheir rooms are so pretty-I really love the simple, modern, sleek style. We didn't get to take advantage of the Release Pool Party this time around as it was raining, but it's free for hotel guests. Nice views of the desert too from our room.",,,informal

Perfect place to sit for a small group of 2 or 3! \n\nMust have - Lobster Poutine. One might think this is probably Chuck Hughes' most overrated dish...but trust me, it was well due the accolades! Absolutely delicious. Poutine with just the right amount of \""fishiness\"" added to the gravy, curds, and frites. We also had the Albacore Tuna and Crackling Pork (equally amazing) and the Pierogies & Pork Belly (yum). \n\nService was great.

5,"My husband and I have a slip here and are members. We love this marina and its laid back atmosphere. The only downfall to this marina is the long walkway if the shuttle service is busy but you are more than welcome to wait. They do have call boxes for the golf cart shuttles at each end of the walkway. Being a member you have access to private showers and bathrooms, a bbq area thats shaded with tables and chairs, washers and dryers, power and water hookups, 2 free bags of ice daily etc.. Love the staff. All of them are friendly and helpful. The whole marina and docks have the feel of one big happy family. Never have had any issues with theft etc. Definetly laid back with the exception of the party weekends lol.. I reccomend this marina over Scorpion Bay Marina based solely on how laid back and personable Pleasant Harbor is. I have been to Scorpion Bay Marina a few times and things just seem a bit more uptight over there. Not to mention the cops that seem to consistently be driving around. Just an uneasy feeling all around for me. If you plan to get a slip here make sure to talk to Shannon. She knows her stuff. :)",,,informal

He was very honest with his products and very knowledgable. My mother wanted to install hardwood flooring but he explained the pros and cons of it. We went with laminate flooring instead because he explained that hardwood flooring is not ideal in Las Vegas because of the dry climate. I did not know that!!! We went with the Shaw laminate flooring. He gave us a good deal. 1.89 per sq ft for Shaw laminate flooring and that included the padding!!! I did not go with chinese made laminate or home depots because of the quality. TLC has good quality products for a great price!!\n\nThanks Ramin for all your help. I love my floors.,,,informal

5,I am not a great golfer by any means. But i do love the sport. this course is great for beginners and good golfers alike. It's wide open with few houses in a hittable location unless you REALLY get a hold and slice or pull badly. water is a recurring nightmare and provides some good challenges. Greens were in pretty good shape. not perfect but compared to other courses for under 50 dollars a round I haven't found any better. \n\nThe part that sets this place a part from courses i go to is the employees and service. from the clubhouse counter all the way through to the food service were the best I've experienced.  ll actually have starters rolling around DOING their job and pushing the very slow groups along. My green fee included some draft beers and some food which i didn't plan on. and to top it off unlimited range balls. It was the best Saturday of golf I've had in Vegas.,,,informal

She cut his hair right on the very first time... It literally took my last groomer 3 attempts before she finally gave me what I wanted. \n\nIf you're in the market for a new groomer, for whatever reason, I highly recommend you trying this place out.

Since they are in my neighborhood, I thought I should give them a try.\nVery clean and friendly place. We went in at lunch time and looked at the lunch menu. They have lunch meals for less than $6.00. With drink was just over $7.00 per meal. I got the house chicken. Marked spicy. Not overly spicy but I am used to eating some very hot foods so I am not always the best person to ask. My wife got the Orange Chicken. Wow. We got enough food to feed 4 or 5 people. Depending on how hungry you are there is enough food to feed 3 people in each meal. The food was good, and temperature was hot, hot as they cook it while you wait. Much better than the other Oriental food places in the area. I will be back. Many times. \nThis place just got started. Go see them. You will enjoy your food and service.",,,informal

Danielle took fantastic care of us and the entire staff worked together to make the experience phenomenal. When we arrived we noted the fantastic view of the strip and the potential sunset.  The staff worked as a team to make sure that the sun was never a bother and in a single synchronized effort made sure that pall of the blinds were open for the diners to enjoy the majesty of sunset.

I had read that Aureole had a great happy hour, so we headed over to the bar to partake. Two for one wine flights and appetizers. We got, how do I put this delicately...wasted. The wine was plentiful and the appetizers, while delicious (I had my first oxtail) were not enough to stave off the effects of the alcohol.\n\nOur bartender was really nice and attentive. I disliked one of the wines in my flight and he chose another one for me to replace it. He let us play with the digital wine list, and kept a close eye on our needs all evening. After our flights he suggested some desert wines that were a great way to end our Aureole experience and then release us into the casino, inhibitions shorn away!\n\nOverall, a very pleasant experience and I am sad to see the bad reviews Aureole has been receiving lately.

Among many other things.\n\nThey have always been highly communicative, honest, and fair; informing me throughout the entire process of what needed to be fixed, detailing throughly how everything would be done and what it would need to cost. They have always fixed only what needed to be, and never anything more, not allowing me to repair something that would be unnecessary for me to do. They have always been very timely and productive with their work; I recently had to replace my alternator and they had the job finished within the day.

Bread was super tasty and wine was light but flavorful.,,,informal
5,"We live in Seville, and have been going to the Blue32 up on Val Vista and Williams Field.  We waited anxiously for this to open, and all of the anticipation led to some really high expectations.  \n\nI'm happy to report that our expectations have been exceeded twice in a row. \n\nLast time, we were seated at a table with a server named Amanda and we loved her.  The food was great (I had the Alfredo pasta, very flavorful) but my favorite every time is the strawberry daiquiri.  They're made with real strawberries rather than gloppy corn syrup mix, and the taste is miles apart.  \n\nWe couldn't remember our awesome servers name this trip (sorry Amanda) but we won't forget because we've now immortalized her in this review.  \n\nShe's thoughtful.  We had been dithering about what to order (flatbread? Shrimp poboy? Steak?) When a massive party arrived, requiring extra tables and chairs to be brought in, she was nice enough let us know so we could get our order in before they were all seated.  \n\nWe never wanted for a drink or water refill, food was correct and piping hot, and she's just delightful.  \n\nAlso... Fresh Strawberry daiquiris... Did I mention that..???",,,informal

Set me back $800 out the door but those bags were exactly what I needed.  Gunnel's couldn't get me in for about 5 days but they did exactly what they said they would and they did it on time.

5,"Try to find a cheap but good place to eat on the Plateau, and good luck!  Well, here is one, all dishes including desserts are only $5.00!!  Mind you, the emphasis seems to be heavy on the junk...poutine & more poutine, the godfather hot dog, (mac & cheese on top of a giant hot dog) and different burgers. Take heart ,and if you are worried about your heart, fear not, there are veggie and some lighter fare options. I had the veggies wrap, which was very good, lots of FRESH crisp veggies wrapped inside a green tortilla, with a chocolate mousse with raspberry coulis for dessert... yummy indeed! My friend had the curried chicken dish ,followed by the same dessert as I had, and she proclaimed that it was better than what she'd had at Juliette & Chocolate,and for a far better price, oh my! Great little place with a retro-oddball decor\n(old desk lamps with extension necks, all cobbled together as chandeliers, old 78's as place mats,graffiti walls) but it all works.

They have a soup menu, a hot sandwich menu, wraps and salads... and of course desserts!  \n\nyou order your sandwich, wrap or salad.. they give you a buzzer and a receipt... you walk down the line of neatly arranged extras of potato salads, macaroni salads... fruit cups, brownies, chips...

I decided that MTL was the place to go. \n\nI called ahead of time the day I was planning on getting it done, I asked about a time and was told that they'd be able to fit me in! Great! I went and met Tony, the guy I'd talked to on the phone. He was super friendly, and recognized me from the call. In all honesty, the paperwork and setting up took longer than the actual tattoo. He made me feel comfortable, reassured me and explained what he was doing every time he did something new. I could not have been better taken care of. He was efficient and compassionate, telling me to relax and distracting me. \n\nAll in all, a great experience. Everyone is super friendly, the place is really relaxed but professional and I'd totally recommend MTL Tattoo to anyone who was looking to get something done. Thanks Tony!",,,informal

I had been communicating with Ali regarding possibly having an upcoming event at the resort.  She was extremely timely, helpful, and detailed in her email responses.

She gave us an outstanding and thorough tour of the Mandarin Oriental, which by the way is gorgeous!  Ali also followed up upon our return to see if there was any additional assistance she could provide.  \n\nAs far as the resort itself goes, the Mandarin Oriental is sophisticated and provides a quiet and relaxing atmosphere, among the hustle and bustle of Las Vegas, without being far removed.  it is definitely the best of both worlds.  \n\nAlthough, we ultimately decided to go in a different direction, we will definitely consider this resort for future events.  Hopefully, Ali will still be there!  She is sensational, a joy to meet, and represents the best of the Mandarin Oriental.  I would HIGHLY recommend working with her.",,,informal

I've tried maybe 6 or so of their dishes, and have yet to be disappointed. \n\nI haven't had a bad experience yet at this place. The service is always nice.

Needless to say we had plenty of leftovers.\n\nEven with the discount I spent a bit more than I had hoped, but everything was delicious and the service was great, as well.

Look forward to trying other dishes.\n\nAlso, I arrived at 5:00 pm on a Tuesday afternoon in mid-May, the bar seats were full for happy-hour and the restaurant had about seven 4-tops in play.

One of the better Creme Brulees I've ever had the pleasure of eating, and the indulgence platter is an astounding mix of brownies, cheesecake, ice cream, fruit, whipped creme, and these cheesecake spring rolls that were good enough to warrant a return visit all on their own.\n\nThe place is a sports bar, so you wouldn't expect to find gourmet food here, but give it a shot.

5,"I was a little skeptical about trying a fro-yo place because they are popping up all around the valley, but when I stepped in here, I knew this place was good. They are very inviting and the atmosphere is relaxing. I come in every time i'm in the neighborhood. Yummy flavors!",,,informal
5,"La Unica rocks. \n\nThe authentic tacos are awesome, there a $1.75...try one if you have never had one.  We almost always get the burrito Tuawana...also their ice tea is perfection mixed 1/2 sweet and 1/2 unsweetened.  Staff is AWESOME, some of best people I have ever meet.  To ME there is no doubt this is the best Mexican food in the Charlotte area.\n\nAlso, this is in a small strip mall...they also have signs to that read no meetings, no seating before all parties arrive...in other words \""we're too busy to seat you if your not ready....and please don't hang around because we are really busy...\""  (my interpretation)  GREAT FOOD!!!",,,informal
5,"Fun fun fun, a steakhouse cannot get as entertaining as this one. The bar scene in the center is very stylish, with great DJ spinning good music in the background, and yet the tables are set at a comfortable distance allowing for private conversations, STK is such energetic steakhouse fit for great food as well as people watching. I just love the vibe of this place!\n\nThe Green intensity martini is exicting, spicy and refreshing.\nThe tuna tartar was really yummy, especially love the chili oil on the side, really brings out the flavor of the tuna.\nThe baked bread with blue cheese butter was one of the best bread i have tasted in any restaurants, so innovative!\nThe filet medallion was done just right, i savored every bite of it.\nThe chimichurri sauce on the side was excellent.  \nParmesan truffle fries was good, but didn't really tasted the truffle.\n\nThis is the kind of place you would want to return again and again~",,,informal
5,"This course has been on my radar for awhile, but just a bit out of my price range, but I decided to make this a \""tax return splurge\"" for myself, and could NOT be happier with my decision!  Every hole is different.  The staff is excellent.  The greens, while a little marked up, putted true and very fast.  And at a rate of $110 from their own website (booked a week in advance and cheaper than golfnow, btw), it's a far better value than your standard North Scottsdale courses, and equal to, or superior in quality.  A couple negatives; sand was a bit compacted and a couple tee boxes were hard to find a level spot.  Also, if the ball gets into the desert, get a new one.  \n    I will play this one more time in \""season\"", and several times this summer.  Don't miss this.  It will eventually go totally private at some point.",,,informal
5,"This is our Sunday after-church destination. Phenomenal hummus, pitas, pizza, and wraps. We like the hummus trio with grilled chicken, add extra pitas and cucumbers. After that go with the mahi mahi. Our kids love the lavash pizza and red lentil soup. Get a half and half of the tropical and green iced tea and they'll always offer up a to-go cup on the way out. \n\nMy wife and I walked to the PJ in Tempe off Apache during college and now have one within biking distance again!

I am on a bit of a health kick, so I asked if they could serve one chicken kabob with a side of grilled veggies(not on the menu). The cashier was more than accommodating,  and said it wouldn't be a problem. A few minutes later, she brought out my food.  First i took a bite of the grilled veggies They were flavorful, and not too salty. Next came the AMAZING chicken kabob. With out a doubt,  the best I've ever had, and that's coming for a girl who loves Greek food. It was tender, juicy, and seasoned to perfection with herbs/spices from the heavens.  I scarfed it down in 5 minutes! To top it all off, the owner and his staff were friendly & make you feel right at home. I will definitely be a regular at this place. It's a ten: great prices, fresh ingredients, and awesome service. I'm thrilled that I found this gem in South Charlotte! :)",,,informal

I am happy with those two things, though their italian beef and hot dogs are good too.  \n\nMy one critique is that the meatball sub is hard to eat; it's more like two huge meatballs accompanied by some bread and sauce.  Maybe that's part of the charm?  It's distressing for me because I can never seem to walk away from this place without getting some red sauce on my shirt.  This is why I never wear white.",,,informal

So when my friend told me she was considering purchasing a Prada bag, I almost died (of envy). \n\nSo we went into the store and the sales associate Charles Punzal was the absolute sweetest. He was patient and pulled practically every color option of saffiano leather totes we asked for. Definitely made the selection process a lot easier on us, and we left with the most gorgeous, black purse. \n\nWould recommend coming here and asking for Charles to help you out if you're thinking about making the financial plunge into timeless happiness.",,,informal

5,"This place is fantastic! I've been there a few times for business lunches and everyone has always been happy. The pizzas are ample for one person or could be split if you also got a saled (which is huge). Everything looks and tastes fresh and I love that you can ask to have as much as you want piled on and it's still the same price. Although the line can back up at lunch (much like a Chipotle) since everything is made to order, the pizza is done in 3 minutes after being cooked in a hig-powered 550 degree oven. I don't think I've even had a problme finding any seatign even when the line is long. I actually think this pizza is better than 90% of pizza I've had elsewhere. To me, it's worthy of 5 starts. I just wish they had one right where I live.",,,informal
5,"This place ruined all other Chinese restaurants for me. Seriously. I've eaten everything here that I can pronounce and even a couple things I can't. \n\nThe absolute MUST from this place is the tofu flower with spicy Szechuan sauce. It comes with pork or chicken in a broth of dried, fried whole chilies. It is smaller than it used to be, but still quite a lot of food. Worth every bit of pain you will feel the next day. In fact, you'll probably grow to like it. I recommend you ask for a dish of steamed broccoli (not on menu) to incorporate with the dish. \n\nOther homeruns include the seafood sizzling rice, cumin beef, Szechuan peppercorn anything, green beans and pork and the shallot beef. All so very, very good. Remember, though, when they say cumin (or any other spice/flavor), they really, really mean it. \n\nRating Scale:\n1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  \n2 Star: Risky at best. \n3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.\n4 Star: I eat here regularly if financially and calorically feasible.\n5 Star: I'm comfortable taking other chefs here.",,,informal

5,"I am 100% confused by the one star rating on here. \n\nI'm a newbie bicyclist/triathlete and just trying to learn the ins and outs of bike maintenance. I knew my gears were being wonky and I suspected it was my derailleur but I know just enough to make an educated guess and then turn it over to someone that actually has a real clue. Being a newbie I was a bit worried about being taken advantage of or not being considered a \""real\"" biker with my 2nd hand Trek. \n\nI'm so glad I stumbled upon Espada's great reviews on Yelp. I easily found the shop right on North Davidson. Parking is like anywhere else in NoDa - sometimes easy, sometimes a pain in the ass. When you walk in you're in an art gallery/jewelry store/bike shop but no worries, bike shop in the back, easy to see. Steve isn't a huge chatter but he was able to take a look at my bike right away and I wondered around the shop as I waited. I asked some questions all of which he easily answered and his prices are beyond reasonable (I'd called around beforehand). I rode around yesterday and my bike is back in business. I never felt like he thought I asked a dumb question (I'm sure I did) and I certainly didn't feel like he tried to up-sale anything\n\nSo go support this local bike shop and check out the art while you wait.",,,informal

No where else can you go and have a personal mixologist, in a private setting, and in Las Vegas, or anywhere! \nI can't really begin to decribe every single detail in this place. The thought that went into it is incredible.  Everywhere you look you see something else to appreciate. I don't want to spoil anything. So all I can say is trust the reviews! \nI also have to give a shout out to the talented piano player that played for us, Spidoni (I hope I got that right). He is there on Wed night only. Great guy and plays beautifully. \nOne last thing. I would definitely recommend going early. There are very few seats anyway, but my husband and I sure enjoyed having Dan, just about all to ourselves!\nTruly the BEST experience and can't wait to return!",,,informal

5,"As a local, it would make ZERO sense for me to go to Planet Hollywood for a sandwich. So my 5 star rating shouldn't be misconstrued as me saying I would frequent them all the time, but rather based on convenience and price compared to what you typically find in a Las Vegas casino. At $6 you would be hard pressed to find a better sandwich on the Vegas strip. Is it the best sandwich I have ever had? Certainly not. However, with warm bread, tasty meat and relatively quick service... you can't beat Earl of Sandwich. Added bonus is that it is directly across from the Sports Book... grab a sandwich and go sit and watch a game. \nI agree with Misti that they have a major lack of options for not only bread but toppings and sauces. No oil and vinegar? How does a sandwich shop not have oil and vinegar?\nSandwich is not overly filling, which could be either good or bad depending on how you look at it. Heading to see Peepshow? Probably don't want to sit through that on an overstuffed stomach! Grab some Earl and you will be good to go!\nI order the Full Montague (I believe) which has turkey and roast beef. Consistently good and they have not messed up an order of mine yet.",,,informal
5,"Cornerstone is what one may call a \""Mega Church\"" and it is mega-sized for sure.  But the interesting thing I have found is that the size of the church actually enables it to be whatever you want it to be.  Sure, you could come to Sunday services every week for a year and never see the same person twice, but if you are looking for a deeper community, there is literally something for everyone.  Be it a class, small church, support group, or other gathering, you can find whatever is right for you for your place in life.  Or if it's the anonymity of a large church you're looking for, that's definitely possible... with smiling faces all around and a really great energy.\n\nCornerstone offers a coffee shop/cafe area, bookstore, a ton of volunteer opportunities, men's ministries, women's ministries, retreats, mission trips, top-tier worship leaders, sermons that dig in to the bible and provide real-life context, and thoughtful kids programs.\n\nYou can feel confident dropping your children off while you're at the service, because they will be cared for by background-checked, well-trained individuals ready to teach your kid the week's bible lesson!  Babies mere weeks old are welcome, and the older kids have fun activities every week.\n\nCheck out a service to see what it's all about, and stop by the information booths for further direction!",,,informal

They were two mini burgers of BEEF MEDALLION WITH FOIE GRAS, WILD MUSHROOM, ARUGULA AND TRUFFLE MAYO.  It was so good... It was a perfect portion too!\n\nOther burgers that I recommend are the Rising Sun and Duck Duck Goose.\n\nIt's casual, its comfortable, and definitely a perfect place to go to if you want to avoid bougie and expensive restaurants on the strip.

5,"So a few years ago my brother tells me this story about how a few high rollers from New York wanted their pool cabana catered by a local deli.  To make a long story short these guys wanted some of the best and authentic New York style deli and Italian food in Las Vegas.  \n\nSo we figure lets go check this place out. I'm proud to say that after about 5 years this is still one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas.  And that's not even with me getting to the food.  Julia and her family are the nicest, kindest,  sweetest people on this earth.  It doesn't matter if it's been a day, a week,  or a few months,  they take the time to chat with you.  Ask how the family has been and always have a smile on their faces. That awesome attitude translates into the food.  Fresh sauces made daily,  authentic New York style pizza,  garlic knots to die for,  and those rice balls.  When I first started going to Cugino's they weren't regularly available,  you had to ask or pre order them.  I always get the larger rice balls with the meat inside.  If you are eating in store ask them to heat it up and put some sauce and cheese on top. Everything from a basic plate of spaghetti to the linguini and clams is always top notch,  hot and amazingly fresh.",,,informal

For a couple of hungry people, the Sushi/Sashimi Omakase is a great value at about $36.  We also shared Age Dashi Tofu with Shrimp, served piping hot with an amazingly rich (almost beefy) dashi broth.  House sake is good.\n\nThis place has incredible atmosphere, and is a great 'night out on the town' place to go.  Decor is gorgeous and modern.  We were dressed pretty casual, but didn't feel under-dressed.  The sushi bar is fun and lively - and the prep line is impeccably clean and orderly.  Fish is fresh-fresh-fresh.

But today, right in the middle of a post Halloween funk/Sunday blues combo, I started to wonder if maybe I was slipped something last night, when Mr. Incredible who was there too, greeted me at Pink Spot. To protect his identity I won't say who it was, but the tomato, egg, bacon, avocado sandwich with chipotle mayo, sprouts and American cheese on wheat bagel he made me, truly hit the spot, and the mocha was just what I needed to lift me out of my forlorn state. It's a good thing they have free wi-fi here, because that's why I'm yelping. I'm going to go ahead and throw a solid five stars at these guys because they genuinely accomplished something that trumps, taste, price or ambiance; they served up a generous helping of good humor.

I shared the NY 16oz with the booface and I don't know if we were starving or if the steak was just THAT amazing but we couldn't stop salivating even at the last bite of medium rare heaven. I tried some of the other people's filets which which also mouth watering.\n\nThe sides (creamed spinach, potatos, asparagus, mac n'cheese) were also good though the meat was definitely the star of the show.\n\nOther mentionables: friendly service with a waitress with nice arms and strong cocktails. The price is hefty but you kinda realize that going to a place like this in Vegas.",,,informal

I like that they provide wine & beer pairings with each course.  Nice bar/lounge area where you can get a \""small plates\"" menu or anything off the regular menu.  I recommend the BBQ shrimp & salmon tartar apps.  They also have great seasonal soups.  For entrees I like the scallops, crispy skin bass & the steaks.  Sunday nights they have half off bottles of wine.  They also have many beer & wine dinners during the year.",,,informal
5,"I recently took NCT's level 1 Improv Workshop and I LOVED it.  My first class I awkwardly sat on stage and nervously laughed and couldn't come up with anything.  By the end of the class, I was kung-fu-ing my way to rescue Princess Miyuki with a prince who still lived with his parents.\n\nThe class focuses on the basics of Improv - listening, \""yes, and\"", relationships, responding emotionally and staying rooted in reality.  Dorian was able to provide consistent guidance and constructive criticism to move me forward as an actor.  The other students are equally awesome, as everyone is at least some form of funny.  \n\nI would recommend (and do recommend!) everyone I know at least take a level 1 improv class, and I love the people at NCT.  The skills I've gained from 6 weeks of workshop have already helped me become a better listener and improviser at work, as well as with friends.  Looking forward to more Improv with NCT in the future!",,,informal

I ordered the half sandwich and chicken and corn chowder it was so good, but I couldn't finish it because it was so filling, but not in a heavy greasy way - just very satisfied with a delicious meal.

5,"I will make this brief.   This is not just the best Scottish pub in Pittsburgh, this might be the best pub / bar / restaurant in Pittsburgh - period. \n\nFOOD\nLove the scotch eggs but the cardiologist said to only have these once a decade.  Stilton and Rasher salad is incredible.  Pub burger is the BEST!  Reuben and Fish & Chips are excellent.  Open face roast beef on italian bread covered with a dark/rich whisky onion gravy and a side of half-mashed red potatoes = ultimate comfort food.  So many other great options - you cannot go wrong!\n\nDRINK\nLove the beer list.  There is a focus on imports but they also have a dozen or so excellent PA craft beers on the list.   This place takes everything that they do seriously - the beer tastes fresh and the lines are clean.  If you are a fan of scotch whiskey, the list at Piper's Pub cannot be beat - http://piperspub.com/scotch/\n\nSOCCER / FOOTBALL\nFans of the beautiful game rejoice - you have found your home at Piper's Pub.

The place was packed, but while our server was available, her co-worker took our drink order & got us started. Our server was WONDERFUL. Seriously :) \n\nThe food was absolutely delicious. My daughter is a teen, & anyone who has teens knows that they are hard to please. I was a little worried that the menu would be a little too adult for her, but luckily that wasn't the case. She ordered the The Cabernet Burger with, what she calls, the perfect french fries :) , & I got the best Meatloaf Sandwich. To drink our server recommended a French lemonade to my daughter because I ruled out wine & she doesn't like dark sodas.

I came here with a friend at 10pm, frustratingly everything else in town seemed closed.\n\nI ordered a small falafel (\u00a33.50) but got a 10% student discount upon showing my university card, making it a \u00a33.15 falafel! The falafel looked as though it had not been previously frozen, the hummus was clearly homemade and the wraps were like the ones you get in Lebanon. The wrap was generously packed with salad, falafel and hummus and then toasted and conveniently wrapped in tin foil and a napkin.\n\nThe lighting inside is a bit dreary, as one expects when it comes to kebab shops, so we took the wraps home.

Even the hallway from the door to the bedroom is longer than my last apartment's.  We had a beautiful view of the pools.  The bedroom and living room are separated.  I can tell the casino was definitely decorated to appeal to Asians.  Everything is red and gold, with dragons, lucky dogs, and butterflies everywhere.

I love the arugula salad that comes under the dates.  They also give you bread and olive oil pesto dip.  That's a meal in itself.  We ordered the chicken chopped salad which was delicious!  We told the waiter that all four of us were going to share so he brought it out already divided in four bowls.  We also had the margarita flat bread and the sweet potato cannelloni that was to die for!  We also ordered the cheeseburger that was cut into four as well.

The tofu is organic non-GMO and everything I ordered was vegetarian. It was incredible! Fresh veggies, perfectly grilled tofu, and the sauce was spicy and flavorful. \n   My husband ordered a spicy tuna roll and the cucumber salad. He was very happy with the flavors.\n   My son (22 months) had the kids teriyaki chicken with noodles. The kids get the option of having a cookie or mandarin oranges. My son had the oranges. It also comes with a drink. My infant daughter passed on the food. ;-)\n  It's a sit down/take out place. You order at a counter and they bring the food to you. The service is speedy and the prices are good.\n   We were able to eat a delicious, healthy meal for about $20 for all of us. In a country where fast food has become a staple in many people's diet, Tokyo Joe's is a breath of fresh air. \n   If you eat meat you're covered. Pescatarian? They have fish. Vegetarian?

5,"A new benchmark has been set for pubs in Las Vegas. \n\nIn my initial review, I praised the amazing service and exceptionally friendly atmosphere of this hidden little gem on the western edge of town, but I also mentioned that the food was nothing to get excited about.\n\nWell that has all changed with Sagos new menu. I have two words - GREAT JOB!\n\nMoving the menu closer to the restaurants Baja theme, management has introduced a completely new menu filled with some great selections like fish and shrimp tacos, homemade pizza, a delicious chicken avocado sandwich, a new twist on the BLT with a tomato jelly that rocks and much more.\n\nIf you go, and you will, you have to try the Ceviche - cradled in what looked like a sea-shell shaped crisp flour tortilla, the taste is fabulous and the serving size to price ratio will fill you up but still make you want to order another.\n\nWay to go Sagos, you guys have hit all the marks now - great food, great service, great atmosphere. I'll be there - soon.",,,informal

5,"I recently stayed at the Cosmopolitan and had the best experience ever! Our room was beautiful and had the a great view of the strip. We can see the Bellagio fountain right below our balcony. I had so much fun that I accidentally left my beloved $230 Tory Burch sandals behind. I was sure I would never see them again. When I called the lost and found, the housekeeping lady actually turned them in! I was so happy I wanted to tip her, but they didn't know who turned them in. I must say, thank you Cosmopolitan for providing top quality service and having a very reputable and honest staff.",,,informal

5,"I've been seeing Meg now for probably close to a year for massages. She has treated me with massages ranging from lymphatic drainage to deep tissue. Every time I see her for a massage, I feel like a brand new person leaving the room. I really enjoy Meg as she gets to know her clients on a personal level prior to the massage, making the massage experience that much more personal. I would recommend Meg to anyone that wants an experienced massage therapist, who truly loves and enjoys what they do!!",,,informal
5,"This place truly could not be better. I came here for dinner with some family after reading some good yelp reviews. Upon entering, we were warmly greeted by the owner's father. He brought out chips & salsa for the table immediately and answered all of our questions about the menu. The food was insanely delicious - I had the CC Sizzle sopaipilla style. It was so good that I devoured the entire thing, which left me in a ridiculous food coma - but so so worth it. The rest of the family loved their meals as well. Before we left, the cook came out and placed warm sopaipillas covered in cinnamon on our table & said they were \""on the house\"". Once again, delicious. As we were leaving, we paid & tipped our lovely waiter. Much to our surprise, he did not even want the tip! After some insisting though, he did kindly accept. He went above & beyond to make his son's customers happy and that alone was enough to bring us back here. Try this place - you won't be disappointed!",,,informal

5,"I have no complaints here.  European-style shop for gourmet coffee and tea.  You can buy fresh-brewed coffee or beans and loose leaf tea in bulk starting with a 1/4 pound and up.  Besides that, the shop is crammed with coffee and tea supplies, candies, and chocolates.  Good prices.  Friendly, knowledgeable staff.\n\nI usually buy coffee, but the last time I went in for green tea and wanted to try something new.  The man who waited on me didn't know a whole lot about tea, so he did something amazing:  he found someone else who did!\n\nTip: Go on Thursday afternoons when Market Square has their farmer's market and pick up some fresh produce and pierogies, too.",,,informal

5,"With all the hype and great things said about this place, why wouldn't I try a little Good Fellas Grill.  In addition, I was looking for something a little on the healthy side, and this somewhat meets that criteria.\n\nOH MY GOSH!  Isn't that hummus and baba ganoush amazing?  The owner split our plate in half so we could enjoy this excellent dip.  It packed flavor, freshness, and a delicious spread on top of my pita.  The wifey and I were not able to finish it, and I would have to be so bold to say that it even tasted better the following day.  No way?  Oh yes way, my friend!\n\nThere is a ton of hype on the lentil soup, but I would have to say the potato soup had more flavor and was definitely more hearty than the lentil.  Therefore, I would highly recommend trying the potato as well.\n\nThe wifey had salad wraps while I had the 2 meat combo.  Since my wife did not share the wraps, I am sure they were delicious, as she kept them to herself.  The 2 meat combo is like the combo punch and kick you would see watching old school batman with the words saying, \""bam, pow, or crunch!\""  Meaning, the meat, the chicken, with the rice, onions, and tomato make for a treat for excitement.\n\nIt definitely lives up to its hype and adds on to another great Greek Restaurant in Phoenix!  We will see you again!",,,informal
5,"I love, love, love me some  Oregano's and I'm so glad I live just a few miles away. Their salads, their sandwiches, appetizers, pizzas and pizookie dessert are all amazing. Serious grub, very affordable, huge portions, a fun atmosphere, super friendly wait staff...this place has it all.\n\nThe only negative I have ever had is just a personal preference. If you are in a mellow mood or looking for something more romantic on a date night, this isn't the spot. It's LOUD and pretty cramped full of tables, people and antique 'stuff.' Fun if you are in a social mood and don't mind your personal space being invaded often.",,,informal
5,"Great tourist attraction. feature shops, botquies, night clubs, art museums, Good Luck with finding a place to park. I highly recommend valet.\n\nThere is so much history in Old Town.

That is another great perk about old down many local shops and boutiques with a variety of things to enjoy.",,,informal
5,"My boyfriend and I took a last minute trip to Vegas, and based on reviews, made a reservation at Cut.  We were not disappointed.  From the moment we walked through the door the service was friendly, accommodating, and attentive from the hostesses, to the bartender, to our two waiters.  Wine choices were on par. Nice, simple decor.  Excellent presentation and recommendations on types of steak.  Did not skimp on the bread (which unfortunately we took full advantage of).  We shared the American Wagyu Beef porterhouse for two and it was possible the BEST steak I have ever had.  Cooked to perfection.  Sides of mac and cheese and caramelized cauliflower also did not disappoint.  We finished with a huge and yummy chocolate souffl\u00e9.  The whole experience was a delight.  Great meal, great atmosphere, great service.  You can't ask for much more.  We definitely made the right choice with this restaurant.",,,informal

I was out all night and was too tired to go out for lunch with my friends, but they were kind enough to bring me an Earl's Club back. It was probably a good hour or so by time they ordered it to the time they brought it back to me, but the sandwich was still warm and delicious! I can't imagine how much better it would be fresh! For $6, this is a freaking steal compared to a lot of the more expensive food options in Vegas. Couple that with the fact that it's open 24 hours, and this place is money.",,,informal

We did some shopping on the strip and we we passed again at 10 there was a huge line waiting to get in.  Our food was fresh and delicious.   All the toast and French toast is made from fresh Mancini bread.  Pancakes were awesome too.  Service is fast and friendly for how busy they are.  Get here early and make a nice little morning out of it like we did.,,,informal
5,"This is our kind... a real winner-the most godly breakfast burrito I've ever had!! and FRESSSSSHHHHH made with their own special salsa. Love the urban decor indoor, and you see a mexican grandma cookin' it up in the kitchen-you know you're in good hands. We had to wait for a while for our food, but that was good news to us=ignore the whiners who demand the food fast. It meant that they were cooking everything from scratch. It's important that chefs invest their time and love in their food, and it reflected through my first \""ahh, this is heavenly\"" bite of the burrito. I'm so happy I found this place!! I plan on buying their El Sol salsa. Always follow the traditional mexican bakery-guaranteed you will get authentic mexican dish. Not only El Sol was an exciting discovery, but downtown Chandler is a very cute n historic area to scope out! It's filled with many other mexican joints, which I'm sure are delicious. I look forward to going back to that area!\n\nThis beats Los Favoritos. Period.",,,informal
5,"Vegas is a foodie town, and Aria has a lot of wonderful restaurants.  If you ask me, Julian Serrano is the best restaurant in Aria and it's one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas.\n\nI LOVE THIS RESTAURANT.  \n\nService is top-notch and fast.  For a party of 14, I was worried about the wait time for food.  No need to worry, they know what they're doing!  Food started coming out almost immediately.  Tapas are a terrific option for large groups.  The pace of dishes coming out was perfect.  Also our waiter was able to split up the bill (we ordered in groups of 3 to 5 people).  \n\nFinally, the food.  It's excellent!!  Everything is amazing but I particularly recommend the calamari, which is among the best I've ever eaten.  Other notable dishes include the salmon, the risotto, croquetas, peppers, papas bravas.\n\nYou simply cannot go wrong eating here.",,,informal
5,"Best red curry I've had in a long time!! Seriously I am salivating just thinking of it. And if you ask for it extra spicy, oh boy will they make it hot! I love going in for their lunch special. For $7.50 you get soup, 2 wontons, an egg roll, and an entree with rice. Good prices, good service, and excellent red curry. Their orange chicken is also very good, but I can never bring myself to order anything besides the red curry because it is so freakin' good. My one complaint is they serve sweet and sour as the dipping sauce for the egg rolls when I prefer the sweet chili sauce many Thai places serve instead.",,,informal
5,"Consistently the best customer service around. Needed new rear tire a while back. No up sells, just options for my budget and needs. Today in for a flat repair.

After about a year later, I slowly got the courage to give Rochelle's Salon another chance, but only for a blow dry and style. We kept dating like this for a while. They referred me to Abel who did a great job and eventually, the relationship progressed and I now trust him to cut my hair and color it. I love Rochelle's and am now a loyal girlfriend. Abel is great, creative, easy-going, and very accommodating as most my appointments are last minute. In addition, he's great at giving dating advice-NOT, but it's hilarious to hear his escapades being a straight hairstylist. Scandelous. Liz at the front desk has a great memory, too!",,,informal

While I've only been there once and can't speak to the quality of all the items listed, my friend had a tea she enjoyed, a panini that she said was delicious; and I had the side salad that was excellent for only $4.99.  They are also giving away free donuts with purchase to promote their opening and I thought it was very tasty.\n\nTheir menu includes salads, sandwiches, paninis, deserts/pastries/donuts and coffee/espresso.  \n\nI will definitely go back - great location, lovely inside, and a great offering of foods.",,,informal

We all got mimosas and our server offered to just grab us a bottle since it would be the same price ($5/each). Yum! I had looked up reviews before going and was all about ordering the bruschetta but my friends were feeling the brunch items. Everything looked so tasty! I ordered the prosciutto and Brie panini and chips. Oh my gosh soooo very flavorful!!! It was in the sweet side due to the fig but so many flavor profiles in each bite! I can't wait to come again.

Yes, we have been back and it is just as good and we will be back again and again as long as our stomachs don't explode from the massive amount of food you get on the plates they serve you. Hot dog they call them here but they are the largest hot dogs I have ever seen and cooked to a plump juicy temp with an awesome bun.

The soups in particular just warm you up inside. \n\nPad thai here is also exceptional and come with plenty of meat.\n\nI ordered catering here for a large party and it was incredibly competitive pricing plus they delivered the order such a convenience.\n\nGreat place to bring people great date place too the decor is very nice and there is a great drink/happy hour menu. While not alcoholic, I do recommend their thai ice tea if you like sweeter beverages. \n\nReally cannot speak more highly about this place, but there is a small warning if you are not a fan of spicy foods make sure you order yours MILD. Even some dishes when ordered mild will have a kick and medium to hot dishes can have quite the lingering burn, but I could just be a wuss. Order the sweet ice tea in case and the spice won't be a problem you can't handle.",,,informal

King Crab Legs... Delicious  \nPrime Rib - Nice and pink.. just the way I like it .  It was seriously a meat fest at the Wynn. \n\nBe sure not to get too bogged down by the fillers (i.e.  bread, pasta, rissoto bar)\n\nThe wait was a good hour 15, but that was expected especially when we were arriving at 6ish.

I love how everything is made fresh daily and the fries are cut in the store. The one thing I don't like is how it seems everyone in Phoenix seemed to be at this location when I was there. I guess the fact that it was the day after Christmas and that it's near Paradise Valley Mall didn't help that. We couldn't find a table so we tried eating outside, but it was way too cold and windy (I was visiting from Cleveland, so I was shocked at the cold weather) so we ate in our car in the parking lot. It was worth it though. Hands down In N Out is one of the best burger places in America. Now they just need to come to the Great Lakes region.",,,informal

5,"I usually wouldn't review a theatre, but I really need to brag about a manager (Aries). He is an amazing person that reminded me there's still people out there we can be thankful for this holiday season. My husband, daughter, and I drove from California to visit friends & family for Thanksgiving, but wanted to catch the \""Frozen\"" movie the day before (Wed). During our drive I called AMC Theatre's number and asked a nice lady if they still had the $5 special they use to have Mon-Thurs. She said yes except for holidays. I asked her if today counts as a holiday cause it's so close to Thanksgiving, she said no. It will still be $5/ticket. I was so happy ... Until I got to the theatre to purchase tickets. The young boy said it would be $29.90 for all of us. I was shocked cause I mentioned the $5 special I talked to a lady on the phone about just that morning. He suggested asking his manager, Aries. When the manager came out, he immediately apologized to us & handed us our tickets ... for FREE! My husband and I looked at each other shocked cause that's the last we expected. I wanted to hug him!!! \n\nThank you Aries for making our family night out a memorable one :)",,,informal

5,"Truly an Authentic Chinese experience. It' looks like a Panda Express from the outside. Inside is a whole new story. Bunch of Chinese waiters running around. There's the infamous cliche of a fishtank. When we got here we were seated next to the fishtank. And fish were looking at me.....So I ordered one. Fried. With a black bean and spicy garlic sauce. Teach that fish to look at me....Grrrrr\nBut in reality. You can order chinese food on the menu. I like things off the menu that only the cool asians know. So my advice - learn some chinese food that's not americanized with sugar and sweetness. And order off the \""cool secret menu\"".\n\nUpdate 6/2/08\nSEE I FUCKIN TOLD YOU - BEST CHINESE! EVER!",,,informal
5,"Another favorite in Vegas definitely the best Indian in town! I've been to the lunch buffet and the a la carte dinner. While the buffet is certainly worth the price I love coming for dinner so that I can order exactly what I want! \n\nThe garlic naan is a MUST. And I recommend it with some plain yogurt on the side! For main courses I really love the lamb (or vegetable) korma and the chicken tiki masala. I get both on medium (5) level and it still has a good amount of spice!! I'd say those two sauces are my favorites since I've tried others that are not as memorable to me. I don't love the chicken tikka but probably only because I'm a big sauce girl! I also really enjoy the okra vegetable dish! Full of flavor!\n\nThough the talk of slow service is true I'd say the food is too good to pass up and don't mind the service. I also like to finish my meal with a chai tea at the end. Overall great place eating so many delicious spices just makes me feel very warm and calm on the inside I would definitely consider this \""comfort food\""",,,informal

Its the perfect combination of 2 of my favorite things: beautiful people and (midwest) sports.  \n\nBelly up to the bar in the middle of the restaurant for the best people and sports watching seats in the house--there are a ton of TVs so you wont miss a minute of your favorite games, even if youre cheering for more than one team at a time.  \n\nThere are pool tables for your entertainment at half time, and a private room in the back where I once got way too saucy at a company gathering.  \n\nDJs are mixing the latest during commercials of REALLY big games, and Fox Sports broadcasts right in the bar from time to time.  \n\nPrices are Scottsdale par and the food is upscale bar.  \n\nBe sure you shower and put on your best jersey, there are some seriously good looking sports fans at Fox Sports and hell, you might even be cheering for the same team.",,,informal
5,"I lived in Tucson for 16 wonderful years, leaving with my three children, new husband and two stepchildren in 2002 for New York. New York is wonderful in many ways, but truly is lacking in true authentic Mexican food. And there is no fooling my family. So when I come back to Arizona to visit my family here, the first thing I want is authentic Mexican food. Since my parents and sister live in Apache Junction, we find our fix at Los Tacos. The place is immaculately clean, the staff courteous and genuinely kind. I think we'd have a longer conversation if I spoke Spanish but their English is just fine. The food is cooked to order, the tortillas homemade. There is a salsa bar with salsa fresca, roasted hot peppers, spiced carrots, salsa verde and a nice chipolte salsa. I am not sure if they serve coffee as they are always so kind to let me bring in my morning addiction, Starbucks Vente. My son, who came on this trip with me, wakes each morning to walk the two miles to Starbucks and then a few steps more to Los Tacos. What a wonderful way to start the day. I can't recommend them high enough. Definitely worth the four mile walk each morning.",,,informal

5,"This new development I believe is a success! There's tons of people coming in and spending their money in what used to be a parking lot. From random eateries and retailers, you're sure to find something you'll want. I particularly like the layout and the designs of the shops as well as the high roller attraction that boasts being the tallest eye In the sky on the west coast. I will return for sure whether it's to dine or people watch or even play. If the goal was to keep people close and on only Caesars Properties then I think it worked. Kudos to the architects and developers and whoever brainstormed the idea. People hop a from the Linq Hotel and Casino to the Flamingo to Harrahs and so forth keeping their money all on this side of the strip. Nice thinking",,,informal

The bartender, Mike, was super awesome and friendly. He made me an Irish Mule even though they didn't have ginger beer on had. He worked some magic with real ginger, ginger ale and other things and the drink was even better than a normal mule with real ginger beer. \n\nThey had a piano player who kept asking us for requests, and he was able to play any song we listed, including songs by JT, Foo Fighers, Kanye West, etc. It's cute little place with a speakeasy feel. The bartenders are obviously very talented mixologists. There's a beautiful patio right out on the promenade as well. I'll be back!",,,informal

I just moved to az and as any woman knows trying to find someone to do a Brazilian wax is a pretty anxious experience but right when I met her I felt comfortable. She knows exactly what she is doing and from someone that has been waxing over 12 years I can say she is the best! I have very sensitive skin and have always left everywhere else with some soreness/sensitivity and today I left without any of that. She was quick and efficient. I also got a facial as I bought her yelp deal and she also did a fantastic job on that. No need for me to look any further I have found my regular estetician!

For purposes of this review, I'll focus on my experience since becoming a tenant.  As others have stated, the complex itself is fantastic - great grounds, pools, apartments and location.  However, it is the staff which necessitated I leave a five-star review.  I have been a serial renter and have found the staff at The Dakota to be top notch and 2nd to none.  I have leaned on them heavily and admittedly, have been demanding at times.  Whether it is picking up my weekly deliveries or setting high expectations in terms or my service requests, they have always gone out of their way to accommodate me, show proper urgency and handled with professionalism and a welcoming demeanor.  If you're in the market for a new place and want to know more than what brochures and websites convey, have confidence in the team here.  Cheers -",,,informal

I'm a big fan of thin crust pizzas and this place might be one of the best. \n\nThe restaurant is pretty small but I loved the atmosphere of this place and the beautiful brick exterior of the restaurant was my favorite! We almost didn't come because we didn't want to have a long ridiculous wait, but I'm so glad we decided to come anyway. Luckily, we went there after the lunch rush around 2pm so we got seated in less than 10 minutes! \n\nThe service was great and the pizza was amaaaazingly delicious! We devoured our pizzas in silence cus it was that good hahaha. I'm actually craving it quite a bit as I am writing this review.... everything about the pizza was perfect! It was a 10/10!! :D We got the Margherita and the Wiseguy pizza. The toppings were extremely fresh and I loved the smokiness of the crust from the wood-fired oven. Wish we got to try all the other signature pizzas as well. The pizzas are a bit pricey compared to the size, but I think it was worth it :)",,,informal

I had my haircut scheduled with Vanessa and she was punctual on time. I was looking for a trim on my layers and a polished look - and it was done! After that I had asked Vanessa if she had room for a walk-in service right after me, as my mother was looking to get her hair cut (she had gotten it colored at another salon the same day, and it was her day off, so she doesn't have a lot of time on her hands). Luckily Vanessa was able to accommodate her the same day and we both came out with gorgeous, fresh hair cuts done!

All of the books are beautifully displayed and I have to admit, seeing original copies of The Moomins, Peter Pan and Where The Wild Things Are made me feel quite misty-eyed for my own childhood. \n\nIf your little Jack or Janet already has enough children's books, OCB also sells a small selection of adorable prints and comic books. Personally however, I'd opt for one of the illustrated editions of Alice in Wonderland or Wizard of Oz. They look and read beautifully and are sprinkled with magic!",,,informal

I highly recommend the Fettucine ala George, a marvelously tasty appetizer as is the lobster bisque.

I should have started earlier, so I would be done and over with the removal process. \n\nAfter searching numerous times online, and price comparing. I decided to go on GROUPON, searched for laser tattoo removal and landed on \""Erased Laser Tattoo Removal.\"" \n\nThey offer great rates at a discounted price! I was a little skeptical, but glad I stumbled on their website. Even without the groupon, they still offer good rates! I had a free consultation and started the treatment the same day! Estimate completion is 4 sessions, 3 more to go! I can already see cleared up spots after a few hours (don't know if that's possible, but it sure happened to my tattoo). It varies from person to person, because no one tattoo is the same.\n\nI recommend this place, very professional, straight forward, and clean! It's always a great view if the establishment is clean, makes you feel safe to move forward with the process.\n\nGlad I came here!

We both happily demolished them immeditately. Both Carol, the owner, and the young guy working the register were pleasant and conversational. Carol seemed to make fast friends with every customer who walked in, making sure to check on them and ask their names. One unusual thing about Zookz is the addition of a small sink at the beverage counter. This is so useful for dumping out leftover ice and liquids and rinsing plastic containers before you place them in the recycle bin next to it. \n\nOh, and they have punch cards! 10th sandwich is free!

Phil was the one that looked over my truck and was very honest. Said that he wouldn't recommend the rack & pinon replacement because the leak was dried up, no wet dirt. Plus most rack & pinon do leak at first. He also said that the sensor was not bad and that the thermostat was the issue and that I did need a radiator since it was leaking.\nIn all, the write up was very reasonable and I went ahead with the work.

With Bear by my side, she sampled different foods and treats and I was able to see right there what she liked or didn't like.

We all had a fun time trying to create our own masterpieces, and everyone walked away with an awesome canvas painting that we were proud of! \nDina herself is extremely friendly and accommodating.

5,"THE place to go on Madison's North Side.  Roomy, beautiful decor, family-operated, friendly staff.  The pastries are good, the bread and rolls are excellent, and the brunch and lunch menus are amazing!  There are lots of good vegetarian options, all clearly marked.  The Earthly Delights sandwich is my favorite--wow.  The soups and salads are also very, very good.\n\nMy only complaint is Manna's coffee, which is sometimes thin and over-extracted.  People who don't have a taste for good espresso may not mind (my Mom likes it fine), but I have to order a mocha or flavor syrup to cover up the bitter taste, and the texture of the mocha simply does not compare to what you'll get at the cafes on the square.  Still, it's probably the best coffee on the North Side.",,,informal

She never makes me feel bad for what I did and she is willing to work with us who can't afford regular salon coloring visits and attempt to do it ourselves. She has been in the business 50 years and she knows her chemistry. I hear she is great with African American hair as well. Check her out.",,,informal
5,"Honestly, I'm not sure what to expect when eating at Hooters. So far, so good, thus, the 5 stars.  But, I do have one minor issue with them, but not enough to downgrade them.\n\nEating here is what I imagined the 70's to be about.  Wood paneling, that weird color orange, and a little bit of tackiness thrown in for good measure.  So far, when eating here, I have had good experiences.  The girls are nice, the place is clean, and service seems to be prompt and efficient.  I usually can be found here during lunch hour only, and so far, those have been my only experiences.  No happy hour, no dinner, no weekend service.\n\nMy only \""complaint\"" is that I have carried out a few times from this location.  A handful of times, I felt like I have had terribly slow carry out service. Waiting forever for someone to take my order, waiting just as long for food, and feeling \""less important\"" then maybe the dine in patrons.",,,informal
5,"A must-stop over when you're in the Phoenix area. Best southern food i've ever had! Far better than Roscoe's hands down. Their fried chicken is nicely seasoned. Not too much batter so when you bite into it, you're getting the right amount of crunch without the doughy taste. And it's juicy too! Even the breast. Their house made hot sauce is perfect on everything. I also ordered the biscuits and gravy. Biscuits were soft and fluffy and the gravy was legit too! And the service we got was really good. Def coming back when i get another chance.",,,informal

5,"One of my absolute favorites in CU, Courier Cafe is the best place to relax and get some delicious American food. Old fashioned soda fountain favorites like phosphates and malt shakes make this place unique, but nearly everything is good. Sandwiches are on fresh bread,  and burgers are thick and hearty. There are a lot of vegetarian options- my favorite is the pesto grilled swiss on sourdough. I also love the ham melt on a fresh croissant. For dessert I recommend sharing a headliner, a monstrously delicious sundae drenched in hot fudge.\n\nFor the quality of food you get, this place is actually a bargain. I'd prefer it over most of CU's \""fine dining\"" establishments any day. Service can be slightly slow, but overall this is one of my favorite places to enjoy after a difficult test or a arduous paper-writing spree.",,,informal
5,"This was a nice surprise and definitely a hidden gem in my opinion.  My friend and I tried this place on a whim because she heard they had good fried pickles.  Am I ever glad we stopped in!  The drinks are especially unique and it's a nice change from the typical Freemont Street spot to grab a snack.  Definitely more upscale than the usual with friendly staff, good food and unusual (and very delicious) cocktails. Drink prices are average to the other bars nearby, but the quality is much better.  If you're going to spend $8 for a cocktail on Freemont you'll get a better drink here than at the frozen drink stand down the road.  We had a couple of appetizers, a couple of cocktails and some good conversation with Chris, our waiter.  Definitely recommended!  I will be stopping here for sure next time I'm in Vegas.",,,informal

The bar staff was very friendly and I was happy to find out they had some awesome deals for happy hour.  I tried their shrimp and eggplant appetizer and it was amazing.  I'm not usually a big veggie guy but between the shrimp and sauce this dish is delicious.  The bread was warm and fresh and I ended up using too much of it to sop up the sauce from the appetizer dish and made myself full.  Can't wait to come back and try more.,,,informal

With the season pass we paid only $10 more than the day pass and got free parking for the season. \n\nYes the lines can be long and yes the food is really expensive but that is why you plan ahead.  Go on a day that makes more sense to be there and you can stay late, weekdays and Friday/ Saturday are the best we found.  Friday and Saturday because they close at 10 and you can beat a lot of the long lines.  \nBring a cooler and keep it in the car, that helps on prices of food.  \n\nI really don't understand all of the complaints.

This is one of those places that I've heard alot about and couldn't wait to stop and have a brew. It did not disappoint either. It is the, umm, hipster, artfag, freaks and geeks place? If your clothes rarely match by accident or design, this is your place. A typical dive bar with some great local art adorning the walls, kickass jukebox and a pool table. Now that I've also finally been to First Friday, it seems the two go hand in hand. I love when I get to go there.

Fresh squeezed juices and high end teas.  I've never experienced this at any other buffet.  \n\nThe food was very high quality at such a low price!  I ate chilean sea bass and roasted bone marrow the most!  The chefs will adjust and make any of the dishes the way you want it.  Everything was cooked to perfection!  All the food were artfully presented in their own miniature plating.  The dessert bar was so good!  I love gelato, apple pie, and bread pudding.  \n\nIf you love buffets, you must try this place!

My credentials are: 10 years back of the house fine dining experience and 6 years dining professionally as a fine wine distributor.\nI've never had a bad meal at The Parlor and generally find myself talking for days about whatever the latest seasonal menu item I've tried is. That said, any restaurant  is destined to have an inconsistency now and then...  It's just never happened to me here. \nLet me get to the point. I'm a very adventurous eater but now and then when I find a classic dish that is executed in superb fashion, I'll fall back to it time and time again.\nTHE PARLOR MAKES THE BEST CAESAR SALAD IN THE VALLEY. It's such a simple preparation yet somehow 95% of valley restaurants do something to screw it up. They either deconstruct it and make it a chore to eat or put there own twist on it that completely takes it out of the realm of what a caesar salad is. How arrogant. \nToo all other PHX restaurants: Just because you use romaine doesn't make it a Caesar. \n\nLesson:\n\nCaesar Salad = Chopped or torn Romaine hearts, Creamy parmesan and anchovy emulsion, fresh toasted (and seasoned) croutons and some shaved Parmigiano Reggiano.\n\nTHANK YOU PARLOR PIZZERIA FOR KEEPING IT REAL!",,,informal

My credit was not so good at the time, but they did give me the loan, as well as a subsequent one, both of which helped to improve my credit.  Everyone working here is super nice as they know that the members own the credit union, rather than a bank where investors own it.  The location is convenient - right off of 77 at Tyvola.  The coolest thing they have done recently is eliminate the need for deposit and withdrawal slips if you make transactions inside the branch.  Also, you can make deposits for other local credit u ions here which is nice.\n\nOn the rare occasions I have to call and talk to somebody, I talk to someone with a southern accent rather than someone from halfway around the world that I can barely understand.

The service was also prompt, and the gal who walked my order out to my car was super friendly! Prices were very reasonable as well! This experience sure beats out the long line, hasty service, tiny over-priced cups of joe, and hard pastrys, at your local chain Starbucks.

Her friendliness, dedication, and skill are unmatched. \n\nI started taking my dress pants here to be taken up almost 8 years ago when I was still in school at Ye Olde UW.

There's about half a dozen different meat stations, which you line up at and order, then you pay at the register.\n\nThe Adobada (Spicy Pork) was so good that as soon as I finished, I lined up  and ordered some more.  At the Adobada station, you'll see stacks and stacks of marinated spicy pork roastin on a spit, with a pineapple at the top.  The pork is shaved off the spit to order \n\nMy next favorite was the Suadero (Beef Shoulder), which you'll find at the station with the big pot of beef stewing away.

We were seated in a booth that had its own flat-screen TV.  It was off and the hostess offered to turn it on.  While we appreciated how it would be good for sports fanatics, we opted for a non-TV dinner.  \n\nI love that the burger choices at Kickstand are unique.  They offer interesting flavor combinations.  My partner ordered the Cycle Zydeco Burger (Zydeco spread, Mardi Gras slaw, and Root Beer glaze).  It wasn't too spicy for him, and he's not a big fan of too much heat.   I, on the other hand, love spicy stuff, but went with the Greek Burger as a change of pace.  It had kalamata olive spread, tzatziki sauce, and feta, three of my favorite things to eat.  The sauce really made the burger.  The burgers themselves were juicy and flavorful, too.   \n\nThere were also a lot of sides to pick from.  We both opted for the combo tater tots/sweet tater tots side item.  The regular tater tots were good, and the sweet (potato) tater tots came with a butter/brown sugar syrup for dipping.  It was literally like dessert.  What a great offering.  \n\nWith the food, atmosphere, and service being great, what wasn't to enjoy?

5,"Fantastic bagels. I have never had better in my life--not even in any of the seven local bakeries we visited in NYC. I've had at least one bagel every week since it's opening, and each one is just as delightful as the first. It goes without saying that their bagel sandwiches perfectly complement the bagel itself (might I suggest a jalape\u00f1o bacon bagel with egg, pepperjack cheese, sausage, peppers, onions, tomatoes, and jalape\u00f1os?). \n\nWhile the pastries are all delicious, the chocolate croissant is truly exceptional--the type where you promise yourself you'll have one...and then stop reordering after your fifth.",,,informal
5,"Reasonable prices for great service (I'm usually out the door for $26 total).  These guys won't let you sit around too long.  If you want to talk, they'll talk - sports, women, whatever.  If you don't want to converse, then you can watch one of the TVs they have at each chair.\n\nEach regular cut ends with a straight edge shave and hot or cold towel, as well as a quick machine massage.  Good guys here, well worth a few extra bucks over going to Cost Cutters etc.",,,informal
5,"Wow, never have I though that pub food could be this delicious. Cornish Pasty Co. is by definition a hole in the wall well worth driving too from any where in the valley if you are seeking simple, affordable and downright deliciously satisfying food.\n\nThe menu is impressively varied, from typical, premium to signature pasties. I went with the lamb vindaloo and its spiciness left me goofy with delight.\n\nThere is no host/hostess at the entrance, so you can either seat yourself at the bar, and you can even hang your purse from underneath the counter!\n\nThe service is warm, friendly and efficient. Dinner for two without drinks was a bargain at $ 25.",,,informal
5,"First time impression was awesome! Sat down as soon as I walked in, the server came right over and asked me what I'd like to drink and if I know what i want already! They must have a lot of regulars that come her for a quick good meal and go. Great business. I ordered the special, whatever it was it was fantastic. Fries were yummy and crunchy. Everything is great here, I look forward to being a regular. It's super close to my company's office!",,,informal

5,"There are only a few stores that I can spend hours in.  There are certain stores I don't like to bring my wife with me also.  Harbor Freight Tools is that place.  I get the flyers in the mail and start my wish list.  It's like when a a kid gets the Toys R Us catalog.  \n\nOne has to approach Harbor Freight Tools a little different.  Are you a professional contractor that has multiple jobs weekly?  Well then this place probably isn't for you.  You might want to spend a few bucks more to get some better power tools. Are you the weekend warrior or the DYI home owner?  Then, this is your place.  They have a lot of great tools that won't be used all the time, but will get the job done. These tools won't break you wallet either.  I have purchased some specialty tools here that I needed for certain jobs and they were great.  I have also purchased a cordless power drill that was a piece of garbage and waste of money.  \n\nThe trick is to go see the quality of the tool and then see how often you will use it.  If you only need it a few times and it's pretty cheap, then get it!  Overall this place is awesome.  I love going here and finding some great deals.  You have to come check this place out.

Wow! Made it there in less than 10 minutes he pulled the vehicle out that he was working on And pulled mine in.

The staff is dressed very authentically Japanese and loves to interact with their clientele.\nThe food was amazing. I had fried oysters, which are brought out in the shell. There were 5 or 6 on my plate and they were huge and oh so good. They tasted fresh and were excellently fried. My wife got the sashimi variety platter which looked and tasted fantastic. I really have nothing negative to say about this place. Our bill was approx $60 for 2 entrees, two appetizers, twos soups and salads. It was a very nice experience and date!",,,informal

The receptionist called me back after talking to the owner and he said he would personally show up as long as I didn't mind it being a little later.  He showed up right at 9pm and took care of the issue.  Everything has been great!,,,informal

It was clean, I enjoyed the setup and the dim lighting\n\nFood - Excellent! There were so many options on the menu it was hard to chose, they also had a vegetarian friendly menu. Huge portions, great value, and the food itself was amazing. Food is spicier than most thai places, they warn you, so make sure you don't get anything over a 3 if you only want mild spice.\n\nService - Our server was great. Very friendly, helpful and quick. My boyfriend was clearly struggling with his Pad Thai (which was a level 5 spice) but, we weren't going to ask for a new one or complain, but the server offered to make him a new one. It was a very kind gesture.\n\nWill be back!",,,informal

5,"I decided to make New Year's Eve reservations here based on the reviews I'd read on Yelp and my girlfriend and I both walked away impressed.  We were a little late for our reservations, but still had no problem being seated immediately as the restaurant was only about half full.  We were promptly greeted by our server Christy who was very attentive throughout the evening and was also helpful in drink selections for my girlfriend.\nAfter ordering our drinks, we started with the cheese plate appetizer with 3 cheeses - a brie, a cheddar and a third called Red Dragon (which I really enjoyed). In addition to the cheese and bread, the plate also came with candied pecans and a honey \""jelly\"" that really worked well with the cheeses.  The cheese plate was a nice starter as it wasn't overly filling, but there was plenty for two people.\nFor our mains, my girlfriend ordered the apple and brie salad with grilled chicken and I ordered the sea scallops large plate.  Both dishes were excellent - her chicken and my scallops were both cooked perfectly.  The sweet potato hash and celery slaw that came with my scallops was also delicious.  We both left feeling fulfilled, but not stuffed which was nice. \nThe experience at Table 274 was a great start to our night and we'll definitely be returning soon.  Great job Table 274!",,,informal
5,"Really really really great place to eat.  Nothing is greasy, and everything tastes fresh.  Slow roast short ribs are the best I have ever tasted.  Ahi sashimi salad is a full blown meal.  Portions are very generous and prices are more than reasonable.  The restaurant is very nice too, very classy, and staff are very polite and attentive.  I also recommend the bbq salmon if they have it.  Very moist with great flavor.\n\nAlthough it looks like a cookie cutter chain, don't let the applebees look fool you.  This place is first class without being first class expensive and it totally has no snotty-ness in it.  Did I mention how good the food is?  \n\nFriends tried the filet-mignon and they said it was the best they have ever had.  Perfectly cooked just as they asked for.  This coming from a  world traveler and self proclaimed steak lover this says a lot.",,,informal
5,"Every time I visit this place, it just gets better. \n\nFirst, their selection keeps expanding. As a Gibson and Orange lover, I am in heaven walking into this place. Decent selection of used stuff as well (was sad to NOT see the Ibanez lawsuit les paul rip off in there this last time, but hope that means it sold!). \n\nBy far the best atmosphere of any music shop in town. Has a very \""Chicago Music Exchange\"" vibe, with couches and chairs set up in classy little arrangements, wood floors, and bare brick walls. It definitely has the feel of a higher end boutique shop, which is cool. Contrast that with the fact that the staff is extremely unpretentious, affable, and inviting. Everytime I've been in there, the employees have repeatedly asked if I want to play anything (which... yes, I want to play everything). Short haired blond lady, small shaved head guy, and taller brown haired guy all just seem completely approachable and like they're as happy to talk shop as I am. Love the staff there.\n\nOverall, this is a shop that I hope sticks around. I will definitely be making the effort to abstain from the online giants in favor of supporting these guys.",,,informal
5,"We had a terrific experience here with Dr. Soltero. \n\nWe were a bit nervous about taking our great big 12 year old Belgian Malinois to a vet's office - her entire life, she was seen by a recently-retired vet that made house calls. We looked on Yelp and saw that Saguaro was in our city and had great reviews, so we made an appointment since our dog's back legs seemed to be giving her trouble. \n\nThe place is very clean and most of the staff were friendly. We did not have to wait long to see Dr. Soltero, who was kind and soft spoken. His assistant was also great with our dog and friendly with us. He gave our dog a thorough exam and helped us to consider several possible causes of her leg pain and prospective treatments. He knew what each course of action would cost, and helps us to weigh our options. In the end we chose the conservative option of treating her first with an anti-inflammatory, and we saw some improvement almost right away. \n\nShe's since been back for a follow up appointment, which was also a quick one, and Dr. Soltero called himself and left us a message about the blood work results. \n\nOverall we were extremely pleased with our experience and will return when our pets need care.",,,informal

My sister and I decided to bring our cat Hula there also and they have helped us get him back on track too after we noticed significant weight-loss and excessive shedding turns out to be a thyroid problem and they have helped us regulate his meds. I think they are very reasonably priced too. You should definately bring your pets here Dr. White is very good!!,,,informal

If it's a chain restaurant Suicide wings =  a penguin's dangly bits. \n\nI am one of those idiots that frequents hot-sauce forums, sites and other places where my legal high can be obtained or discussed with those similarly afflicted so I took them up on the $15 challenge to eat 10 in 10 minutes, prize for 2 hours of speaking in tongues and humming a Johnny Cash tune?  Picture on wall and T-shirt plus not having to do it again:) The wings are caked in a habanero reduction that is more a  volume of heat eaten rather than insanely hot. Try it.It's awesome way to spend  20-30 minutes:D \n\nThankfully they have more affordable, livable, Zombie wings for those times you have enough T Shirts in your wardrobe but still need that kick. Their Hellzapoppin burger is rather good too.

Appeared to be a nice place to take a date or go out for a business lunch or dinner.  I was a little taken back by the paper covers on the tablecloths, but again, Italian food is messy.\n\nThe server was very knowledgeable about the menu, pasta and wine, and made some excellent recommendations.  I was appreciative of her knowledge. \n\nI ordered eggplant parmesan.  Other guests ordered scampi, fresh fish, and pork medallions.  Every dish came out beautifully prepared, very large portions, everything was fresh.  Everyone raved about their food.\n\nThe eggplant parmesan was covered in cheese and fresh, home-made marinara sauce.  It was delicious and I wanted to eat every bite, but it was so huge!.  This dish could easily have fed four people!\n\nI was too full to eat another bite by the time dessert came around, but the 10 of us shared a tiramisu.

5,"I've been coming and going to Vegas since I was 6 years old...as a kid, Excalibur was the coolest hotel in the world to me...now as an adult, I've never had more fun at a hotel.\n\nJust the gadgetry in the room kept us entertained for a solid hour, flipping on and off the lights with the touchpad, goofing around with the curtains using the switches on the wall, and testing to see if the master turn off switch really turned everything off...I was a kid in a candy shop!\n\nI lost who knows how much on the blackjack tables, but made it all back at the Craps tables.\n\nThe hotel staff was better than most and the security guards were on top of checking the room keys which made me feel better about keeping my bikes in my room.\n\nAs expected, the fridge was booby trapped with a 30 second switch, so we couldn't keep our drinks in the fridge. The view from my room was pretty epic as well. We woke up to seeing hot air balloons taking off towards the red rock mountains with the sunrise reflecting back the solid orange and reddish hues. Good Stuff.\n\nI posted a picture of the view from our room. Not bad at all. Overall, it maybe, just maybe as cool to me as an adult as Excalibur was to me as a kid.",,,informal
5,"I have been going to Sakanas for years now, and can say that I have yet to have anything short of a great experience there! \n\nThe sushi is fantastic, very high quality and fresh! They give you huge pieces of fish for a very affordable price. The rolls ate delicious as well, they always have cool specials that can be seen on their whiteboard behind the sushi bar. The lunch special is fantastic, you can get plenty of rolls for very cheap! \n\nAlso, the service is always awesome. Yoshie, a manager, is always walking around greeting everyone and checking on you during your meal. She seems to know almost all her customers, and makes everyone feel important.\n\nI give them 5 starts for service, food quality, portion size, and prices, Sakanas is the best!!",,,informal

I can't dock them a star for that though. The cakes are worth hunting down a place to sit!",,,informal

Fries taste great, try the fries sauce. it's interesting. my chicken shawerma has some garlic sauce and tahini sauce.  it was the best compare to Filfila Mediterranean Cafe or  Kyklos Gyro.  Even it's not as big as the Kyklos Gyro, you can order the gyro bowl (either chicken or the beef lamb gyro), rice are delicious (maybe cook with gravy from the gyro). Honey cannot finish all the rice from his combo.  Definitely will come again.",,,informal

Okay, so it really looks like a hole in the wall joint but that's where you gotta go sometimes to find the magically and spiritually liberating kind of stuff. Which other banh mi place can boast they make their own bread? THEIR OWN BREAD??? A good banh mi is only as good as the bread that it is incased it. Not many and don't give me lip about general lee's fakewich down the street either. If you want the real deal, you got to dig deep. Sandwiches range from 3.25 - 3.75. This place won't break the bank and the sandwiches are a foot long. EAT THAT JARED. No, literally. Eat it, it's good for you. Another amazing thing about them is that you buy 11, they give you the 12th free! SCORE. with 12 different kinds of banh mi and even a vegetarian to boot, who wouldn't want to give this place a shot? If it seems I am over zealous about this place, I promise you I couldn't be zealous enough. If you love banh mi then definitely give this place a try!",,,informal

But our amazing server, Zach, went over the menu and I mentioned something about the Fish Tacos. And Zach told me how delicious they were, and WOW he was right!  So we got the Duck tacos and soup as an appetizer and the Fish Tacos, and my husband got the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine.\nMy Valentine's Day was awesome!

5,"I'm here on business so that means I'm here sans wife and kids.  This is definitely not a place we'd have looked at twice if I had the family in tow.\n\nFirstly, their sign says \""Chinese and Cuban Food\"" which usually isn't something that I'm going to even give a second glance.  Stick to one cuisine -- generally speaking when people try to dabble in different cuisines none of them are done extremely well.\n\nTruth be told I was out on a quest for Mexican food I found on yelp.  But, both restaurants closed at 7pm and I was out looking at a few minutes after 7 so this place caught my eye.\n\nI can't tell you how the cuban food tastes; but, I had something called the \""Hunan Fried Rice\"" which is house special of sorts.\n\nIt was amazing.  It had eggs and bacon in it along with quite a bit of other flavors.  A bit of a language barrier -- I asked for no mushrooms and the waitress thought I was asking for no hot sauce.  \n\nBut, they brought some on the side and just a little bit of it did the trick.  It was very very hot.\n\nPoint is I loved the place and glad I stopped in.  It was within my budget also.",,,informal

The service is top notch and the food was outstanding. Their wine list is overwhelming, but if you look around you can find a decent bottle for under $100. \n\nFor appetizers we ordered oysters (fantastic!), the yellowtail hamachi (very fresh, although the citrus did overpower the fish a bit), and the lobster bisque (absolutely perfect - we ordered one to share for the table and they brought it to us in four small cups - nice touch).\n\nI had the wagyu skirtsteak and it was by far the best skirtsteak I've ever eaten. The yukon potatoes were amazing and the fries were perfect.\n\nFor dessert I highly recommend the monkeybread - it was amazing and the pecan/brown sugar ice cream was so refreshing. I'm a huge chocolate fan but this dish was far superior to the chocolate tart we ordered, which came with maple bacon ice cream (didn't care for it, and I love bacon!).\n\nOverall, one of the best meals I've had in a long time. Did I mention the bisque?\n\nFive stars - huge fan!",,,informal

I don;t know anything about whisky but the staff were really helpful, and knew their stuff so I managed to come out with a decent bottle.  They didn't push me into buying the really expensive ones either, which I'd expected.  I noticed they weren't overly pushy with other customers too, leaving them to browse if they didn't want any help when asked. \n\nThe selection of miniatures and big bottles is huge, and they have lots more besides whisky.  There's a note next to each type, explaining a bit more about it, which I thought was a nice touch, saving you having to ask all the time.\n\nwould definitely go back for another present - great selection, nice staff, good prices.",,,informal

The wait was like 45 minutes, but so worth it.\n\nThis isn't snow cone land, the ice consistency is smooth and sleek.

From classics like cherry and bubblegum (regular and blue) to traditional Hawaii flavors, to several types of cakes. \n\nSome add ons like ice cream and sour spray and other stuff I don't recall are only .50 to $1 to add. Condensed milk is free (if you've never had condensed milk on a snowy treat, do it; you are welcome). \n\nThey have a Twitter so you can find them on the go and webpage they update!

When we hit a few rough spots and some damages,  the owner, Derek, stepped in immediately, kept his word on all repairs, and stuck to the original moving estimate - even though it was off by a more than small amount.

5,"I agree with the positive reviews of this spa.  I had a massage there last week, and it was very clean, and the massage was great.  I was glad I got to keep my clothes on, and the masseur put towels over my clothes to protect them from the lotion on his hands when he massaged my back.  Though it was a little painful at times, I didn't ask him to lighten up the pressure, because I wanted to see how I felt afterward.  My feet were in heaven for over a day!  The price was great.  I will be back, and bring friends with me.",,,informal
5,"I honestly have only positive things to say about Postino's since every one of my visits here has been very pleasant. From the valet who is running his ass off to the food and everything in between, this place does it all right! If you go here hungry, you should know that your options are basically a panini, a salad or some bruschetta. I've had a little bit of everything and for the value and quality you can't go wrong the the bruschetta. I recently determined my favorite to be the ricotta, dates and pistachio but a close second is the salami and pesto.\n\nWine by the glass can be a bit steep so if you're planning to stay for a bit and can agree on a style with your company, you might be better off getting a bottle. A bottle is pretty much 3x the price of a glass so you end up getting 1 1/2 glasses extra. Bonus!\n\nSomeday, I'll actually take advantage of their $20 deal for wine and bruschetta!",,,informal

They have coordinated the flow of people so well that you talk to someone at a window within minutes about fingerprinting, they take debit/credit cards to pay the like $8 fee (not sure about that price, double check). Then within minutes, they take you to the back, pat you down to make sure you're not a sociopath and do your prints. It's that easy. Plus, they had wipes to clean your fingers off and I've heard of horror stories for other police departments about leaving with gummy black fingers.

Two of the staff members Marcus and Brendan are two of the most knowledgeable when it comes to the screamy-shouty stuff. good used vinyl. CHECK condition. this is the best location to score indie stuff. While the chandler store will have way more titles on cd at $2.99, the Tempe store has better stuff. more imports. more rare cd singles and maxi-singles. Jazz cds are okay. Jazz vinyl not so much. they do have some solid reissues. The country section is small but well stocked on wax and cd. hiphop could be better but if yuo enjoy turntablism and underground hiphop this is your store. Again, to sum up this is the best Zia in town. To all the people complaining about getting ripped off on credit, hate the game not the player.

My dream dinner there is to have many friends, many hours, many many tacos, and many beers or margaritas.  I am impressed with the food quality, but haven't had the beans or rice, I figure why?

I mean, doesn't having a yummy snack make long drives better?\n\nThe workers here are SOOO incredibly nice, practically forcing us to have free samples before we chose to buy anything. They always have 3 flavors fresh in stock & a bunch of rock hard frozen flavors in the freezer. \n\nWe had a scoop of vanilla custard ($2.22) & a chocolate concrete w/ Kit Kat mixed in ($4.90). Between the 3 of us, we couldn't even finish because the custard was so creamy & thick & the servings were so large. The ever-so-friendly workers even gave us a little extra custard in our concrete so that it was oozing over the edge.\n\nI can only describe it as a creamier version of ice cream w/o all the extra ice fluff & a thicker version of frozen yogurt.

I remember the Black Cod melting in my mouth and the exotic trout which shocked my tongue in a good way.  The Kobe beef was heavenly...  Just thinking about this meal has me wondering when I'll be in Vegas again.

The final installed cost from Cody was very reasonable when we also considered this company had it's own installers, and we would be dealing directly with Cody on both any installation issues and any future manufacturer warranty conditions.\nAt the time of installation, it was quite evident that Chris and Tim knew their craft, which resulted in a glitch free installation.

I learned I like steamed lobster if kept attached to the shell, and if removed prior to final grilling then the grilled. Great portion of veggies. Nice salad as a side.\n\nAll-in-all, Jessica and TGIFridays exceeded our expectations.",,,informal
5,We haven seen a number of shows in both Reynolds Hall and more intimate Cabaret Jazz.  The buildings and grounds are beautiful and represent a cultural gem for the city  and its residents.  We invariably see at least one show each trip and have never been disappointed.  On our most recent visit we saw the Wizard of Song which previously played off Broadway for 1.5 years and starred local George Bugati.,,,informal

Paul not only fixed the problem, that WHIRLPOOL did not, but was MUCH less expensive than the original price I was initially quoted by the big company.

5,"Since the positives outweigh the negatives by a considerable amount, I'll get it out of the way and say that if Trader Joe's had a more extensive meat department it would be a one-stop-shop for me. \n\nThe store brand quality never disappoints, the staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and prices are very affordable. That you're greeted by their beautiful selection of flowers, herbs, and other types of foliage and later welcomed to try one of their delicious concoctions cooking in the back is just icing on this mindful preparation of grocery and household offerings. \n\nThe store is always clean and while it's usually crowded at the times I visit, I'm rarely bothered. A friendly place like Trader Joe's seems to attract friendly patrons. If my bright blue insulated tote happens to bump into your bright blue insulated tote while I'm deliberating over the vast cheese or nuts selections, we'll probably exchange smiles instead of middle fingers.\n\nThe folks who work here are approachable and extremely helpful. While I don't regularly drink wine, I find it a nice touch that a personable sommelier is available in the event I need a crash course on pairing and someone can recommend a high fiber cereal.\n\nSome of my favorite products:\n\n-Salsa Authentica\n-Cowboy Cavier\n-Vegan trail mix cookies\n-All-in-one facial cleanser\n-Cruciferous crunch\n-Coconut cashews\n-TJ's brand almond milk\n-Spinach and fontina chicken sausage\n-Spicy peanut vinaigrette\n-Roasted red pepper soup",,,informal

5,"We stayed here for 3 nights in the master suite with full kitchen, master bath, projection screen, couches, dining room, bar counter, another bedroom, and another bath. It was a suite that connects to two other rooms on the 33rd floor. Our friends ended up getting the two connected rooms and we had a blast! The view was great and it was attached to the Miracle Mile Shops. It was a few minutes walk to Planet Hollywood Casino, Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, and The Paris. Same goes for all the eateries. It was super inexpensive. \n\nThe decor was on the modern/contemporary style. The color scheme throughout the Elara was red, white, and black. It was definitely on the \""younger\"" side, in terms of clientele - between 25-40.\n\nEach of us paid around $150 for 3 nights with one of our friend's discounts. It was a great deal for a large group of people. We party in the suite and on the strip. This hotel gives you the full effect of Vegas without the expensive of being in one of the more expensive, renown hotels. \n\nIf you're looking for a not so inexpensive stay with a group of friends, definitely go for the Elara!",,,informal

The ambiance is fun and unpretentious, the service is friendly and helpful, and last but not least the food was absolutely amazing.  Ciao Ciao's has earned my loyalty. I will only eat pizza here from now on, and considering I live 13 miles away from Ciao Ciao's that's saying a lot. \n\nNow how do I even begin to describe the one delicious brick oven fired rich meaty concoction that will forever plague me with an eternal raging hunger erection. How can words even do justice in accurately portraying the rich creamy clouds of ricotta cheese, the carnivorous festival of pepperoni, sausage, and meatballs layered about providing you with a new and exciting flavor combination with every single bite. The fact of the matter is, that I can't. I can't begin to describe how truly good this pizza really is. The only thing you can do is experience it for yourself. Drop whatever it is that you are doing right now.  Go to Ciao Ciao, order a pie, and insert it into that large flapping hole in your face with the lips and teeth and go ....MMMMMMM.\n\nCiao Ciao is the best place to get pizza in Las Vegas period.",,,informal
5,"Wow!  This place is good!  The atmosphere is modern, the staff are kind (sometimes slow), the food is always amazing. I don't think I've had one thing bad here. However, the prices are a bit high. But then again, it's the only place around where the food is made from scratch. Their homemade potato chips and potato salad are insanely good. I don't normally go for mayo on anything, but it's absolute perfection. Their posole is amazing (love that it's clear broth and not red), Reuben sandwich is amazing, breakfast foods are perfection and those potatoes. This is definitely a comfort food place to go, if you want to take a nap afterwards. No joke!!  It's unbelievable. Pricey, but worth it. I guess. If you don't have the money, you should probably stick with Taco Bell and don't complain about how much it costs. The owner(s) probably want to buy a bigger house, put their kids through college and they have something really amazing here, so why the heck not!!  The prices haven't hindered the majority of clients from going here. So be mindful of what you order. Also know, if you're on a budget, I believe they have an ala cart menu and you can purchase 2 to 3 things and keep it under $10. \nEnjoy!!",,,informal

I had the corned-beef hash wrap from the breakfast menu and it was delish! It came with a generous side of fruit. My companions had the bleu cheese bacon burger and the roast beef baguette. My only complaint is that they don't have brewed iced tea. Otherwise, we had no problems and would definitely return.",,,informal
5,"This is the best Mexican food I have ever tasted. I know that's not saying much at all since I hail from NYC, but bear with me.\n\nThe tacos run you 2 dollars and are stuffed with meat, guacamole, salsas, onions, cilantro, and so much ugh. I ate about 6 - tongue, beef head, spicy pork, tripe (THE BEST!), carne asada, beef shoulder. They were all good, except maybe the beef shoulder because it reminded me too much of my homestyle Russian food. The tripe was the star though, with the intestines fried to a crunchy yet still a bit chewy perfection. In addition to the tacos, I also tried a carne asada quesadilla. My only knowledge of quesadillas being those flattened, depressing (yet still delicious) things in Taco Bell, I was mindblown. Everything had such a great flavor and texture.\n\nThey serve grilled peppers and scallions on the side for free, which have a great flavor. Also on the side for you to grab at your leisure are radishes and lime pieces. Mexican fountain sodas are also available but I didn't like any of the flavors, and was upset that they didn't have Jarritos.\n\nNext time I come back to Vegas, I'm definitely eating here again, and saying hi to my Mexican bro with whom I conversed in my rudimentary Spanish.",,,informal

A fabulous wine list awaits you with a wide selection. The food...absolutely delicious! Great appetizer selection and the steaks and sides were superb.

While we didn't have a reservation we were able to get an open booth and the service was among the best I have seen at a bar. The drinks were reasonably priced and were among the best we have had, some of my other friends ended up on the strip. I'm pretty happy I ended up at Herbs and Rye.

You expect a wine cellar and what you have is this dinky liquor store. You enter the dinky liquor store and it couldn't be more anonymous, but if you just stay true (Navy term I believe) there is a staircase that leads down. Normally this is a bad sign, never go downstairs in a dinky liquor store - this one is the exception. I find the experience to be a little Narnia-like. But it isn't Narnia; it's a really cool looking wine bar. \n\nAnd this would be cool if this was it - but wait, there's more.\n\nThere is also a lounge area where people can relax and hang out and the rumor says that they play live music down here. I have totally missed it every time, but I cannot blame the establishment for my failure to plan. \n\nThey have a nice wine selection, and a limited but eclectic beer selection.\n\nI have not been here for the live music, so I cannot say much about the clientele.. but the establishment is really nice.

Just some design flaw I guess, since my car has a hydraulic self-adjusting clutch pedal. \n\nDid you know it only took like five minutes of conversing with Adriana (the female mechanic) before they returned my car with the oil, filter, and airbox filter all completely changed?!? \n\nIt may be more expensive than the usual stay at the Toyota Dealership, but appointments at the dealership took me in excess of 2 hours, possibly THREE just to get a oil change. Even though Toyota provides me a 21-point inspection, it basically is the same exact thing with JiffyLube.",,,informal
5,"Driving up to the place, you contemplate if you should have brought your bullet proof vest. You pull in, see that nothing has been touched since 1950, and fall into deep thought about the greatness that's going to enter your mouth. You look at the menu (with taped over prices) and order through the original Alexander Graham Bell phone. Can't understand what the lady is saying back to you? WHO CARES!! \n\nAll you need to do is order the BBQ Minced sandwich and a 1/4 BBQ chicken (white meat). Yeah, some people say the sandwich could have more BBQ sauce on it, but those people need to walk out onto Wilkinson with their eyes closed.\n\nYou won't find another place like this in the world, i promise...I've looked. The people that work there make this place especially unique. The guys are funny, quick, and they were shirts with holes in them.\n\nOverall, if you are in Charlotte, you better go there. Make sure you bring Cash with you because Credit Cards are not allowed.",,,informal

5,"Sue and company have run an outstanding restaurant for 23 years in the east valley. Terrific Chinese cuisine, in a very pleasant sit down setting. You will not find better service at any restaurant, anywhere. Not sure what \""pretty standard\"" Chinese food means; but compared to several other east valley Asian fares, including the major chains, this place is superior. \nPlus, if you're going to gamble on taking out Moo Shu, the dish that is typically created and rolled at your table, well, you takes your chances.\n\nIf you like the occasional fried delicacy, try the Golden Gate shrimp; love it!\n\nSpend your precious eat-out dollars at locally owned businesses.",,,informal
5,"I have now dined at Central bistro 2 times for the Brunch menu on the weekends and 4 times for dinner in the evening. Every time I have gone in I always try something different off the menu. First off, the restaurant has a beautifully open layout concept from the high ceilings to the marble tables throughout. The hostesses always greet you professionally. I have had up to 4 different servers here and they definitely know their info on the menu items and the cocktails. one of the most in depth cocktail was their lemoncello sour, a spin off on the whiskey sour and the server even went into detail about how the chef prepares the lemoncello he also brought out a few extra italian black cherries that are garnished with the drink and showed us this 80$ jar of cherries. I absolutely LOVE their Brunch menu most off all because i am a brunch fanatic. The eggs Benedict and the Chicken n Waffles are all to DIE FOR. I Highly recommend this restaurant if you want a beautiful place to hang out with excellent service and food.",,,informal

5,"This was my first timeshare experience.  My good friend invited me to stay with her.  If you don't feel like being out on the strip around all the drunken people.  This is great for a peaceful Vegas alternative.  I noticed a lot of families on the property.  \n\nWhat you get: a room, Air Conditioning, Full functional kitchen, washer and dryer, fireplace, BBQ and 2 TVs.  Not bad.  Oh, now lets talk about the amenities.  Outside are 4 swimming pools and a couple of hot tubs.  There is a gym and recreation room.  You can borrow DVDs to watch.  A mini market in the middle of the property, that serves Starbucks.\n\nShuttle service.  Runs on the hour, takes you to the Monte Carlo.  From there if you need to get further down the strip, I suggest walking across the street to MGM and catching the rail.  Faster than taking a bus on the strip.  Once a day, there is another shuttle that takes you to Vons grocery store.  I hit up the Taco Bell in the same shopping complex and some groceries.  Lastly, they provide you with an airport shuttle number if you ask, which cost me $9, rather than a taxi ride.  Awesome!!!!",,,informal

Came here Valentines day night and it was crowded, I had a seat while my date stood until a seat became available, the 2 bartenders working were busy but still took time to talk about their drinks and recommendations.  I ordered a drink in a souvenir cup, I don't remember what it was but the bartender asked what flavors I liked, after she shined the flashlight on the sample cups on the shelf I chose the Wild Watusi cup, and she recommended something with passion fruit/guava flavors in it.  These drinks could get dangerous, even though it tasted like a tropical fruit punch it wasn't super sweet and/or syrupy tasting, it was a great combination of flavors and liquor!  After I finished my drink they rinsed out my tiki cup and swizzle stick and boxed it back up.  I want to go back and collect them all...Pokemon style!!",,,informal

The building is not well marked, but the tables in the windows let you know you have the right place!  \n\nFor a new restaurant, they have their workflow and service very well done; I believe all the reports saying they hired experienced people. The server knew the menu & the beers on tap well, and never disappeared for too long.  My husband and I split the \""classic\"" poutine -- the fries were crisp outside the gravy and perfectly soft within, and the cheese curds delightfully squeaky.  I had the chicken breast (with artichokes, mushrooms, and risotto); he had the fresh wild fish.  Both were perfectly prepared and delicious.  Desserts were also excellent, and the coffee was good, though not stellar (but you're not going there for the coffee).\n\nI saw a few people there with kids; it seems to be a bit more casual & kid-friendly than Point Brugge, so we may take ours sometime for lunch.\n\nVery impressive overall, especially since it's been open less than a week.  We'll be going back, and I hope they have sidewalk tables this summer (hint hint).",,,informal
5,"This was my first time eating at this establishment, and normally, when I write a review, I usually wait until my second visit.  But considering the company has been open since 1963, I figured they are doing something right, so I'll write my review now.  Quite honestly, this was the best Mexican food I've ever had in the Phoenix area.  I love the homemade salsa (not to mention, how MUCH you get - they don't use the tiny bowls for salsa like some restaurants do).  Tonight, I had the carne asada chimichanga, and I have to say that it's probably the best chimichanga I have EVER had.  The tortillas are homemade, and it almost looked like the chimi was pan-fried, because it was over-loaded with grease, which is a definite plus.  It comes with guacamole and sour cream, and I think they kind of over did it with it, but that's my personal preference.  I'm not going to ding them for that.  And the Spanish rice tastes just as it should be - almost like mine.  :)  When we arrived, they were in the middle of their happy hour, where your drinks were half-off.  Bonus!  But if you get regular drinks, such as pop, tea, etc., you get a huge glass for it!  Double bonus.  I know, the little things excite me.  I'll definitely becoming back to this restaurant soon.  I think it's better than Serrano's.  The decor is mediocre, at best, but they make up for it in the food.",,,informal
5,"Tonight I went to Jade Palace.  We have several restaurants in the area that are mediocre and somehow continue to stay busy, so I wasn't sure about Jade Palace.

These were not skinny like your Krispy Kreme variety.  These were fluffy pieces of dreaminess.

I had never gone because it looked so ritzy... not my style of pizza place from the outside. But once I walked in it my mind was changed! It was nice and cozy :)\n\nWe started out with drinks, I got a root beer cause it was 12pm and I'm not one to drink a glass of wine in the afternoon and guess what... they have keg Root Beer!! It is freakin amazing =))\n\nI ordered the mozzarella, basil, tomato salad and it was amazing... but I was confused that they had it under the salad selection and it isn't a salad at all; it is the traditional slab of yummy!\n\nWe also got the Pesto Pizza... with nothing on it of course & it was to die for, I could have eaten it all day!!\n\nThis is one of the best pizza places in town!

I didn't see a single one.\n\nThis is definitely a hike from the strip but it is by far the best beer selection we saw in Vegas.

5,"Cannot recommend this place enough!!!\n\nThe cuts are amazing, the barbers are legends and the barbershop has the coolest shit everywhere. \n\nWe got there at midday and there was already about 8 boys waiting for cuts (this is how you know it's good). All the barbers greet you and tell you it might be a bit of a wait but feel free to stick around....and so glad we did. We had 6 of us the day of my wedding for some fresh cuts. The whole time you feel included in their banter and jokes, there's good music playing and it doesn't even feel like you're waiting. \n\nThe cuts turned out amazing, they take time as they are all perfectionists, I couldn't believe the skill and precision they all had. \n\nMy barber did mine on the house as a wedding gift....I was absolutely speechless....but their service didn't stop there. As we had so many of us we'd been there for longer than we'd planned and I had to be back at my hotel in an hour for wedding photos. I called a cab and it was going to be at least an hour.....I am stressing...I'm going to be late to my wedding...\n\nThen one of the barbers offers to drop us back to our hotel to make sure we're not late. I couldn't believe it....he literally saved my life....and my wedding day...and my wife loved the fresh cut.\n\nYou boys are amazing, thanks so much and I will always recommend you to anyone I know going to Las Vegas.",,,informal

5,"I wish I could give DB 4.5 stars, but the bartenders were pretty cool so I'll bump it up. I ate here with a friend. Well, I actually ate alone at the bar, which was the first time I have ever dined in a restaurant by myself, since my friend was in a meeting. I must say, eating by yourself, in a dress, ready to go out at night is one surefire way for guys (good and bad) to come talk to you. It was pretty empowering though, and when my friend showed up after her meeting to grab dessert with me, I think the bartenders believed me that I really wasn't a prostitute!\n\nI had the most amazing foie gras I've had in a while, a decent crab salad, and some fabulous duck. The albarino suggested by the bartender was ok, but the desserts were fabulous. I think we actually ordered two although I can't remember which ones since I was probably in a food coma by that point! Top off the meal with a drink from the bar and we were ready for a night out.\n\nIf you can, grab a seat overlooking the Lake of Dreams so you can watch the dancing frog. And girls, don't be afraid to sit at the bar and eat by yourself. It's actually fun!

The vegetables were fresh and nothing was too greasy.\n\nThe service was excellent as well.

As for entree, I can never decide on whether the Lasagna, chicken Piccata or Ventano Spendini are my favorites. \n\nSave room for dessert~!!! They have wonderful desserts. I love the cannoli.

He was very knowledgeable but yet listened to my concerns regarding the height of the TV.  He actually saved us money by recommending a different wall mount from the one we purchased when we bought the TV - so we were able to return the super expensive but not worth it one to Costco.  We love the look of having the TV on the wall with no wires showing and have had so many compliments.  Joe even removed our old 32\"" ton of bricks TV for us!  We highly recommend him!",,,informal

5,"I highly recommend Halo and there very professional environment. After a horrible scalpel experience by a piercer in California years ago, I had to have 2 surgeries to reconstruct my ears. I thought there was no hope of ever having them look normal again. I went in to Halo about a year ago to talk to Jeremiah about possibly piercing them one day when the scar tissue healed. You could imagine my hesitation to do anything to my ears again, but as the surgeries left my ears a little uneven I wanted to pierce them with simple studs to take the focus off. So, I finally went in a week ago to see about  piercing them. Jeremiah was very comforting through the whole process and the piercing was quick, precise and just what I had hoped for and more! They are healing better than any piercing I have ever had. I don't have to hide my ears anymore! I have also had a dermal removed there in the past and can honestly say you can trust everyone here. Great place to find some awesome jewelry too. Thanks guys, I will definitely be back!",,,informal

Well, the falafel has a competitor in a place in CA i had once, but the hummus is seriously the best of the best of the best.\n\nOther than those, I think the only other thing I have tried is the beef kabobs... Pretty expensive, but also one of the best ever and well worth it.  \n\nMy only complaint with the place is the ordering/eating/paying system  - especially when it's busy.  That's the order - order first  at the counter (which can be a little chaotic), then go sit and eat at a table, then pay at the register.  \n\nSo the flow is a little awkward, but not enough to give it less than 5 stars for the best hummus, falafel, and kabobs, i've ever had on a consistent basis for the 4+ years we've been going there.",,,informal

Ordering this way is almost like getting the freshest prix fix menu where the food comes out in courses. There were cold appetizers, hot ones, grilled treats, rolls, frozen dessert...the list goes on.

Shortly after arriving, they addressed me by name and inquired about my bacon tattoo (thanks, Amy D!! They thought it was a hoot.) And they remembered I wrote about wanting the try the lamb ($27). \n\nIn a word: Phenomenal \n\nRubbed with Dijon mustard and topped with fresh herbs, the lamb was baked rare (I don't see any reason to cook lamb past rare; doing so destroys the terrific texture and flavor that make lamb such a treat for me). The manchego and chorizo risotto paired perfectly with the lamb. And I was surprised the cheddar basil waffle was actually a Belgium waffle in style as I was envisioning something much thinner. Yet it all worked remarkably well. \n\nNow I must acknowledge this was a spurge for me. At $27, I knew it was something I couldn't enjoy every week. But for that price, I was delighted with a generous rack of lamb and a hefty portion of risotto. In fact, it was entirely too much for me to eat in one meal. And as my leftovers sat next to me in the theater, I felt wonderfully fulfilled not only because I converted to Team Jacob but because of the knowledge I would have the best lunch in the office come Monday. \n\nCenturion is a damn fine restaurant.",,,informal

Great date night or special occasion restaurant.\n\nMy wife had the 4 course tasting menu for $50 (appetizer, small pasta plate, main course, desert), with the $20 wine pairings for each.  With the little surprise tastes that everyone may get, who knows, it turned into a 6 course meal.  Healthy portions, very tasty.  The wine was nicely matched and excellent value.\n\nI nibbled on her courses and just had the filet for $30.  Filet was very good (not spectacular, but if you want that you have to go to the best prime steakhouses), but what made the meal amazing was the mushroom risotto it sat over.  I love risotto, and it was the very best I've ever had.  I would go back and just order a big blowl/plate of that if I could! \n\nIt was a very special meal.  Excellent service.  \n\nWe had reservations and still had to wait 35 min for a table, because they were genuinely that busy.  But what was nice is that the manager just came over, without a word from us or even a look, and had the bartender make two of her best signature drinks on him.  What a nice touch!  How many managers of nice, busy restaurants would do that.  Make a terrific meal even better to be treated that way.\n\n$110 tab before tip... worth ever penny!",,,informal

I am a pepperoni fan myself but they offer most of the other usual toppings as well.  I will mention I tried the sausage one time and wasn't real thrilled with it.  \n\nSauce tastes fine to me, they do not skimp on the cheese, and they have a variety of specials as others have mentioned.

The service is super good, they have the nicest barista and staff!\n\nTomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and days after that, if I am not at the library, or at home, or at SERF swimming pool, or zumba-ing or yoga-ing at SERF, I will be at Colectivo! :D \n\nIf you happen to see a nice and smiley lady with some colorful scarf, just greet her! :) She's in love with Colectivo, so she's always in the good mood even with some books and a lengthy paper!

5,"A Tale of Two Pizzas in Scottsdale, Part I\n\nAfter a night of clubbing in Scottsdale, my wife and I began searching for a place open late that serves pizza.  We really didn't want to eat in club central where the only way to park is by valet.\n\nOut came the iPhone with the Yelp app, and out pops KISS.  It was open late and we could park in the parking lot.  I was a bit apprehensive at first, but we had friendly, accommodating service as soon as we walked in.  There was a cheese pizza all ready for us to eat upon entering--all we had to do was pay and have it served.  This was a fantastic pie with a slightly chunky sauce.  The cook puts a lot of love into the preparation of his food--and it shows.  This place is apparently ONLY open on Friday and Saturday, but I see how they stay in business.  Their food is so damned good, they obviously sell a LOT of it.\n\nBoth my wife and I really enjoyed our late-night dinner here and hope to return again some time soon.  We both heartily recommend KISS Back East Pizza and Beef Joint.",,,informal
5,"Loved this place!  We're new to Phoenix and happened upon this restaurant by accident.  We looked at the menu and decided to get the 3 tacos for $5.00 and a bottle of water for $6.00 total.  Menu prices include tax and they accept cash only.\n\nI had 2 chicken tacos while my wife tried a fish taco.  Included on each taco is:  Beans, cheese, tomatoes, onions, shredded cabbage, rice, a choice of meat, which green sauce and red salsa on the side.  \n\nThese aren't tiny taco bell tacos.  These things are huge and delicious!  My wife loved her fish taco and the chicken tacos were also fantastic.  We can't wait to go back.  \n\nMy only wish was that I had black beans on my tacos instead of pinto beans, but my wife looked at their menu online later and found that I could have requested them.  A minor error I shall correct on our next visit.",,,informal

5,"The service is exceptional. There was a South American teppan chef that was very nice and generous. I had the calamari and it was sooo fresh and tasty. He gave us nice shrimp appetizer that I was surprised came with. The teppan is unique because they serve noodles. The rice came last after the food, which was nice because I hate filling up on rice before the main entree. But, the rice is definitely the best part of a teppan experience. I got too full by the time the rice came out and felt guilty not even touching it.\n\nWe went during happy hour and everything was reasonably priced. I ordered a shrimp tempura sushi and it cost $7, but it was a large well presented roll that tasted fresh and perfect. We were tempted to go for the all you can eat, but we held that off as Ricky wanted the happy hour teppan. It ended up costing us less. We are on a budget so we needed to by mindful of what we ordered even if we were treating ourselves. \n\nAll in all I would definitely come back.",,,informal

Mountain.)\n\nThis place is a little paradise....a piece of small town USA.\n\nThe farm at South Mountain in great place to bring family, friends, out-of-towners, and it is incredible for kids.  The entire facility is open and you can roam the place freely while checking out the farm and lots of chickens.\n\nWe were bummed that the wait for the breakfast place was over an hour.  Someone told us to check out The Farm Kitchen.  We were very glad we did. \n\nThis quaint little cottage offered a wide variety of sandwiches, salads, and baked goods.  Most of the items included products groan on-site.  We ordered a few sandwiches, the pasta salad, and the mushroom soup.  We were not disappointed....everything was great.  \n\nThe food was high quality.  The sandwiches were huge. The service....well no service to review since the place was an order and pick up at the counter style sandwich joint. The prices were a little high.  I would say the average lunch will run $12-$15 per person if you get a drink and side.  The price  was worth it to me to get out of the house and spend a few hours in place that really takes you away from the city.",,,informal

5,"I was impressed with David's Hamburgers and Mexican food. The building is a cozy little 50's themed outlet in Scottsdale. The music matched the decor and was enjoyable. The place was clean, not spotless, but clean. \n\nI ordered the guacamole burger. It came with pepper jack cheese, bacon, lettuce, and tomatoes. You can also get fries, onion rings, or cole slaw included in the cost of the burger. I got fries. I also got a Dr. Pepper. The fries were good, but nothing noteable. The burger was also good. Perfectly cooked to what I ordered. The guacamole was amazing and everything else was good.\n\nWhat really stood out to me was the service here. My server was a slender middle aged man with grey/white hair and glasses. I sadly did not catch his name. He gave me PHENOMENAL service. I was greeted promptly, he was knowledgeable about the menu, he checked back on me often, but not too often. My beverage was NEVER empty and he was professional in his conduct. He even gave me a to-go cup so I could have Dr. Pepper when I left. I sincerely hope that all of their staff are this way and that he is recognized for his AMAZING service. I will return to David's on this aspect alone.\n\nTo conclude, the food was good, the building was pleasant, and the service was PERFECT. I recommend you try David's Hamburgers and Mexican Food.",,,informal

The rooms are clean and the bed and linens are nice and comfortable.  It's a great place to stay for a \""stay cation\"" or if you want to stay somewhere quieter than the strip.  It's convenient to Nellis Air Force base so if you are TDY I suggest staying here.  The rooms are 150 times better than on base plus there's excellent food choices just steps away in the casino. It's also convenient to the 215 so it's easy to get around the city.  It has a great pool, free wi-fi and free valet parking.  Great prices and great rooms! I highly recommend it!",,,informal
5,"oh that is some good tuna. the chefs house blend cold plum sake was so smooth and refreshingly crisp. service was great too, wifey went omakase style and they explained each item to her, all the servers were friendly with no attitude. no signage either out front so look for big wong's. there's also this japanese italian place next door that i will want to try next time. will need to continue to venture off the strip for food next time were in vegas. loved the minimalism decor and designer restroom. mmmm, dreaming of the akami, so meaty. not a big fan of the fatty tunas i guess. also be smart and ask for the bottle of the house blend plum sake instead of being like me and first getting the apertif size, and then 2 champagne flutes worth. each champagne flute is $6, which isnt that bad, but later on i was told i could order a bottle for $25. but the fish here is top quality and the cuts are generous. you get wasabi here, and they only serve you the soy sauce to complement the sushi. also no spicy tuna here, wah. bet it would be bomb.",,,informal

It is in an offbeat area (a business park) and is located right next to a bar/gaming lounge (there are no signs on the outside...just have to walk into the lounge to get in).\n\nI definitely agree that the food is top notch.  The menu is only made up of sliders and fries, but the quality of the food is awesome.  You are able to mix and match up to three sliders.  I had the barby, yaya, and pep pep sliders.  All three sliders were great and each one had distinctive flavors.  The barby is a bbq style slider, the yaya is a greek style slider, and the pep pep is a cheese and bacon slider with special sauce.  They don't seem that big at first, but I was pretty stuffed after eating three of them.\n\nThey also have sweet potato fries that are covered in cinnamon sugar, which was surprisingly pretty good.\n\nThe place itself has a fun and friendly atmosphere and our server was very nice and helpful.  Oh, and they have an NBA Jam arcade machine that has free play on it...very cool.\n\nI would definitely come back again to try the other sliders and their specialty fries.",,,informal

This was fun, light and each item had a distinct unique flavor. \n\nAs all good culinary opera's must end, so must this one and it did with my signature doppio espresso with a twist. In keeping with the spirit of the rest of the evening, this near perfect espresso was accompanied with a delicious collage of petifores, (Fudge cheesecake, honey of raisin granola, honeycomb tuile & tanka bean ice cream). I mean seriously how often does one get to eat tanka bean ice cream. This dish was actually the best desert I had this night and it was served on a groovy piece of drift wood. Which reminds me, everything from the preparation, presentation, service and taste at Hawke & Hunter was above and beyond my expectations. I have been to several places that boast food of this level but fail to deliver. Hawke and Hunter was quite the opposite. They didn't boast but they sure did deliver. \n\nBravo!\n\n(Pictures are available for all these dishes on the Hawke & Hunter Yelp link)",,,informal

5,"I've been here three times previously and always had the chicken sandwich which we all know is amongst the best in town. But on my stop by the takeout window today at noon I knew I wanted something different and told the young lady working the counter (wish I'd asked her name so I could acknowledge her...cute brunette...ponytail I think). Rather than give the \""everything is amazing\"" line that annoys the crap out of me she recommended a single item that she thought I would like, the Paris burger. She even gave me a food hack to ask for the next time I'm there (chicken sandwich with Paris burger toppings). I got home, devoured the delicious burger (I'm not normally a grass fed guy) and am already thinking about the chicken sandwich with Paris toppings she recommended. Kudos to Ingo for truly tasty food and also for such a great staff of friendly and knowledge people. They make the food even tastier...especially for people like me who score atmosphere and energy of a place right up alongside the food.\n\nThe Stand may have the best overall burger in Acadia/Arizona/America? but for the complete package, Ingo's Tasty Food can't be beat.",,,informal

Just enough dill,  not oversauced, nutty and unexpected faro. Also excellent was the rabbit rillettes. So rich but also herbaceous and rustic. The Turkey leg was amazing. Could have used just a few more lovely little brussel sprouts. But the meat and the sauce were incredible. The bread pudding with the cherries showed the same attention to detail as every other dish. Just outstanding food and really friendly, attentive service.",,,informal

Nice atmosphere and there is a great sense of politeness and respect from the Hostess to the Bartender and to our waiter.\n\nThe Waiter was very knowledgeable of what the daily house specials were and shared his recommendations.
