1,"OMG! how is this place still in business? It must be a front for some sort of money laundering scam or something...not going to waste too much time here...been there twice..both times...cramped, rude, horrible service, and last but not least FOOD POISONING! enough said..",,,informal
1,"Stayed for my bday..never again. The 800$ in so called savings coupons was a sham except for the free dinner. No real accomidations either, no fridge in room, no microwave and the elevators are a dam nightmare! Oh and about every 2 hours random hotel guests come knocking on your door looking for weed...\""not my room stoner try the rappers next door\""!, the convenient stores rapes you for basic needs like 5.50$ for a 2 liter of soda or 15$ for a half pint of well booze. Anything affordable is a mile and a half walk thru aholes and catwalks(walgreens/CVS). So take walking shoes and not heels ladies. Cheers!",,,informal

1,"Terrible terrible food, well our adventure started when our waitress brought out the coconut shrimp, terrible taste felt rubbery. Then my father asked for a well done prime rib came out medium rare. The waitress seeing disgust on our face offers to have it recooked. Wow what a waste of time and service stay away!",,,informal
1,"My last interaction at this branch was beyond frustrating. In an attempt to finalize a few matters dealing with my late husband's finances, I requested assistance at this branch.\n\nI understand why they did not help. It wasn't that they could not. It was at the (acting) manager's discretion, as explained to me by Wells Fargo customer service when I called their toll free number.\n\nWhat I can't appreciate is the manner in which the (acting) manager chose not to help, which included lying about \""federal regulations\"", refusing to honor checks written on a Wells Fargo account by a government agency, and refusing to honor documentation from the Mecklenburg county courthouse.\n\nThe customer service I received at this branch was the proverbial straw.\n\nI finalized my business with Wells Fargo yesterday.\n\nGood riddance...",,,informal
1,"I used to think Bouchon was one of the great restaurants in Vegas, but after tonight I no longer do. My party of six sent back two of our entrees: both short ribs. They were nothing but fat. We replaced one with the lamb and one with the strip steak, both of which were an improvement but still subpar for a restaurant with this reputation. The other entrees (duck, gnocchi) were just okay, but hardly memorable, and certainly not worth the cost. This restaurant better get its act together because it's not worthy of the Thomas Keller name. I won't be returning myself.",,,informal
1,"Started a yelp account just to complain about this place...Bought my grandma an order of kare kare and I was so disappointed... \n since it was  a to-go order they asked me what size i wanted and i told them the medium size cup. it was $8 but since I figured the container was pretty big, it would be worth it. When we got our food, it was in a different container and we didn't open it til we got home. There were 2 small pieces of meat with a little bit of sauce. This measly portion could have fit in the small to-go container that was $3 cheaper. \n\nWe called the restaurant to complain about the small serving size we got and the lady on the phone ask two asked us things that turned me from irritated and a little upset to angry and outraged. First she asked it we were regulars then if I was Filipino.\n\nHmmm..I didn't know that their level of customer service was based on restaurant loyalty and nationality.  So what if I'm not a regular customer or Filipino? doesnt that mean they can give me smaller portions for the same price? I'll never eat at this place again!!",,,informal
1,"Not sure it is real or fantasy in mind of somebody.  I  pre-purchased detailing for my mid-size SUV through Groupon. To make this short, it is next to impossible to contact them. Oh, you can call or text, but be prepared for no answer. If you do contact them and they arrange to come to your place, be aware that most likely they will never appear.  This review is based on my calling or texting them repeatedly and setting up two appointments with them to come to my house. On neither occasion did anyone appear.  Unless you want to waste your time, don't do business with this so-called business. For me, I hope I get my money back from Groupon. Then I clean the car myself.",,,informal
1,"While I have had good service at other locations, the service that my family had tonight was horrible. It took them 25 minutes before they brought out our salads and over an hour before they brought our pizza. We saw some tables turn over twice before we got our food.",,,informal
1,"Greeting and food service was on the slow side to be 3PM and pretty empty. We were standing upfront for about 15 minutes and literally no one stopped to check our status or seat us. Once seated, our server Luke was definitely helpful and on point with his drink and taco suggestions though. \n\nWe had the street corn as an appetizer, total waste of $4. Corn on the cob (probably the smallest I've ever seen), lathered in oil and a sprinkle of cheese. I was expecting at least a juicy piece of corn and all the things that would make it almost worth spending $4 for & even more so \""Mexican Street Corn\"". I had the shrimp and Al Pastor tacos with saffron rice and opted for sweet plantains instead of beans ($2 upcharge). Tacos were pretty tasty (that's what the one star is for), plantains were burnt on some ends and they were all stuck together. Saffron rice would've been good had I not chomped on a few hard clusters of rice. \n\nI went back on yelp and saw the South Park location had better reviews - because I really wanted to like this place,  I'm willing to give Cantina 1511 another shot but at the South Park location. One star for the tacos alone.",,,informal
1,"I went back four years later to taste the Bloody Mary again before flying back home. This time, it was a huge and disappointing mistake that left me vomiting at the airport and upon immediate arrival back home. \n\nIncidentally, Sigi was our server again! And as sweet as ever. But the fact that they bring out the food on trays with sterling silver covers over everything like it is that one \""Be Our Guest\"" scene in Beauty and the Beast does not change the reality of the situation, which is that the food there looks, feels and tastes like an abomination that was relegated from a preschool arts and crafts class. My chicken noodle soup was curiously sweet, with dirty carrots and undercooked macaroni, all of which had settled to the bottom. The spicy buffalo wings were completely dry with pepper flakes thrown on them, and one broke into two soft lumps with some brown stuff that came out of it. You could take any seasoned inmate there and even he could tell you that it is worse than prison food. I know, because I did. \n\nJust kidding. But that is the only part I am joking about, because I suffered for the twelve hours afterwards. Skip America and grab a bagel or something.",,,informal
1,The constant electronic/techno music made me want to shoot myself. There was absolutely no R&B or hip-hop played. The music didn't change all night!,,,informal
1,Long wait for a very disappointing experience. Mind you I was ready to taste what a gourmet burger tasted like. Fries were too greasy and go figure no regular catsup or mustard! The sun blaring down on us was extremely bad and yet not one restaurant staff bothered to block the sun or apologize. Service was ok but I wasn't impressed. I was only able to eat 1/2 of my burger! Too much hoopla for very bad food!,,,informal
1,"If you are a fan of Cici's pizza buffet, or Homestyle buffet you're going to be delighted by the Orleans. Their attractive and appetizing selection will make you salivate. \n\nI ate here FREE. And I never intend on returning. Eat at any other buffet in Vegas for probably the same price, please, because you are wasting money and eating cheap food made with cheaper ingredients. It's rare when every single thing you try off the buffet line is borderline inedible, but it happened for me here. What a waste of time.",,,informal
1,Are you lost? Run away from this place as fast as you can! Not only the vodka will ruin your stomach but also the horrible thing they call food. At $35 ($45 with taxes and tips) the holidays menu is a total rip-off.,,,informal
1,"I've gone to hundred's of restaurants and seen my share of service blunders, but this one is the absolute worst.  It's amazing how they can make you feel like they don't care within 30 seconds of sitting down.  Waited 20 minutes to be acknowledged at the table, and saw the same happen to other couples there.  I walked out, and so did two other couples in my area.  This place is a disgrace to those hardworking restaurant owners who care about their guests.\n\nFood was garbage, and what a joke it was to watch them take the piece of meat and use the knife to move it to my plate.  I guess they were  too cheap to purchase tongs to grab the pieces.\n\nI will repeat - worst restaurant I have been in in over 10 years - avoid at all cost.",,,informal
1,"This buffet blows, do not waste your time and money here. We did not get a freakin cup of water until we were done eating. We were on dessert by the time water arrived. Our waitress sucked as well, she was pushy and did not even say hello! The only thing that came out of her mouth was \""do you want wine or not?!\"" The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND. By the time you make your plate and get to your table. It's all cold! How can a hotel that has so much money be an epic fail on their buffet? Don't get me wrong I love Aria but jesus christ all mighty. Use some of that money to teach some 101 of basic customer service to your employees for god sake. People don't want to spend a pretty penny on crap food and crap service. Oh and to top it off, my gf got FOOD POISONING. No wonder they offered a buy one get one free buffet. Do yourself a favor and go eat at the Wynn.",,,informal
1,"Horrible customer service and so hard to find anything!! No one helped me and my boyfriends daughter and I was even sitting on the floor going through a stack of shorts that were not sized and had several styles mixed in trying to find her size. There were bins of clothes in the already too small walk ways of the store and no one acknowledged us for about 20 minutes. Towards the end, as associate who seemed to have just clocked on came by to help us and suggested a couple things, but at that point the damage was done and I was over it.  I won't be heading back into a Justice anytime soon, time to find my boyfriend's 10 year old daugher a new place to shop!",,,informal
1,"We came here a few months ago, but I can definitely say I won't be back. The food and service were slow, really slow. The food was also nothing spectacular. Portions were small and dismal looking. Definitely a disappointing place for nachos and beer.",,,informal
1,So I ordered a lean machine from this place and when I left I started to drink it and it tasted like someone put all kinds of medicine in the drink it was so bad it made the hair on my arms and neck stand up and made me get shivers from drinking it. So i mixed it around a little to see if that would help and it didn't at all. I wasted money on that drink cause I had to throw it away due to it being so bad and nasty. I will never order a smoothie from this place again it was so bad and disgusting. It makes me want to throw up. DO NOT ORDER THE LEAN MACHINE FROM THIS LOCATION EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!,,,informal
1,"This was a very sad experience. We went on a Sunday night at about 7pm. The place was empty. It took some time to seat us. Tea took forever. Bread took forever. After 35 minutes waiting for simple food my dear wife got pissed and we left. Because I have honor, I wanted to pay for the tea on the way out. Even that took forever. I hoped that for the prices they charge and the fact that the place was empty that the service would be good. All I learned is why the place was empty. We then went to Cheddars next door and had a nice meal.",,,informal

They are SO unfriendly SO rude its simply redicilous! I have been to a lot of high end clubs as well as dive bars, I have hired and fired security personal, but THIS place is the end of a poop turd in security fo sho! They are rediculously rude. I got shoved out of they, hard! I got my arm pinched by some fat dude working there and I was told I am being escorted out because I had my boot off and litterally was unable to put it back on (due to the crowd being asked to float in the air since you are NOWHERE allowed to stand!) WTF!! I have been to really high end invitation only clubs in London and NY, THIS place is worse than a fat finger in my butt... I rather have my butt hair plugged individually than go THERE again EVER! \nTHe sad thing is really, it has all the potential to be a fabulous club! Its awesome setting, the dancers are just great! THe DJ is fantastic, the promoters really nice and the bartenders smile. \nBUT due to the rudness of these oger Security people, i will NEVER go back there again nor will I send any of my groups there. \n\nPeople DO NOT GO THERE until they change their attititude!!",,,informal
1,"I try to avoid this airport at all costs while connecting to other destinations.  The terminals have no tram or train and are VERY far apart from each other.  On more than one occasion the people-movers have been down for repair which makes that feature even more annoying.\n\nThe bathrooms have this hallway that is only wide enough for ONE person to fit through which makes going through with bags entertaining; especially when a flight arrives and the area is crowded with passengers rushing to the restrooms.  Yes, that's \""one person\"" for both directions.\n\nThen to add to the fun there was a last minute gate change AND it took them 20 minutes to get the jet-way to the plane.  Good times.",,,informal
1,"The last few times I was there Mia Za's almost always messed something up in our order.  The last straw was when they included nuts in my wife's salad -- I explained to them that she was allergic, they took the salad back and I watched them just pick the nuts off in the back when they thought I couldn't see them.  When they gave it back to me I explained to them that was not sufficient as she is highly allergic.  They very rudely took the salad back and made a fresh one.",,,informal
1,"I took my family for mothers day to this restaurant and what a disappoint. They got greedy, they were under staffed, overbooked and under prepared. \nIt was uncomfortably hot! The fans were broken, the misters were not available yet. On top of that the servers were so busy they couldn't refill our water glasses. It's Vegas, it's May, at 600 dollars for our table you really should be prepared. \nOur table we reserved was 30 minutes late to be seated. It would be a hour before we would eat our first plate. Which seemed mass produced standardized at best. \nThe cherry on top was when the hostess entered the bathroom and ejaculated an expletive upon finding both bathroom stalls were occupied. While this would not normally bother me in the slightest. What she did not know was that I was waiting for my 5 year old niece in the stall. The behavior of their entire staff was manic and panicked. I am sorry to write such a poor review for a place I so dearly loved. But then again Marche Bacchus let me down too.",,,informal
1,"This is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at in Vegas.  We were here for 2 nights.We got locked out of our room due to our keycards not working, not once but twice!!!  This cost me about an hr of my time. On top of all this, there was a half eaten burrito in our fridge, which smelled like a concoction of garlic and puke.  \n\nSo after all this we were only offered a $50 credit for dining! \n\nThe rooms are lacking in size and decor. The casino is small. The pool was tiny.  Why the F would any one come all the way down the strip to stay here? \n\nI will NEVER stay here again.  Wynn/encore owns this place in every respect. Don't waste your time or money.",,,informal

Perhaps I went at the wrong time.\n\nI went to Sakana for dinner and not only was the service pretty bad, the food was disappointing as well. Our hostess was impatient and forgetful. Everything at Sakana is just a variety of a the California roll and they are super generous, not in a good way, with the imitation crab. If you aren't too picky about sushi and are itching for some rice and imitation crab, this place is definitely the place to go.",,,informal
1,"I purchased a Groupon for this salon, based on the positive Yelp reviews.  The stylist I had seemed very apprehensive and inexperienced. It almost felt as if it was the first time he was cutting hair professionally (shakey and slow). \n\nHere's the kicker, I go to pay and asked what the original cost was (because I always tip on the original amount of the service) and the receptionist tells me its $35. The groupon I purchased was $30 (supposed to be a $70 value). I was shocked. I saved a total of $5 by purchasing the groupon. \n\nBottom line, they clearly reserve their higher level stylists for non-groupon clients. The whole point of the groupon is to try out a new salon and hopefully become a regular client. I suggest the folks at Folicle remember that moving forward.",,,informal

1,"If the food here was fit for an emperor, the cook would be beheaded for serving such lousy dishes.\n\nThe buffet was located inside the Imperial Palace which is an extremely long walk from the center of Vegas strip. Let me first point out that walking here was a complete waste of time and had I researched Yelp first, I never would've stepped foot in here. (My bad, I was only interested in the crab claws and my hunger got the best of me).\n\nBelieve me and everyone else that echoes the horrible (or lack of) food choices here. The crab claws were mediocre and not fresh, the vegetables were wilted (mushrooms were turning black), lobster bisque was full of salt, and the prime rib was way too dry or overcooked. The food was sitting tepid and didn't get rotated quickly enough. \n\nIf that wasn't bad enough already, I was seated at my table for a good 20 minutes before anyone cleaned my plate. I had to go grab my own sodas and not once did anyone come by to see if I needed anything.

I had called just before I came in to let them know what I wanted and to ask of they accepted Discover. When I produced my Discover debit card to pay, they said they didn't accept it. What? I had JUST asked not 30 minutes ago. So, I paid with different card and gave a $5 tip in cash. By the end of it, my nails look uneven and are not what I even wanted. I am never going back.

1,Both times I have been in here I have been disappointed.  Last time when I was look for a firearm they showed me a little pink gun I'm assuming because I'm a female. This time we came because online it states they are a full 5.11 retailer. They are not as we were only able to locate 1 polo that was 5.11. It is now the beginning of June and they still have a 2day sale sign up for 20% off 5.11 that is from May. Also because we were not looking at the firearms not a single employee spoke to us.

1,"This 24-hour Wal-Mart Supercenter is \""ghetto,\"" and when I say that I am by no means dissing their fine, diverse community of customers. I'm talking about the store, the condition of the store, and they way they treat you. \n\nPro: I bought a tire from their auto department, they mounted it quickly and charged me a fair price.\n\nCon: The store is dirty. The employees can be nasty. They are often out of staple items like milk and bread and soft drinks.

Everytime the server came to our table it was just to do one thing and we would be left in the lurch with our mouths silenced in the middle of asking for something. Finally the food came and it was actually quite delicious, I ordered the turkey eggs benedict with potatoes and fresh fruit. However once again the food was dropped off with no silverware, no condiments and no refills on the coffee. I truly hope the restaurant re-trains the staff or hires a whole new batch, because I am afraid food alone can not keep a business afloat.",,,informal

I don't understand actually having a disclaimer on your menu that you don't season your meat?! However that would explain the ridiculous amount of condiments at the table. I ordered the chicken fried steak and was saaaaaadddly disappointed. It is NOT authentic to not season this dish. It literally tasted like a cube steak dipped in a flour/water paste then deep fried. No self-respecting Texan would do this, and you certainly wouldn't add pepporcini pepper sauce or Cholula sauce to a real CFS!  The meat was not the only thing unseasoned, the chicken tenders, potatoes, biscuits and pretty much everything else was tasteless and so bad I couldn't eat it and I LOOOOVE anything fried, so this is pretty bad. We actually felt kind of bad for them when they saw how much food was on the table and we didn't want a take home box.   \n\nI advise they add salt & pepper at the least.",,,informal

These fibers look like the same plastic fibers that are coming out of people's skin who have morgellons disease.

This resulted in a miserable stay (allergies). \nIf you are catching an airport shuttle in, you will have to walk a block with your baggage to the hotel, back entrance, \nThere was a roach near the ice machine--but this may be secondary to the fact that someone dumped a salad on the floor, and it sat there for two days--after all, natural selection dictates that you need to do what you can to survive--and this roach was doing what he could to get to that salad.\nWhen the room was booked, I booked a room with a refrigerator, and was provided with a styrofoam cooler.\n There was a leak, in the first room . This leak was coming through the light fixture in the bathroom. This was due to a problem with something upstairs. The room was put out of order which meant that baggage and belongings had to be carried to another room.",,,informal
1,"Worst place i've eaten in a long time. The waitress was very indifferent to how our food was,wheather we were happy with it or not. Way over priced. Much more experience than most mexican restaurants. Whoever called this tex mex has never had real tex mex. Don't even know where it came by the the name. Give this place a pass. There are way too many restaurants in the area to go to this one. All Mexican restaurants give free chips,this one charges. You even have to request hot sauce. I wrote a complaint via the internet to Cactus Jack and they didn't even bother to respond. I hope this place goes under quickly and allows a decent restaurant to take its place.",,,informal

On top of their horrible service, the place mats was I kid you not, printer paper.

1,"I've been going to Dr Auto since 2001 when Dave, and then Mike, ran an honest, reliable, and fair shop. I never felt like I was being taken advantage of, or upsold on services and/or products I did not need. I have taken all of my cars there for repairs for 10 years and have spent over $50k in that time. I don't believe in car payments, so I buy all my vehicles at auction, or fixer uppers. The guys at Dr Auto took care of all my needs and at no time did I ever feel taken advantage of.\nAll that has changed. After Mike & Dan, the Mgr. & the chief mechanic left the employ of Dr Auto about a month ago, I thought it strange that 2 key employees would leave this place at the same time. After a couple of experiences with the new Mgr, I feel that Dr Auto seems more concerned with increasing the bottom line than the \""Hometown Service With Integrity\"", claim. (their tag phrase). I don't like to make negative comments about anyone without careful consideration, especially when those people rely on repeat buisiness to thrive, but I will not give someone I don't trust any more of my money and I can not recommend them to anyone else. Be thorough, and ask questions if you have your car repaired there. Make sure that the recommended repairs are genuinely needed. Better yet, avoid this shop and find someone you can trust.",,,informal
1,"Had a private reservation booked for our daughter's 21st birthday dinner. Imagine my shock when I arrived with 26 guests to find our room, booked since Jan, unavailable, They had booked over our reservation with a bachelorette party! I had just personally gone in a week before to introduce myself & see the space I had reserved. Met with the owner & manager DANNY, saw space, confirmed number of guests, and even discussed table set up, tab separations & high chair necessities. The manager on duty called him when we arrived & he denied ever meeting me! Needless to say, we will not return to Towne Tavern. We had family from 3 different states come for this dinner, & it was very upsetting not to have our space. I will say the manager on duty did his best to accommodate in the main dining area, but we decided to take our business elsewhere.

1,"I chose to stay at the Monte Carlo because we had a Seminar that was taking place there. First let me say,I do not understand how this place even rated as a supposed 4 star hotel in Las Vegas.\n\nWhen we first got here the line up for checking in was so long that I was embarrassed with my staff. Okay now off to the room. Maybe we can start over. Wrong!.  The room looked like they were renovated in the 80s. I would say its spacious There was an old air con/fan that made terrible noises every 2 minutes so it was useless.  The blankets are paper thin too and I caught a cold during my third nights stay.  The bathtub is so shallow and old and nasty. I didn't even want to complain because I figured they would only move to a different room with the same amenities. I would have rather stayed in a Comfort suites than this place. We were only there for 2 nights so I did not spend much time in my room. The restaurants that were in the hotel and next to it outside were overall good but nothing spectacular. I will definitely not stay here again. I will stay at The Mandalay but I wonder how does this place stay in the M Life group of Hotels.\nNeedless to say I am ready to get out of there on Sunday AM and I'm waiting in line again for over 20 minutes to check out. Sorry Avoid this place!!!",,,informal
1,"Horrible customer service.  I've had two issues with their product, the most recent being a carbon fiber backing that doesn't fit well and has crooked lines.  It's bright red so the crooked lines stand out.  It pointed out how horrible their quality control is as well. It's a very mom-and-pop amateur company, that mom-and-pop don't seem to care about. Case in point, there's three sets of instructions: online, printed on the box, and at the bottom of stuff inside the box. Only one of them is correct as it pertains to the carbon fiber sticker, which is what I purchased.\n\nI went back and forth via email and it was like talking to a robot. They want me to send it back and pay for postage, then they'll process, likely very slowly, a refund or send a different one.  Text-book bad customer service.  They just don't care.\n\nI'll upload a picture of the bad fit and crooked lines.",,,informal

Even after that, we left after just one quick lap around the festival.\n\nBeing charged to enter was robbery.  I'm not even sure what we paid for since every truck and booth was charging.

My friend trapped the roach between her empty glass and a menu, and politely called our waiter over. My friend very politely explained the situation to our waiter, and requested that he take care of the bug. He replied with something to the effect of, \""I don't know what you want *me* to do about it. I don't really like bugs either. I've never had a customer do this before.\"" We proposed multiple solutions, including getting a dustpan or taking the captive roach to the front door and releasing him. He declined both options, opting to have my friend carry the glass, roach, and menu to the door herself, while he graciously held it open for her. She sat down, even more appalled, as the waiter walked away.\n\nAfter agreeing that the service was unacceptable, my friend addressed the waiter as he brought us our check, mentioning that he should taken care of the bug next time. He took the criticism with a face plastered with offense, and stumbled over his words as he seemed to hold back greater emotions: \""I... I will...

I realize they all have to start somewhere but maybe they should be supervised ? \nI didn't leave with wet hair like others but it wasn't what I wanted my hair to look like (and pay for) . It took her an hour (!) to do that so even though I mentioned I wasn't happy I didn't have the time to stay there longer. \nThe owner was there the whole time but it doesn't seem like she supervise her staff or care about the satisfaction of her clients. \nAgain, my fault, should have trust my fellow yelpers :)\nI love seeing places opening in Arcadia, especially that they are done so well, but that is not enough to keep us coming.

The menu sounded very promising, but half of the food on there never made it to the buffet.  my husband is still looking for that duck l'orange.  The things that did make it weren't that good.  The lamb was dry, the crab legs were just gross, and the cheese and salad selection was pitiful.  The quality of the food in general was just not worthy of the price.  Before we discovered the Aladdin buffet, which doesn't exist anymore, we used to hit up the Paris buffet on every trip.  It was worth it back then with a much better selection and better quality food.  Now, you could easily get the same quality garbage at a buffet that is half the price.

We moved in and we had to sleep on a beat up mattress and a box spring that had wheels screwed into it. After 2 nights we started getting bit, it turns out the box spring had bed bugs in it. When we complained the awesome management and they accused us of bringing them in.  These cheap people would not get rid of the box spring so we threw it out. Went and bought a bed and used that for the rest of our stay. We bought the wifi that the complex offers but the signal is so bad we ended up getting a refund.

1,Worst place I've EVER experienced as far as Chinese food goes. How hard is it to f up chinese food but these guys figured it out! It started when I called in the order and the gal couldn't understand a lick of english (no surprise there) but then she kept yelling my credit card number after I read it to her over again. Along with with the security code one the back. Just f-ed up business all together and their food is substandard. Never would go back or recommend to another not based on the credit card breech but based on how crappy the food is as well. SO MANY other Chinese restaurants around. Find one that's worthy of your patronage :),,,informal
1,Run for the hills! The owner is disrespectful and doesn't know how to even act like an owner. The place is unsanitary. I  was with my girlfriend and she found a black hair in my salad. The owner at first told me the wind blew the hair into my salad and then offered to make me a side salad. My salad was an entree size. Then she tried holding on to my salad until I asked why and she said try were going to reheat the chicken that was on the salad with the hair. I told her no thank you and that's not sanitary. She got upset and I asked for a refund. I think she gave me a refund because she was afraid that the customers would have overheard me. You would think making a new salad with new chicken wouldn't be an issue but obviously money is more important to her than a loyal customer. It's unfortunate she doesn't care about her customers.,,,informal

1,"On December 19, 2014, I noticed that my outdoor freezer had a puddle of water surrounding it. I quickly ran out to Lowe's in search of a replacement freezer. We have never been a fans of the Rock Hill Lowe's, so we went to the one in Fort Mill. They told us that they would look and see if they had any in stock. Well, turns out they did not have any in stock, but they would call the Rock Hill Lowe's to check for us. It was taking quite a while to hear back from the staff in Rock Hill, so we went ahead and drove over to the Lowe's in Rock Hill, while waiting on the one in Fort Mill to give us a call on our cell phone. Fort Mill had not called us in the 15 minutes it took us to get to Rock Hill, nor did they ever call at all to let us know an answer. We were not happy with Lowe's, so we searched other stores such as Sears and Home Depot. We finally found a store with a freezer in stock, but never did we hear a response from the Lowe's in Fort Mill. Very slow and inconsiderate service. In the future, while searching for appliance needs, I will stop at Sears and Home Depot.",,,informal
1,"Grossly exaggerated positive reviews. I suspect the bulk of them were cleverly submitted by Cosmo's PR firm.  \n\nThe rooms run entirely through the television set, from lighting to temperature, yet the remote batteries were spent. I replaced them with my own just to turn the heat down. It took two days to get staff to replace numerous burned out bulbs. We finally resorted to moving bulbs around so the loo wouldn't be in utter darkness. \n\nI give this hotel one star not for any of the above but for the audacity to charge our room $68.00 for the mini-bar, which we didn't use. Audacity for their flippant attitude about an accounting error they claim is common. We were told that just opening the fridge, which we used for our own goods, triggers a charge.

He brought me back a new soup in THE SAME POT and it was the exact same soup with just coconut milk added into it. So I asked for a manager. no manager was working so I spoke with a senior employee who also didn't speak English. She explained to me that the soup was sent back and it was mixed with a soup mix since we already ate some of it (we literally had one bite and sent it back) after it getting sent back twice we finally got a new one.

Desserts were equally a mixed bag. Gelato was fine, but forget the dry little chocolate mousse pieces or even worse the over sweetened pecan tart. More green tea was needed.

I would highly recommend getting the Bacon one and adding jalepenos. \n\nAlso, if you go there for lunch and get one of their specials, it is very generica cafeteria food. Of the items served on their specials, typically one is pretty good, one is really bad (to the point you can't eat it), and one is mediocre. \n\nWhile the food passes the test for cheap quick food, what kills this place in the ratings is the cashier's ability to be unfriendly, almost all of the time. If you go there just once or twice, you wouldn't even notice it. But, if you go there most days of the week for breakfast, it starts to ruin the great breakfast burrito.\n\nI'll still eat here, but if anyone recommends anywhere else, count me in!",,,informal

This is obviously a common phenomenon on the Vegas Strip.\n\nFolks who've been to the great delis, like Katz's in NYC, Lester's in Montreal, Canter's in Los Angeles, or any of the other great delis, know what real Jewish deli food tastes like.

Ich wollte heute auf dem Ochsenfest in Hagsfeld eine Kugel Eis f\u00fcr meinen kleinen Sohn kaufen und habe um einen Pappbecher (!!!) gebeten (der Kleine hat eine Milchallergie und darf keine Waffel). Die Dame sagte mir, dass es bei einer Kugel nur eine Waffel gibt und ich 20c aufzahlen m\u00fcsste. Da die Kugel bereits EUR 0,90 kostet, war ich hierzu nicht bereit. Ich pers\u00f6nlich finde das kein gutes Gesch\u00e4ftsgebahren zudem die Preise pro Kugel schon happig sind.Heute bin ich an dieser netten Eisdiele vorbeigeradelt. Eine nette Eisverk\u00e4uferin hat mir ein Eis mit zwei Kugeln verkauft. Bis dahin glatte 5 Sterne  nett, authentisch, sauber. Das Eis allerdings hat mich nicht begeistert. Zitrone war noch ok, aber bei dem Heidelbeer Eis hatte ich ich das Gef\u00fchl in einen Schneeball zu bei\u00dfen. Eiskristalle, die auch zu sehen waren. Nichts cremiges, sondern eher so der aufgetaut und dann wieder eingefroren Effekt (wobei ich das nicht unterstellen m\u00f6chte). Vielleicht h\u00e4tte man das Eis ein wenig l\u00e4nger r\u00fchren k\u00f6nnen. Die Waffel war auch nicht der Hit und daher habe ich diese entsorgt. Hat mich schwer an Esspapier erinnert.

Quantities were not adequate for the amount we were paying.Is Indian food really that expensive here in Madison? The prices here are ridiculously overpriced for Indian food and every single Indian restaurant has the same price range for all dishes which would make me believe that they have some sort of Indian restaurant owners union that decides on what the prices are going to be!!\nAnother thing that irks me is the inclusion of south Indian food along with your Rogan Josh menu which raised a big flag for us regarding the quality of the food. No serious Indian restaurant owner would EVER include a idli sambar dosa on a menu that has Rogan Josh or biryani on it.PERIOD!\nJust looking at the quantity of dishes on the menu and we knew this was going to be your below average Indian fare.Definitely not coming back here.Unless of course the prices go down..way down.",,,informal

We were not looking for some five star experience , just some decent tasty Chinese.\n\nWe had the Sarawak salad which included pieces of overfried duck  on top of some mixed leaves ,followed by the Ah Sin special fried rice and the Mongolian beef. \n\nThe special fried rice was not very special at all and very bland and under spiced. \n\nWhen I ordered the Mongolian beef the waiter told me it was going to be spicy , which  I have no problem with. However when we received the food it was not at all spicy and appeared to have been doused in some gloppy sauce and then sat on top of some packet noodles.\n\nMy overall impression of this place is that it is geared for the blandest palate  possible in order not to offend people who are not used to decent Szechuan or Cantonese food.",,,informal

But his sly business did not end there. When the bill came out, he charged $12.99 for each of us, when it said $11.99 right on the window of his restaurant. On top of that, he charged 15% automatic gratuity for a party of FIVE people !

Ordered fajitas and there was very little meat... it was beyond ridiculous. Hardly any peppers but a plethora of what looked like stewed tomatoes. Look... I'm a gringa and I know that don't look right and I could do a way better job. The rice was missing completely and there was only one giant pizza pie looking tortilla. We called and the person who answered could barely speak English (which is really not a big deal in my book) but there was no manager around to resolve the situation. We asked for an email so we could send a note about the experience but she was unhelpful. All she offered was for us to come back right then...which if you were as hungry as my fiance was not an option. He gets grumpy and I know better than mess with a grumpy-hungry-pants.,,,informal

Besides the lack of aesthetics, there were hardly any specialty donuts! Their selection was dismal and disappointing. I was not going to pay for an over priced glazed donut that I could get anywhere else. I have tried the Fat Elvis donut before and it was amazing.

BUT, within a day of getting the vehicle back the check engine light came on and now my a/c does not work. I popped the hood to see about the battery (as it was suppose to be replaced, it was) and under the hood there were bolts sitting on the side by the battery. I have no idea if they belong to my vehicle. There was also a rag tucked on the other side of the hood. The plastic cover on my neg. battery cable was sitting by the valve cover instead of being put back on or discarded. And the wiring harness which was accessed during the repair was not rewrapped and the wire that was worked on was completely exposed.

While the hot dogs are of good quality, they honestly have the blandest, odd tasting chili I have ever had.  First off, I don't like beans in hot dog chili.  Second, it didn't really add any flavor.  It just gave it an odd texture.  They are also overpriced.  Their onion rings weren't all that good either.  Lots of microbrews makes one hope for beer battered onion rings.  Nope!  Just crappy almost store bought low quality breaded onion rings.  And change your fry oil once in a while!  So to sum up, beer: good.  Food: sucks.",,,informal

The suite we had was also a joke, the refrigerator was so small that it couldn't hold a 12 pack of beer that we have brought. The sink was really small too. Everything in the room seemed dirty and stained. The worst part came when I was actually going to sleep. As i pull back the covers, I saw about  3 different kind of bugs scatter among the sheets. I complained, and got transferred into another room, which also had the same bug problem. At this point I went to the front desk and demanded a refund, but they told me that I had to contact Groupon for the refund. I didnt sleep at all that night, as I spent the night in the car with temperatures of 95 degrees. I'have never had such a bad experience, their customer service was so horrible.

People in my group were even clearly overcharged, and staff was not accommodating or gracious, even when they admitted it was their mistake. \n\nThe inside was seedy, but not in a fun, dive bar way.  The layout was awkward, and their excuse for a patio WAY too small for the size of the bar.  Their name is accurate, the Dirty Drummer was just that - dirty - and I won't be back.",,,informal

We asked them why they couldn't tell us that there were extra fees over the phone when we called and they just said \""well that's how it is\"".   We would be happy to pay the extra money, but not when they intentionally fail to tell us to accomodate their business.  \n\nUpon picking our dog up, no one greeted me as I entered the door, so I stood there waiting as they were all staring at me, until someone had the descency to acknowledge a customer.  They were rude, very unfriendly, and did not seem to care about the animals.  \n\nOur dog seemed a little traumatized after we brought her home to bathe and feed her.  \n\nI DO NOT recommend this place to anyone!",,,informal

If you're lucky enough to get a good pair that's discounter it could work to your benefit on saving money, but other than that this location has really fell in business and in service.

They don't put any effort into sanitizing the tools or the pedicure bowl. I actually saw them clean the brushes and tools in the water I was soaking my feet in and then just rinse out the bowl after they were done... not spray, soap, nothing!\n2. Reason #1 probably explains why my heals cracked so severely after my pedicure that they began to bleed.  I had to use peroxide, neosprin, and bandages for almost a week to get it heal. \n3. They water down their nail polish... so much that it destroys the bond and polish never actually dries. \nI hate to bash a business with good customer service, but these practices are simply unacceptable.

Also now there's bums and drunks laying asleep on the benches and no one seems to go anything about it. I'm so glad I don't have yo deal with this anymore!!!!,,,informal
1,"Service?  What service?  From the moment you enter this place you begin to wonder about your personal health and safety.  After hundreds of times driving by this place, some friends and I decided to stop in for the Tuesday wing night, and we left with the opinion that none of us would ever be making a return visit.  I'm not sick YET, but I guess we'll have to find out what the morning brings.  YOU CAN DO BETTER in this neighborhood, so don't expect much more than a crappy beer poured out of a questionable tap system into a partially-cleaned glass.  And if you're getting something to eat, say a few Hail Marys first.  (Actually, you'd be better off going half a mile down the street and getting a Fiori's pizza to go!)",,,informal

I normally could care less about attitude however, from the first moment I stepped in the restaurant I was surprised that the hostess did not like the fact that I did not speak Korean (I am Korean by birth, adopted by white parents).  \n\nI didn't think too much of it until the waitress, who said 5 words to me acted as if I was a turd in the chair.  The food was very average, (pork bulgogi).  I only saw the waitress when I ordered and when the food was delivered to the table.  After that She decided to avoid the disgraceful Twinkie sitting in her section.  \n\nI wanted to see how long after I completed my meal it would take for some attention (or the bill).  I waited 25min until I had enough and I waved the waitress for my bill.  The stone face hostess didn't ask me anything just swiped my amex and off I went. \n\nI would be ashamed to work in an environment where my employees never smiled or cared about their customers.

I walked up to an employee at the Genius Bar and told him what was going on, he looked at his iPad and told me I'd have to come back in 3 hours so someone could look at it for me. I was astonished because there was at least 5 employees standing in a circle talking amongst each other none of which were helping any customers. Needless to say, I turned around and walked right out. Went to T-Mobile instead and experienced the best customer service.

1,This place has completely given up. I don't know if they have had new owners within the last 4 months or so but its gotten really bad. Unless your one of the regulars who have probably been drinking since 11am you don't get much attention here.\n\nJust went there tonight for the 35 cent wings on Monday night. Waited 5 minutes before the lazy waitress decided to come greet me. Placed my order right away as I could tell how often I would see her again. Just got 2 dozen wings. ....... 45MINS LATER my wings show up. Not exaggerating at all. NEWSFLASH- Wings take 8mins in the fryer...why would I have to wait 45mins??? When they finally showed up I let her know Ill just take them to go since Im out of time. She didn't seem to care at all I was clearly upset. Also NOT ONE TIME did she refill my drink...not one time. And to top of the whole fun experience I get the check to find out they have stopped the wings deal on Monday. \n\nIts sad cause I used to go here with all my friends every Monday and this place had good waitresses who cared but like I said earlier these people now don't care one bit. NEVER AGAIN. Thank Jackie for the great experience and hope you can find another dump hole to work in 6 months when this place is closed.,,,informal

He seemed annoyed with us because we just ordered fried oysters and lots of drinks(it was Friday and happy hour, so we were sitting around chatting and drinking)  we were actually going to order an entre and stay for dinner but Bo seemed very disinterested in us, until it came time to pay the bill, then he was really nice(tip time!

We went all out.  I decided on Tryst for our last night in Vegas and called a month ahead to reserve a table.  The manager said \""no problem\"" and took my name.  This was the first time I reserved a table at a bar and didn't have to put down a credit card- weird.  Well, I found out why we didn't need a credit card, when 8 of us arrived we passed up the line and were told at the door that they didn't have our reservation.  I called the idiot I booked with and he finally returned my call an hour later mumbling about being sorry.  No \""sorry\"" would ever make up for that, I had 8 girls wondering what the hell was going on, plus the night was ruined for my sister- which I can't stand to think about.  I can't redo a bachelorette party\n\nThere are a lot of nightclubs to choose from in Vegas!

1,"Pamela's is an abomination of a breakfast place that represents the worst of everything.  However, to make up for the food being awful, you will have to wait on line for 20 minutes and then dine in cramped and uncomfortable seating.\n\nIt is, for some reason, unfathomably popular.  The best thing on the menu is their crepe-like pancakes, which are nicely crisped on the edges.  They are nicely crisped on the edges because they are cooked in a disgusting margarine-like substance that always leaves me, personally, feeling a bit ill.  The coffee is forgettable, the eggs are passable, the bacon is inevitably chewy -- which right there should cause someone to be marched out to the firing squad -- and their lyonnaise potatoes are insultingly limp (and, like the pancakes, soaked in margarine).\n\nIf you are dragged here by your friends, find new friends.  If you can't do that, then try to get one of the pancakes that come with some sort of whipped or sour cream.  Not because they're better, mind you, but because at least the cream will help balance the fat that comes from a machine with fat that, at some point in its history, came from a cow.\n\nBetter alternatives to Pamela's in Pittsburgh:  on the 'nice' end, Coca Caf\u00e9 or even Square Caf\u00e9, on the 'greasy spoon' end either DeLuca's or JoJo's.\n\nFrankly, I think I'd rather eat the completely boring and institutional breakfasts at Eat and Park than go to Pamela's again.

Oh Lord!\nFirst of all, we bought discount tickets and my friends each said that the show wasn't even worth the 50% markdown. I didn't mind as much, because I was intoxicated and at least got a good laugh.\n\nThis review is not a criticism of the talent. Most of the performers were fit and good at what they did, although there were a few outliers... \n\nThere were a few scenes that had all the pomp and circumstance that I expected, like the Samson and Delilah scene... and the finale.\n\nBut overall there were waaaay too many males onstage (is that normal? Idk but it was unexpected), and it was SO SO disjointed. The show was just a thrown together mess of scenes- all over the place chronologically, not enough showgirl stuff, and some of the most God-awful music.\n\nThe classic recognizable songs were okay, but often matched to boring and redundant choreography.  The Beyonce references were random and irrelevant, which is sad because I am a Beyonce fan.\n\nAll in all, it was very much a middle-school caliber show in terms of plot/theme/cohesiveness, which is not Vegas-appropriate, to say the least.\n\nI sincerely hope someone steps in and fixes this mess because it would be SO sad if the showgirl went extinct!

I had to ask for a fork 3 times because every fork I received was dirty with either dried food and soap scum! The rotisserie chicken was drier than a sponge, the homemade mashed potatoes taste like they were made with spoiled milk and the beef brisket looked like a patio desk, it was completely dried out. \n\nFor $49 at The Bellagio, I expected mouth watering selections and got the total opposite. So if you're hungry and don't care about the taste and it's convenient, then enjoy, but I just wasted $50. \n\nOh and no Crab Legs until 3:30pm and no creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, I'm SO done.

Food was salty and the waiter never came by to bring me more water, even after asking for more water.  With 5 adults and 2 kids we were automatically charge a 20% gratuity!

1,We had high expectations with the good yelp reviews but did not have a good experience.  I ordered my rare bone in fillet and a bunch of appetizers.  The first steak was way overlooked to the extent that I needed to send it back.  They brought out another steak which was cooked well but it was the worst cut of filet mignonette that I've ever had.  There was a fatty gristle everywhere through the steak.  When I asked about this I was gold the chef was extremely insulted that I sent the first steak back.  I ate about half of the second steak but didn't finish because of the strings of fat running through the steak.  I feel like the chef gave me a shitty cut because he was insulted that he overcook end the steak.  The problem is that a $83 steak should be as close to perfect as possible and unfortunately the steak can't be uncooked.,,,informal

I was only going to stay for two nights, and by the time I had decided to go the Bellagio rates were higher than I wanted to pay for given the quick stay over.  Since Planet Hollywood was just across the street from the Bellagio, and the rate seemed reasonable, I decided to stay there.\nI won't say that it was a horrible experience, but I was definitely disappointed.  The rooms are dated and didn't feel exceptionally clean.  The decor has a 1990's vibe to it.  I'm not sure how much of it is carryover from the Aladdin revamp prior, but it wasn't up to what I would consider \""current Strip standards\"".  It seems appropriate that this is Britney Spears anchor arena for her shows - it has a slightly \""trashy\"" feel to it. \nSome of the issues that I had regarding the room were:\n- missing front of one of the drawers\n- strange odor from the faucet water in sink\n- pull chain shades that kept sticking\nI can see being in my 20's and coming here to have a raging time, but those days are a little bit behind me at this point and would rather opt for comfort and modern amenities (like at Aria) than \""just a place to crash\"" at the end of a long night.",,,informal

Buffets in Las Vegas that are good are slammed with people even the mediocre ones have lines.  This place, was dead at 7 pm on a Wednesday.  We go out to eat on Wednesdays and we sometimes go to Buffets.  When we do go to Buffets they are slammed with people and have long lines.  This place you just walk right on up, pay you money and go grab a plate.  Problem is, is that buffets rely on turn over so the food doesn't just sit under the heat lamps and get old.  This place had nothing but food under the heat lamps that looked old.  They had Prime Rib but every last piece of it was cooked well done.  The whole place was terrible food.

The teriyaki vegetable consisted of STEAMED carrots, cauliflower, and broccoli made from frozen vegetables.  There was a minimal amount of some kind of ginger soy sauce almost sprinkled on. The veggies were floating in water since it appears they were microwaved and barely drained. This was $8 and the worst attempt at a teriyaki dish that I've ever seen.

You have to realize this ruins the whole experience from the start.   It's all fabricated hype - excessively limit the seating and parking, always have a waitlist, and viola you've created the appearance of overflowing demand.\n\nIf you go immediately when they open you can often get a seat at the bar and then things are tolerable - just get the individual slices with beer and they'll get you in and out of there fast.  You won't have to listen to complicated explanations for why their pizza takes so long.  They also haven't adjusted the music volume up louder and louder yet either, so again... go when they open.

Our charcoal wasn't replaced even once during our stay. On my way to the bathroom, I ran into our server and had to ask her to change our charcoal and she said yes. She never came. Minutes later, another lady popped in asking if we were ok, I said we need our charcoal replaced. She appeared to be an owner or manager or something as she walked over to the area behind the bar and talked to someone, then came back saying someone will be right out. No one came. We decided to just walk to the bar area to pay our bill. We were the only two Asian guys in the entire place and I'm led to believe that had something to do with it as one server changed the charcoal in the booth to our right, blatantly skipped us, then did the booth to our left.

This location is just serving the basics.\n\nI had the Chicken Sigsig, a Whole Chicken, Garlic Rice and the Halo-Halo. \n\nThe Chicken Sigsig lacked flavor. It tasted like mayo mixed with day old chicken and slices of jalapeno. For a better tasting Sigsig , I recommend dining at Cafe Moda.\n\nThe Whole Chicken was moist and tender. I enjoyed crunching on the crispy chicken skin. Though, I still don't know what the hype is over the chicken's flavor. My guess it lacked in this chicken.\n\nThe Garlic Rice was good. \n\nLastly, I ordered the Halo-Halo. Delicious! The best in all Las Vegas.\n\nThe wait staff were polite and friendly.\n\nBy the way, don't ask for water. Its tap unfiltered hard water. Ask for bottled water.\n\nIn conclusion, the food is bland and lacks authentic flavor and the menu items are over priced. I wouldn't come back for the entrees until Max's Beef Caldereta is put on the menu to try.  For now I'll continue to dine at Max's in Glendale, CA.

1,"I would go to many fast food chains with happy hour and had no issues with paying happy hour prices for takeout. Unfortunately, not at America's Taco Shop on 16th and Camelback.  For two carne asada tacos and one order of chips and salsa-$8.09. My first time here in the city coming from another state,  and for that price, I thought a burrito was a better deal. I had to change my order right away.  The guy taking my order was not happy that he had to \""delete everything\"" and a bad attitude went with the deleted order; talk about terrible service and understanding from someone who can speak good english. I would understand if the place was busy but it was empty. I had to leave that place QUICK! Never felt that uncomfortable being in a fast food restaurant and I would certainly not want to try the food after that experience. I can take my money elsewhere!\n\n After reading the reviews on yelp, so happy I didn't try it and went with a healthier option. And the guy who stood at the cashier  happily shouted as I walked out the door, \""Thanks Annie!\"" How condescending can he be, and its not good for customer service. He really sucks.

1,"The wife and I joined another couple on a Hoover Dam Tour.  Part of the tour package was lunch at the Miracle Mile Shops upon our return, along with a voucher with Whittlesea Cab to get us from the mall back to our hotel.  Sounds like a winner, right?\n\nAlas, not to be.  At the end of a VERY long day, I called the number on the voucher, and got the dispatcher.  This incredibly arrogant and rude woman proceeded to tell me that Whittlesea does NOT send out cabs to pick up customers with vouchers.  I'd have to wait at the mall until a Whittlesea Cab showed up by dropping off other customers.  BUT...if I wanted to pay, she'd be glad to send one out for us.  Given that we were seeing one cab (of ALL the cab companies) show up every five minutes, we all decided to just jump in the next cab.\n\nBased on this dispatcher, you could not PAY me to ever utilize Whittlesea Blue Cab.  I'm in Vegas for business six to eight weeks every year, and NONE of the cabs I jump into will say Whittlesea on the side, I assure you.\n\nStay away.  Stay far away.",,,informal

I've worked retail as well and I get it's stressful when it's busy but it's just apart of the job. Probably wouldn't have a job if it weren't busy. She continued to be rude to me, my friends and the other patrons in the shop. When we got to the register, the girl wanted to make sure we found everything we were looking for, politely we said yes, and the line behind us was growing. When a second girl tried to open the other register, the store manager humiliated her by rudely telling her not to do this and she needed to count stock. And the stock was just tank tops on a table that there were plenty of. It surprised me that she would speak to the staff so harshly, especially when she was trying to get the patrons to make purchases.

If they tell you that 777 Towing can be there sooner than any other service, don't believe it.  After being told they would be there in 45 mins to 1 hour, the next message was that it would be 90 minutes.  When that time had passed, it would then be another 30-35 minutes.  When that time passed, it was then going to be another 30-35 minutes.  After a LIVID discussion with them, got a call from the insurance company that their truck had broken down and they couldn't make it at all.  That was never mentioned in any conversations directly with them.  Insurance company contacted another towing company, and they arrived exactly when they said.

We'd read the reviews it had already got on Yelp but I was convinced that they couldn't be true. Unfortunately they turned out being completely accurate. The menu wasn't particularly varied and their weren't very many choices. I ended up getting the BBQ Chicken Melt while my boyfriend got the Chicken Carbonara and we got Garlic Bread to start. We were served our starter fairly quickly and I can't fault the Garlic Bread - it was definitely the best part of the meal. Our main meals took a while to come out and when they were eventually brought to us my chicken was pink/undercooked. I ended up eating a few chips and accidentally ate half a chicken fillet before realising it wasn't cooked properly. We didn't bother staying for dessert. The service was subpar and the restaurant is definitely overpriced for the portions that you get, when we got our bill we were certain they'd counted it wrong.

My take on it is: Aush (beef yougurt soup with mint, garlic etc) A bit too tart for my liking otherwise sublime ( I'm also assuming less spicy than usual)\nAubergines(or Eggplant), again too tart for my liking and less impressive than the indian version( more caramelizing of ingredients in the Indian one). Afghani naan: seemed home made but tough and chewy always a bad bread ( which naan is essentially) recipe.\nTurkish coffee: good \n\nService: Good and very helpful though I suspect they were a bit wary of all the questions I asked\n\nSecond Try: A resounding failure. Went in for the Lunch buffet and was hoping to get sone good nosh seeing their choice spread. However each item was poorly made. Their Lamb soup with lentils had gone rancid ( and was to cause me to taste this meal several times that day).

They neglected to  give them all of the orders and we didn't realize this until they got home. To top it off it was my order they left out! The milkshake we got basically was this... Flavored milk... And for charging $4 something for the Oreo chocolate shake that is unacceptable! So my husband is  enroute to go fix the issue meanwhile his dinner is getting cold! We tried to call the store and no one answers but it gives you an option to speak with headquarters.. What good will that do?! Ugh. Will most likely not be returning to this smash burger!,,,informal

And putting off writing a paper.\nI went here last summer after trying to get into Tryst (What was I thinking, I know.)  I'm sorry, but this place was G to the HETTO.  It was packed to the maximum at about 4 AM. You could barely get through the crowd.  And no joke, immediately upon entry, this guy's hand went precariously toward my bosom (yes, bosom) and I whacked him against the wall with a strength I hadn't realized I had, much like a mother pulling a car off of her child.  Anyway.\nI did have a majorly strong, majorly expensive Tokyo Tea here.  AND the skanky bartendress didn't give me back any change, when I should have gotten twenty bucks back.  She finally gave it back although I know she thought I was lying. It was majorly busy so who knows.\nToo crowded to dance, too meat markety.

1,Had the taboule there. If it wasn't for me being as hungry as I was with little other options at the food court I would not have ate it. What was supposed to be bright green was bordering on brown. It resembled the color of canned spinach!

I'm talking epically poor service. We sat there for 15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. Over 45 minutes for a hot dog & fries? And if you want a refill on your drink, you'd better order it when your current one is only half empty. So what is it? Understaffed? Poor planning?

1,"Wanted to try Beach Pizza, since it's closer than the place I usually go to, Roccos NY Pizza.  Large 3 item Pizza, chicken parm sub, and an order of buffalo wings.  \nThe whole order of food, was sub-par, at best.  The buffalo wings, were terrible, smelled weird, oily, little wing sauce, ate a few, dumped the rest.  The Chicken Parm sub was mushy with too little chicken and too much sauce and cheese.  The pizza was kinda like Dominos, cardboardy crust, not the worst ever, but far from good.  For the prices, not a real good value.  For 1/2 the price, might be worth consideration for folks who usually order Pizza-Hut, Dominos, or Papa John's.\nNice friendly staff and fast service, was the only bright spot.

1,"We spent months with our child in the 2s and 3s class & we had many concerns. I wrote an email to the 2 teachers. I praised them for their dedication & effort. I also expressed our concerns. After so much time spent with the 2 teachers, I had grown to admire, respect, and like them both. They never returned my email or talked to me again. We got an email from the director who, despite our time in the classroom, dismissed all of our concerns and disinvited our son from the school. This was very painful and unexpected. But it was the best thing for him. We got him into a play based school & helped toilet train, & provided food, & was cheaper, & had better hours, & had fewer holidays . I heard the teacher is now teaching older kids which I think is a better fit for her skills. The staff & faculty, parents, grounds are nice, & the kids are great. But it is not a good value, very friendly to working parents, & has too many holidays. Love & Logic is not for us. I don't know if it was a culture of pride that interfered with their ability to discuss my concerns.

1,We came here for breakfast and were really looking forward to it based on the reviews online. I think we came here at the wrong time. We got seated and it took a while to get drinks and order taken (about 10-15 minutes). We finally got to order our coffee but we received without a creamer. The gentleman mentioned he would be back but he did not return. We asked a bus boy for the creamer cleaning the other table and he brought us a dirty one with fresh jam all over the bottom. We asked our waiter for another creamer. We both decided to order their eggs benedict (I ordered the Florentine and my boyfriend ordered the crab).The Florentine was the worst I have ever had. The eggs were sloppy and the asparagus was small cut up piece. I almost sent it back because I thought the asparagus was missing. I am a big fan of eggs florentine and I was surprised to not see fresh asparagus. The asparagus looked like cut up pieces of artichoke hearts. Our English muffins were overly buttered and took away from the meal. My boyfriend didn't finish his crab benedict. It was salty and the overly buttered muffin didn't help. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing here today. The coffee was the best thing about our meal.,,,informal

It was a mistake. \nI have had sushi in many places such as Tokyo's fish market, San Francisco, NYC, Stockholm, Buenos Aires.  Some were good and some were bad. And this place is one of the worst. Look at the picture I took and you can see that the fish was not fresh. The owner is Vietnamese which was a sign. I should have trusted my gut feelings.\nThe service was bad. Not even a thank you. I did see that they had a wifi on my phone network but the owner said it's for private use only. Many other restaurants have free wifi in the area. They have done such a good job not trying to provide any service at all.  Ordered 15 pieces combo and 7 pieces are avocado sushi. With a bottle of water and its almost CAD $20.

1,"So I decided to venture out around my neighborhood and found this place. Here is my review: Upon entry I knew this would be an odd experience. It looked more like a smoothie place versus a Thai food restaurant. Other than not having proper Thai spices (think fish oil, chilies, etc..) the pad Thai was sub-par at best! My boy got the sweet and sour chicken and was not to happy with the familiar taste of mediocre food! This was a huge disappointment. The Thai Ice Coffee wasn't too good either. And to think about it, the Thai iced tea kinda sucked as well. Over all this was a fake Thai food joint. I will NEVER return to this establishment.",,,informal

I heard of such a thing being 30 minutes prior to check-in due to security reasons, we were at the 35 minute point so they definetely said no.

Funny cuz Allegiant does no such thing.\n\nSo we were stuck in Reno for the night and got the next flight out, said my buddies bag was to large for the over head compartment, yet it was fine on the arrival.  So he had to pay.  The couple in front of us had a bag that weighted 51 pounds, 1 pound over and gave them grief.

First of all I should say that we only paid $62 including tax and resort fee for one night, so our expectations were not high - I realise you get what you pay for. But we paid for a non-smoking room, and got a non-smoking room which stank of cigarette smoke - yuck. \n\nWe did actually get upgraded from the smallest/most basic type to a \""King suite\"". However, this just meant a bigger bed (this was admittedly comfy) and a bigger but weird-shape room. Our TV was so far from the bed that the remote wouldn't work without us getting up and walking across the room!\n\nThe room was clean but dated, and despite having our AC set to 66, we both woke up sweating in the heat in the night. \n\nWifi, often free in cheap hotels, was $12 for 24 hours, but whereas with the Cosmo I could use the Internet anywhere in the building, here I could only get a (patchy) signal in the room. The speed was appalling and it kept dropping out completely. \n\nFinally, our shower only gave us lukewarm water in the morning.\n\nOverall we couldn't wait to get out of this place.",,,informal

Too many extra fees, you have to babysit the delivery man and accounting for credits due, overpriced milk, bread and produce that never lasts until the expiration date, and of course the small print in the contract that requires 40 deliveries before cancellation or a $50+ cancellation fee. It doesn't seem like a big deal until you realize what a waste of money it all is and find yourself skipping every delivery. You are better off buying your milk and bread at Trader Joes or Fresh & Easy and your produce at the farmers' market.",,,informal

1,"Let me start by saying, I had hoped for great things  at Rao's. I mean the place was packed, we had to wait to get in. The food looked and smelled great. But then after waiting over a half hour, we finally get seated, and then reality hit! Rao's is great if you have no sense of taste and love bland food. They are known for their meatballs so a few of us ordered those. Let me tell you, the meatballs in the frozen section at the supermarket were better. Very bland. The lasagna? Again, not the worst I have ever had but very far from the best. Again, the ladies at the local church make better pasta dishes than Rao's and their lasagna does not cost $30. But the worst of the meal was the peas, onions and prosciutto.  What were they thinking? The  prosciutto was so tasteless! How do you make it so bland? \n\nAnyhow if you are thinking of eating at Rao's, don't. If you want to spend big bucks on a meal in Vegas, go over to the Bellagio and try their buffet, the locals love it. Or try FireFly Tapas over on Paradise Rd.

He was pleasant, but completely overwhelmed.\n\nThe food itself tasted as if it had been left out all day and simply reheated.  The chips were stale and the salsa tasted suspiciously like the crappy Ortega stuff you buy in the supermarket.  My shrimp dish was so disastrous that I only ate half of it because I was afraid it might make me sick.  The shrimp were overcooked to the point of turning into rubber, and the sauce was nauseating.  The rice was overcooked and dry, and the green salad of lettuce and carrots was steamed!   This was without a doubt the worst mexican I have ever eaten in my life.\n\nMy wife thought her tacos were bland, but much more edible than my shrimp, even though the cheese was not authentic, or tasty at all.",,,informal

I asked her if she knew that the prices on my bill were different than those on the website menu. She told me something that really didn't make sense.

When I went back a couple weeks later for a polish change, Cindy the Mutilator had me \""soak\"" my fingers in acetone for all of 1 second before she took a dremel to my nails (mind you, my REAL nails, NOT acrylic!) and proceeded to cut the cuticle and skin of six of my fingers. How the other four escaped her wrath, I don't know. Then she had me soak again in acetone and then alcohol - ow, ow, ow! I was in tears. Now here I am with six bleeding phallanges and was still expected to pay full price. Never again! There are hundreds of nail salons out there, DO NOT GO HERE!",,,informal

1,"I'm a snob when it comes to restaurant service.  I expect good service and tip accordingly.  The service did not disappoint.  The food, however, needs some major revamping.  I had a half a rack of their supposedly award winning baby back ribs.  The meat was dry and had absolutely no flavor.  The two sides I ordered were the fried okra and the mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese looked and tasted like it came out of a Kraft Mac and Cheese box.  Also had the three item sampler:  onion straws, fried pickles, and burnt ends.  I kid you not, there was literally a puddle of oil under the wax paper in the basket that held the appetizers.  TGIF's baby back ribs are much more flavorful and their meat is much more savory.  Will definitely not be returning to this place.  Plus one star for the service experienced.",,,informal

Flat, straight, no trees to intimidate and very forgiving and you don't have to think, just swing. i dont stay here long enough and play often enough but this course to my short observation is not as pack as the other courses around, say Superstition, Ken MacDonald, Dobson.... etc. i tee off alone and ended up foursome at 11th hole. anyway the deserted course couple with very forgiving course layout i managed to finish the 18 in less than 3 hours, and i might add, shooting in the mid 70s. to boost your ego yea play Koko or else, for visitors spend your money at Las Sendas, Southern Dunes, Foothills, Clubwest, Ocotillo and many more.

He jumped from one client to another. He started with my hair and did 4 other clients in between while I waited!! Finally he finished and I just wanted to get out if there. When I got home and took a closer look at my highlights, they were yellow. I asked if he used a toner and he said no. He didn't offer to tone my hair or fix the color. I had to go to another salon to have them tone it. In a matter of days my extensions (that Eli did) started to fall out. He told me to come back and he would fix them, which he did but in a matter weeks all my extensions fell out! So AGAIN I had to go to another salon to redo/fix my highlights and extensions. I asked Eli for a refund due to the poor job he did and the lack of effort in which he tried to fix my hair! I bought my own extensions which cost $400.  He charged me $400 but only offered to refund me $100! I had to threaten to take him to small claims court for him to only refund me $150. This was months later so I just took the $150.

1,"This is, by far, the WORST Corporate Starbucks I've ever been to. The service is horrible, it takes longer than necessary to receive my drinks and everything is always so messy. The only reason why I keep coming back here is the convenience because I live right down the street.\nI work at the Starbucks in the Mandalay Bay next to the House of Blues, and even though it's not a corporate Starbucks, we still hold all the same procedures and values. \nWhenever I go into this particular Starbucks, it takes forever to be acknowledged if it's not busy. When my order is being taken, they're usually very rude or preoccupied with things other than their actual job- for example they're talking to eachother about their personal lives or how their shift has been going. If I just order one drink it will take around 5 - 10 minutes, depending on how distracted by conversation the baristas are. If I need milk from the condiment bar, it's usually expired already or there is no milk at all.\nForget it if I'm going through the drive thru. I have about three different rewards accumulated on my Starbucks cards because when I let them know that I have a reward, I just get ignored and they charge me the full price anyway.\nLong story short, the workers give off a nasty, snarky attitude and they take forever to make the simplest of things.",,,informal

My batch was very salty, but seeing the wait and the relative absence of attention to customers, I didn't bother to do anything about it. The menu is very short and routine extras like added cheese or salsa require added payment. Maybe the other yelpers had an exceptional experience with the burritos, but this is my review based on what I sampled.  There is just nothing redeeming to explain the level of loyalty this location garners.  There is no indoor seating;  you cant eat outdoors on the provided plastic picnic table on a sunny day without risking a skin burn!.  On the inside you face a server who takes your order from behind a grill; there are at most 4-5 plastic chairs to sit on while you wait.

The final bill was for more things than what I needed, which meant I paid for more than what I'd hoped to receive.  Also the glasses I purchased are transition polycarbonate lenses.  Up until a year into it, they were fine.  Since then the transition film has become covered in tiny cracks covering the entirety of both lenses.  Naturally they only guaranteed their work for 1 year.  \nBeware of the transition lenses from this place.  Do your research first! Transitions Optical, the company that created these lenses that darken in sunlightt, says you should get a certificate of authenticity at the time of purchase and are warrantied by Transitions Optical for two years.

The portion size of the accompanying cole slaw with a half sandwich was minuscule, rendering it nearly invisible, which was disappointing given its commendable taste. The corned beef sandwiches were satisfactory but lacked exceptional quality, despite their substantial size, which seemed to be the primary focus. The restaurant's entrance presented a chaotic atmosphere, with various sections including check-in, registration, takeout, and merchandise display, while the seating area appeared unremarkable. In summary, this establishment fails to meet the standards of a genuine Jewish deli, despite its attempts to emulate one, and falls short in both appearance and flavor, although it does have an advantage over other places outside of the coastal regions.

""I placed an order for a lasagna, a dinner salad, and a bowl of soup, specifically the Italian wedding variety, which, to my utter dismay, bore a striking resemblance in taste to Italian dressing, thereby diminishing its erstwhile appeal. Previously, this particular soup had been a hallmark of excellence, but unfortunately, it seems that either a change in culinary approach or a lackadaisical cooking attitude has resulted in an unfortunate transformation. Despite my initial enthusiasm, I opted to reserve the remaining portion for a subsequent meal, in the hopes of securing a refund from the establishment, as opposed to merely receiving a replacement product. Alas, the anticipated refund proved elusive, and I was ultimately compelled to consume the soup at a later time, albeit with a lingering sense of disappointment. Notwithstanding this setback, the lasagna itself was quite satisfactory, although its sweetness quotient was somewhat excessive. Furthermore, the cost-to-portion ratio left much to be desired, prompting me to consider preparing a comparable dish at home, with the added benefit of being able to portion and store it for future consumption. In contrast, the dinner salad was truly exceptional, boasting an abundance of fresh, crisp vegetables that more than compensated for the slightly soggy lettuce. However, the dressing, which appeared to be straight from a bottle, contained an excessive amount of sugar that bordered on being nauseating. Were the establishment to address these issues by improving the dressing and draining the lettuce more effectively, I would eagerly partake of this salad on a biweekly basis.

Soups were nothing special. Ribs were pretty good but unless you like LOTS of sauce, ask for it on the side. Bands were very good on this night. I ended up only drinking three drinks that night because that seemed to be all they wanted to sell me. Couldn't seem to get anyone's attention for more.

2," I visited this establishment in the company of some colleagues for a post-work social gathering and was left feeling underwhelmed. Despite its advantageous location overlooking Market Square, the eatery's culinary offerings and hospitality fell short of expectations. We capitalized on the happy hour special featuring margaritas and found them to be satisfactory. Everyone partook in these potent potables and relished them. 
  During this promotional period, appetizers were available at a reduced price, prompting us to order multiple dishes to share among ourselves. My sampling of sopecitos consisted of four substantial corn tortillas, each topped with a distinct protein - chicken, steak, carnitas, and chorizo, respectively. While the meat was passable, the tortillas lacked freshness and arrived at our table merely lukewarm. 
  My attempt at the empanadas yielded a mediocre experience, as the beef filling failed to impress. This dish was unremarkable and forgettable. A few other items we ordered were similarly unimpressive. However, the flautas proved to be the exception, as they were the only dishes that garnered universal acclaim from our group. If only we had opted for multiple orders of these delectable treats instead! 
  Our experience was further marred by subpar service. It took nearly an hour for our appetizers to arrive, and one dish was incorrectly prepared upon its eventual arrival.

2," I must confess that my predilection for Mexican cuisine has rendered me somewhat fastidious when it comes to indulging in such culinary delights. My penchant is for diminutive, unpretentious eateries that serve authentic fare, the kind of places that are often overlooked by those who prefer more ostentatious establishments.

In this particular instance, I opted for the quintet of miniature chimichangas, accompanied by a serving of both beans and rice. While the total cost of ten dollars may strike some as rather exorbitant for a meal of this caliber, I must admit that the quality of the ingredients utilized did justify the expense to a certain extent.

The aforementioned chimichangas were stuffed with an amalgamation of cream cheese and shredded beef, the former being slightly more prevalent than the latter. Furthermore, the pastries themselves seemed to possess a subtle sweetness, almost as if they had been crafted from a flaky pastry dough. Although the rice was relatively unremarkable, the refried beans served alongside them were truly delectable. It is worth mentioning that I would have greatly preferred the option of procuring chicken-based chimichangas instead.

My exploration of their salsa bar revealed that the assortment of condiments available failed to impress my palate, striking me as rather bland and lacking in flavor. However, the combination of avocado and salsa verde did manage to capture my attention, boasting a singular uniqueness and tantalizing taste that set it apart from its counterparts.

Upon entering the establishment, I was immediately struck by its pristine state of cleanliness. The staff's enthusiasm for ensuring a warm welcome was undeniably commendable, yet I couldn't help but feel that their repeated expressions of hospitality throughout my dining experience bordered on excessive. As a native of the southern United States, I find that a simple acknowledgement or courteous greeting suffices in most situations.

One item that did pique my interest was their fried ice cream milkshake, which I would love to sample on a future visit. Unfortunately, the aforementioned dessert constitutes the sole reason for my potential return, as I do not foresee myself frequenting this establishment with sufficient regularity to warrant further exploration of its menu. In conclusion, I must assert that this restaurant falls short of the standards set by similar eateries that I hold in high esteem, such as Carolina's or Los Dos Melinos.",True,1052.0,formal

Moreover, the complimentary to-go iced coffee, formerly imbued with a rich, toasted almond flavor, has vanished from their repertoire.

The chandelier over the liquor bottles  was kinda pretty, but the plastic \""chandelier\"" that draped from floor to ceiling...meh. Was pretty tacky looking, actually...reminded me of a giant version of the Mardi Gras beads you get for showing your boobies. Maybe they were going for Diva but got closer to Dive-y. I know it's Vegas, but there are plenty of less tacky places to hang. It felt very dated and old-fashioned. Dated can be good if there's at least a pinch of glam, but the obviously plastic almost-shimmer fell short of that pinch. Call me a snob, but it felt good to leave the verging-on-suffocatingly naff decor.",,,informal

2," ""Upon perusing the evaluations on Yelp, I opted to visit this establishment, seeking an economical watering hole offering potent potables. My excitement was palpable when I espied the 128oz Blue Fishbowl, available for a mere $20. Alas, my enthusiasm was short-lived, as I was dismayed to learn that the advertised 'fishbowls' were nonexistent, and the beverage would be presented in dual large cups instead. Although the vessels themselves were 64oz plastic pitchers, which engendered a modicum of amusement, my delight was short-lived, as the drink was found wanting in two significant aspects: firstly, the absence of any 'fishies,' as depicted in the image, and secondly, an excessive proportion of soda, constituting a whopping 90%. Disappointment notwithstanding, the price remained reasonable for the novelty. 

Moving on to culinary matters, the nachos appearing on the adjacent table seemed quite appetizing, prompting me to investigate further. However, owing to a recent hearty repast, my interest was piqued by the'southwestern corn on the cob.' Inquiring as to what precisely rendered it'southwestern,' I received a less-than-satisfactory response from the server, who simply asked if I desired 'corn.' The term 'corn' proved to be a portent of things to come, as the dish consisted solely of boiled maize, accompanied by a meager pat of butter, all for the princely sum of $3.

It appears that the hygienist has adopted an unscrupulous modus operandi, whereby they endeavour to coerce patients into acquiring supplementary dental services and routine cleanings, which are often superfluous and not necessarily conducive to their oral health. My personal experience with the deep-cleaning procedure, performed only two months prior, serves as a case in point; my gum health has ostensibly deteriorated since undergoing the treatment, leaving me feeling dubious about its efficacy. Furthermore, my sole encounter with the dentist was cursory, at best; she merely glanced at my X-rays, divulged the necessity of fillings, and displayed a marked lack of interest in engaging with me on a personal level.

2,Well for starters I am not a big fan of the Beatles (Yes we do exist) so I was not really looking forward to this. We had reasonable seats and the venue is quite large and with stage being 360 and they way main stage is set it is possible to miss out somethings. Cirque tried to cover it with something going on each side but I found it to be a sensory overload. The soundtrack is good as it is a take on legendary music here. The acrobats are ok but not amazing like other shows.

Perplexed by this anomaly, we inquired as to the cause of the delay, and were informed by the hostess that the restaurant's computerized system dictated the order in which guests were to be seated, irrespective of the chronological order of their arrivals. Consequently, we endured a protracted wait of over twenty minutes before being escorted to our designated table, situated outdoors, adjacent to table number 108. Furthermore, a significant lapse of time ensued before we received our initial glasses of water, while other parties, who had arrived subsequent to our reservation, were promptly served their beverages and bread. The quality of the fare provided was merely satisfactory, as my spouse's seafood dish contained a portion of unopened clams, indicative of inferior quality, and the absence of pasta as an accompaniment was conspicuous. My own dish, consisting of lemon chicken, was compromised by the excessive fat content of the poultry. Additionally, despite our request for breadsticks, they were never forthcoming.

A fresh tortilla makes a world of difference to the enjoyment of the taco. Some of my favourite tacos in the world are just plain, $1.50 tacos that are with some plain 'toppings' a good verde salsa, in a warm, fresh tortilla. I say all this because I think that Verde puts too much emphasis on the ingredients (Which are still under-spiced and boring with some store bought hot sauces on the table giving all the flavor) and then put those toppings into a boring, store bought tasting tortilla.

My primary objective was to procure a bowl of soup, and thus, I placed an order for the Tom Yum variety. Accompanying the soup was a small salad, which, much to my surprise, proved to be remarkably fresh and palatable, although the dressing was excessively sweetened. My daughter elected to sample the chicken satay, which, regrettably, did not closely resemble the traditional peanut-based sauce typically associated with this dish. Rather, it was characterized by an overpowering sweetness, with only a scattering of peanuts evident within the sauce itself. As for my own soup, I must confess that it lacked the customary harmonious blend of sweet and sour flavors that one would reasonably expect from a Tom Yum preparation. Instead, it was decidedly sour in taste, rendering it marginally edible at best. Notwithstanding these shortcomings, the service we received was relatively prompt and courteous. In conclusion, should you find yourself situated on Madison's West Side on a Monday and in urgent need of a soup-based meal, you may wish to consider this restaurant as a viable option, provided you are willing to temper your expectations accordingly.

Miraculously averting disaster, I managed to safely place the scalding teapot on the table without any further mishaps. 

As I was experiencing the aftermath of a hangover and fatigue while attempting to consume sustenance prior to my impending flight, I did not feel inclined to voice my dissatisfaction. Instead, I politely requested an ice bag from another waitress, who subsequently sought assistance from our absentee waitress. The latter then contacted the manager, who in turn summoned security personnel. Upon the arrival of the latter, I conveyed my desire for a bag of ice, which could have been readily obtained by conveying my grievances directly to the drink server and requesting her to procure said item from the kitchen.

It was seriously a fish with only half the meat left on it (bizarre wedges were cut out of it, and filled with limes), stuck in a fryer, un-filleted (other than the wedges), and essentially undressed or prepared (other than the limes).

2," Visiting Phoenix and cognizant of the effusive acclaim bestowed upon this establishment, we opted to experience its offerings en route to our lodging. Arriving promptly at 8:30 PM on a Friday evening, we encountered merely a single couple preceding us, thereby ensuring a relatively expedient service.

However, upon entering the premises, we were immediately acknowledged by a lone staff member, fostering an impression that a definitive knowledge of our preferences was expected at the onset. The sole employee tasked with attending to our needs exhibited a reserved demeanor, potentially attributed to the culmination of a protracted work shift or other factors.

In regards to the frozen delights, my spouse selected the TC^2 and salted caramel flavors, while I opted for the almond buttercrunch and apple cinnamon varieties. Additionally, I sampled the honey blue cheese and sugar and spice options. Unfortunately, the almond buttercrunch failed to showcase a discernible almond essence, although the remaining flavors proved satisfactory. Notably, the texture presented a rather icy consistency, lacking the anticipated creaminess, given the extensive praise surrounding this venue.

The pricing, however, proved reasonable and, if seeking unique ice cream flavors at a fair cost within close proximity, a visit may be warranted.

However, upon perusing the menu, I was dismayed to discover that they offer genuine animal flesh, which is antithetical to my dietary preferences. Despite this, I must admit that my unsweetened iced tea, which I had mixed with mango lemonade (a concoction that I had created myself), was quite delectable. The side salad that accompanied my pannini was also impressive, boasting an array of fresh, crisp ingredients. Unfortunately, the pannini itself was rather unpalatable, as it lacked the rich, savory flavors that I have come to expect from such a dish. Moreover, the fact that it contained tofurky, a plant-based meat substitute, made it seem like a poor imitation of a true pannini. The highly recommended red velvet cake was somewhat redeeming, as it possessed a satisfying texture and flavor profile, despite its relatively low caloric and fat content. However, my overall experience was marred by the sluggish pace of the service, which, combined with the limited number of patrons, made for a rather underwhelming dining experience.

When I received my fish tacos they looked like what I expected except for one thing. If the fish was breaded at the restaurant then why bother breading fish pieces. The fish itself was fine but I received pieces. Typically, if you cut the fish correctly you won't have pieces. The batter was okay but I've fish sticks for Gorton's that were better. The batter had absolutely no flavor. It just seemed that someone took the time to decorate but I felt that I was served leftovers. I'm going to look somewhere else for fish tacos in the future.\n\nIf you ever in San Diego then try Rubio's, which is a fast food fish taco place and they seem to know what to serve the customer and what not to serve the customer.

It wasn't bad, but the food didn't seem freshly cooked; more like it had been under a warmer too long. Most of the meats were ok. The flank steak was great, chicken was good, sirloin was ok but sort of bland, the pork was good, lamb ok, alligator (yes, alligator) was not bad (my first time trying). \nThe atmosphere was the most disappointing element of the whole experience, as the picture on their website made it look like a 4 or 5 star fancy restaurant, with a nice picture of a glass of wine -- however when we arrived, it looked similar to the interior of a Golden Corral (not exaggerating) - definitely not a place that is likely to impress your wife/girlfriend. Also, be prepared, the restaurant is actually split in half: one side is Indian and the other is Braza's; so, it had the thick smell of an Indian restaurant in the air- which kind of worked against our Brazilian appetites. \nI have to say the service was pretty good.

Specifically, the pork dishes were not adequately cooked, the enchiladas featured a questionable cheese substitute, and the marshmallows possessed a decidedly unpleasant flavor reminiscent of those from a bygone era (specifically, 1987, which appears to have been an inauspicious year for marshmallow production). Furthermore, I couldn't help but notice an unusually high concentration of severely overweight individuals within the premises, which only served to further diminish my overall satisfaction.

My order consisted of their Kung Po chicken dish; however, I must admit that I did not derive satisfaction from consuming it, primarily due to the fact that the poultry was battered, which seemed incongruous with my preconceived notion of an authentic Chinese culinary experience. Furthermore, the accompanying sauce possessed an overly saccharine quality reminiscent of a sweet and sour variety, which only served to further dissuade me from expressing enthusiasm regarding this particular dish. Moreover, the cost of procuring this item proved to be greater than I had initially anticipated.

""The recreational aquatic facility boasts pristine cleanliness and aesthetically pleasing architecture, yet, it perplexes me as to why the management would opt to cement the pool decking during sweltering summer days in Arizona, rendering the surface hazardously slippery and uncomfortably hot underfoot. Witnessing a visitor slip and sustain a head injury, resulting in an ambulance being summoned to transport them to the hospital for treatment of a concussion, only serves to amplify my incredulity. Furthermore, the ratio of pool-goers to lifeguards appears to be disproportionately skewed, with approximately three guests to every one lifeguard, leading me to question the efficacy of such a safety protocol. Additionally, the standard operating procedure in the event of an injury, which involves the whistle-blowing mobilization of all fifty guards to expel every single patron from both the pool and surrounding area, strikes me as excessively zealous and unnecessary, especially considering the inconvenience and discomfort it causes for those simply seeking to retrieve their children or personal belongings. While I acknowledge the importance of addressing emergencies promptly, I believe it is unreasonable to cordon off the entire pool area, thereby precluding patrons from accessing their belongings or even hydrating beverages.

Furthermore, my experiences at other esteemed establishments, such as Barista in Portland Oregon, where I was served by an award-winning barista, and at Coava, Stumptown, and The Refinery, all renowned for their high-end offerings, only further reinforced my belief that JPH's prices are unjustifiably steep. While I do appreciate the occasional indulgence in a premium coffee experience, I cannot help but feel that JPH's pricing strategy is pretentious and unreasonable, particularly given the plethora of more affordable options available. Perhaps the exorbitant rent or the prevalence of affluent clientele who are either trust fund beneficiaries or burdened with substantial student loans might explain the coffee shop's seemingly inflated prices.

The two employees were unwilling to convey anything to management (which we believe was utilizing the nearby couches for leisure activities) that it is more practical to prepare a PB&J rather than a smoothie.  The employees only knew to state that it was against company policy to create a PB&J before 11 am.  Anyway, I requested an egg sandwich with tomato and turkey and it was a rather unremarkable sandwich in that I could have easily prepared the same dish at home, but with superior quality due to the availability of Tobasco.  I inquired about Tobasco but was instead offered their homemade ""chili"" sauce, which possessed a flavor profile akin to pureed sundried tomatoes combined with chili powder.  While it was not unpalatable, I do enjoy the piquant sensation of Tobasco when consumed in conjunction with eggs.  Anywhoo, if that was indeed management relaxing on the couches, then shame on them for not defending their stringent PB&J policy and investing in a bottle of Tobasco!",True,1406.0,formal
2," I genuinely aspired to relish this establishment, given its favorable evaluations and reasonable happy hour prices...nonetheless, I simply did not.

The embellishment of the interior appeared somewhat deficient, and the booths were not particularly comfortable. The hospitality was adequate, yet not exceptional.

We opted for the Gyoza, which proved to be moderately satisfying. However, it was pan-fried instead of being deeply fried, thereby diminishing its crunchiness. Additionally, we requested a volcano roll and a rainbow roll; regrettably, the latter failed to impress, as the shrimp was somewhat rubbery, while the avocado exhibited a faintly aged flavor. Notably, they served us a thunder roll by mistake, rather than the volcano roll we had actually ordered. Although I had deliberated between the two options, I presumed it was my error and chose not to contest it. Nonetheless, upon inspecting the receipt, it became apparent that we had, in fact, ordered the correct item. The thunder roll was merely average. The tea and miso soup were, however, quite palatable.

In conclusion, our dining experience was merely mediocre, leaving us unimpressed and disinclined to revisit the restaurant.",True,1407.0,formal

As the restaurant gradually began to fill with patrons, our server seemed to vanish without a trace, leaving us to await her return for an interminable duration. Our initial beverages arrived in a timely fashion; the French press, in particular, was a delight to the taste buds. Nevertheless, the ensuing delay in service became increasingly pronounced, with five, ten, and ultimately fifteen minutes lapsing without any discernible attention being bestowed upon our table. My expectations for a more attentive experience remained unfulfilled, as the waitstaff continued to engage in leisurely conversation amongst themselves, oblivious to our presence. Ultimately, I elected to terminate my dining experience prematurely and depart the establishment, feeling disappointed and underwhelmed by the stark contrast in quality between this visit and my previous encounters with Postinos.

My curiosity was piqued by the notion of Zumanity, as the prospect of experiencing the sensual aspect of Cirque du Soleil resonated with the adult-themed ambiance of Las Vegas, which I was encountering for the first time since attaining the age of majority. Admittedly, my expectations were not entirely fulfilled, as I did not find the acrobatic feats to be as awe-inspiring as those showcased in many of the other Cirque shows. Furthermore, the choreography and musical accompaniment did not strike me as particularly memorable. Nonetheless, I must acknowledge that the comedic talents of the ""clown"" hosts of Zumanity did succeed in eliciting laughter from the audience, especially through their engagement with the crowd. The experience afforded by Zumanity diverges significantly from that of its Cirque counterparts, boasting a far more intimate atmosphere. For instance, the theater's diminutive size and the performers' warm greetings upon entry serve to create a sense of proximity and familiarity. It is worth noting that premium seating in the front row can ensure a heightened level of interaction during the performance, making it a factor to consider when booking tickets for Zumanity.",True,1409.0,formal

Upon our arrival, we opted for the all-you-can-eat option, and my father even overindulged to the point of experiencing discomfort. Needless to say, we were excited to revisit this restaurant and sample their delectable dishes.

Upon our return, we decided to commence our meal with alligator tail as an appetizer, which proved to be a delicious choice. However, the all-you-can-eat platters we customarily order were not as satisfying, particularly towards the beginning of the meal. It became apparent that the oil utilized for frying our fish and shrimp was not fresh, leading to an unpleasant taste. Fortunately, as our meal progressed and new batches were brought out, the quality of the food improved, and we were able to enjoy our dining experience.

In light of the above, I inquired about the oil used and was informed by our waitress that the chef did indeed replace the old oil with fresh oil towards the end of our meal. While this was reassuring, it was disappointing to note that the salad bar was not well-maintained and lacked attention to detail regarding cleanliness. Additionally, it would be beneficial to have identical items on both sides of the buffet to facilitate navigation and minimize spills. Nonetheless, we appreciated the fact that the plates were kept chilled.

Despite some drawbacks, our server provided adequate service, fulfilling her responsibilities effectively.

Our server, with little ceremony, posed an inquiry regarding the presence of a Groupon, to which I responded in the negative, prompting me to peruse my mobile device for such an offering. Subsequently, I procured said Groupon, valued at $19 for $30.

My gastronomical exploits did not, however, meet with great success, as each roll presented itself with an uninspired combination of cream cheese and krab mix, or some derivative thereof. A dearth of originality and vitality characterized the fare, with nary a fish of notable quality nor sufficient quantity to balance the abundance of rice.

Furthermore, the preparation time for our repast proved excessive, occasioning a lengthy wait. The financial burden, in the absence of the aforementioned Groupon, would have approached $60 for a meal of middling quality.

It appears that numerous patrons frequent this dining establishment for the purpose of indulging in a $20 all-you-can-eat special, replete with stipulations and restrictions, precluding the sharing of dishes and exacting payment for uneaten portions.

Upon entering, we opted to sample their assortment of fries, which included zucchini, Mac n cheese, and pepper jack shots (essentially, fried cheese). To our delight, the aforementioned items proved to be delectable. Subsequently, we elected to order burgers and shakes, accompanied by beverages containing alcohol. Unfortunately, the preparation of the burgers did not align with our specifications, and upon conclusion of the meal, we were charged for every item we had requested, excluding those that were part of the burger. The duration of time required to prepare the burgers was considerable. Furthermore, the shake and beverage we had ordered alongside our initial courses did not arrive until approximately halfway through the consumption of our burgers. Moreover, we were compelled to remind the server twice regarding these items. 
The quality of the burgers left much to be desired. Specifically, the pepper bacon possessed an uncharacteristically sweet flavor profile, whereas the meat itself was unpleasantly mealy.

2," I have had the dubious pleasure of dining at Panchero's, and I must say that the experience left much to be desired. In point of fact, I am highly unlikely to return to this establishment, opting instead to patronize either Jersey Mike's, Starbucks, or Yogurtland whenever I find myself in the vicinity. While the culinary offerings at Panchero's were passable, to say the least, the parsimonious manner in which they were served left a decidedly unpleasant taste in my mouth, figuratively speaking.

For instance, the minuscule quantity of cheese provided with each dish was nothing short of laughable. A paltry scoop of cheese, barely sufficient to cover the surface of the food, was all that was offered, leaving one with the distinct impression that the restaurant was attempting to cut corners at every turn. Similarly, the meager portion of beans served alongside the main course was a paltry substitute for the generous helping one might expect from a reputable eatery.

Furthermore, the request to omit the rice from the dish was met with a curious lack of accommodation. Despite my explicit instructions, the serving size of beans remained unchanged, leading me to wonder whether the kitchen staff had perhaps misconstrued my request or simply chose to ignore it altogether.

In light of these considerations, it is hardly surprising that I found the overall value and quality of the meal to be woefully inadequate. To suggest that I was less than satisfied would be an understatement; indeed, I felt positively robbed of both my money and my appetite. Were I to consider returning to Panchero's in the future, it would take nothing short of a catastrophic event befalling every other fast-food establishment within a reasonable radius to persuade me to do so. Even then, I would likely opt for Taco Bell over Panchero's, given the former's superior value and generous portion sizes.",True,1455.0,formal

2," Last evening, I had the privilege of accompanying a corporate assemblage to Harvest, whereupon it became patently evident that their steadfast dedication to utilizing regionally obtained ingredients resulted in an erratic provisioning process. Our culinary experience was particularly pronounced, as they lacked a single fish entrÃ©e on their bill of fare. Furthermore, they possessed merely a duet of their steak specialty, thereby precluding them from accommodating the orders of our gathering. Additionally, they offered a mere trio of their dessert specialty, leading to an analogous predicament. They were unable to furnish a solitary request for a diet Coke, and they exhausted their inventory of straws for a single beverage. It is worth mentioning that our coterie was not considerable in size, nor was the establishment teeming with clientele. Nevertheless, it appeared that Harvest was unprepared to operate last night, which rendered the entire experience rather disheartening.

Although the spa exuded an atmosphere of elegance, it lacked a designated area for us to encounter one another before the massage, leading to separate areas for men and women, thereby creating a sense of disconnection.

On a recent Friday evening, my spouse and I visited this establishment with high hopes of enjoying an excellent dinner; regrettably, our expectations were not met. The food was merely passable and overpriced, which was particularly disheartening given the high standards we had set for our dining experience.

The mixed drinks were reasonably priced at ten dollars apiece, but their flavor profiles failed to impress us. They lacked a certain je ne sais quoi that we have come to expect from establishments of this caliber.

Our servers appeared to be inexperienced, which detracted from the overall quality of our meal. Their service was less than polished, giving the impression that they were recently hired staff still finding their footing in the industry.

Moving on to the main event, the cuisine left much to be desired. Our New York strip steak arrived in a meager portion, which was problematic for my robust appetite. Although its flavor was satisfactory, it fell short of our expectations regarding quantity. My wife's sandwich, cooked to a medium temperature, was also underwhelming. Unfortunately, it was served rare, necessitating its return after a protracted wait of ten minutes.

In conclusion, our dining experience was subpar, with each dish costing approximately forty dollars. Considering the high prices and lackluster quality, we were left feeling disappointed and underwhelmed.",True,1548.0,formal

Between our party we had a combination of the appetizer sampler for 2 (fish tacos, bacon wrapped bacon & eggs, chicken pot pie nuggets) all were good, the chicken pot pie nuggets were lacking something in flavor , maybe salt?

Notwithstanding the palatable quality of the fare I managed to consume, I shall not be returning to this dining establishment, as the overall experience left much to be desired.

Furthermore, the instructor displayed a remarkable lack of engagement and enthusiasm, exemplified by her pacing back and forth at the onset of the class without exhibiting any semblance of tranquility, focus, or concern for her pupils' well-being.

Upon ordering a burger cooked to a medium level of doneness, I was taken aback by the copious amount of red liquid emanating from within its interior. The circumference of the patty rendered it challenging for me to consume without resorting to an unrefined manner of eating. My apologies, but the art of creating a delectable burger lies within the harmonious balance of flavors and textures derived from premium ingredients. If one desires to augment the size of their burger, it should be done in a manner that maintains the structural integrity of the sandwich. Unfortunately, my dining experience at this location did not meet my expectations, especially considering the exorbitant cost. In contrast, Stack'd located in Shadyside offers a superior dining experience at a mere fraction of the price. Furthermore, the ambiance of the restaurant was uninviting, with temperatures so low that I felt compelled to don additional layers. The minuscule size of the tables made it difficult to accommodate our meals, and the method in which the burgers were presented hindered my ability to partake in them with any semblance of decorum.

2," My companion and I briefly visited Phillip's during a layover at Charlotte Douglas International Airport, seeking a rapid culinary experience while our aircraft underwent maintenance nearby. Upon entering the establishment, we adopted the customary protocol of seating ourselves and placing our order once a server had arrived at our table. The procedure was uncomplicated, and the food was delivered in a timely manner. However, a couple of drawbacks became apparent. Firstly, the cost of the cuisine was somewhat elevated, which is common in airport eateries. Moreover, the staff failed to provide BBQ sauce upon request, which was disappointing. Setting aside those issues, the fare was generally predictable and satisfactory. The chicken strips were unremarkable, accompanied by honey mustard dipping sauce. The seafood platter consisted of fried shrimp, crab cakes, and some spring rolls. The crab meat within the crab cakes lacked distinctiveness, enveloped in fried breadcrumbs with an unremarkable flavor beyond that. The spring rolls were unimpressive, while the fried shrimp was adequate. 
It is not worthwhile to anticipate attentive service at this venue, as our server required a signal to present us with our bill.

Our bar bill itself was $100 so we always pay way over our coupon voucher. My husband ordered the seafood pot and salmon,which he found to his liking. I ordered the beef carpaccio and chicken with the sauce on the side. My chicken and the little side thing ( veggies?) it came with were dry. They also gave us a palate cleanser of squash soup ( was it supposed to be cold?) and some fishy paste, blah! I don't know, I was expecting the same service that I got from their sister restaurant, Andres but there was no comparison. The views are pretty. The only great thing was the crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e, that was good stuff. Not enough for us to be back though. Thank god we didn't tell the host we had the TZ like that other unlucky poster!

Upon entering the premises at 6:45 p.m. on a Saturday evening, we anticipated a brief waiting period before being seated; however, the hostess was nowhere to be found, leaving us standing idly for an extended period. Furthermore, the abundance of vacant seating arrangements throughout the restaurant was striking, particularly given the presence of numerous patrons gathered around the television screens, captivated by the live sports broadcasts. Following a prolonged wait, our server finally appeared to take our order, and we began our meal with an appetizer of bruschetta, which, while flavorful, did not justify its cost of nearly $10 for a simple bread dish topped with tomatoes and dressing. Our daughter opted for the macaroni and cheese dish from the children's menu, which, much to our disappointment, turned out to be a pre-packaged, microwaved variety rather than the authentic, homemade version we had been led to expect. Despite this, her hunger prompted her to consume the dish nonetheless. My wife selected the lasagna entrÃ©e, which she found satisfying, albeit overpriced at $12. I opted for the Tuscan Panini, which proved to be the highlight of our meal, boasting an impressive taste and presentation. However, taking into account the considerable number of unoccupied tables on a typically busy Saturday night, it appears that this eatery may need to reassess certain aspects of its operations to ensure its continued success.

Unfortunately, our gastronomical expectations were not adequately fulfilled, as the victuals presented themselves as somewhat deficient in quality. Specifically, my attempt to consume a burger resulted in an unpleasant taste sensation, closely resembling that of a burnt hockey puck. It is suggested that the cooking duration be moderated, perhaps aiming for a medium level of doneness rather than medium-well, in order to avoid such unfortunate flavor profiles in future culinary endeavors.

Moreover, I am uncertain about the nature of the ingredients utilized in their products, and I harbor doubts about the authenticity of my raspberry shake, given its absence of seeds (typically a reliable indicator of naturalness) and its slightly synthetic taste. Concerns regarding the hormone-free status of their milk also linger. Despite these reservations, the venue boasts a charming ambiance that appeals to patrons of diverse age groups, and during our latest visit, we became acquainted with K-9 Custard, a canine treat that our furry companion relished thoroughly (priced at $2.75, ensure your pet's hunger before purchasing!).

Following an amicable encounter with the accommodating bartender during lunch, we embarked upon a gastronomical excursion that unfortunately proved somewhat disappointing. Specifically, the initial offering of calamari was characterized by an unfortunate rubberiness and an unpleasant greasiness that bordered on the inedible, thereby establishing a less-than-auspicious beginning. Subsequently, we opted to share the renowned Biloxi chicken sandwich, which, regrettably, exhibited a notable lack of moisture and a certain blandness, coupled with the My Wife's Favorite Salad (featuring duck confit), an uninspired assemblage that neglected to impress. Furthermore, the Caesar salad, adorned with an unpalatable abundance of kale, tragically fell short of our expectations, its flavor profile reduced to a barely perceptible hint of saltiness derived from the minute shreds of overcooked, previously prepared fried egg situated atop the bed of wilted lettuce. Fortunately, the attentive bartender, cognizant of the unappealing nature of the offending egg, graciously provided a fresh, properly cooked alternative, thus salvaging the dish from utter disaster.

It is my sincere hope that this correspondence finds you in an optimal state of existential fulfillment, and that the inherent trendiness of your establishment has not been compromised by the proximity to an exceptional hub of artistic expression (Emergency Arts). However, I must confess that my experiences with the hipster staff responsible for attending to my culinary needs have been consistently marred by an unfortunate display of haughty demeanor. It is my ardent desire that, in the interest of fostering a more convivial atmosphere, they might consider adopting a more affable and helpful countenance, thereby enhancing the overall dining experience for patrons such as myself.

With the notable exceptions of Heather (whose exceptional customer service skills are truly commendable) and the charming foreign gentleman whose adeptness at slicing tomatoes is a source of perpetual fascination for me, the prevalent attitude exhibited by the staff has been one of aloofness and disinterest. While I must admit that the quality of your food offerings is indeed impressive, and that the ambient surroundings and diverse array of weekly events do serve to mitigate the deficiencies in the coffee and espresso department, I cannot help but feel a sense of disappointment and disconnect. My fervent hope is that, in the future, I might be able to cultivate a deeper emotional investment in your establishment, but until such time, I fear that our relationship shall remain tenuous at best.

I did not formally time the waitstaff, but various delays became apparent throughout the dining experience, including those encountered during seating, menu procurement, replenishment of beverages, food preparation, and ultimately, receipt of the bill. It became patently evident that avid players of slot machines and a select few regular clientele garnered a disproportionate amount of attention and expedited service from the staff, whereas all others were afforded a markedly inferior level of care. Consequentially, I felt compelled to dock Mr. John a star in light of the subpar nature of the service proffered.

Additionally, we found the prices to be disproportionate to the level of quality provided, leading us to question the overall value proposition offered by this establishment.

""It merely requires a negative mindset and an inflexible demeanor to transform a positive encounter into a detrimental one in a remarkably brief period. Unfortunately, this phenomenon transpired at 360 Physical Therapy, where I was prepared to compose a laudatory review, predicated on the quality of their physical therapy services. My overall impression of the physical therapist was favorable, and I felt that I received adequate care. However, the clinic maintains a stringent policy regarding appointment cancellations, which entails the imposition of a substantial fee. Regardless of the numerous $35 copays I have paid (a sum that I deem exorbitant, yet that is a separate issue with my healthcare provider), and despite my diligence in informing them of any potential lateness, the billing manager remains resolute in demanding payment for an alleged missed appointment that I adamantly maintain was rescheduled beforehand. The impasse has become an arduous and unyielding contest. 

My central contention is that preserving customer satisfaction is paramount. In my case, I had attended multiple sessions at their facility, consistently arriving punctually and settling payments promptly. I was the embodiment of a model client. Were it not for this minor yet contentious issue, I would continue to patronize their services and recommend them to others.

2," ""My daughter and I embarked upon an excursion specifically dedicated to acquiring these bagels while they were still fresh from the oven in the morning, and I must say that my expectations were not entirely fulfilled. In fact, I would venture to assert that my predilection for New York-style bagels (a preference that has motivated me to undertake similar pilgrimages in the past) was not entirely satiated by the offerings of Montreal's bagel purveyors. While I acknowledge that there exists a certain je ne sais quoi associated with the city's unique bagel variant, characterized by its thinness and subtle sweetness, it does not necessarily conform to my individualized culinary inclinations. Moreover, it was rather disconcerting to discover that a few of the dozen bagels purchased during our excursion exhibited telltale signs of staleness and were only suitable for consumption after a period of maturation. Amongst the assortment we sampled, the sesame variety was perhaps the most satisfactory, but it was not enough to persuade us to abandon our allegiance to the superior quality and authenticity of New York-style bagels. It is my conviction that many Americans who have had the privilege of indulging in premium bagels within the confines of New York City would concur with my assessment. Incidentally, I am of the opinion that several establishments in Boston offer comparable or even superior alternatives. Suffice it to say that Montreal's gastronomic landscape boasts an array of exceptional French cuisine, which, in my estimation, renders it unnecessary for the city to attempt to rival New York's preeminence in the realm of Jewish delicacies.

At that time, I was accorded the status of a esteemed patron, and the personnel nearly convinced me that they were experts in the field of podiatry.

However, upon my recent visit to the aforementioned location, I was unable to locate my customized shoe inserts and thus opted to purchase a new pair of shoes at a cost of six hundred dollars, which was comparable to the amount I had expended on a previous occasion many years prior.

The food here is good, but thats the problem - It's not 'excellent' , 'mouthwatering' or 'to die for'. It's just ok good.  It's not worth what they charge, and if you're looking for good French, this place definitely isn't it.  With that being said, the ambiance and decor are superb. The mixed drinks are tasty and they don't jip you on the alcohol.  I suppose I expected a lot more out of a restaurant in the upscale Renaissance Hotel near the theatres, where a lot of out-of-towers may frequent.

2," We are temporarily residing at the Mirage and coincidentally strolled past this culinary establishment, which boasts an impressive facade. My spouse and I are ardent devotees of sushi and reckoned this eatery would be a stimulating venue to sample. The hostess was quite hospitable, and the Kirin Ichiban beverage was indeed delectable. However, the sushi failed to justify its exorbitant cost. We requested the calamari, which consists of thick strips-a delicacy that, albeit scrumptious, is also rather pricey. We ordered three sushi rolls and were utterly disenchanted with the dearth of inventiveness characteristic of such an expensive dish. Consequently, we elected to settle our tab despite still experiencing hunger, as our satisfaction was inadequate.

Regular sushi rolls are minuscule and consist merely of an item enveloped by rice and seaweed. If your primary motivation for dining is sushi, it is unwise to frequent this restaurant. If you crave sushi that embodies a diverse array of oceanic flavors, then avoid this establishment. Perhaps we are spoiled due to our origin in San Diego, but I shall not revisit this restaurant. We are accustomed to savoring more flavorful and imaginative sushi at approximately half the cost of Japonais.",True,1968.0,formal

2," This establishment boasts an expansive interior, encompassing a multitude of recreational activities such as bowling, billiards, a dining facility serving passable cuisine, and various other forms of entertainment, the majority of which are designed to reward participants with tickets. However, there are several significant drawbacks associated with this venue, in my opinion. First and foremost, it does not cater particularly well to juvenile patrons, as its open layout makes it vulnerable to unsupervised children wandering off, creating potential safety concerns. Parents must maintain constant vigilance when visiting with multiple children, which can prove challenging.  

Furthermore, this arcade lacks a diverse array of games typically found in traditional arcades, opting instead for violent or ticket-based games, neither of which are suitable for all age groups. Additionally, the prevalence of games reliant on chance and rewarded with tickets serves as an introduction to gambling, a potentially harmful pastime. As such, I actively dissuade youths from participating in such activities, emphasizing the importance of enjoying games irrespective of ticket rewards. In conclusion, while children may find enjoyment here, my personal enthusiasm for this establishment remains limited.",True,1970.0,formal

3," I have had the pleasure of partaking in the delectable offerings of this esteemed establishment on a previous occasion, specifically for a midday repast, and I must say that the culinary experience was truly remarkable. However, my most recent visit, which took place in the evening and was intended to celebrate a dear friend's anniversary of their birth, unfortunately did not live up to my lofty expectations. Our group, which consisted of numerous individuals, gathered in the bar area and occupied the three central tables, which were situated at a considerable height. It is worth noting that the server appeared to be responsible for attending to both the bar patrons and certain tables in the dining area, which may have contributed to the sluggish pace of service that we encountered. 
 After placing my order for a beverage, I waited for an extended period of time, approximately twenty minutes, before it was brought to my attention. It is worth noting that a companion's culinary selection, which was placed at roughly the same time as my drink order, arrived a full ten minutes prior to the arrival of my beverage. Furthermore, our proximity to the bar area did little to expedite the delivery of our orders. Upon inspecting the menu, I discovered that the advertised drink did not align with my expectations, as it was described as a martini-style beverage but was instead presented in a wine glass and possessed a sickly sweet flavor profile. Consequently, I chose to return the drink to the server and requested an alternative selection. Unfortunately, the second drink took an additional fifteen minutes to arrive, further contributing to my disappointment. 
 It is worth noting that the menu selections for dinner, specifically the small plates and entrees, left much to be desired. As a group, we were interested in ordering several shareable dishes, but the options listed on the menu did not appear to lend themselves well to sharing. Moreover, it seemed that every dish featured bacon as an ingredient, which may not appeal to all diners. Additionally, the prices listed for the entrees struck me as somewhat exorbitant, particularly the tilapia dish, which carried a price tag of twenty-two dollars.

3," Despite my reservations based on the unfavorable reviews, I opted to give this establishment a chance, and my experience validated the prevailing sentiment. The ambiance was visually appealing, but the lavatory presented an unconventional layout. The hand dryer was situated on a single faucet, prompting a sequence of inconvenient delays for patrons awaiting their turn to utilize the facilities while attempting to operate the cumbersome dryer. Furthermore, the absence of sanitary disposal units within the stalls necessitated a departure from the stall to discard items in the central waste receptacle, posing an additional challenge for female patrons. 

My culinary selection was a vegetarian burger, which, although flavorful, was diminutive in stature, inviting comparisons to a slider. The accompanying fries were palatable, yet their portion size was standard, rendering the supplementary fee seemingly unwarranted. Moreover, the minuscule dimensions of the water glasses necessitated a deliberate sipping motion, akin to savoring a fine wine. Following my meal, I remained unsatisfied, capable of consuming a medium-sized popcorn at the cinema without difficulty. 

Regrettably, I must conjecture that this dining establishment may struggle to flourish, given its steep prices and inadequate serving sizes. A revision of their pricing strategy or generosity of portions seems imperative to justify the cost. Notably, the absence of an option to augment the vegetarian patty was conspicuous.",True,2011.0,formal

It may serve as a suitable venue for gatherings of a larger group of individuals seeking basic bar fare and beverages, given its expansive dimensions that preclude a sense of confinement. In the rear of the establishment, numerous pool tables and assorted games provide entertainment for patrons. The front area features additional tables designated for culinary consumption, while television sets are ubiquitous throughout the premises. During a recent visit, I sampled the SoCal Chicken Sandwich and found it to be merely satisfactory, with a slightly desiccated texture. However, I did appreciate the seasoning applied to my fries. The cuisine at Doc and Eddy's is adequate for a bar, and I surprisingly felt satiated upon conclusion of my meal. Service was adequate, yet unremarkable, as it met the bare minimum requirements for satisfaction without compelling generous gratuity. Previously, my experience with the service at this establishment was subpar. Notably, my draft beer was served with insufficient foam, which, while not excessively frothy, was still deficient in this regard.

Well, my dear reader, let me elucidate. Firstly, there are the exorbitant fees associated with online ticket purchases, which, when combined with the additional five-dollar parking charge, result in an aggregate increase of ten to twelve dollars per ticket. Now, were these surcharges to benefit the performing artists themselves, one might be inclined to turn a blind eye. However, I assure you, the maintenance costs of the facility do not warrant such excessive fees. In essence, it is a large concrete room, albeit one with a sloping floor designed to afford prime views of the stage from any vantage point. Admittedly, the drink selection is satisfactory, the prices reasonable, and both security personnel and restroom facilities are adequate. Furthermore, it is undeniable that this venue attracts high-caliber acts, making it a worthwhile destination for music enthusiasts such as myself, who must, perforce, selectively seek out musical experiences in this, the fifth most populous city in the United States, wherein live performances by notable artists are often few and far between.""",True,2099.0,formal

3," Throughout our numerous excursions to Arizona, we invariably found ourselves passing by Nielsen's Frozen Custard while en route to and from our accommodations and our daughter's residence. On each occasion, I would mentally note that we absolutely had to sample their offerings. Unfortunately, we frequently encountered the establishment during its closure, thereby thwarting our intentions. However, during our final visit (which coincided with our daughter's relocation), we finally managed to arrive at the establishment when it was open for business.

Upon entering the premises, we were taken aback by the discovery that Nielsen's Frozen Custard offered more than just frozen treats; they also served an assortment of meals, including burgers, sandwiches, and salads. Our primary focus, however, remained the frozen custard.

We were warmly received by a courteous young woman who attended to us from behind the counter. She exhibited great patience as we carefully scrutinized the extensive menu featuring an abundance of toppings. Ultimately, I opted for a modest cup of vanilla frozen custard adorned with sprinkles, while my spouse selected a small, unembellished chocolate custard. Following our order, we were assigned a number to display on our table, and the young woman promptly delivered our selections.

Both my companion and I concurred that the texture of the frozen custard was pleasantly smooth and creamy. Regrettably, we found that the flavors did not live up to our expectations. Neither the vanilla nor the chocolate variant possessed a robust sufficient flavor, which proved somewhat disillusioning. Despite this, we do not lament attempting it.

The original text describes a person's experience at a bar as average, mentioning the view, location, and drinks. To modify it to use longer and more complex sentences and professional vocabulary, we can rephrase it as follows:

* ""Great view"" became ""A sense of monotony."" This phrase suggests a feeling of repetition or dullness, which can be seen in the context of the abandoned buildings and lack of excitement.
* ""Until you walk closer to the wall and you see nothing but abandoned buildings until you see South Mountain"" became ""Albeit with a few redeeming features."" This phrase acknowledges that there were some positive aspects to the experience, but they were not enough to overcome the overall feeling of disappointment.
* ""It was cool being next to US Airways Arena and Chase field"" became ""Characterized by a sense of proximity to notable landmarks."" This phrase uses more formal language to describe the location of the bar in relation to nearby attractions.
* ""For some reason I thought this bar was on the top of the hotel, but it's only on the third floor"" became ""Boasting an unremarkable altitude."" This phrase uses more formal language to describe the location of the bar within the hotel, emphasizing its lack of distinction.
* ""Decent spot, drinks were okay, I might come back again if people from out of town are here"" became ""With a few redeeming features, including an acceptable ambiance and passable beverages, the possibility of future visits remains.""

3," I have had the pleasure of partaking in the weekend brunch at this esteemed establishment on multiple occasions, and I must say that the value offered is truly unparalleled. For those who are local and seeking a reasonably priced meal, I highly recommend taking advantage of the special deals available on Mondays and Wednesdays. For a mere $3.99, $4.99, and $6.99, respectively, you can indulge in a delectable breakfast, lunch, or dinner, provided you present your Hilton rewards card and a valid form of local identification.  

The weekend brunch boasts an impressive array of delicacies, including succulent crab legs, savory prime rib, and an assortment of beverages such as beer, wine, and on certain days, champagne. In addition to the standard breakfast fare, there is also a made-to-order omelet station, complemented by expertly prepared grilled meats and sausages. While the cuisine may not be considered exotic or sophisticated, it is undoubtedly hearty and satisfying. 

At a mere $18, the opportunity to relish prime rib, cocktail shrimp, and crab legs represents an offer that is simply too good to pass up, particularly for those seeking a respectable weekend brunch buffet without the hefty price tag associated with establishments like the Wynn or Bellagio. Although the service may not always meet the highest standards, it is essential to remember that we are discussing a buffet, and thus, such minor shortcomings can be readily overlooked.",True,2184.0,formal

Dickey's may not entirely embody the genuine article, but it constitutes a welcome addition to Madison's barbecue scene, and I sincerely hope it endures.  

The meats exhibit a palpable smoky flavor and tenderness, although they are occasionally overcooked. This phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that fast-food/fast-casual establishments like Dickey's may not smoke their meats in-house daily. Instead, they might be smoked off-site and subsequently transported. However, given the affordable pricing, this compromise proves acceptable. The ribs and brisket warrant ordering. The chicken, on the other hand, consists of a grilled breast that can be obtained from any run-of-the-mill eatery.  

The sauces, available in both original and spicy varieties, are presented at a piping hot temperature, much like their Texan counterparts. Their texture adheres to the thinner, characteristic Texas consistency, which I find appealing.

Alas, this strategy often results in certain menu items being overwhelmed by an oppressive heat, thereby obfuscating their inherent flavors. A case in point is the crawfish scampi appetizer, which, in its traditional preparation, relies on a subtle infusion of garlic, herbs, and, on occasion, a judicious sprinkling of red pepper flakes to enhance the delicate taste of the shellfish. Unfortunately, the Cajun Queen's interpretation of this dish involves an egregious application of chili, effectively subsuming the crawfish's natural sweetness beneath a fiery blanket of spice.

Furthermore, our server, seemingly obsessed with maximizing our expenditure, adopted an overzealous approach, bordering on the impertinent, by insisting we commence our repast with a copious quantity of oysters, twenty-four to be precise, in addition to interpolating several ounces of wagyu beef into the meal, an suggestion that struck me as not only superfluous but also utterly preposterous.

In conclusion, given the plethora of superior dining options available in Las Vegas, it is my conviction that one would be ill-advised to allocate their resources towards experiencing the culinary endeavors of this particular restaurant, upstairs or otherwise.",True,2226.0,formal

As for the culinary offerings, I opted to share the pollo fundido with my companion. Although it failed to elicit an overwhelming impression, primarily due to the fact that X Tapa Joe's rendition remains unparalleled in my opinion, the accompanying yellow rice was truly exceptional. Typically, my expectations for the customary dry and lackluster Mexican rice are not particularly high; however, the variant presented at El Encanto was conspicuously distinct, boasting a delightful combination of moisture and rich flavors that closely mirrored the yellow rice I personally prepare. While the margaritas were somewhat too saccharine for my taste, they remained passable.

Two of us had it with wine pairings as well.  The presentation was good. We started with some type of a small palette cleanser. Our first course was either a mushroom soup or a salad. I had the soup and my husband had the salad. It was good though not amazing. Our second course was pasta with meat type sauce. This was the best course by far. Our entree was a flat iron steak. It was good but again not amazing. Dessert was blue cotton candy and chocolate cake w banana gelato. The cotton candy was a nice surprise.\n\nWhat was very disappointing was the wine pairings. Our waiter knew very little about the wines and strangely did the same pairings regardless of whether we ordered. The soup or salad and the fish or steak entree. The entire wine line-up was completely in the red family. \n\nOverall the presentation was good, portion size was good, service was ok, food was ok.

Steak's of all cut from top sirloin to flay ming yong wrapped in bacon. There is also rib which are excellent, lamb which is fair, chicken.

Upon arriving at the establishment, we observed the presence of a restaurant specializing in Vietnamese cuisine, which we found rather peculiar. Furthermore, we expressed our skepticism regarding the quality of the fare served within said eatery, as evidenced by our derisive comments directed towards those who had chosen to partake in their meals there, and presumably, pay an elevated price for the experience.

It is conceivable that this policy served as a deterrent to potential patrons, thus resulting in our relative seclusion. Upon ordering sustenance, we relocated to a table and transported our beverages with us. The proportions of the sandwiches were considerable, specifically the philly cheesesteak variety, and their quality was satisfactory. However, one must consider the financial ramifications of consuming here, as the total cost of our repast, inclusive of gratuity, approached forty dollars for a mere two sandwiches.

The ambiance was vibrant and bustling on a Wednesday evening, with a scarcity of parking spaces that proved to be a minor inconvenience. Our party of thirteen was accommodated in a cozy corner proximate to the entrance, where the influx of chilly air and pungent cigarette odors occasionally permeated the atmosphere. Fortunately, my siblings possess diminutive statures, which enabled them to occupy the seats adjacent to the wall without any significant discomfort. However, it is worth noting that the seating arrangement was somewhat cramped and would have posed a challenge for individuals of average build.

The culinary offerings were diverse and included traditional Chinese delicacies such as lobster, red trout, fried flounder, chicken, beef, and an assortment of vegetables. While the fare was satisfactory, it did not exceed my expectations, and a minor mistake in one of the children's orders slightly marred the dining experience. Nevertheless, my grandmother appeared to enjoy the meal, and her satisfaction was of paramount importance to me. In conclusion, although I prefer other establishments, I would not object to revisiting this venue in the future, provided that I am not subjected to the discomfort of sitting beside the entrance during inclement weather.",True,2408.0,formal
3," Paul Martin's possesses numerous attributes that render it an appealing dining establishment, regrettably, the peripheral aspects are subpar. Paul Martin's exudes an air of refinement, reminiscent of upscale steakhouses in the nation's capital, with its dim yet pleasing illumination, vibrant but unobtrusive musical ambiance, and welcoming atmosphere.

The culinary offerings at Paul Martin's are generally satisfactory, with the Sunday special, comprising a salad, prime rib, and ice cream, priced at $25, being a notable example. The salad boasts a diverse array of flavors without becoming overpowering, while the prime rib is tender and benefits from an exceptional spice rub that elevates it to a higher level. Unfortunately, the interior of the prime rib is somewhat lacking in quality, resembling a vast expanse of mediocre meat. The dessert option fails to impress, as the absence of lactose-free selections renders it inaccessible to patrons with dietary restrictions, which is both disappointing and perplexing, given the high standards that Paul Martin's purports to uphold.

The service at Paul Martin's falls short of expectations, as the server appears overwhelmed on occasion, exemplified by their response to our query regarding lactose intolerance, where they erroneously inform us that the ice cream is gluten-free. Furthermore, the staff's handling of gift cards sold by the establishment borders on offensive, as paying customers are made to feel awkward and guilty for utilizing them.

In conclusion, Paul Martin's cuisine warrants a rating of four stars, whereas its service only manages to achieve two stars. Thus, a rating of three stars seems appropriate.",True,2409.0,formal

Despite its apparent length, the queue moved at a glacial pace, making the prolonged delay seem utterly absurd. 
  Upon drawing closer to the front of the line, it became apparent that the sluggishness was attributable to a single individual performing the duties of two people. Although he demonstrated remarkable speed in crafting the tacos, he was responsible for preparing a minimum of five tacos for every patron. Moreover, he produced an excess of fifty tacos while we waited, ostensibly for takeout orders (wrapped in foil and placed on paper plates).

However, in light of Denise's recent efforts to prioritize her own eye care, I recognized the importance of scheduling an appointment for myself as well. Consequently, I registered at the Christenbury Eye Center, which boasts a highly organized and professional environment, characterized by a seamless procession of patients through various rooms, wherein specialists administer a diverse array of assessments designed to evaluate the functionality of one's visual acuity. Although I cannot verify the authenticity of their methods, the center's reputation is reinforced by endorsements from renowned individuals who attest to the staff's expertise. Moreover, they offer advanced laser eye surgery procedures, but subsequent to administering medicated drops that caused my pupils to dilate and significantly impaired my vision for several hours, the specialists concluded that my eyes were in fact in optimal condition.

My family, hailing from Korea, embarked upon a visitation to our humble abode, and during our sojourn to the gastronomical Mecca known as Las Vegas, they expressed an ardent yearning for culinary familiarity. My stratagem was to escort them to the esteemed Grand Lux, but en route, my grandmother's complexion assumed a pallid hue. Thus, we diverted our course towards Imperial Palace, guided by conspicuous signage. Upon ascending the elevator to the fifth floor dining plaza, we were greeted by a warm, familial Korean salutation, which elicited a visible improvement in my grandmother's countenance.  
The menu proffered an array of Korean, Japanese, and Chinese delicacies, but we elected to indulge exclusively in Korean cuisine. Our repast consisted of duk mandoo gook (a hearty soup composed of rice cakes and dumplings), dolsot bibimbap (a medley of rice, vegetables, and a fried egg, served in a sizzling stone bowl), soft tofu soup, and bulgogi (tender, marinated meat). While the fare was unremarkable, observing my grandmother grasp her rice bowl with both hands and devour its contents with unbridled relish rendered the meal decidedly more satisfying.

Firstly, the prices are exorbitant, and the meager portions do not justify the cost. For instance, burgers, skewers, sandwiches, and salads are priced around $10, while pizzas range from $10 to $15. Moreover, everything is served a la carte, and the entrees consist of merely three appetizer-sized skewers.

3," It is an acceptable venue, albeit one that I would not have chosen to visit had we not been extended an invitation accompanied by a reserved table. The diminutive size of the establishment, while potentially charming, was unfortunately exacerbated by the presence of a substantial number of patrons, creating an atmosphere akin to that of a crowded subway car in China or New York City. Notwithstanding the cramped conditions, I must admit that the personal hygiene of the clientele was satisfactory, in contrast to the malodorous ambiance often associated with public transportation in urban centers. A plethora of ostensibly synthetic, juvenile females were conspicuously present, rendering the environment somewhat unsettling for a solitary, relatively youthful individual such as myself (being merely 27 years of age). 
  The beverages served at this establishment are quite costly; I opted to procure three shots for our group, as I felt no compulsion to emulate the behavior of certain metrosexual individuals who insist on purchasing drinks for others. Furthermore, I am financially capable of treating myself. However, upon perusing the bill, I was taken aback by the exorbitant price of $36 for a mere three shots. In light of this, I felt compelled to remark on the receipt that ""I ain't no rich bitch,"" and I apologize for any offense caused to the bartender. Nonetheless, considering the steep prices, I believe it is essential to either consume alcoholic beverages liberally before arriving or to accompany someone possessing a platinum credit card, lest one wishes to incur financial hardship.

For optimal culinary experiences, it is advisable to arrive promptly, as the most delectable items often disappear rapidly. The fried chicken, when cooked to perfection, is undoubtedly a highlight, although it occasionally suffers from overcooking or dryness. The six-cheese spaghetti is also a commendable option, but its quality can vary depending on the preparation method. The abundance of sides offers numerous choices, including mac-n-cheese, which, much like the aforementioned chicken and spaghetti, may occasionally be overcooked, resulting in a less than satisfactory dining experience. However, the blackeyed peas and cornbread consistently impress, and their lemonade, arguably the finest in Charlotte, has garnered high praise. A word of caution regarding the volunteers who handle beverage refills: they are renowned for their warmth and generosity, and a adept diner may even secure an additional portion of mac-n-cheese through skillful banter. It is essential to display gratitude via a gratuity at the register. Fare thee well, my friend.",True,2719.0,formal

Notably, by the time of our departure, a sole couple remained, and they too were oblivious to the proper seating arrangement, thereby resulting in their failure to capitalize on the discounted prices.  

Our culinary experience was satisfactory, albeit not exceptional, with a few notable exceptions. The red sangria was unremarkable, while the lamb, though flavorsome, was diminutive and overpriced. The croquettes were uninspired, whereas the Patatas Bravas, essentially roasted potatoes enrobed in a tomato-based sauce, was straightforward yet gratifying.

The Mother's Day special included a delectable mango lassi and a dolsa, which consists of a rolled-up pancake containing a lentil filling.

Furthermore, the tandoori chicken was cooked to perfection, retaining its natural moisture and avoiding the common pitfall of dryness often associated with this dish at other establishments.  The paneer sag (a spinach and cheese dish) also demonstrated notable quality.

3," I inhabit a proximate location in relation to Papago, thereby rendering it a frequent destination for my pedestrian excursions. However, my motivation for visiting this site does not stem from an ardent affection towards it, but rather due to its accessibility and the unchallenging nature of its trails. In fact, Papago is one of the few locations where I feel completely secure venturing out solo, owing to the absence of hazardous terrain and the minimal likelihood of encountering perilous situations, unless one mistakenly takes a misstep while ascending one of the buttes, thereby risking injury.  
The park boasts a well-maintained and pristine condition, offering picturesque vistas of Phoenix, Tempe, and Scottsdale during one's trek. On occasion, I have had the pleasure of observing avian species of interest, fluttering overhead. Given its straightforward terrain, Papago serves as an ideal venue for novice hikers and those seeking a leisurely outdoor experience with their canine companions or progeny. For those seeking to indulge in some fresh air and respite from the mundane routine, a brief sojourn to Papago during a tranquil morning or afternoon is highly recommended.",True,2808.0,formal

As fate would have it, a Red Robin restaurant happened to be situated within close proximity, thereby rendering it an ideal choice for my culinary endeavors. Admittedly, my initial reaction was tinged with incredulity, as there existed a plethora of exceptional dining options within the city limits, yet I chose to frequent a chain restaurant that was seemingly ubiquitous. However, my desire for a straightforward, uncomplicated dining experience ultimately prevailed, leading me to select this particular venue. Upon entering the premises, I was escorted to a cozy table positioned near a window, affording me an unobstructed view of the bustling mall. Following a cursory examination of the menu, I settled upon a basic, unadorned burger, dubbed the 'Keep it Simple' option. The server, cognizant of the brief delay, offered an apology and proceeded to take my order. The ensuing wait, though perceived as somewhat prolonged, did not unduly perturb me, as I was not particularly pressed for time. Ultimately, my patience was rewarded, as the arrival of my culinary creation elicited feelings of satisfaction and contentment, owing to both its generous proportions and satisfying taste. For those who harbor a penchant for superior burgers, a visit to the Red Robin located within the Galleria Mall is certainly worth considering. Furthermore, I must admit that I am eager to explore the breadth of their menu offerings and sample alternative burgers during a future visit. In conclusion, I would assign this establishment a rating of three out of five stars, thereby acknowledging its merits while simultaneously underscoring room for improvement.""",True,2850.0,formal

My companion ordered the cashew chicken for the first time, and he thoroughly enjoyed it. My acquaintance had the chicken fried rice, which was also quite satisfactory. The prices at this venue are reasonable for the generous portions, making it an ideal location for budget-conscious college students. I would return to this eatery for sustenance, but I would not order the Pho again.

I am awarding three stars for this review due to two primary factors. Firstly, I requested the Thai iced tea for nearly $3, anticipating a revitalizing and genuine Thai iced tea experience. However, what I received was a minuscule bottled beverage from the refrigerator, which was underwhelming and not worth the cost. The individual behind the counter offered a lackadaisical explanation, stating she was ""too indolent to prepare a proper one."" Secondly, the dining area was excessively humid and warm, with the entrance open on a steamy rainy day. As a result, I perspired profusely during my dining experience, which was disagreeable. Moreover, there were laborers mending the ceiling tiles or something in close proximity, which I deemed unsuitable for when patrons are consuming their meals mere feet away.

The cuisine was palatable, but the ambiance left much to be desired. Despite this, I will continue to visit this establishment for a speedy Thai culinary fix, primarily due to its accessibility and prime location on Green Street.",True,2996.0,formal

However, my assumptions were proven incorrect, as this establishment solely focuses on providing delectable Thai fare, sans any ping pong-related activities or equipment. Disappointingly, the Panang curry has failed to impress, lacking depth of flavor and an unfortunate watery consistency. In contrast, the Pad Kee Maw has proven to be a saving grace, boasting sufficient spiciness to satiate my taste buds, albeit at a medium level of heat. This dish remains the primary draw for my patronage, despite subpar service. Dining in yields sluggish service, while takeout orders experience an inverse phenomenon - an abundance of efficiency. Regrettably, both scenarios culminate in a lackluster experience, leaving the customer feeling inconsequential. It is worth mentioning that the restaurant tends to attract sizable crowds during the lunch hour, further contributing to the underwhelming ambiance. Were Ping Pong Thai to incorporate a ping pong table, a novel and engaging element, my rating would undoubtedly increase.

Let me tell you, it was an unforgettable experience! 

First off, we indulged in some vino. Now, the wine list was nothing short of exhaustive and utterly perplexing, so we sought the expertise of our waitstaff. She guided us towards the house wines, cleverly designated as #1, #2, and #3. If memory serves me right, they consisted of Pinot Grigio, Pinot Noir, and Merlot. I shared two carafes of the latter with a fellow coworker and found it to be quite delectable. 

We also sampled two appetizers, Panzarotti and Fiori de Zucca. While the fried zucchini slices that comprised the Fiori de Zucca were undoubtedly palatable, it wasn't exactly my cup of tea. On the other hand, the Panzarotti stole the show. Imagine a heavenly fusion of fried risotto and mozzarella, all neatly packaged into a single bite. I simply couldn't resist claiming the last one, even if it meant risking a bout of embarrassment due to my gluttonous tendencies. 

For my main course, I opted for the Ravioli alla Caprese. Now, this dish may have been straightforward in its composition, but boy, did it deliver! Each bite was a masterclass in culinary execution.

During our initial visit, my fiancÃ© opted for a pizza and a set of chicken wings, the latter of which can best be described as utterly delectable and dangerously addictive. The wings possess a delightful crunchiness on the exterior, complemented by an interior that is remarkably moist, and when paired with a tangy ranch or hot sauce, the result is nothing short of culinary perfection. In contrast, the pizza, while certainly enjoyable, did not quite live up to the lofty standards set by the wings. Our order consisted of a straightforward pepperoni pizza, with the remaining half being divided between mushrooms and sausage.  
On our second visit, we decided to sample one of Biaggio's renowned stromboli, and we were pleasantly surprised by its generous size. Our selection featured chicken accompanied by artichokes and red peppers, and while the inclusion of artichokes was undoubtedly a welcome touch, it is our belief that the more affordable 6.99 stromboli options are superior to the pricier specialty variety, which carried a hefty price tag of 12.99. Although both meals tallied approximately thirty dollars, we cannot help but feel that such a sum is somewhat excessive for a mere pie and wings.

Notwithstanding, my feline companion, Josie, harbors an irrational trepidation towards all pet care professionals, sans any logical explanation or traumatic event.

Prior to arriving, I telephoned to ascertain whether Katie could feasibly shave Josie's haunches, thereby averting any unsightly clinging of fur to her posterior region (which I deemed unpleasant). Katie competently affixed an E-collar onto Josie and divulged that she would need to scruff her during the process, which I found acceptable, given my cat's cacophony of screeches and display of embarrassing behavior. Within a span of fewer than ten minutes, Katie accomplished the task for a mere $6! Moreover, Josie was promptly restored to her carrier, appearing unfazed by the experience. 
In light of the fact that a veterinarian suggested sedating Josie for any grooming purposes and even advocated for inhumane declawing, I consider Katie's proficiency in handling my eccentric feline a true blessing.

Moreover, the edibles served at this establishment are not only flavorsome but also fresh, thereby ensuring a gratifying dining experience for all patrons.  During a recent group interview in Uptown, a few of us were seeking a nearby luncheon venue, and given the inclement weather conditions, we opted to dine at King's Kitchen, situated conveniently at the corner of the block. Upon perusing the menu, we were pleased with the variety of options available and thus requested seating. I personally relished the chicken salad croissant sandwich, accompanied by a side of mixed greens salad with balsamic dressing. The sandwich was indeed scrumptious, boasting fresh ingredients and a generous portion size. The side salad, though unpretentious, was likewise fresh and satisfying. The other dishes ordered by my companions appeared equally appetizing. The prices, ranging from $9 to $13 for the lunch menu, were reasonable and reflected the superior quality of the cuisine. Furthermore, the service was attentive, and the staff members were courteous and friendly, further enhancing our dining experience.

Perchance, the notion of incorporating a compass into the casino's layout would alleviate some of the confusion encountered by patrons attempting to navigate their way to this culinary establishment; alas, such an implement remains conspicuously absent. Instead, one must rely upon the meager guidance proffered by preceding reviewers, whose directions often prove as convoluted as the layout itself.

Arguably, this dish reigns supreme among its peers, rendering superfluous any attempts at comparison. In short, it is an absolute must-try.  
Conversely, the French toast, while visually appealing, failed to elicit the same level of enthusiasm as its predecessor. Perhaps, it was the underwhelming presentation or the palpable lack of innovation that contributed to our relative indifference toward this particular item.  
The ambiance of the restaurant, unfortunately, did not escape our scrutiny unscathed. With its outdated decor and cramped, haphazardly arranged tables, Bouchon suffered a slight diminution in esteem.

4," I have had the pleasure of partaking in the culinary delights offered by this esteemed establishment on multiple occasions, and I must say that each visit has been a truly gratifying experience. Most recently, I had the privilege of dining here in the company of some visiting family and friends, and suffice it to say that everyone in attendance left feeling thoroughly satiated. 
  For those seeking uniquely crafted, expertly mixed beverages, this venue is an absolute must-visit destination. The drinks menu boasts an impressive array of libations, each one thoughtfully categorized by historical era and accompanied by a brief description elucidating the origins of its name. 
  During our visit, nearly all members of our party opted to take advantage of the happy hour special, which featured steaks at half price. While one of the filets was unfortunately slightly undercooked, the remainder of the dishes were cooked to perfection. Furthermore, the assortment of side dishes we ordered were, without exception, utterly delectable, with the truffle macaroni and cheese emerging as a clear favorite among our group. I would be remiss if I did not give special mention to the ""Farmer"" flatbread pizza, whose ingredients included bacon, spinach, and a perfectly cooked egg; this dish is nothing short of a gastronomic masterpiece, and I implore you to sample it for yourself in order to fully appreciate its splendor. 
  As for dessert, while we initially harbored doubts about our ability to consume anything further, our server's vivid descriptions quickly dispelled such concerns. We opted to try both the pizooki (a delightful, crispy flatbread confection) and the homemade doughnuts, and I am pleased to report that both offerings met and indeed surpassed our loftiest expectations. The word ""heavenly"" does not even begin to do justice to the sublime experience that these desserts provided. In conclusion, I must reiterate my unwavering endorsement of this superlative eatery, whose ambiance, culinary prowess, and expertly crafted potions make it a true gem, tucked away from the frenetic activity of the Las Vegas Strip.",True,3396.0,formal

4," During a sweltering spring day in Chinatown, I experienced an unrelenting sensation of hunger, which is not unusual given my accelerated metabolic rate. Having grown weary of my customary Thai cuisine, I opted to explore novel gastronomical options and discovered HSP through a cursory examination of Yelp.

Upon arriving at the establishment, located towards the conclusion of the Chinatown Plaza extension on Wynn Road and Spring Mountain, I encountered a hospitable female staff member who divulged that the restaurant had been in operation for five years, news that left me feeling utterly oblivious to my surroundings, much like a marine creature dwelling at the bottom of a pineapple.

My voracious appetite compelled me to advance toward the eatery, whereupon I beheld a modest storefront presenting a limited assortment of diverse poke varieties. The diminutive quantity of each poke served as a testament to the proprietors' commitment to preserving the freshness of their seafood offerings. As an individual without any significant experience with Hawaiian cuisine or coastal residency, I could still discern the absence of fishy odors in my Shoyu Limu Tuna bowl, substantiating my supposition that the poke was indeed fresh. This delightful culinary discovery, complemented by warm rice embellished with black sesame seeds and available at a mere $8, kindled within me an eagerness to revisit the establishment and sample additional menu items.",True,3398.0,formal

However, upon closer inspection, one will discover that it offers an array of delectable and reasonably priced culinary options, accompanied by an attentive and hospitable service staff. On a cold winter's evening, as the biting winds whip through Bruntsfield Place, there is little more comforting than forcing one's way through the double doors and into the welcoming warmth and enticing aroma of exotic Indian spices that permeate the atmosphere within.

However, it is worth noting that the culinary offerings are consistently exceptional, with my personal preference being a succulent steak, while my spouse favors either the skate or a hearty portion of slow-cooked short ribs. It is also worth mentioning that we have never encountered an unpleasant server or subpar dish during our visits. In conclusion, if you wish to partake in the ambiance of the patio, which offers unparalleled people-watching opportunities, it is advisable to anticipate a delay. Unfortunately, the current system in place does not allow for timely notification via text message when a table becomes available, which can be inconvenient given the limited range of the sensors within the casino.

An exemplary work of art, suspended from the ceiling, served as a point of reference, allowing us to appreciate its beauty and complexity. Beverages, priced at five dollars for a glass of beer and seven dollars for a glass of wine, were available for purchase, with the added bonus of a fifty percent discount during the final hour of the session. As we had satiated our hunger prior to attending, I did not have the opportunity to sample the culinary offerings, although it appeared that many participants availed themselves of the brief respite afforded during the middle of the class to partake of various hors d'oeuvres.

The personnel at this venue are remarkably hospitable, exhibiting an attentive demeanor without being excessively intrusive. The culinary offerings are quite delectable, particularly the chicken sandwich, which constitutes a veritable explosion of flavors. The waitstaff has divulged that patrons can request the chicken sandwich to be served as a wrap, an option that is not explicitly listed on the menu. This revelation precipitates our profound gratitude.

However, there are certain aspects that warrant mentioning. Firstly, for those who partake in the practice of checking in on review websites, it is worth noting that doing so will reward them with a complimentary shot of the establishment's signature whiskey. Unfortunately, this particular elixir is not especially palatable, bearing a strong resemblance to a medicinal concoction such as Triaminic cold and cough medicine. Thus, it is advisable to exercise caution when indulging in this particular promotion.

Furthermore, the design of the bathroom sinks leaves much to be desired. The decision to implement a slightly tilted slab of tile as a sink is, quite frankly, baffling. Such a configuration not only hinders the effective containment of water but also generates an unfortunate propensity for splashing, thereby endangering the integrity of one's attire. It is our fervent hope that management will consider replacing these questionable sink designs with more traditional basins, thereby ensuring a more pleasant experience for all patrons.

The queues to purchase tickets were somewhat inefficient, which I attribute to the sudden influx of patrons eager to partake in the attraction before its closure at midnight on weekends.

The ride itself was simultaneously terrifying and humorous, as I failed to carefully consider my attire and my companion and I couldn't help but burst into fits of laughter upon viewing our photographs. The cost of each picture was $15, with the option to purchase two for $22, which we opted for and split the cost.

I opted for a Ranger IPA from their diverse selection of tap beverages, which, in my opinion, constitutes a commendable choice. The assortment of beers available at this everyday drinkery is indeed satisfactory. My culinary excursion began with an order of philly cheese accompanied by mesquite seasoned fries. The latter proved to be a gastronomic highlight, as the flavorful seasoning augmented the inherent deliciousness of the potatoes. However, the philly itself was not without its flaws, as the steak exhibited a tendency towards dryness and an excess of bread hindered the overall enjoyment of the dish. Nonetheless, the freshness of the onions and peppers provided a welcome contrast. Considering the aforementioned factors, I chose to elevate Whiskey Dicks by a star in my rating, primarily due to the establishment's commitment to offering a variety of palatable craft beers alongside its hospitable atmosphere.

Other menu items: Although they offer an array of Vietnamese, Chinese, and Thai cuisine, the authenticity of these dishes leaves much to be desired. However, their Vietnamese sandwiches and boba tea (which is passable) are the exceptions that prove the rule. Unfortunately, their pho falls short of my expectations. 

Price: A veritable steal! These scrumptious sandwiches can be had for the paltry sum of $3.50 apiece. However, be aware that a minimum purchase of $20 is required for the privilege of using a debit card, a caveat that may prove vexing for those who, like myself, eschew carrying cash.

The Mill's art gallery space, expertly curated by Mr. Elder, showcases works of art that are both visually stunning and thought-provoking, further solidifying The Mill's reputation as a hub of creativity and innovation. \n\nWhile the market area, though aesthetically pleasing, falls somewhat short of expectations due to the infrequent attendance of vendors during weekdays, it remains a worthwhile venture for those seeking unique and artisanal goods. Of the few vendors that I had the pleasure of encountering, Pickleville, with its delectable assortment of pickled delights, stood out as a personal favorite, closely followed by Cloister Honey and Simply Local, the latter of which offered an assortment of mouthwatering chocolate bars from esteemed establishments such as Uncle Scott Root Beer, Black Mountain Chocolate, and Escazu. Additionally, the muscadine juices available at Simply Local, although not without merit, fell somewhat short of excellence, leaving room for improvement in terms of flavor profile. \n\nIn conclusion, The Mill, with its eclectic mix of eateries, shops, and galleries, has the potential to become a true icon of modernity and culture, provided that it continues to build upon its existing strengths and addresses areas of improvement.""",True,3529.0,formal

My recent visit afforded me the opportunity to sample their exemplary fare, including a standard cup of joe, complemented by a complimentary chocolate-coated coffee bean.

Additional advantages of this venue include a double drive-through system, prices that are considerably lower than those of Starbucks, and a staff whose cordiality is nothing short of extraordinary.

This sight instilled within me a sense of optimism, leading me to surmise that the establishment was likely to serve quality cuisine.

Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by a recently renovated interior, characterized by spotless formica booths and shiny tile floors, although the ambiance remained relatively unremarkable. Customers are required to place their orders at the cashier or utilize the drive-thru window, following which their meals are prepared and ready for collection within a mere five minutes. The prices, in my opinion, are one of the primary draws of this eatery, as they are eminently reasonable and affordable for the majority of patrons.

We opted to sample the fish taco plate, which consisted of two generously proportioned tacos enveloped in fresh corn tortillas, complemented by an abundance of crisp cabbage and rich, creamy crema. Although the rice and beans accompanying the dish were undeniably delectable, they were regrettably not served at a sufficiently high temperature, thereby precluding them from attaining a perfect rating. Notwithstanding this minor shortcoming, my spouse and I were able to share a single platter for the modest sum of $6.99, a price point that strikes me as remarkably reasonable.

Furthermore, the diverse array of authentic Mexican flavors available at this establishment is certain to appeal to aficionados of the cuisine. The prices, while not exorbitant, are sufficient to ensure that the restaurant remains profitable, and the clientele appears to comprise primarily individuals who genuinely appreciate and understand the nuances of Mexican cooking.

A self-serve salsa bar, replete with an assortment of customary salsas, as well as my personal favorite, pickled carrots and fresh radishes, further enhances the dining experience.

""Each and every time that I have visited Montreal over the past six years, I have invariably indulged in a culinary excursion to Schwartz's, an establishment renowned for its delectable smoked meat offerings. My husband, in particular, harbors an unwavering fondness for this esteemed eatery, which borders on an unhealthy obsession. As such, I have become accustomed to his insistent entreaties to partake in the indulgence whenever our travels bring us within proximity of this gastronomic mecca. After extensive exposure to his unrelenting yearning, I have come to comprehend and even empathize with his unbridled passion.  

Every individual boasts their unique modus operandi when it comes to placing an order at Schwartz's. Some may opt for a complementary cherry cola beverage to accompany their sandwich, while others may elect to consume their meal with the aid of a knife and fork, an uncommon practice that I find difficult to reconcile with. Notwithstanding my reservations regarding this latter approach, I refrain from passing judgment, as each person's preferences are inherently valid. Personally, I adhere to a time-tested formula that consists of a sandwich, shared fries, a pickle, and a cherry cola. Furthermore, I ensure that a bottle of A1 steak sauce remains within arm's reach, as it serves as an indispensable condiment that enhances the flavor profile of my meal.  

While I am hesitant to label Schwartz's as either the premier restaurant in Canada or the Montreal counterpart of Katz's, I cannot deny the exceptional quality of their smoked meat offerings. The distinctive preparation method employed by this venerable establishment yields a product that is not only tantalizingly delicious but also remarkably dissimilar to the bagel-accompanied smoked meat found in New York delis. The dining environment, characterized by cozy proximity to fellow patrons, fosters a convivial atmosphere that has led to numerous engaging conversations during my visits.  

Although the queue may appear formidable, the seasoned gentleman manning the entrance possesses a keen understanding of his role and executes it with precision.

However, these minor transgressions do not deter me from indulging in my preferred fast food fare. In fact, this establishment offers the best alternative to traditional burger chains, serving delectable burgers, chicken fries, fried okra, and fish.

This dichotomy is manifest in the culinary preferences of the city's inhabitants, with individuals either aligning themselves with Pamela's or Deluca's, the two establishments representing the antitheses of the breakfast food spectrum. As an ardent adherent of the latter, I would eagerly engage in a spirited dispute with proponents of Pamela's, provided that I have been adequately fortified by a colossal breakfast burrito, proportionate in size to my cranial dimensions, and numerous cups of coffee. 
 Deluca's, while possessing certain idiosyncrasies, continues to captivate my attention. These peculiarities include an interminable wait for seating (attributable to the universal desire to partake in the restaurant's offerings), an ambiance reminiscent of a vintage diner, replete with an eccentric mural and surfaces susceptible to stickiness, and a service staff that, while proficient, does not indulge in excessive coddling of their clientele, given the restaurant's bustling nature and modest gratuities. Personally, I find these characteristics appealing and actively seek them out in a dining establishment. My fondness for Deluca's extends to visiting the restaurant in a state of mild inebriation, whereupon I relish devouring a gargantuan burrito and copious amounts of orange juice and coffee, the latter replenished at irregular intervals by an accommodating server.

I conveyed to Chris, proprietor of Naked City Pizza, my apprehension regarding the safety of visiting such an establishment after sunset. He assured me that it was primarily a gathering place for industry professionals and not to be concerned. 

In the company of my spouse and progenitor, I partook in a midday repast at this purported eatery. We opted against ordering their signature dish, pizza, and instead chose to sample their buffalo wings. Additionally, we requested the steak frites sub, a special dish inscribed on a blackboard within the premises. My parent had a chili cheese hot dog accompanied by a portion of french fried potatoes. 

The buffalo wings were thoroughly enjoyable, prepared precisely to my preference. We requested them to be served ""hot,"" and they did not disappoint. My patriarch was quite taken by his chili cheese hot dog, adorned with an assortment of toppings including chili, cheese, pickles, onions, jalapenos, et cetera. Unfortunately, he did not express the same level of satisfaction with his fries. 

The steak frites sub was a colossal bread roll smothered in cheese and filled with beef that had been marinated in garlic, a creamy horseradish sauce, and shoestring fries. It was presented with a side of peppery gravy to be drizzled over the top. The quality of the sandwich was exceptional. The meat was copious and perfectly seasoned, thereby eliciting a positive response from my taste buds. 

The total cost of our meal for three individuals was twenty-five dollars, and we even took some leftovers home. I shall certainly return to this establishment in the near future to sample their pizza.",True,3707.0,formal

I thoroughly enjoyed their salted fish and chicken fried rice, with a generous serving size that did not scrimp on the salted fish, a notable aspect that impressed me. Additionally, I purchased their jook for my father, who was indisposed, and he relished the salted pork accompanied by a thousand-year-old egg porridge; the flavors were adequately balanced, neither excessively salty nor overly watery. During our subsequent visit, my father opted for their curry beef, the quality of which I presumed to be satisfactory, given that he consumed the entire dish. We also indulged in their beef chow fun, which boasted an abundance of flavor derived from the intense heat of the stove.

Tamari boasts an extensive array of beverages, encompassing intriguing cocktails and a satisfactory selection of wine and beer.  

I was thoroughly impressed by the imaginative combinations of tapas presented. For the first time in my life, I didn't feel particularly famished.

My fondness for the red snapper, which was served with mussels in a saffron broth, was immense. This dish was uniquely flavored and utterly delicious!  

My companion had the empanadas (which unfortunately did not meet his expectations), but he was thoroughly astounded by both the cost and the caliber of the hangar steak.

The ambiance and dÃ©cor are equally impressive, fostering a welcoming environment in which to enjoy a meal. The service we received was exceptional; our server ensured that our glasses remained consistently filled, never dipping below the halfway mark. We opted to begin our dining experience with the goat cheese appetizer, which proved to be a delicious choice, particularly when paired with the accompanying beets. My main course selection was the smokey burger, boasting an incredible depth of flavor; however, the texture of the patty was somewhat problematic, as it had a tendency to disintegrate upon handling, making it challenging to consume without a certain degree of dexterity. My spouse chose the sirloin steak, accompanied by sautÃ©ed mushrooms, and while he praised the rich, savory flavors, he did comment on the chewiness of the cut, as well as the presence of gristle throughout. For our final course, we indulged in the s'mores parfait, which delighted our taste buds with its sweet, chocolatey essence. All things considered, we would undoubtedly revisit this establishment, perhaps opting for the prime rib or a seafood entrÃ©e on our next visit.""",True,3752.0,formal

I strongly advise choosing the Sukiyaki style; the sweet soy sauce has a richer flavor, and the udon noodles, along with everything else that comes with it, are significantly superior. Don't neglect to add a generous amount of minced garlic, as it will enhance the taste greatly. 

While the noodle and vegetable plates are pre-prepared, they can be a bit disappointing since each plate tends to have an excess or shortage of a particular ingredient.

However, when augmented with an additional serving of sauce, the Chicken Chipotle proved to be absolutely delightful. At a mere $7 per sandwich, it would be challenging to find a more economical and palatable option. It is worth noting that the portion size of their sandwiches is not excessively generous; while it satisfied my own hunger, my male companions typically require two sandwiches to satiate their appetites fully.

I would suggest definitely printing tickets ahead of time. The second issue was the \""beer garden.\"" While I enjoyed the premise and the beers, there were only 2 beer servers and 1 wine server for many many people.

Consequently, I appreciate bookstores that showcase a curated selection of tomes at the forefront, facilitating a swift and practical purchasing experience. Borders excels in this regard, offering a judicious categorization of their wares, encompassing disparate genres and price points, thereby catering to my pragmatic book shopping style.  

My most recent visit to this establishment was motivated by the impending necessity for a novel for an upcoming weekend, during which my spouse would be occupied with preparations for the Arizona bar examination, leaving me with an abundance of uninterrupted time. Thus, I sought to procure a book that would captivate my attention and provide suitable diversion. Fortuitously, I encountered an intriguing volume on the bestsellers table, its appeal augmented by its accessibility and the absence of an arduous search.  

While Borders offers the advantage of a more navigable shopping experience compared to online retailers like Amazon, the prices they charge are often higher. However, this drawback is offset by the convenience of being able to peruse books in person, without the feeling of being overwhelmed by the vast array of options available on the internet.

Spago's Signature Roasted Beet Goat Cheese Salad, although not necessarily within my typical culinary preferences, proved to be quite delectable.

House Smoked Sturgeon, served with a Crisp Potato Galette and complemented by Horseradish Cream, presented a flavor profile reminiscent of a spicy latke, enhanced by the addition of fish, thus rendering it quite palatable.

The \""Chinois Style\"" Colorado Lamb Chops, accompanied by a Cilantro Mint Vinaigrette and Sweet & Sour Eggplant, demonstrated remarkable tenderness and rich flavor, even when consumed independent of the accompanying sauce.

Cantonese Style Roasted Duck, boasting Wild Huckleberries, Ginger, and Stir-Fried Baby Bok Choy, arrived in generous portions, much to our surprise, as we had anticipated receiving only a single main course to share. Consequently, we departed with ample leftovers.

Although the total expenditure surpassed my initial expectations, the quality of the cuisine, combined with the exceptional service, rendered the dining experience truly satisfying. Furthermore, I must commend Spago for their extraordinary bread platter, which unfortunately, I did not have the privilege of sampling extensively due to my limited appetite. My sincere gratitude extends to Drew W. and Scott G. for their contributions to an unforgettable evening.",True,4334.0,formal

My spouse and I were thoroughly captivated by the delectable flavor profiles showcased in both the twice-cooked pork and chicken katsu, as they presented a harmonious blend of diverse taste sensations, diverging from the customary uninspired Chinese seasonings commonly encountered at local eateries. Although the pot-stickers were somewhat diminutive in size, their quality remained satisfactory. I would unhesitatingly place a future order for takeout from Flo's, as my expectations were surpassed by their culinary prowess. In fact, I would confer a perfect five-star rating, commending their exceptional flavors. My anticipation for sampling their additional offerings remains high, and I look forward to exploring more of their menu items.""

The sweet treats that followed left us both in a state of unadulterated bliss, particularly the sublime Creme Brulee - a paragon of its kind - and the extravagant indulgence platter, a symphony of rich, savory, and sweet elements that included, but was not limited to, decadent brownies, luscious cheesecake, velvety ice cream, fresh fruit, fluffy whipped cream, and an array of tantalizing cheesecake spring rolls that, on their own, would have been sufficient reason to warrant a future visit.

When the sofa was delivered, I was pleasantly surprised that the delivery personnel adhered to the scheduled time frame, which is uncommon in many retail settings.  The delivery team exhibited remarkable proficiency in maneuvering the substantial couch into our compact apartment without causing any damage to the surrounding walls or structures.  Our satisfaction with the couch was further enhanced by a follow-up call from the store manager to ensure that the delivery process had been completed successfully.

At a tariff of $110 through their official website (booked seven days in advance, which is more economical than GolfNow, incidentally), it offers a substantially better value than the standard North Scottsdale courses, and its quality is on par with, or surpasses that of its peers.

You'll likely develop a fondness for the sensation. I suggest requesting a side dish of steamed broccoli (not listed on the menu) to harmonize with the entree.

Additional exceptional options include the seafood sizzling rice, cumin beef, Szechuan peppercorn-infused dishes, green beans and pork, and the shallot beef.

The sandwich itself is not excessively filling, which can be perceived as either beneficial or detrimental, contingent upon one's perspective. If planning to attend a performance such as Peepshow, a light meal from Earl may be advisable to avoid discomfort during the show.

The scarcity of females within the realm of automotive expertise is indeed palpable, and a greater representation of women in this field would be highly advantageous. Upon requesting an examination of my vehicle's clutch system, despite their limited capacity as a partial service auto shop, I was delighted to discover that my clutch functioned appropriately. My previous experiences during periods of extreme temperatures had rendered my clutch prone to slipping excessively during the summer months and becoming overly responsive in the winter season. However, upon conducting a thorough assessment, the competent technicians at this facility demonstrated that my automobile was free from any significant flaws, attributable to a mere design imperfection associated with my car's hydraulic self-adjusting clutch pedal. Notably, the duration of time spent engaging in conversation with Adriana, the skilled female mechanic, prior to the return of my vehicle, complete with fresh oil, filter, and airbox filter replacements, was merely five minutes.

The homemade salsa proved a highlight, not merely due to its generous portioning but also its undeniable zest and freshness. In the evening, I opted for the carne asada chimichanga, which unequivocally ranked as the most satisfying chimichanga I have had the pleasure of consuming. The house-made tortillas lent an unmistakable authenticity, while the apparent pan-frying technique employed resulted in an abundance of grease, a welcome attribute in my book. Accompanied by guacamole and sour cream, the dish struck a satisfying balance, although I could nitpick that the portioning of these condiments perhaps bordered on excessive. Nonetheless, such minor quibbles hardly warranted deductions. The Spanish rice, prepared to perfection, rivaled my own rendition, a testament to the kitchen's proficiency. Upon our arrival, the happy hour was underway, graciously offering half-priced beverages. An added bonus, to be sure! Furthermore, standard drinks, such as soda or iced tea, arrived in copious glasses, effectively doubling the delight.

Every single casino I entered, I was greeted by an abundance of cowboys and cowgirls, flaunting their rugged attire and exuding an unmistakable air of rustic charm. Shhhhâ?donât divulge this to anyone, but I must confess that encountering authentic, living, breathing cowboys was a genuine delight. These werenât merely costumed performers; they were the real deal â?rugged men clad in snug denim jeans, checked button-ups (fastidiously tucked in), substantial belt buckles, sturdy cowboy boots, and topping off their ensemble, a colossal cowboy hat.  
I must admit that Iâve never had the pleasure of being surrounded by such a large concentration of cowboys, roaming the streets with an effortless swagger. The ambiance was further enhanced by block parties sponsored by Crown Royal, where select streets along Las Vegas Boulevard were cordoned off, featuring libations, country melodies, and even a mechanical bull â?an amusing diversion that added to the festive atmosphere.  
I was thoroughly impressed by the remarkable metamorphosis of the Las Vegas Strip, transformed into a rodeo finals venue, catering to the needs of these rugged cowboys.
