1,"Disappointing cakes.  The \""buttercreams\"" are made with shortening, and no butter at all.  Anyone who has tasted real buttercream knows that it is not as shelf stable or white as shortening frosting and tastes like real butter.  The chocolate cake has some kind of flavoring in it.  Fake rum, maybe?  I really think people buy these cakes because they don't know any better.  Perhaps the term \""buttercream\"" is used loosely outside of Europe, but true buttercream is not a concoction of Sweetex (sweetened shortening, commercial grade) and some other fake ingredients.  Carl also is very stuck in his ways when it comes to design.  He's not on the cutting edge, he will only do certain designs that he's been doing since the 80s.  There will be no rolled fondont ribbons or pulled sugar flowers or bright colors.  If you want a simple cake, and don't mind that it is frosted with fake buttercream because that's what is more shelf stable and easy to work with, then go to Carl's.\n\nI see that since I posted my review Deb R. from Carl's Cakes commented.  Thanks for your comment and those pictures.  I can definitely tell which ones Carl decorated as opposed to other cake decorators working there.  The cakes with a very simple piping design and love birds have Carl written all over them.  The cakes that are more creative and interesting are done by other people.  Oh, and you guys must go through a TON of shortening for all that \""buttercream\""!",,,informal
1,"This is based on the Buffet alone\n\nDon't let the extravagance and massive size of Caesar's Palace\ndistract you from how freaking horrible their buffet was.\nI'm not sure if this rule works but when you go to a buffet for dinner in\nLas Vegas and no one is in line for it, I'm thinking it is a first warning.\n\nThe eating area looks nice enough, but when you see the spread\nit is just awful, at no point should you pay $25+ for a buffet\nand you're able to be at one end of the buffet and you can see the other\nend of it, the buffet was THAT short. It was just unimpressive.\nI don't know about you, but when I go to a buffet, i like SELECTION.\nThank goodness they had snow crab legs because if they hadn't\ni would've FLIPPED, so of course i tried to get my meal's worth.\n\nThe food in general was just unappetizing for my eyes and my stomach.\nAvoid the buffet at all costs.",,,informal
1,"This place sucks.  period.  The food is low-end, soggy, overpriced crap.  The service is a joke - you should not come here if you have plans within even 2 hours of entering this place because you will probably still be waiting for your check.  Oh yeah and the best part?!  They dont \""do\"" change.  SO basically if you dare to pay for your meal with cash - don't expect any of the change they owe you from YOUR money.  Probably to save for their pathetic servers because I doubt they actually get tipped anything.  This is quintessential Charlotte BS built for use by the culture-less yuppie zombies that are slowly taking over this city.....beware.",,,informal
1,"I think the ownership has changed.  The people who are running this place now are poor at providing customer service.  What a shame.  I have tried to eat lunch at this place three times over the last month (since the ownership changed) and each time they demanded cash only since \""the credit card machine is broken\"".  WTF?? For a whole month?  If you stopped taking credit cards just say so.  Today when I went to check again, they again said the credit card machine is still broken.  So I declined to eat there and then the manager said \""don't you even have seven dollars for lunch?\""  WTF.....what business is it of theirs how I manage my finances.  I use my credit card for almost everything other than when I am just buying a drink at the Seven-Eleven.  That is how I maximize my bonus points and kick-backs and that is how I track all my expenditures too.  So if you want to be treated like an idiot go there to eat.  If not, don't go because you will certainly be disappointed.  I wonder how long before this place will go under too?",,,informal
1,"This club should be renamed DXS... because the only thing it has an excess of is douchey-ness.\n\nA totally un-original club, where the only highlight was the pool no one was allowed to swim in.

The cover was overpriced, the drinks were overpriced, and the club was wayyyy overcrowded.",,,informal

1,Birthday signup we got the $30 gift card and went over mid week.  Another one of my favorite places.  The service was terrible.  The guy was new and he was trying but we sat down and it took 2 and half hours.  I don't think it's supposed to take that long.  I even saw the manager on my trip to the bathroom and told him that the server needed help.  Nothing changed.  I don't think the manager cared because I didn't see him helping.  \nBut the biggest issue besides being there for 150 minutes was that the fried rice problems.  The cook who I think was also new.  And it could have been the server. But he didn't make enough.  And he accidentally gave the bowl to the wrong person.  Then he realized and took it back and gave it to the poor girl next too us who was also having a birthday.  And I think the first person took a taste of it.  Then my girlfriend gets her rice and because there wasn't enough left he put in a bunch of burned rice that was sitting on the edge of the table trying helplessly to give her a full bowl.  Pretty sad I had to pay a few dollars for that upgrade.,,,informal

1,"I've been going here for two years, but only started seeing them more than once a year to start allergy shots this past April. The actual doctors are good, not great but good enough for me not to search elsewhere. The staff however is abysmal. They regularly cancel appointments or allergy injection hours without notice, lose paperwork and in one case demanded payment and attempted to deny treatment for billing they never actually sent me. \n\nA great example, I decided to start allergy shots in April. They were supposed to start the proces immediately, but only started the process when I follow-up with them in May wondering why I hadn't been charged for it yet. Once they ordered my serum for my allergy shots in May I was told to wait a month. In late June, 6 weeks later, I called and they said they weren't sure, they had no record of my serum yet. Then they confirmed and made my appointment to start. Which they lost when I went in. In the less then 3 months I've been getting shots the \""open hours\"" for shots have been altered without notice 3 times.\n\nOnce I finish my allergy shots I'm leaving and never looking back.",,,informal
1,"Gluten-free sure, but unfortunately lacking in healthy choices. \nWent for breakfast. Smoothie was the most horrible one I have ever had in my life.

1,"I'm sad to have to give this review. I've tried to eat here a half dozen times over the past several months, and succeeded only once. While the food was ok, the service leaves much to be desired.  The biggest complaint? That they don't seem to understand why they have hours of operation on their web profiles, and posted in their window.  As a busy full time worker and student, sometimes I can't make it to a restaurant until after 9. So if you post that your hours are until 10 pm, and the sign in the door says the same thing, and if come in at 9:15, when there are still customers eating, why the hell would you tell me your closed? The sad part is that this isn't a one time occurrence. It has happened repeatedly over the last several months.  You'd spend your money more wisely at New Seoul. My experience over the years is that Korean restaurants either look nice and have poorer quality food and service, or they look like a hole in the wall, but have better food and service.  Sol's on the Square is the former, while New Seoul is the latter, and they actually are open durring their posted hours of operation.",,,informal
1,"Let me start off by saying that I haven't ate at Coco's in probably 10 years, used to go with my grandparents when I was young. My girlfriend ate here with a co-worker a couple weeks ago and said she wanted to go back and get some Pie. I figured why not I really couldn't remember the quality of the food so I decided we'd give it a go.\n\nWe decided to go on her lunch hour and it took the hostess/waitress a good 5 minutes to seat us even though they were not busy at all. This wasn't that big a of a deal since I'm always willing to wait for a good meal. Too bad it never came! We decided to split a sandwich but after 35mintues of waiting I paid for the drinks and had to walk out. The waitress gave us the run around and kept making excuses about why the food was so slow. I will never eat at this coco's again in my life, I can't stand poor customer service or just poor service altogether.",,,informal

There's  way better places in this town to have a out of this world burger, and folks this ain't one of them. \n  First if all I hate spending this kind of dough when I'm not being served.

No matter how good the food could of been, the terrible service by \""Danny\"" ruined it all.  Believe we were there for almost 45 minutes before we even ordered dinner.  Thought maybe he was fired a couple of times since we didn't see him for so long.  It was a Sunday and not busy so could only imagine how bad things are on a Friday or Saturday.  A friend of mine that works in the industry called and spoke with a manager and guess he really didn't much care.  So, glad business is good that you do not have to care!  There was a group of 7 of us and this place will probably not see any of us any time soon.  Keep up the awful service and not caring and I'm more than happy to take my business elsewhere.",,,informal

1,"I really want to like deejai and I've been four or five times to try to build the relationship that just isn't there. Every time I've eaten here the server doesn't write down my order and, predictably, messes it up big time. And then offers nothing more than a \""sorry.\"" \n\nThese have all been simple orders like pad Thai with chicken, pad see ew with tofu, etc. One time the pad Thai came out at the highest spice level because, according to the server, when I didn't specify the heat level he just assumed I'd want it as spicy as possible. My dish originally arrived much later than my husbands and then by the time the server brought out a revised dish (the first one's spice was UNBEARABLE), my husband had already finished his dish and what was supposed to be a lovely dinner together was, well, ruined. \n\nAnother time the dish I ordered with tofu came out with chicken. I told the waiter server this and he apologized and asked if I wanted him to send it back. It was almost 10pm on a Friday and the kitchen was closed so I said I'd just deal with it. \n\nIn my opinion, when these type of thing happen, the restaurant should offer some kind of peace offering - a coupon, discount, free drink - something! Deejai did not and with prices like that, it simply isn't worth it for me to keep trying to love it. Sorry, deejai!",,,informal
1,"I purchase 6 laser treatments for my face and had to request a before and after pic. I did not notice any difference even after receiving the last of those treatments.  In addition, they suggested that I get 3 AFT treatments.  I have only had 2 of those treatments and those i did see a difference.  The technicians that did the treatments were all very skilled and good.  However, with having to deal with the long wait and not being able to book an appt for weeks out and then they have mix ups with the actual confirmed appointments like wrong date or times.  Now I don't know if thats something that is wrong with their book or a dyslexic thing with the scheduling person or what but if you are going to get any services done here, make sure you request your appointment to be written down and if you have to reschedule, make sure you have it emailed to you to be certain you have it in print.  Another suggestion is to book first thing in the morning so you don't have to wait for a long time.

1,"With great relish, the Salt Lick has moved on to greener pastures.\n\nThe issue with here was definitely the seasoning...there were none. I'll always remember this experience last year, I ordered the ribs while my eating companion ordered the brisket...both tasted exactly alike. The sides had ZERO taste to them and the condiment BBQ sauce was extremely watery. I'll admit that I am a fan of Memphis BBQ styles, I did not expect Texas style to be so wildly different. The service also bothered me, we waited a total of 35 minutes to receive our check...not including our eating, prep, sides, and ordering times. I hope the owners learned well because this was a miss on many others' tastebuds. But I will leave this review with one saving grace, the sweet tea was a bit above average.",,,informal

1,"Once in a while, it's possible that a restaurant can have a bad night. Like going on your first date with spinach on your front tooth. But three nights in a row is not a fluke; it's an art. \nMy first night, I ordered their Brooklyn Spaghetti and meatballs. Had I been a Brooklyn wise-guy, somebody would be missing a knee-cap.  They served it in a soup bowl, which was appropriate for the water in the bottom. The \""garlic bread\"" was subbed with some kind of flat bread with garlic butter on it.\nService was minimal, and the waiter must have been on his first week of employment-- Anywhere.\nSo I gave them another chance the next night, and ordered a sizzling platter. Served with a Filthy handle cover, and a rusty, or dirty knife.\nThird times a charm: Spaghetti again. Forgot the cheese. The white bread that was substituted for garlic toast, wasn't even toasted. The waiter said he was sorry, and he was right.\nCleanliness wasn't an option, or a concept known to them.\nSuffice to say it had  all the old world charm of Tijuana.",,,informal

I have good teeth girl...I just want a pizza to eat without a serrated steak knife.  Wow....special!  Garlic bread so so. Same your money and hit up something else.

We sent it back.\n\nI wasn't really impressed with the other dishes.  They weren't bad, just not memorable.\n\nI was a bit surprised the manager didn't come by the table to apologize, and perhaps offer desert or something ... no one acknowledged the bug.  Yes, it was *only* a ladybug, but still ...  Even worse, they didn't remove the item from the bill.\n\nSince it was a client lunch I didn't want to make an issue of it.  But, for the $ I would have expected better service.\n\nI will give huge props to the general manager.  After reading my survey feedback on my experience, he promptly contacted me (on a weekend, no less).  He was very nice and they did adjust the bill quite a bit more than just removing the salad.  5 stars for him and his attempt to make it right.\n\nWithout the bug incident, I still would just give the place 2.5 stars.  Not really worth the cost.  \n\nSorry, Julian Serrano.",,,informal
1,"I went to the place for the first time with a friend. Hard to find. Had to go into a shop to get directions even though we had GPS. Once there it was empty... completely empty for a normal lunch hour. We are both hippie eaters, whole foody kind of girls. There was nothing on the menu we found interesting that we couldn't have made ourselves and while I was on the groupon/fine dining list, it still was outrageously expensive. We shared a salmon dish, tiny and bland with globs of sour cream and capers thrown on top.  The quinoa (that was extra) was so cold we found it hard to eat. The waitress was super nice, if a little over attentive (read: bored) and we could not decide what to eat since we have all those ingredients at home. It was $30 for a main course that was not even an appetizer in size when shared, and my friend had one coffee. We tipped 20% but while we are both into bringing organic food into the world more and more, we could not perceive how this place can continue to exist. I think that the cost of owning a place this nice: as it is a really super nice interior, really classy must be way beyond allowing this little business to survive.",,,informal

Orchids boasted of its giant dining and 24-hr dim sum service, but from what I could tell, that was the source of all its problems. It was near impossible to flag down carts with their ill-tempered servers, and the food was usually lukewarm, sometimes even cold. Reminiscent of mass processed foods, dim sum here was oily, skimpy, and of such poor quality I could barely tell meat from grease. The room is pure chaos, noisy and unorganized, with empty tables sitting uncleared, piled with dirty dishes. All this, for more than $20 per person.

Rather than apologizing and offering her a second chance like any respectable business would do, he not only argued with her but mocked her. That is immature and repulsive. I believe that maybe their teaching approach is a scare tactic. I was only offered to sign up for the unlimited 10 day package which I thought was a STEAL! One class is $16! What's the catch? It must be the attitude/customer service. Or they are discouraging customers to come back and pocketing the extra $4/person. I am not sure what is going on. I would love a good hot yoga class and I would also love to be pushed - that's not what people are complaining about. It is known that Bikram is a discipline. Constructive criticism is necessary. But personal attacks are very un-yoga-like. And I'm sorry, but I cannot honestly recommend this place to anyone. It's a shame.",,,informal

1,I am relatively new to Las Vegas. A friend of mine suggested Ritual. I signed up to receive a $20 off coupon as a new client. Conveniently their hair cuts are priced at $60 and the coupon is only on services $65+. I called and asked if they could honor the coupon and their suggestion was to add a $35 deep conditioner. Really? You can't charge me $5 more for a haircut so I can take advantage of the coupon? Clearly you do not want new business. I will not be using Ritual.,,,informal

1,"Read this before coming to this location because this is worst dining experience I've ever had and I'm in the hospitality business! The wait time was 80 minutes and when we were seated we didn't have straws or silverware for at least twenty five minutes. We repeatedly asked for them and the waiter kept replying that they would but nothing happened until the manager was involved. Our food literally sat in front of us while we stared at it with no silverware and no one was proactive about solving the problem. Our food orders were wrong, refills were very delayed, and to top this whole experience off it was my dad's birthday dinner :( The response at the end of the night was \""sorry, I'll try better next time\"" and barely anything was discounted. We were so excited for this location to open, we literally counted down the days and chose it as the birthday location but we seriously recommend you going to the location on sunset and not this one.

Finally after about 15 minutes total time I decided to leave after never having seen a menu.   \nThere were  about 7 other patrons in the restaurant when I arrived so the busy and seemingly rushed waitress must have been helping with take out orders.

Last week we returned to Montreal for the first time in three years and were eager to return to our favorite Chinese buffet. \n\nTo say we were disappointed would be a massive understatement. \n\nThe food looked like it had been sitting out for days. The vegetables were brown and spoiled. The sauces were syrupy and disgusting. The meats were nauseatingly greasy. The store-bought steamed buns were so old they had fused with the paper they were sitting on. \n\nThere was not one dish I can honestly say I enjoyed... and I tried a LOT of dishes. Normally I'd feel guilty at a buffet if I didn't eat everything on my plate before going back for more. Here I felt like I was doing the next guy a favor.\n\nThe place is now wallpapered with advertisements for an assortment of absurdly extravagant alcoholic drinks (we're talking umbrellas, dry ice, and fruit wedges). I have to assume pushing these overpriced novelties is their focus now - serving good food certainly is not.\n\nAbsolutely disgusting. The only redeeming aspect is how quick they are to refill your drink... and you're going to need a lot of refills to wash the taste out of your mouth. Avoid.",,,informal

Bring oxygen. \n\nSlots and Video Poker that drink ladies do not come around at all you'll waste 50 in a video poker machine and still not get a drink\nand of course when they do come around they act like they're doing you a favor",,,informal

Once I finally got there, I was on hold for 12 minutes when I gave up and hung up the phone.  It's the little things like this that efficiency, cost savings experts that propose such cost cutting measures to replace people with phone prompts, and staff at the minimum possible in order to force people to shop online,  that makes my blood boil.  They have no clue what customer service means.",,,informal
1,"I paid $100.00 for a room with two double beds. The room was not clean. I found debris under the wall heater, discarded clothing tags in the drawers. The worst was the black mildew on the plastic shower curtain.  \nOne light was not working and there was no kleenex in the bathroom wall receptacle upon our arrival.  On my road trip returning home I had spent nights at Holiday Inn express and Best Western and all of those hotels were clean as one would expect. Based on this experience I will never spend another night at the La Quinta chain even though I am sure that not all of their inns are kept in such a poor condition. The unit was truly overpriced for the condition it was in.  The Coffee was awful. There was no choice of bread other than white bread. The staff scurried to remove any and all items from the countertops at 9:30 sharp although guest had arrived only fifteen minutes before and had not the time to finish their breakfast meal.",,,informal

1,"My boyfriend and I have been here a few times in the last 6 months and I don't know why we keep going back.   The food always tastes fairly good, however their service is horrible.   Our waitress, whom we've unluckily had the last 2 times we were there, is awful.  This recent time, my boyfriends specifically asked for no tomatoes on his burger, guess what it came with tomatoes.  Not a huge deal but would have been nice if it had been correct.   She never asked me once if I wanted another drink, but kept my boyfriends drinks refilled.   We finished our meal and sat there while she kept walking by us, clearly seeing I needed a to go box and never once asked. Finally I caught her and asked her for one.    I wish I could remember her name, blonde, hair in a ponytail all the time, young and clearly waitressing isn't her thing, otherwise she would have paid more attention to our needs.  If I had been paying she would have gotten zero for a tip, she didn't deserve one at all.   Then we went to go pay and leave, however stood and waited, and waited, and waited to even be waited on so we could go.  The cashier/waitress asked my boyfriend how his food was, but didn't ask me.   I think the place needs some work on their people and service skills.    Time to find a new location and give them a try.  We probably wont go back to this one anytime soon.",,,informal

They gave some excuse that there system can't handle the transaction (this is how they don't allow you to use the points from the casino).\n\nPoor Food:\n-Steak is the worst steak I have ever had. Looked like someone stepped on it and cooked it on the grill. It was full of fat. I did not eat it and would not even feed it to my dogs. Steak was not cooked at the level I stated to the waitress. \n-Waffles tasted horrible and they appeared to use pancake mix for the waffles, from the taste.\n\n\n\nWe felt ill and sick the rest of the day.

I presented a certificate from my DR. explaining that the client pays only $15.00 & the instructions on how to use it was written in clear ENGLISH on the back. She mentioned \""this saying coupon is expired\"". That is impossible cause there is no date printed anywhere on the certificate. She would not release the prescription after they have filled it. Now she is demanded \""you pay 268.00\"" Who in their right mind talks to a customer like that and expect them to remain a customer of theirs -- Hm Not me.

I have given this place so many chances...so many deep breaths before walking in the door and they still fail. Lots of chaos & people arguing with staff. One ortho says ' braces off in 2 weeks make that early morning appt!' You get there and its a different ortho who says ' who told you that? I'm sorry...you have a few months left'.

Even if we were to return to Vegas and do the BOB tour, I would skip this dump.\n\nHonestly I was a little surprised how bad Lago buffet really was given that it is part of Cesar's resort.

Fast forward three years and my Mother-in-Law found a cockroach in her taco salad.  My husband's family has been going to this restaurant for quite a while.  Not anymore!! The waitress asked if she wanted to take a new salad to go (she lost her appetite but give in at the waitress insisting).  She got it to go and was charged.  The owner was a complete jerk and argued that the bug could have flown in.. On top of that, the food is mediocre.",,,informal
1,Stay away from the dairy during this time...my two sons had yogurt (chocolate and strawberry) and a friend of ours had whipped cream on her crepes tonight.  All three had to run for the bathroom soon after.  Something is spoiling the dairy tonight.

1,"The great dilemma, is this resort & casino worth 1 or 2 stars?  I love the location of this hotel and had a room with a view of the bellagio fountains.  Despite those promising facts, I changed hotels after 2 nights.  The casino did nothing for me, nor the mock french streets and restaurants.  I am in my mid 30s and was also on the younger end of those I saw roaming this resort.\n\nThe room was kind of blah.....had a nice big bathroom but the normal living area was pretty small.  It is evident that this is an older hotel and casino.   But the main reason for the rating of 1 star.....I have to agree with the other reviewer that commented on the air quality.  Ever time I walked into this resort, I feel like somebody kicked me in the stomach.  The stench of the air was disgusting.  If you look at the painted ceiling in the casino, you might see pollution.  If they were to give air quality ratings to casinos similar to cities, they should tell you to wear a mask and drag and air tank with you into this joint.\n\nAnd the debate ends with 1 star.  It wasn't a complete disaster but I did end up changing hotels and would not stay here in the future.",,,informal
1,"I'm a long-time lurker, first-time writer.\n\nWe went to Black Dog last night at 8:00pm after hearing rave reviews on two local blogs (you probably can guess which ones.)\n\nWell, we stood by the door for a good 5 to 7 minutes politely waiting with absolutely no one giving us a blink of attention. We saw people in booths and tables with food and drinks, waited on by a woman, and at least two people standing around behind the bar. They were not busy.\n\nFinally tiring of this exercise we seated ourselves at the bar uninvited. The bartender came by and told us they were basically out of food. No ribs, no pulled pork, no chicken, nothing.\n\nI can understand their under-estimating demand given that they haven't been open that long. (Although, if you start serving ribs at 5pm, you only have something like 5 booths and 4 tables, and you're out by 8pm -- huh?)\n\nBut if someone had told us there were out when we came in, it wouldn't be a problem. Letting customers just stand around stupidly is ridiculous. I'm sorry, no food is so good to suffer so much attitude. I felt like I was in a snooty restaurant in Paris.\n\nNo thanks.

I brought two of my foodie friends and we were excited about trying this place. Our high expectations were shattered with the worst service I've ever had and just downright lame food. The \""world famous fried chicken\"" (which took 20 minutes to bring) tasted like Banquet frozen chicken. The server brought our cornbread 10 minutes after our lousy chicken. We had no silverware for a while.  My other colleague ordered the special ribs. He compared them to the McRib sandwich which I thought was an insult to Mickey D's. The men's bathroom didn't have hand towels to add to our misery.

When I returned to place where I left my cart, there was none. I asked pink-haired bakery lady if she's seen it, but she didn't. When she asked cashiers, little Asian guy admitted that he dissembled it and returned my meat and cheese to the departments. No apologies. Bakery lady didn't say anything either. Wow, what a great customer service!\n\nI had to go back to the meat department and ask for my meat, explaining the situation. Meat guy said that it was probably done, so food wouldn't be stolen. Now I was accused of potential stealing. How the food sitting on the cart can be stolen?!

I do like the way they throw all the 1950s furnishings and finishes in there randomly, and our waitress was good, but the food was weak and the people around us were getting horrible service. The table across from us sat there after finishing their meal waiting for the waiter to come back for almost the entire time we were there, and when he asked the host for the tab, he told the guy he should go find his waiter.\n\nFried green tomatoes were OK, but not great. Sauce was actually pretty good; the highlight of our meal.\n\nThe backbone of good BBQ is a good dry rub, and my chicken had none. I'm more of a fan of KC style BBQ, and I don't appreciate when it arrives already slathered in sauce, so I asked for mine dry. That was a mistake, as what came to my table looked like no more than a roasted half chicken. It didn't really taste slow-cooked either, and the meat did not fall apart like it should. Hell, I can cook a beer can chicken in 90 minutes and it falls off the bone. I don't believe they cooked this for half a day as they claimed. Even with any of the three sauces--which couldn't go head to head with Open Pit or KC Masterpiece--left me very disappointed.",,,informal

Our appetizer came out pretty fast but it took another 1/2 for our food to come out. There was three people in the whole place. Now the tea I got was excellent, my food was ok tasting until I bit into spoiled chicken.  I spit it out and it smelt rancid. They wanted to make me a new dish but I refused. I about had it with this place. We waited another 1/2 an hour for our bill but never got it so we went to front to pay. All and all it took us 1-1/2 hour to finish and get out. Will not ever go back.",,,informal
1,"Went here with the family for NYE dinner.  Food was half good and half horrible.  Kitchen closed and sent home all of the chefs (except the pastry chef) before we even had the plates delivered.  They should never have taken the reservation for a party of 14 at the end of the night.  They were running 40 mins behind and still seated us, but only to poorly execute the food and service. They didn't even have bread for the table or any of the entrees...this is an italian restaurant!  They finally brought us some frozen bread to try to appease us. It was still frozen in the middle.   If you are going to take a reservation at the end of the night, then you should make sure you have the right people there to execute at the level you should be for the type of restaurant you are. I live in NYC and have no problem paying higher prices for good food, but having to pay high prices for crappy food is just ridiculous.  Very disappointed and will never go back!",,,informal

1,"Worst service ever. The manager took our order and then he disappeared... When the cocktail waitress came to deliver our nachos (which took 20 min), my bf asked if he could have another beer and she kinda went.. I guess.. Cause she wasn't taking care of us. She only had one table so it's not like she was busy. After that she would not even walk by us or make eye contact. Both me and my bf are in the service industry and were pretty upset about it. We understand when people are busy, but another thing is to not care. We cancelled our dinner order and asked for the check. The manager apologized and said he only had one cook and he was busy. We didn't care if the food was taking long but we never had a chance to order drinks. $40 for 2 beers, a martini, nachos and a cup of soup... never again.",,,informal

My husband went to pick up the tickets and when he returned our waiter was very nice and prepared a place for him. We were able to secure an extra  chair from an adjacent table.

1,"Really bad food. We ordered their \""special\""  of the day which was the lobster hash and a quiche. The lobster really chewy and smelled really fishy. They wouldn't accommodate a fried egg on top of the hash instead of scrambled either. The quiche was cold in the center and seemed like it was reheated in the microwave. We asked to get something different instead and ordered a cobb salad and blueberry muffin which we hoped would be safer choices, but alas, they were not. The salad was really small for a $17 dollar salad and really gross chunks of bacon fat in it. The blueberry muffin appeared as if it had been microwaved as well and was dried out. Lunch was practically inedible and with all of our complaints a manager never so much as looked out way. We were extremely dissapointed!\n\nOh also water is $7 and they won't tell you there is a charge until you get the bill!",,,informal
1,"Not impressed. First, only certain theaters have service. You can order food and take it in but then you have to sit in the seat with a plate in your lap. Not very comfortable. Second, the food is mediocre at best. Tried the hummus and it had obviously been scooped out of a can with what was probably the last of a bag of pita chips. Lots of crumbs. Third, $7.50 for a 12 oz beer is ridiculous. Fourth, we couldn't take drinks into the theater because it is one that children are allowed into. This despite the fact that an R rated movie was playing.  Lastly, the seating is not clear. We entered a theatre during the previews and it was dark and somewhat crowded. We found the two seats together and sat down. But, a manager kicked us out of the seats because they were the special kind that you pay extra for. By this time, there were no other seats other than the second row. Pure digital or not, the picture sucked. They need to have someone to check the tickets of people who try to sit in the special seats. Overall, it was very disappointing.",,,informal

I took my beautiful long hair cat to them for a lion cut almost a year and a half ago and they BUTCHERED HER. Not only did they shave off her undercoat, they nicked her in at least 5 different spots along her back, belly, and tail- all of which took a very long time to heal up because of cat's constant grooming. Long story short, her coat has been ruined because of the hack jobs they have doing the grooming here. When I called to find out if it was normal that my cat's fur was not growing back (6 months later) they treated me like I was the biggest idiot in the world on the phone. Now my cat looks patchy, and she has multiple BALD spots on her body and there isn't a damn thing that I can do about it except try to warn others to stay away from here!\n\nDO NOT - I REPEAT - DO NOT TAKE YOUR ANIMAL HERE FOR GROOMING OR THEY WILL BE RUINED BY NON-TRAINED HACKS!!!!!!!",,,informal

1,"I rarely write a review; however, cannot resist the temptation after a horrible experience here. First of all, the food vs price is incomparably unjustified. I took my wife and kids there, paid close to $100 for 4 people, and the food quality was unbearable. The fish felt rubbery, the shrimp was not fresh at all, the crab leg had too much salt in it. ALL OF THEM ARE FROZEN FOOD, and felt like cooked by a high school student. I felt very bad during the entire dinner and felt like asking my money back the whole time.\n\nIn addition, the server was horrible, our drink was all empty and i had to ask for a water refill for my kids, and he didnt even bother to ask me for a refill. My wife and i had to survive the whole experience with 1 glass of drink. I lost my appetite already and didnt even bother to ask for refill.\n\nThey charge $25 for adult, my advise, pay more for Wicked Spoon at Cosmopolitan, or try Le Village at Paris. \n\nDO NOT EAT in this restaurant.

Sorry, but 12 minutes to wait for sometime to come by a table for a couple of beers is absolutely ridiculous.

However, I can say that the quality of food was below any food expectations anyone can have when we visited. Everything from the apps, pizza and Caesar salad felt like it was either reheated from a pre prepared version in the kitchen or put together with the lowest of standards. I can only hope that the lack of taste and presentation is due to the restaurant's assumption that patrons at 4 am are either too drunk or too desperate to care about good food.

Didn't even come back to collect.  \n\nThe place is a dump, too.",,,informal
1,"OK, so I had become somewhat of a regular at the 61B and was really enjoying the convenience of a local coffee shop again.  However, my most recent experience wipes away my last glowing review.   Their WIFI never works for me..seriously never ever on any of my devices.  I don't own antiquated technology and use WIFI at a myriad of other places, so it perplexes me why it just doesn't seem to work for me at the 61B. Normally I have my 4G hotspot with me, so no big deal when I can't connect.  \n\nBut this morning I was there sans hotspot and tried to connect to the 61B WIFI... again nothing worked. I was basically told the issue was with my device, so I left and wont be going back.  If you're going to offer WIFI as a way to entice patrons I think it should work, no?  Also, perhaps being a bit more sympathetic/apologetic about its shortcoming would be advantageous.  It felt like an incredible waste of time to pack my things to do some work and then not be able to connect to (what seemd like) able bodied internet.  Boo! Pretty disappointed that I need to step away from this establishment, at least I'll save a few bucks and calories!",,,informal

Sat at the bar and ordered the all you can eat in which the customer is timed at 45 mins to eat. Dinner started off bad because I ordered a roll and the sushi chef drowned it in a sweet sauce. And when I say drowned, the bottom of the plate showed no white. I told the sushi guy that I didn't want the roll because he drowned it in sweet sauce. He accused me putting too much soy sauce.

As I said before, the food was mostly pretty bland and even the hot and spicy dishes were not very spicy at all.  Too top it off, not looking at the prices before I sat down, two meals and one ice tea, $28.08 which was ridiculous for the quality of food we ate.

Walked up to the bar to order a drink and waited patiently for quite sometime before the bar tender came over and helped a rude drunk that pushed his way up right next to me well almost on top of me.  I literally had to push the drink guy off of me and tell him to chill out.  I pushed him off of me several times.  The bar tender was beyond rude catering to the drunk man saying hey listen we are all here to have fun but that was directed at me the sober lady that had been waiting patiently for someone to take my order.

There wasn't much variety in the foods, and they didn't re-supply quickly enough (there was a point where was no fresh fruit to be found at all!)

1,We were ignored for 20 minutes after arriving at our table. Normally I wouldn't be so bothered when I have good conversation at the table but the fact that tables that were seated after us were having their drink orders taken and delivered before I had even seen my waiter was irritating. I had to go find a waitress a total of three times before the hostess decided to just come and take our order herself. Our food came out about fifteen minutes later and our drinks finally came out an additional 10 after that (sadly I actually kept track). No one ever came to refill any of our drinks. The only thing that made me feel a little better is that I wasn't the only one who  was receiving this type of service. Three other tables also had to either get up and find someone to take their orders or find someone to print out their checks because they weren't being attended to.

Most of the staff looked hung-over and treated us as though they hadn't clocked in yet. I thought it best to play it safe and ordered the chicken taco's. They were flavorless for the most part, but with an overpowering cilantro aftertaste that didn't balance. I had a bite of my father's fish - which was okay, but by no means anything more than standard fare. Their entire menu lacked imagination and I begrudgingly sat through the meal hoping to leave soon. About 24 hours later (on Christmas Eve) I came down with a wrenching case of salmonella poisoning.

I got the spinach trio (comes with spinach, tomato and feta cheese). It was a thin crust pizza, and there was waaaaaayyyyyyy too much mozzarella on this thing. The cheese was at least 1/4 inch think. This wouldn't be a problem it it was on an appropriate thickness crust. The poor thin crust just couldn't hold up all that cheese and was floppy and soggy. The was also a strange smokey flavor to the pizza, which I just don't get. Plus, there was hardly any spinach at all on the pizza. \n\nOn the plus side, the girl working the counter was very peppy and nice. \n\nSo, if your going to try this place, I recommend skipping the spinach trio...maybe it was the feta that poisoned me.....good luck, I hope you have a better experience that I....if you're the brave type.",,,informal

Upon contacting WF (since I was a legitimate shopper there and didn't leave the lot) they just shrugged their shoulders and just told me the name of the company that managed the lot.\n\nAnd that's it?! $135 is no chump change, but it seems like WF wants me to carry an extra $135 every time I frequent them (thankfully, never, since I don't live in Pittsburgh). This whole parking/towing situation is extremely shady, but the only company I'm going to point my finger at is Whole Foods for doing business with such a shady complex and passing the burden on to its customers.\n\nTip: Bring an extra $135 to pay for parking, or just go to Trader Joe's/Giant Eagle for a better parking/shopping experience.",,,informal
1,Watch out for this place. My wife was there last week and was accosted by glass people pulling a classic insurance fraud scam called windshield replacement fraud. (google it or look on the website of the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud)  They hustle waiting car wash customers into getting new windshields they don't need and try to charge it to their insurance company. Obviously this car wash is letting them do this to their customers. Pretty scary . She will NEVER go back there.,,,informal

1,"Went to BWW last night, Saturday Oct 18th, for my hubby's birthday dinner. Our daughter picked the spot and hubby gave the okay due to the great food and amazing experience we had at the BWW off north ln prior. Well...our experience here was CRAP compared to their other location. Will NEVER go back here.\n\nWe had over a 30 min wait to sit, which was explainable for a Saturday night. Once we finally get sat  it takes about 10 mins to get our sodas, which was \""okay\"" since the server did seem busy and took the time to acknowledge that she would be right with us. However the main complaint is once we ordered our food, 2  chicken meals and a burger it took over 45 mins to arrive, granted it was a Saturday it still should NEVER take this long to get food. Once it did arrive hubby's hamburger and fries were COLD, its one thing to wait long for food to come out hot but to come out cold is not okay. Finally the manager comes over and says he understands our frustration and offers to take his UNTOUCHED food off the bill as he takes his plate (um, ya think?) and gives us a 15% discount for the NEXT visit...wow. \n\n Bottom line HORRIBLE customer service here and won't be going back.",,,informal

1,"Why must this restaurant so notoriously SUCK?! With the exception of a few of these franchises, this corporation has got their big round ugly Jack-in-the-Box heads up their butts. Usually stinky lobbies with bad service and way over-priced food that tastes like they dug it out of the trash bin out back in the alley. At this particular Trop location, I ordered some fish with fries... what did I get? 3 triangles of frozen fish pieces thrown into a fryer and then loosely tossed into a carton that could hold 6 pieces, and a serving of burnt soggy fries slopped onto the tray with no napkins and no ketchup. One of the reasons this dump bothers me is because the company's commercials have that nitwit 'Jack' with his ever-annoying voice trying to act 'funny' while he tells us how cool and hip he is with his 'low-prices', 'good deals', and 'great food'. What can you say about a company that raises the price of a small cup of coffee to $1.81? The 99-cent cup of coffee should never change - even during a recession. They should give a little back to the patrons whom have made them the conglomerate they are. But nooo!.... make that extra buck, that extra quarter, that extra nickel, Jack-in-the-Box. Don't take a small loss or break even for 6 months. Well, I guess they WANTED me to avoid their restaurants in the future, because that's what I do now. Oh look! There's a McDonald's!

The promotions for this event stated \""over 30\"" trucks would be there, but I guess that doesn't matter since you wouldn't be able to try all of them anyhow.  Each line was 50+ people deep and took 20 - 30 minutes of standing in one to get a bite size sample. \n\nYou had to stand in THREE lines to get a beer. One for ID check. One for wristband.

First, check in was late.  No apology, just an \""Oh, your room isn't ready but should be in a few hours\"" - this at after 4PM.  Second, they double charged him for his room - ie, they hard charged the entire stay in advance, and then \""authorized\"" the entire amount + incidentals  yet again (he was staying in a suite for eight days, so we're not talking chump change).  When it was pointed out, not only did the front desk not acknowledge the mistake, but proceeded to argue with him for three days, even though he showed bank verification of the double posting.  After three days of continuous hassle, and three days when several thousand dollars was no longer easily available for other events, they finally acknowledged and corrected their mistake, but failed to apologize or even offer any sort of compensation.  Third, room service ~ basically don't order anything but the fresh fruit, and don't make /any/ special requests, because you'll be ignored.\n\nSeriously, don't do what I did, do NOT EVER recommend this as a decent place to stay that's \""off Strip\"", because frankly, I've seen better front desk customer service at a Hawthorne Inn.",,,informal

They said that they cannot guarantee reservations at the sushi bar. Huh? What is the point of making a reservation if they will not honor the reservation?

1,"Meine Erfahrung: H\u00e4lt man sich zu lange in einem Bereich auf, da man erst berechnet, wie die jewiligen Elemente zusammenpassen sollen. Tr\u00e4gt man ein Produkt an einen anderen Ort, um zu \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen, ob bestimmte Elemente zu anderen passen, tr\u00e4gt sie dann wider zur\u00fcck  dann wird man vom Detektiv nach der Kasse abgefangen. Man sollte hier nicht den Kopf verlieren und den Detektiv auffordern, eine Videoaufzeichung vorzulegen und zugleich die Polizei zu rufen. Der Detektiv hatte ein Fitting in der Hand  und ich dachte schon, er wollte behaupten, da\u00df er mir das gerade aus meiner Tasche gefischt hat. Das erzeugt nat\u00fcrlich die Vermutung, da\u00df der Detektiv auch die M\u00f6glichkeit hat, einem unaufmerksamen K\u00e4ufer etwas in seine Tasche oder Jackentasche zu schmuggeln.

1,I've never been to an establishment that treats their customers so badly. The owner literally shooshed my one and a half year old and then told us our children are too loud. I should mention that we were the only ones in the whole restaurant. He didn't even let us tell the kids to quiet down. He was rude and his actions were ugly towards some mommies and their toddlers just wanting to eat lunch. It was hateful and we will never go back.,,,informal
1,"(edited to tone it down)\n\nPros:\n\n- Pizza is great\n- Beer specials on Mondays are awesome.\n\nCon:\n\n- The restaurant can be a playground for screaming children. \n\nI'm just trying to eat, have a beer, talk, and watch the game. I don't want to deal with a bunch of screaming kids running all over the place and fighting over the arcade game in the corner. Even the great beer specials on Mondays are not worth listening to that. \n\nIt must be noted that there is only so much the management can do about other peoples' children. Their parents should manage the volume - but I think some just become habituated to it.\n\nMaybe it's not like that every night. But we have noticed it twice.\n\nIf you eat here, just ask to be seated in the corner farthest from the arcade game, unless you enjoy the sound of shrieking children after working all day.\n\nObviously, if you have kids, they're a family-friendly restaurant.",,,informal

1,"I gave this place 2 chances before firing them as my dentist.  Being a graduate student on the graduate student dental plan, I did not have many options as who my dentist would be.  I regret chosing Champaign Dental Group.\n\nMy first negative experience was when a dental assistant tried fitting me for whitening trays.  He clearly had never done this before because the mixture was way too hard and he was using a tray too big for my mouth.  The result was SEVEN attempts of putting the trays in my mouth and removing them and subsequent severe cuts in my mouth.  I was called back the next day because the impression was not good enough to make a mold out of and had to redo the entire process again.  \n\nAlready not happy about my experience at Champaign Dental Group, I went ahead and scheduled my next appointment 6 months in advance.  I recieved a card with my appointment time and was had a reminder call 2 days before my scheduled appointment.

The sides were also subpar, just tiny bowls of plantains, beans, rice, and stir-fried green beans/carrots.\n\nWhat really annoyed me was that the first skewer of \""meats\"" to come around were garlic bread and chicken legs.  Really?!  My husband was so hungry that he tried one of each, which I guess is Samba's strategy.  They were both kind of gross.\n\nThe other meats were okay, but for the price I expected a lot better quality of meat.  Finally, the dessert comes, and I was hoping that it would save the meal.

He gets the 1 star I gave here. \n\nHere's my list of the bad:\n- What the hell is that wall of dead birds? \n- The wood fired beets - tasted more like rubber lumps, no wood fired taste. \n- The pan fried corn - yes, it's pan fried corn, my bad for expecting some spices in there. \n- The onion soup - overly salty and has a strong, unidentifiable flavor. \n- The scallops - nothing special at all.\n- The prices - for what we paid, I would expect to be spoon fed while being fanned with palm leaves. Really a said combo of inflated prices and mediocre food you could prepare at home for nothing.\n\nAnd be forewarned: Everything is a la carte. Ordering scallops? That's $20, and then you may add a side for $7. What a joke. \n\nBring a fat wallet  of money you were thinking of setting on fire and low expectations and you should leave happy.",,,informal

Almost left. Wrong drinks. Had to chase someone down to get anything. Food below average. I get it's a coffee shop so wasn't expecting anything spectacular but this is pretty bad. Couple of dry patty melts, runny scrambled eggs that were a little tougher than is normal. Only thing that was somewhat edible was the club sandwich. Cashier asked how our meal was told her it was bad and about how we were about to leave before food arrived. She said .... I'm sorry and will let management know... No wait that wasn't it.

1,"OK PEOPLE...time for a REAL review.  The ONLY thing this restaurant has going for it is the wait time in a Sunday morning...walk in and get seated. That is because the place is not busy here is why:\n\n1) The place is FILTHY. From the end tails  and smears on the tables, to the seats with crumbs spots and food/skid marks to the tops of the booths that have at least 1 month of dust, lint and dirt build up. \n\n2) The food was horrible!  For example the 5 minute rice was either cooked for 3 minutes or cooked the night before. The pork was approximately 50% fat and 50% meat which is being extremely generous in the meat allocation. The scrambled eggs were rubbery like they were pulled from the stay warm buffet. Ahh the buffet...leaves a lot to be desired for a buffet. They actually serve the end pieces of the toast...perhaps the owner likes them and so should everyone else. And finally the bacon...careful asking for crispy....it will be cooked and then deep fried to the point of turning to dust. \n\n3) Wanna be Village Inn pie concept sans pies with a sully's tavern kind of flair using furniture that makes things made in China sold by KMart and IKEA Look like high end quality furnishing. \n\n4) Service...well if you mess up the order...comp the meal, make it right, comp something else...don't server the end tails.  \n\nNever going back and neither should you.

The icing on the cake was when the server asked if we wanted dessert . We said no thank you to which he responded with \"" we have a birthday dessert for you \"" with that being said who turns down free dessert . $329 later that dessert was $30 .

The person behind the counter then told my boyfriend that I was not welcome to sit at their outdoor seating area with him while he enjoyed his gyro.

1,"Not So Good... Half star ... \n\nWhat can I say about Arribas Mexican Grill. Let's start on a positive note.  The staff is warm, friendly, and extremely personable, which is why I feel horrible for saying their Mexican Food is bland and tasteless. \n\nI really wanted to like Arribas Mexican Grill. After all I had been to the Phoenix location and the food wasn't bad. However, the way to begin a meal is not with a watery tomato salsa and a puny bowl of broken chips. \n\nI have to give Arribas props for their cheese crisp. The cheese crisp was loaded with cheese and extra crispy. However, the enchiladas were soggy and brunt on the ends. Followed by  the overcooked rice and flavorless refried beans.\n\nNot the worst Mexican food on earth, but it is a contender.",,,informal

They were served to her cold, and when she told the waiter, he took them back to the kitchen and brought them out just as cold but with more hot sauce on it (he might have told the chef \""make it hotter\""?).  Dessert was also overpriced, and didn't match the description on the menu.\n\nThat said, the staff was friendly and they do have quite a good selection, so it might be a decent option in a large group of picky eaters or drinkers.",,,informal

1,"My boyfriend and I have always been fans of Arriba but they drove us away as customers. We hadn't been back for a few months because of how bad our service had been but the food and drink was usually worth it. Let me tell you that is now sub-par as well, aside from the Margarita that was for 2 and fairly priced, the waitress didn't card us and proceeded to call us Kid's/Kiddo's the remainder of our visit. I work in the restaurant industry and would NEVER serve Kid's or Kiddo's a Margarita for two. Also no waters were given to us until requested. I ordered the Carne Asada and it came out looking good, until I started actually eating it, the carne was piled on top of a HUGE slab of red cabbage, gross. The waitress asked my boyfriend if he wanted Guacamole and Sour Cream making it sound like it was included in his meal so he said sure, the bill came and $1.99 for sour cream, and $2.50 for guacamole.... Holy hell they don't even give you more than 3 tablespoons of the stuff. Concern for the customers wallet is not there and we just had her pay for it with her tip, I don't think I've ever done that to anyone before.

I should have listened to my wife from the start but gave them to many chances. \nThere are no designated areas to stretch or do pilometrics. There are 200 lockers in the mens room and one six foot bench to sit on, ONE!  If there is more than 2 guys in there you have to sit on in like some sort of men's gay rowboat team to fit. They don't allow outside equipment, meaning you can't jump rope or use resistance bands. And they offer no classes or education.\nAt first glance its seems like a sweet deal. Low monthly fees and no contracts. They still ding you on annual membership and cancellation fee, which averages out to the same as 24hr, LA Fit, and Gold's. Katie the manager also couldn't explain how my card was double dinged on fees and offered no remedy.

The salad inparticular was fresh as it gets. The vegetables were crunchy (great cucumbers). Great rye bread too. I would go back for the sandwiches - because I'm flying out in late August.\n\nAs far as the desserts go...\nI ordered the coconut cream pie and my guest ordered the seven layer cake.\nThe coconut cream pie was beautiful, but the flavor wasn't there at all.

I used to make these pies for a resort in Saipan and the right recipe will give you great results every time. It's not a difficult dish to pull off. Anyway, Carnegie's pie lacked so much dimension that I wondered if anyone working there ever stopped to say, \""Can we really standy behind this coconut cream pie\""? are they testing their desserts? I doubt it.\n\nI tried my friends seven layer cake. Way too sweet and VERY dry.

1,"I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone for one reason. \""PATHETIC CUSTOMER SERVICE\"". They really don't care about their customers as they know they are one of the very few Indian restaurants in Madison.  Food is very ordinary and they cheat on their timings. They mention they are open till 10, but stop taking people and orders by 9:30. Let them rather put they are open only until 9:30. They need to learn proper business etiquette. People come for food and they just turn them down without any kind of considerations. I hope we get better restaurant in Madison and we avoid going there.",,,informal
1,"Super cute little place, so much so that I took a pic and sent it to my fiance. I went fo lunch on a Saturday while on my lunchbreak. I was quickly seated as there was only one other group there. Ordered and ice tea to find they only have the raspberry nestea. Was pleasantly surprised when I was given a basket of garlic bread, but it was grossly oily.. alas, I ate them all because it took 30 miniutes for my eggplant parmesan sandwich to arrive. Since I had to get back to work, I asked for it to go. The guy who brought it to me in a bag had to return to the kitchen to ask when I asked what I owed. The owner or manager came out and charged me full price for my sandwich and tea which I thought was rude considering I waited 30+ mins before I had to leave and asked for it to go. Meanwhile my tea was empty...  Aet my sandwich at my desk at work, it was just so-so.\nI wont be back",,,informal

After the movie was done, I went on my phone and screen shot a picture of the transaction that they did in fact charged us with the wrong amount to it, so that I could show them that they were wrong and that on top of their horrible service and bad attitudes, they \""free movie tickets\"" they gave us weren't free and we were still over charged.

1,"Not impressed with these scam artists. I went to The Range at Ballantyne for the first time yesterday. After I got checked in and watched the safety video, I had to wait 10 minutes while they figured out which lane another customer was on so they could charge him. It was like watching the three stooges use a computer for the first time. Once I got on the range, I was happy to find that it was state of the art and had a good 30 minute shooting session using a pistol. Then the bait and switch happened. It is supposed to be $19/hr pistol, $25/hr rifle. When I was rung up, it came up as $25/hr. They said because I used FMJ I was charged the rifle rate. Pistols rate is only allowed if you use Total Metal Jacket (TMJ). Not once was this brought up until it was time to pay. Because they only allow full hour sessions and after tax, my 30 minutes of shooting pistol cost $27!!! NEVER AGAIN!",,,informal

I recognized the girl at the register when I walked in, so I asked her if they just changed the name, but she said that Mark Rich's recipes transferred over when the new owners bought the business in this location. Mark Rich's NY Pizza and Pasta still currently operates another location, using the same recipes and ingredients, but has nothing at all to do with Giani's NY Pizza and Pasta.\n\nI ordered the lunch special for $5.95 which was 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink. The pizza slices were a good size. I didn't care for the pizza though. They might be using the same recipe the previous owner used, but it doesn't mean it comes out the same and it just didn't for me. The pizza was somewhat burnt and had a stale taste to it like maybe it was from the day before.

If I could give it  1.5 stars, I would...just on the basis of the only edible item I had: the urban cookie.  It was so-so.  The simple urban cookie was dry-- which seemed to be the theme of this bakery.   \n\nBought 2 Ollie cakes (cupcakes): chocolate/chocolate and the white cake with lemon frosting.  Both cakes were heavy and dry.  The lemon frosting was slightly pleasant.  The \""ganache\"" on top of the chocolate was like a big lump of frosting without any personality of its own other than of being chocolate.  \n\nBottom line: I spent nearly $9 and ended up dumping everything except the urban cookie.  Best organic cookies are made from scratch and the recipe on the Sunspire Organic Chocolate Chips bag if you use organic sugar which is crystallized.  Incredible!  \n\nOther than that, although they're not organic, I'll stick with Fry's and Honey Moon Sweets (sold at Whole Foods) for cakes.",,,informal

Luckily, I was able to get a refund from Amazonlocal.  Those who have purchased a voucher for this place, don't even bother to order, just get a refund! Also, they call themselves \""President's Pizza\"", as well....I have seen another Amazonlocal voucher for this place as well but never purchased it (Thank Goodness!)  Get your refund!!!! By the way, for all you die hards, perhaps the food is decent, which is why, to be fair i have not rated it, but most of the salad items are not even available....Hmmm...False advertising on both counts, here?!?",,,informal

I just think if they would have communicated how long I would have had to wait it wouldn't have been as bad. \n\nAlso super slow even after we explained we were in a hurry ( i had already been sitting there for an hour now) they did not move any faster to finish my sister's feet and were unapologetic no one tried to make sure that we left satisfied at all its pretty much like they didn't care.\n\nI definitely do not recommend it unless you have 3 to 4 hours to spare for a manicure and or pedicure.

The guys were nice enough, but I felt I was being waited on by the cast of \""Half Baked\"". If they were stoned out of their minds but managed at least occasional service, I would have been content. The first dude took our order for wine and hot tapas and 1/2 hour later I saw him walking into the building with groceries. We still hadn't anything to eat or drink.

Call front desk, got the \""fully booked\"" comment then put on hold. Told to come back to front. Get bags, Load up car, drive back to front where there's no parking. Stand in line, go through whole process again, get new room assigned. Walk back to car. Drive over to other side of property. Unload bags. Walk to new room and open doors to interior design circa 1981. Give up. Drop off bags. Walk over to restraurant and literally cannot figure out where the door is to go in. Walk back to car. Drive over to Elephant bar. Have some good food and a some drinks. Go back to room. Sleep for night. Check out and go home to review my $175 hotel bill and wonder what I paid for.",,,informal

Instead of crispy breaded chicken inside, it had plain unseasoned chicken slices which was covered in cheese and a sauce one step away from ketchup.

1,"We read all the reviews, were in the area so we thought we'd try it. We started with the breaded panko mozzarella. It was very thick so that the cheese did not completely melt. Pretty bland with little flavor. The marinara was good though. I ordered the sliders since I read so many good reviews on them and my husband ordered the lasagna. Our salad was all lettuce and four little diced tomatoes in the corners. The dressing was flavorful but I would have liked some Parmesan or something. Our meals came and the lasagna was lukewarm. We sent it back to the kitchen and it came back a few minutes later... Same piece of lasagna. They must have microwaved it which is completely tacky. Sauce was bland and it was mostly cheese. My sliders were also disappointing. All I could taste was the burned charcoal flavor of the inside of the bread.  The server was wonderful however. She was super attentive, apologetic about the lukewarm meal, and quick to refill our drinks. Of course, there were only 2 other parties in the restaurant. Overall, food was bland and lukewarm, and my husband's rating is Blech.",,,informal

We went round and round with trying to fit a scheduled visit to the house for the stove. We came to an agreement. The day before the appointment, Debbie called and canceled, saying the tech isn't available. We then went around and around AGAIN to figure out a new appointment time. Debbie suggested I take a day off of work to accommodate the tech. I told her absolutely not, that the two days off in the middle of the week (not Saturday or Sunday ) were sufficient. Oh no, those days don't work for the tech, it will have to fall on a day of which I work, requiring me to miss work. We finally agreed on a time. The tech came out and looked at the stove. Told me the parts will take 7-10 business days. Fast forward to today. I once again called Debbie to get an update. She says I'm being impatient and unreasonable. That it's only been 9 business days since the tech visited. She tells me to give it more time. What a rude person.",,,informal

Apparently they don't charge the card until you pick it up (in case you don't have the patience for the chaos, perhaps?).

1,"I stayed here because it was on labor day weekend and i was attending my cousins wedding on the strip.  The strip hotels were over $200 a night so I could only afford a hotel in the $90 range on the weekends.\n\nThe room was big, nice, comfy, casino was good, resturant was good, free wifi.  The BAD PARTS is its in a sketchy hood. It's an outside hotel. Casino is seperate from the hotel.  It seems like a really trashy truck stop place, and i could hear the people having sex in the room next door, and I mean everything from the sound of the neighbors tv, toilet flushing to them having sex on the table.

We were sat away from the area were Asians ate at a Formica table with no table cloth or silverware!\nI ordered sizzling sea food which had 5 shrimps and the rest was mystery fish. my husband ordered crispy  duck which was so old and dried out that it was impossible to bite thru! He asked to have it replaced by cashew chicken. After an argument it came burnt!\nThey then tried to bill us for all three meals.,,,informal

We didn't realize it until we got to the hotel and looked on the map on our I-phone to see actual route driven versus what it should have been.  I assume they are hoping that none of their passengers have a clue.  I called the company immediately and the girl acted like I was the first one to complain of such a thing.  She suggested that I write a letter to the company.,,,informal

Manager(?) of Betsy's Ice Cream asking what I could do to get a better score from my review. He mentioned that he was training his staff to serve bigger portions but some staff just weren't getting it done on the front line. He also said would look into changing his recipe. My response to him would be to make sure the staff is trained BEFORE putting them on the lines to HIS satisfactory. You can buy an entire half gallon of premium Ice Cream for the four bucks Betsy charges for two tiny miniscule scoops. As for the sorbet, I'm not a fan and normally I would choose frozen fat free yogurt but I didn't see any. To me any sherbet is overly sweet.",,,informal

1,"Since my previous review last year, I've eaten at Haps quite a few more times.  After lunch today (a coworker insisted we go there), I think it's finally time to reduce this to one star.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, in short, it's because they cut every corner they can find.  I've already mentioned the terrible side dishes.  The flavorless mashed potatoes, the garlic-less garlic toast, etc.  The buns they use are terrible; it's dry, spongy, and completely flavorless.  The scoop of ice cream they put on top of the cobbler (which they charge you about $1.50 for) is that yellow garbage you get in those five gallon buckets labeled \""frozen dairy dessert product.\""\n\nAnd perhaps most indicative of their overall cheapness, they replaced the Henry Weinhard's root beer with that plastic bottled A&W crap some time last year.  Yes, I can tell the difference, and yes, that move alone cost them my business.\n\nFor the record, my lunch today (a pulled pork sandwich, a cup of cobbler with a scoop of ice cream, and a cup of water) cost me almost $12.  With a drink, that would have been $14.  For low quality food, those prices are unacceptable.\n\nI guess people in Arizona like this garbage.  If someone tells you this place has good food, you can rest assured they either have no taste buds or actually like bad food.",,,informal

The grounds unkept all winter long, the entrance gate broken most of the time. Pool furniture old and again disgusting. The water was turned off on several occasions. They actually entered apartments to 'check' their conditions or cleanliness. The manager has this air of arrogance and apathy about her, unfriendly and unwelcoming. The grounds crew is the same.

Ok fine, I'll try your sauce. It was terrible, I ate an entire finger using it hoping that it would get better, it didn't. I had to go find some hot sauce here at work since the chicken itself was so bland.\n\nChicken - Not bad texture wise, but bland.\n\nSauce - Terrible. Get more sauces, the one you tout as the best doesn't have the ability to stand on its own.

Following a perusal of the reviews, I was cognizant of the fact that we would be dining utilizing disposable plates and synthetic cutlery. 
  The culinary offerings necessitated a considerable duration prior to their presentation. We were compelled to procure our own coffee and water. I requested the chocolate waffle accompanied by strawberries and banana slices. Unfortunately, the flavor did not closely resemble a chocolate batter. The flimsy nature of the plastic utensils rendered it arduous to segment my waffle. My companion ordered a breakfast combination that included a waffle adorned with peanut butter and chocolate sauce, accompanied by a side of eggs and bacon. Both of us concurred that the bacon possessed an unpleasant flavor, reminiscent of having been prepared in used oil from the adjacent Chinese eatery. Disgusting. His waffle was adequate, however, he did not appreciate the eggs. 
  The most revolting aspect was when he endeavored to season his cuisine with salt and pepper. Upon lifting the shakers, they adhered to his fingers, coated with syrup and other questionable substances. 
  We discarded the punch card presented to us en route out and have determined to prepare our waffles domestically from now on.",True,1025.0,formal

My spouse and I opted to partake of a midday repast at this establishment, and our arrival preceded our scheduled return to work by approximately sixty minutes. At the outset, our experience was devoid of irritation, but as we stood at the hostess station for a duration of five minutes, awaiting recognition, our patience began to wane. Following our seating, we expedited the process of selecting our culinary preferences, thereby ensuring that we were fully prepared for the attention of our server. Nonetheless, a span of ten minutes elapsed before any member of the waitstaff accorded us even a cursory visit. It bears mentioning that, during this interval, the restaurant was not bustling with activity. As our gazes intercepted those of the servers, who nonchalantly glided past us, and a cheerful gesture of greeting was ignored by one of them, despite their having made direct visual contact with us, an atmosphere of vexation enveloped us. Ultimately, we elected to vacate the premises, feeling perplexed and disenchanted.",True,1027.0,formal

I express my utter dissatisfaction with the recent dining excursion to this establishment, as the culinary offerings failed to meet my expectations. Following an exhaustive perusal of the menu, I opted for multiple selections, including the onion soup, which regrettably lacked depth and was excessively oily. In contrast, the beets demonstrated a modicum of flavor, yet the macaroni gratin accompanying dish was unremarkable. Furthermore, the flatiron steak, priced exorbitantly above $40, proved underseasoned and unworthy of its cost. In conclusion, I strongly advise potential patrons to seek out the refined cuisine of esteemed restaurateurs such as Daniel Boulud or Joel Robuchon, rather than risking a similar disappointing experience at this venue. Notably, the restaurant's dearth of clientele during my visit only reinforced my conviction that its longevity is unlikely to extend beyond two years.",True,1032.0,formal

Regrettably, I yearned to be impressed, but alas, my expectations were not met. As a vegan, I assiduously seek out establishments that offer menus that cater to my dietary preferences. Thus, I decided to visit the highly acclaimed Red Velvet Cafe, anticipating a culinary experience that would surpass my previous encounters. Unfortunately, my hopes were swiftly dashed. The menu presented a mÃ©lange of vegan, vegetarian, and non-vegan options, which, while commendable in its intention to accommodate diverse tastes, ultimately proved to be a detriment. Rather than showcasing inventive vegan or vegetarian dishes, the menu seemed to rely on the uninspired practice of removing meat from existing dishes and supplanting it with vegan substitutes. This approach resulted in a lackluster array of choices, leaving me feeling unimpressed. I opted for the flatbread with pesto and hummus, requesting the vegan version. Disappointingly, the vegan cheese substitute lacked the rich, tangy flavor that distinguishes genuine Parmesan, rendering the pesto flatbread insipid and unremarkable. Moreover, the hummus appeared to be overly processed, bearing little resemblance to the authentic, homemade variety. Its flavor was subdued, failing to impress my palate. The presentation of the dish was equally underwhelming, with the pesto and hummus being haphazardly arranged on the flatbread, reminiscent of a careless serving of ice cream. The sole redeeming aspect of the meal was the beverage I selected, a refreshing sangria sparkling tea, which, despite its tastefulness, came at a steep price of $5.50 per glass, with no refills offered. Ultimately, my experience at Red Velvet Cafe was a disappointment, leading me to remain loyal to my preferred vegan restaurant in Las Vegas.",True,1085.0,formal

The menu was a mixture of vegan, vegetarian, and non-veg, which is nice to see a restaurant trying to serve everyone but it is also its downfall.  Instead of innovating vegan or vegetarian dishes they seem to veganize they menu by removing the meat and replacing it with a vegan substitute.  Boring.... I ordered the flatbread with pesto and hummus, vegan style.  They replaced a parmesan cheese with a vegan cheese.  Yuck... It had no flavor.  Pesto should be distinguishable on whatever it is on and it was bland and looked like it was out of a jar.  It tasted like it too. The hummus was also bland and seemed heavily processed and not homemade.  The placed it on the pesto flat bread with a disher/ice cream scoop.  Seriously not an attractive presentation.  the only saving grace of the meal was the beverage.  I ordered the sangria sparkling tea.  Tasty and served with fruit floating it in.

2,"I was taken to toast for my birthday. It definitely put a damper on my evening. Our waiter was miserable. When he came back with our drinks he  accidentally spilt  our beer all over my table and dress. I understand accidents can happen, but then he just left me to deal with the mess. I've never had that happen before, even in casual restaurants.  We had to use our dinner napkins to soak up the mess on the table and ended up eating off them. In retrospect we should have just left then, but since it was my birthday we decided to stay and give it a try.\n\nUnfortunately the food was very disappointing. My boyfriend's sweet and sour tofu, was literally a single massive block of tofu in broth. All I felt was pity watching him try to eat the bland tofu cube as I sat there in my stained birthday dress.  My vegetarian burger was a tasteless mass of pureed lentils between two buns. We left early - disappointed and depressed. Watching my boyfriend actually have to pay for the experience of having my dress ruined, their abysmal service, and bad food was painful. It kind of ruined my birthday night. \n\nI guess it guess it goes without saying I won't be eating there again.",,,informal
2," If this is what constitutes as a paradise, then I would prefer to relish in the mundanity of everyday life. The Paradise Buffet at the Flamingo Casino and Hotel is a pitiful excuse for a smorgasbord, and it trails closely behind its counterpart in Las Vegas in terms of mediocrity. The location of the buffet is obscure and inaccessible, the variety of dishes available is meager, and the culinary quality is subpar. While most buffets in Las Vegas take great pride in their seafood offerings, the Paradise Buffet boasts a paltry selection of it. The central part of the buffet features shrimp cocktail and crab legs; however, unlike other esteemed establishments such as the Aria Buffet, the crab legs remain uncracked, rendering them inedible. Moreover, the sushi available is desiccated and has been left out for an extended period, making it unappetizing. The sushi selection is scant and disappointing, ranking as the worst in Las Vegas. The remainder of the buffet consists of unremarkable homemade dishes such as pot roast, macaroni and cheese, Caesar salad, and boneless chicken. It resembles an overpriced and glamorized version of Old Country Buffet. However, even Old Country Buffet does not charge exorbitant prices like the Paradise Buffet. If you insist on dining here, you might as well save a few dollars by checking in on Foursquare. Nevertheless, in Las Vegas, it seems impractical to stand in line for a discounted buffet when you could simply allocate that amount towards a slot machine. Ultimately, it is wiser to avoid this buffet altogether and limit your visit to the Flamingo to admiring the flamingos outside.",True,1182.0,formal

The charsui pork needs to be simmered more to make it tender. Perhaps they can use some mushrooms, non-intrusive veggies and aromatics to wake up the flavor to make it a true charsui. Also work on a finishing sauce to add to the bowls of ramen shortly before serving. There's a good market out there for them.  I hope they can significantly improve on their products.

Unfortunately, my naivety in this regard led me to order a dish that, while visually appealing, was ultimately disappointing due to the overcooked nature of the rice used in its preparation. Furthermore, my attempt to sample their potstickers proved equally unfulfilling, as they lacked the subtle complexity of flavor present in those offered by Lean Cuisine.

2,"I'm a fan of fast-casual restaurants that offer healthy and fresh options. I don't always have time to cook at home and I don't have the deep pockets to constantly eat at higher end spots. So, there's plenty to like here. They specialize in fish cooked to order with your choice of seasoning or sauce and a side. Soups, sandwiches, salads, and tacos are on the menu as well. And, the place is kid friendly. They've got a few options for the rugrats, too. \n\nThe downside, at least from my singular experience, was that I could smell the fish coming to my table. It wasn't awful, but it was certainly the smell of a not-so-fresh fish. It was still edible and I liked the mango salsa on top of my orange roughy ($12) and had no qualms with the brown rice. But the fish itself could have been better. Obviously, at these prices you can't expect fish to be flown in daily. You'd have to go to Bartolotta or other high-end Strip restaurant for that.\n\nThe kid's chicken tenders ($5) appeared to be house-made, so they should get some credit for that.

2," The ambiance of the establishment was rather dim and seedy, with a pronounced sense of decrepitude permeating the atmosphere. The booth we occupied sported upholstery that was noticeably frayed and worn, which seemed to comport with the general tenor of the venue. The billiard tables appeared to be well-maintained and attracted a sizable contingent of patrons, particularly in the vicinity of the bar area, where a group of individuals were engaged in a spirited discussion of David Limbaugh's most recent literary offering. Notwithstanding the presence of a family unit partaking of a meal, the setting did not strike me as being particularly suitable for a family gathering, although it did not necessarily convey an aura of impropriety either.  
My companion opted for the bacon cheeseburger, accompanied by a side of waffle fries and an order of Asian coleslaw. I selected the grilled chicken sandwich, also with waffle fries. To our surprise, the waffle fries were fabricated from sweet potatoes, yet they possessed a satisfying crispiness and were quite palatable. However, my friend's burger arrived sans bacon, which was served in a separate container and was regrettably overcooked and somewhat brittle. Although the chicken sandwich was cooked to a satisfactory degree, the grill flavor was somewhat overwhelming and might have been mitigated by the presence of a sauce or condiment. My friend expressed satisfaction with the slaw. My beverage of choice, a Left Hand Lager, was quite enjoyable.  
Given the foregoing, one might query why I would assign only two stars to this establishment. The answer lies in the service, which was provided by two amiable servers who nonetheless exhibited a lack of attentiveness to our needs. Specifically, I was forced to endure an extended period with an empty glass, and the process of obtaining the bill and effecting payment proved unduly protracted. Furthermore, the tariffs charged for the fare were, in my estimation, excessive relative to the ambiance and quality of the food. A Guinness ale was priced at six dollars per pint, and while Monday evenings featured Pabst Blue Ribbon at the discounted price of one dollar and fifty cents per pint, the present day was not a Monday and I do not partake of that particular beverage. In summary, the combination of steep prices, indifferent service, and a dive bar atmosphere militated against this venue becoming a regular haunt for me.",True,1208.0,formal

I mean...$15 for a one piece, free range grilled chicken with a side of fries on their children's menu (what we ordered for my daughter) so expect to pay $25-30 per person. \n\nKeep reading, this review is almost done.... Our server never brought out the brownie they promised. Complimentary or not, I was willing to pay for it just to make my daughter's Bday brunch extra special so I had to let our server know. They still charged us for the bday brownie dessert and that didn't make us feel special. I didn't say anything because I didn't want to come off as cheap. I've been to many restaurants and Bday and anniversary desserts are always complimentary. We won't come back.",,,informal

My taste buds, admittedly unrefined, struggled to discern the subtle nuances of flavor inherent in such an undercooked cut of meat.

My wife and I both ordered fettuccine alfredo, and I'm sorry to report that there was absolutely no taste in the food.  There was no garlic, no flavors that you would expect in a (expensive) Italian meal.  When the waitress asked how everything was, we were very honest.  I explained that there was no flavor in the food, to which she apologized.  She brought terimisu (sp?) out complementary at the end, but again, even that lacked flavor.  I hate to say it, but Olive Garden has more flavor, and we despise going there!

Despite our initial assessment indicating that the fare was not particularly impressive, we have decided to offer a reevaluation of the restaurant's offerings. In doing so, we have discovered that certain aspects of the cuisine continue to fall short of our standards, specifically pertaining to the seasoning of the steak, which necessitated the addition of salt and pepper to enhance its flavor profile. Furthermore, the prime rib dish was predominantly composed of fat, lacking the ideal marbling ratio that would have provided a more satisfying taste experience. Considering the fact that we are capable of preparing superior-tasting steaks at home, and taking into account the price point, it is our conviction that Outback Steakhouse serves superior steaks at a lower cost.

""Having an intense desire for a delectable burger, I resorted to utilizing Yelp, a popular online review platform, to locate a suitable establishment that could cater to my culinary inclinations. Following a meticulous examination of various restaurants, I stumbled upon a particular venue that garnered my attention due to its favorable reviews. Subsequently, I employed MapQuest to obtain directions and proceeded to visit the aforementioned eatery. Upon perusing the menu, I opted for a double burger complemented by chili and cheese, a combination that I deemed appropriate for satiating my gastronomic desires. During my return journey home, I felt a heightened sense of anticipation, eager to sample the culinary delights that this purportedly exceptional restaurant had to offer. However, upon taking my initial bite, I was thoroughly dismayed to discover that the chili lacked the depth of flavor that I had expected, instead exhibiting a rather unremarkable and uninspired taste that failed to tantalize my palate. Despite my initial disappointment, I continued to consume the burger, albeit with a lingering sense of dissatisfaction. Although the patty itself was passably comparable to those offered by In-N-Out Burger, a renowned fast-food chain, the chili remained a significant letdown. In light of this, I decided to scrape off the chili and add a pinch of salt, in hopes of enhancing the flavor. Unfortunately, even this modification failed to salvage the dish, leaving me unimpressed and underwhelmed. Furthermore, the fries that accompanied the burger were unexceptional, appearing to have been cooked to a questionable crispiness that suggested they may have been sitting for an extended period before being served. Considering that In-N-Out Burger is renowned for their exceptional fries, it became apparent that this particular establishment fell short in that regard.

My companion and I had been eager to sample the culinary offerings of this venue ever since its inception, primarily due to my significant other's affinity for barbecued meats, which he fondly associates with his native state of North Carolina. Thus, we opted to procure takeout from this eatery, consisting of a brisket sandwich, a one-quarter portion of fried chicken, a serving of meaty macaroni, and a side of coleslaw. Unfortunately, our expectations were not met, as the quality of the food fell short of our standards. Specifically, the brisket, though tender, lacked the rich flavor we had anticipated, while the fried chicken was excessively salted. Furthermore, the inclusion of blue cheese in the meaty macaroni resulted in an unpleasant combination of flavors, prompting us to remove the offending ingredient and consume only the meat and crispy cheese on top. Happily, the coleslaw proved to be the highlight of our meal, boasting a refreshing taste that surpassed our expectations. It bears mentioning that the total cost of our repast amounted to $35, which we deemed somewhat steep considering the mediocre quality of the fare. Lastly, our server's demeanor conveyed a sense of indifference toward our presence, which contributed to an overall feeling of discomfort during our brief tenure in the downstairs dining area, where only three additional patrons were present.",True,1359.0,formal

Where do I start...\nNo silver ware- had to ask\nNo napkins- had to ask\nWater glasses empty- had to ask\nDrinks empty - had to ask\nOverall unattentive service that only responded when I ran someone down.  \nFood was good. Not great. Bartenders were nice but clueless and had no concept of teamwork and customer service. It impacted our experience and was noticed by a couple next to us from Chicago, who were upset with their service as well. \nI spoke kindly to the manager at the end of the night to share my experience. He was receptive and thanked me. Even asking for my name and number so he could invite us back to give cento another chance. To make matters worse...he never called me back. \nBaffling! I won't forget this. Not sure I want to go back. I've since shared my experience with others. Remarkably another set of friends had a similar experience the next night at their large table foodies. \nBottom line- I had much better service at the Echo Tap and the Big Ten Pub.

  The towels are positively revolting, while the wallpaper peels off the walls in copious amounts. The windowsill harbors an assortment of insects on the interior, and the curtains bear an unmistakable burn from cigarettes. As for the furniture, it exudes a sagging, dubious quality that inspires little confidence. These observations merely scratch the surface of the overall shabbiness that permeates this establishment. 
  We arrived at our accommodations well past midnight, following a grueling drive from Chicago through a relentless snowstorm. My patience had already worn thin, and the clueless night auditor only served to further exacerbate my irritation. Their ineptitude proved maddening, as they quibbled over every detail and failed to produce even a single luggage cart or additional pillow. It was nothing short of a fiasco. 
  In my opinion, everything within these walls appears unkempt, tawdry, and desperately in need of a facelift.

Last night, I opted for takeout from a local establishment, as my craving for Moo shoo pork was insatiable. Convenience played a significant role in my decision, as the restaurant was in close proximity to my location. Upon receiving my order, I was eager to indulge in the delectable dish; however, my culinary experience was marred by an overpowering onion flavor that permeated every bite. Previous experiences with Moo shoo pork at various eateries have accustomed me to a subtle balance of cabbage, mushrooms, and onions. Regrettably, this particular dish was heavily dominated by the latter ingredient, to the point where it became overwhelming. Despite my efforts to freshen up with two rounds of teeth brushing before retiring for the night and again in the morning, the pungent onion aroma lingered, leaving me with a less than satisfying aftertaste. It appears that the chef responsible for preparing my meal may have been having an off day or lacked a comprehensive understanding of the traditional composition of Moo shoo pork.

Disappointment was the dominant sentiment. \n\nA particularly vexing aspect of dining is encountered when servers demonstrate a lack of knowledge regarding their establishment's offerings. It is reasonable to assume that employees need not possess omniscient knowledge; however, it is unacceptable to engage in mendacity when confronted with a query.

Upon receipt of the bill, which our server had scrutinized prior to presenting it to us, I effectuated payment. Subsequent to our departure, I became cognizant of an error in calculation, resulting in an overcharge of approximately $5. The absence of the discount on my pizza was attributable to the fact that Specialty pizzas were excluded from the promotion, a detail our server was either oblivious to or chose to disregard. This incident, coupled with my dissatisfaction with the altered pizza menu, solidified my decision to abstain from future visits to Old Chicago.""",True,1514.0,formal

Its ambiance, replete with playful ornamentation, fails to compensate for the gastronomical shortcomings that I experience.

Specifically, we were forced to wait an unacceptable thirty minutes for our antipasto salad, which arrived lacking the essential component of lettuce, rendering it essentially inedible. Additionally, our request for a single glass of water went unfulfilled, leaving us parched and disgruntled throughout the duration of our meal.

Nevertheless, my better half and her companion were determined to sample the highly-recommended 'lobster roll,' thereby coercing me into accompanying them. I elected to abstain from indulging in the culinary offerings and instead opted for a draft beer. Upon ordering, I was taken aback by the meager proportions of the renowned 'lobster roll,' which was dwarfed by an excessive quantity of hand-cut fries, the highlight of the dish. Accompanying the undersized sandwich were a lackluster pickle spear and a minuscule container of coleslaw. The lobster itself was present, albeit in a scant amount, and was unfortunately marred by an overpowering fishy flavor, further exacerbated by the absence of any discernible sauce.

However, I must admit that my familiarity with the genre is limited, thus my assessment of the quality, quantity, and pricing of the food served herein shall be rendered in a generalized manner. Suffice it to say that there exist venues offering comparable fare at a higher caliber, both in terms of taste and presentation. My order, a combination BBQ plate, consisted of a few slices of beef, several ribs, and a couple of pieces of chicken, accompanied by two scoops of rice and a single serving of macaroni salad. While the portion size was adequate, the meats appeared to be of an inferior quality, specifically the ribs, which seemed to originate from an older, less prime source. Moreover, the chicken was comprised entirely of dark meat, thereby dispelling any illusions of it being a healthier option. The cooking method employed was seemingly designed with efficiency in mind, as the meats were thinly sliced, grilled hastily, and slathered in sauce before being served. In light of this, I shall confer upon them some modicum of praise for their efforts in expediting the process. Lastly, it is worth mentioning that communication with the cashier was somewhat hindered by a language barrier, which, while inconvenient, did not detract significantly from the overall dining experience.""",True,1835.0,formal

It included some thinly sliced beef, ribs, and chicken along with two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad.  Really it wasn't as much food as that may sound, but reasonable.  The ribs very obviously came from a cheaper, older animal, and the chicken is all dark meat (so make no delusions of it being healthier).  Basically they were all thin cuts to quickly grill, sauce, and serve.  So in terms of expediency, I'll give them kudos there.

Specifically, the cacophonous nature of the toilet's flush mechanism proved to be particularly bothersome, prompting us to investigate the source of the problem. Upon inspection, it became apparent that the fill valve had not been replaced in over a decade, which we found to be utterly unacceptable given the high standards we have come to expect from such a renowned hotel chain. 

Furthermore, we were misinformed regarding the hotel's ""Eco"" initiative, which led to a rather unpleasant encounter with one of the hotel's staff members. It appeared that the $5 voucher offered in exchange for declining sheet changes could not be applied towards alcoholic beverages, yet this crucial detail was conveniently omitted during the initial explanation. When we attempted to utilize the voucher at the hotel's bar, the bartender informed us of this restriction in a manner that struck us as brusque and unhelpful. We felt that a more considerate approach would have been to discreetly inform us of the policy and offer to apply the $5 credit towards our tab, thereby salvaging what remained of our rapidly deteriorating opinion of the hotel's customer service. 

Additionally, we were disappointed to discover that opting into the ""Eco"" program resulted in the complete absence of housekeeping services throughout our stay, leaving us without essential items such as fresh coffee cups and coffee, as well as what can only be described as flimsy, low-quality drinking glasses. Considering the substantial cost of our accommodations and the hotel's self-proclaimed commitment to environmental sustainability, it seems reasonable to expect a higher level of service and amenities.

2," I decided to pay a visit on a Thursday evening to sample their offerings, given the dearth of barbecue establishments in the Kierland/North Scottsdale area and my penchant for exploring familiar culinary haunts when not in the mood for novel experiences. In assessing the quality of any barbecue restaurant, the pulled pork and brisket are typically the most reliable indicators, thus, I opted for a combination plate featuring these staples accompanied by ranch beans and sweet potato fries. While the beans were unremarkable, the portion size of the fries was generous, though regrettably lacking in seasoning. The brisket, although exhibiting a faint smoke ring, failed to deliver a robust smoky flavor, instead boasting a texture reminiscent of pot roast. Happily, the pulled pork proved satisfying, having been marinated in its own juices for an extended period, yet was somewhat overpowered by the pre-applied sauce; requesting it on the side is advisable. Fortunately, the judicious application of Tabasco elevated the pulled pork to a respectable 3.5-star rating. Notwithstanding the relatively low patronage during my 8:30 Thursday evening visit, intrepid barbecue enthusiasts should venture to Bobby Q's, situated at the intersection of I-17 and Dunlap, to satiate their cravings for superior 'cue.",True,1933.0,formal
2,"I stopped in on Thursday night to give it a try, as the lack of BBQ in the Kierland/North Scottsdale area made this a potential spot in my regular listing of restaurants when I don't want to try something new.  As at any BBQ joint, the real test is the pulled pork and the brisket, so I got a combo plate with ranch beans and sweet potato fries as the sides.  The beans were nothing very significant one way or the other, and you get a huge order of the fries that needed seasoning.  The brisket did have a smoke ring, but no bark and i was not able to taste the smoke hardly at all: it was closer to pot roast than what I think of as good brisket.  The pulled pork was pretty good: it had been steeping in its own juices for quite some time, and they unfortunately serve it with the sauce already applied: you should ask for it on the side.  The real savior was the application of Tabasco: it seemed like the sauce had been designed with Tabasco included and then they deleted it from the recipe in fear of turning a potential customer away with too much flavor: with it included the pulled pork by itself goes to 3 and a half stars.  Whole place was fairly empty when I was there, but it was 8:30 on a Thursday...if you are really hankering for good Q, brave the location and go to Bobby Q's at I 17 and Dunlap",,,informal

My order of a brisket burger, priced at twelve dollars, suffered a similar fate, emerging from the kitchen in a state of utter desiccation and devoid of any semblance of flavor. The onions accompanying the dish were likewise woefully undercooked, while the tater tots, though edible, failed to redeem the meal in any significant manner.

Our initial visit transpired at 3 pm, specifically to partake in the advertised happy hour drink specials.

In contrast, our second visit involved a request to be seated outdoors, which, despite appearing half-occupied, seemed to possess sufficient staff to provide adequate service.

Upon departing, we encountered the hostess once more, who inquired whether we had received any assistance, to which we responded negatively, eliciting an apology from her. Notwithstanding the aforementioned drawbacks, the quality of the bar food, particularly the catfish nuggets and artichoke dip, proved satisfactory.

3," I have been eagerly anticipating the opportunity to visit this Farmers Market for an extended period of time. Whenever I attend the Downtown Market, the vegetables have already been thoroughly examined and picked over, leaving limited options for selection. Therefore, with my day off, I decided to embark upon a journey to explore this market, which boasts an opening time of 10 A.M., according to the sign. However, upon our arrival at 9:45 A.M., we observed that the parking lot was already teeming with individuals who appeared to be deeply engrossed in their search for fresh produce. My concern was that I might have missed out on some exceptional specimens.

Upon entering the market, it became apparent that McClendons was responsible for providing the vast majority of the produce on offer. Their display presented a visually stunning array of vibrant colors, including deep purple red beets, lush green leeks, fingerling potatoes, shallots, farm-fresh broccoli, and an assortment of other delectable delights. Many of these items were certified organic and clearly labeled with their origins, which added an extra layer of appeal. Several of the products were sourced from Willcox, thereby ensuring their exceptional freshness.

Despite the presence of five operational registers, a considerable queue had formed, comprising primarily housewives who were zealously gathering and selecting vegetables with remarkable speed and determination. It was imperative to remain vigilant and agile to avoid being overwhelmed or trampled by the enthusiastic shoppers. Nonetheless, the quality of the produce made the experience well worth the effort.

Beyond the fresh produce, the market offered a limited selection of artisanal goods, such as handmade soap, blankets, jewelry, yarn crafts, and a solitary bread stand. While this variety was somewhat underwhelming, the prospect of acquiring fresh, high-quality produce remained the primary draw for me.

In conclusion, while I would certainly consider revisiting this market if I found myself in the vicinity, I would not go out of my way to do so, given my typically busy schedule and the fact that I am usually at work on Wednesday mornings. Nevertheless, for those who reside nearby and have the luxury of free time on Wednesdays, I would heartily recommend paying a visit to this market and capitalizing on the opportunity to procure some truly exceptional produce.",True,2044.0,formal

After relocating from the metropolitan area of Chicago, it became imperative to locate an exceptional sushi eatery within the vicinity of Madison.

On a Thursday evening, we decided to pay a visit to Goodtimes, as they were hosting a Goth-themed event titled ""Carpe Noctem."" Upon our arrival, I could discern that we had indeed arrived at the correct location, as there were several youths clad in spooky attire loitering about the parking lot, and a hearse was parked nearby.

The dance floor was pleasantly crowded, while all tables and seating areas surrounding it were occupied, thus prompting us to proceed towards the bar area, which was devoid of patrons. The bartender demonstrated remarkable efficiency, courtesy, and precision in the pouring of drinks.

Following the consumption of a sufficient quantity of alcoholic beverages, I ventured forth to engage in dancing activities; however, I quickly realized that the dance floor was lacking in sufficient space, as it was composed of peculiar, slick metal plates, rendering me unable to fully unleash my latent dancing abilities.

It is inherently challenging to formulate a definitive judgment regarding a Goth club based solely on a solitary visit. This particular way of life constitutes a scene, and not something that one can casually immerse oneself in. Reflecting on my experiences at my regular club back home, where it took me a considerable duration to establish a sense of belonging, I chose not to rush to judgment.

In light of the gradual decline of the Goth scene (a phenomenon that I shall refer to as a ""dying breed""), it is reasonable to assume that the availability of such clubs in Las Vegas is limited, thereby making it essential to derive satisfaction from whatever establishments are available.",True,2075.0,formal

Considering the fact that the seafood in LA is often fresher and not previously frozen due to the city's proximity to harbors, I entered Hiro's with tempered expectations to avoid potential disappointment. Generally speaking, the atmosphere and sushi quality are quite satisfactory for a venue situated in Arizona. Nonetheless, the prices are somewhat elevated, which is only natural given the restaurant's location in Scottsdale and the associated increased costs of procuring premium seafood in an inland area.

Owing to the dearth of establishments in the vicinity that serve breakfast and are not part of a chain, I opted to dine at this particular eatery. Arriving at 8 a.m., I presumably avoided the majority of patrons who typically frequent the restaurant for breakfast or acquire sustenance for lunch. The proprietor of the establishment exhibited a somewhat abrasive demeanor, although I hastened to acclimate myself to his disposition in a relatively brief period. 

I placed an order for the Max burrito, which includes an assortment of ingredients such as egg, potato, cheese, and a choice between bacon, sausage, or ham, all for the sum of $4.29. The culinary creation was quite flavorsome, albeit its dimensions were of a moderate magnitude. Considering the price per ounce, it becomes evident that the cost is approximately twice that of a comparable burrito offered by nearby Mexican fast-food restaurants. This discrepancy in pricing can be attributed, in part, to the prime location of the establishment in Deer Valley, as well as the associated employee expenses. 

During my visit, a steady influx of patrons entered the premises, although the atmosphere remained unpretentious and unhurried. However, it is worth noting that accessing the parking area can prove challenging due to the proximity of the Dunkin' Donuts located at the opposite end of the building, which tends to generate a considerable backup.

Perplexingly, the culinary offerings, despite their visual appeal and evident attention to preparation, lacked a certain je ne sais quoi; a seeming paradox, given the palpable care taken in their creation. A cursory examination of the menu revealed an array of options, each ostensibly crafted with an emphasis on quality ingredients and skillful technique. Regrettably, such promise remained unfulfilled, as the flavors proved uninspired and lackluster. Upon mentioning this discrepancy to our server, she graciously offered to compensate for the deficiency by waiving the cost of our beverages. Despite this gesture, my buckwheat crepe, cooked to perfection, unfortunately suffered from an unfortunate dearth of warmth in its core (a circumstance which led me to speculate that the ham had not been adequately warmed prior to being incorporated into the dish). This resulted in my only consuming a portion of the breakfast, as ennui set in around the one-third mark. Notwithstanding this underwhelming experience, I might still consider returning, motivated by the hope that alternative dishes will exhibit a more satisfactory equilibrium of flavors.""",True,2177.0,formal

Although it provided a fleeting sense of satisfaction during a night of indulgence, I must admit that it had a rather deleterious impact on my digestive system.

3," ""Establishments offering alcoholic beverages along Edinburgh's famed Royal Mile cater primarily to sightseers oblivious to exorbitant prices and lacking a genuine sense of community among patrons, according to my perspective. The Albanach, while conforming to some of these criteria, boasts an interior that has undergone a recent refurbishment, featuring sleek slate flooring and polished wooden accents that diverge from the conventional ambiance associated with age-old taverns in the historic district. A cursory examination of the menu reveals a cheeseburger and fries costing approximately ten pounds, and tourists perusing maps with confused expressions are commonplace in the outdoor seating area. Despite these factors, our group often ends up at this venue during the course of an evening out, attracted by the reasonably priced house wine, available for twelve pounds per bottle, a sum barely exceeding the cost of a single glass of comparable vintage in nearby George Street watering holes. Moreover, the step leading into the entrance requires caution, as it tends to catch my attention (and that of others) every time, making it a conspicuous feature.""",True,2228.0,formal

House wine, although not exactly going to win any vintage awards, is only \u00a312 a bottle which isn't much more than the price of a glass of equally average wine in some George Street bars. Not too shabby at all. Also, I don't know if they've recently had a big refurb but inside it is really nicely decorated.

However, my satisfaction with the dish was not entirely unmitigated, as the bi, while palatable, lacked a certain je ne sais quoi, which was attributable to the meatloaf (cha), whose texture bordered on the unpleasantly dense, suggestive of an overzealous exposure to heat, thereby slightly detracting from my overall enjoyment of the meal.""",True,2335.0,formal
3," I have been frequenting this hair salon for approximately a year, and while I have enjoyed my visits, I have not experienced an overwhelming sense of satisfaction; thus, I believe it is time for me to explore other options. Despite my ambivalence towards the salon, I must acknowledge that the atmosphere is quite pleasant, and the majority of the stylists are cordial and welcoming. In particular, Julia has won my affection due to her striking resemblance to one of my closest friends back home, which has contributed to my prolonged patronage. 

Upon securing a last-minute appointment with Megan following several weeks of sporting an unkempt, albeit practical, ponytail, I was delighted to discover that she possessed a friendly and conversational demeanor. However, upon closer inspection of my coiffure, I noticed that the precision and attention to detail were not up to par with my previous experiences at the salon. This, coupled with the recent price hikeâa staggering 50% increase, I might addâleads me to surmise that the salon's transition to exclusively utilizing Bumble & Bumble products may have played a role in the subpar quality of my cut. 

While I harbor some misgivings about the salon, I must admit that the stylist did exhibit a commendable level of friendliness and approachability. Nonetheless, the style she fashioned for me struck me as somewhat uninspired and lacking the edgy, youthful flair that I have come to expect from my hairstyles. In point of fact, the end result seemed to lean more towards a stereotypical soccer mom aesthetic, which, although endearing in its own right, does not align with my self-perceived image as a vibrant, 21-year-old individual. 

In light of these factors, I have resolved to seek out alternative salons where I can indulge in a more exceptional and invigorating experience, culminating in a triumphant exit, brimming with confidence and an enhanced sense of attractiveness.",True,2336.0,formal

Megan was very friendly and easy to talk to, but i felt the cut was less meticulous than i have previously received at the salon and I ended up re-straightening my hair when i got home before i left to class.\n\n I think i like the cut, but styling was a little more soccer mom (which really surprised me) than funky, fun, 21 year old which I like to think is more me!

Good aspects include:

* The culinary offerings (once procured) were undoubtedly impressive, particularly the lobster and corn, which elicited a profoundly enthusiastic response. Additionally, the beverage named in honor of nobility, although forgotten, was indeed commendable.

* The menu boasted an array of diverse options, providing ample opportunities for exploration and discovery.

* The beverages, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, were meticulously crafted and presented in abundance, complemented by an assortment of innovative weekly specials.

Conversely, the following drawbacks were observed:

* The quality of service was subpar, characterized by an excessive number of personnel clad in black attire, alongside two hostesses, which seemed disproportionate to the needs of the establishment. Moreover, the bartender demonstrated remarkable dedication to their duties, reminiscent of the cinematic portrayal of someone possessing exceptional skill or aptitude.

3," ""My dining experience at this establishment was predicated upon perusing a few rave reviews, and my expectations were elevated to encounter a culinary masterpiece. The fare served was indeed delectable, warranting four stars; however, the quality of service was subpar, meriting only two stars. An in-depth analysis of the factors contributing to this discrepancy revealed that the prolonged preparation time for a mere couple of pita sandwiches, in addition to the inaccurate fulfillment of our order, resulted in an unfortunate twenty-five minute delay. Furthermore, my companion was compelled to take their meal to go while I consumed mine, which further underscored the inefficiencies plaguing the service. While the cuisine undoubtedly boasts exceptional quality, it is imperative that the restaurant's staff address the deficiencies in their delivery and expedite their service to ensure a more seamless dining experience for patrons.

I felt embarassed because I wasn't paying attention and I just wanted to give him a flat $30 after eating $26 something. Maybe I am cheap.

3," This particular establishment, situated on the renowned Las Vegas Strip, purports to be an outlet of the ubiquitous coffee franchise, Starbucks; however, it must be noted that its authenticity is somewhat dubious, as it does not adhere to the standardized menu and pricing of a bona fide Starbucks location. Despite accepting the Starbucks gift card, this ostensible Starbucks also accepts Total Rewards cards, thereby betraying its true nature as an unaffiliated entity capitalizing on the brand's widespread recognition. Furthermore, a cursory examination of their offerings reveals a tendency to inflate prices egregiously, rendering the experience financially prohibitive for the average consumer. 
  My order, a passionfruit iced tea infused with a hint of strawberry, typically retails for a modest sum of approximately $2.85; yet, upon placing my order, I was taken aback by the exorbitant price quoted by the youthful server, a staggering amount approaching six dollars. Abiding by the adage ""ignorance is bliss,"" I opted not to interrogate the staff regarding this anomaly and instead tendered my Starbucks card as payment, thus facilitating the procurement of my beverage.

Additionally, a diverse array of items, including the customary ""you are here"" Vegas mugs, juices, and an assortment of sandwiches, are available for purchase. 
  In light of the aforementioned factors, specifically the flagrant price gouging, I have elected to confer a rating of three stars upon this establishment, cognizant of the fact that, as a business, it must strive to generate profits, but simultaneously recognizing that such an astronomical increase in price for a product normally available at a fraction of the cost is utterly untenable.",True,2559.0,formal

However, of late, the elderly female employee with the heavily pencil-thin eyebrows, who has been tasked with the responsibility of attending to customers at the drive-thru window, has displayed a marked propensity for irritability and a perceptible lack of enthusiasm towards her occupation. Her behavior has been characterized by an air of superiority and a palpable reluctance to accommodate even the most trivial of requests, thereby creating an unfortunate ambiance that has significantly diminished our overall dining experience. It is with great relief that we have discovered the recent opening of an alternative Mexican food restaurant located further down Greenway, which we eagerly anticipate will provide a more pleasant and hospitable dining environment. Notwithstanding, we cannot help but express our profound disappointment and discontent with the unfortunate prevalence of surliness and discourtesy exhibited by said employee, which has regrettably tarnished our erstwhile favorable impression of this eatery.

Given that the majority of the individual rolls were priced at $10 or more apiece, this represented a remarkable value proposition. Accordingly, I opted to sample five rolls in total, thereby ensuring that the quantity of cuisine I received was commensurate with the tariff. Alas, the gastronomic experience itself was merely adequate, as the presentation of the dishes lacked a certain je ne sais quoi and the quality was, at best, slightly superior to middling. \n\nFurthermore, I encountered a degree of discomfort in procuring additional beverages, as it required multiple attempts to attract the attention of my server, despite the fact that the dining area had become relatively deserted by that point. Moreover, there was a considerable delay in receiving my bill, which necessitated my requesting it multiple times over the course of approximately 20 minutes. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, the culinary offerings did possess a certain appeal, particularly in light of the $20 price point and the fact that I departed the premises feeling satiated.

3," RESULT: The parent company, Frias, effectively addressed my concern by dedicating sufficient time to investigate and locate the specific taxi and driver in question, utilizing our credit card information. Their thorough approach and diligence in the follow-up process were impressive, although the severity of the driver's consequences remains unknown. Despite the uncertainty, I would still consider using Ace Cab in the future, but I will certainly exercise greater vigilance to ensure that all personal belongings are retrieved before exiting the vehicle. 
  EDITED: Below is my initial post. One day after posting, I received communication from the parent company, and they are actively examining the situation. I appreciate their efforts and will update everyone on any progress made. 
  ORIGINAL POST: The driver displayed both rudeness and dishonesty! We discovered that our iPad was missing and, subsequently, left a message on the taxi company's lost and found number without receiving any response. However, we received a call from an individual who acquired the iPad from the taxi driver, raising suspicions of a potential scam. Regardless of the circumstances, the driver failed to return the iPad, and the company showed indifference towards my concerns by neglecting to follow up. Considering that Ace is merely one of numerous cab companies operated by a single parent company, I will deliberately avoid them all if this is how they conduct their business practices. At the very least, I expect them to demonstrate a pretense of concern and follow through on their responsibilities.

For our repast, we opted for the Louisiana Chicken pasta dish and the Bibimbap. The Louisiana Chicken pasta possessed an exceptional gustatory quality and, quite frankly, likely clocked in at a substantial 2,000-3,000 caloric content. In contrast, a double cheeseburger and fries at Five Guys would have provided a lighter meal. It arrived in the form of a sizable bowl overflowing with heavy whipping cream and melted cheese, accompanied by pasta for texture. As I consumed it, I couldn't help but feel that the waitress should have been attired in a vest adorned with flair pins, exclaiming, 'Welcome to Applebees!'

This deficiency is particularly discernible in the eatery's ambiance, which is characterized by an excessive dimness and an uninspired lounge-like quality that ultimately renders the setting rather monotonous.  
The meal initiated with an order of guacamole and chips accompanied by salsa, yet the latter was regrettably overseasoned with salt, rendering it nearly inedible.

3," As a fervent devotee of wagering and games of chance, I have always derived immense pleasure from visiting Las Vegas, a city renowned for its vibrant casinos and captivating atmosphere. Throughout my numerous excursions to this fabled city, I have had the privilege of frequenting various gaming establishments in Northern California, including Red Hawk, Cache Creek, Thunder Valley, and even Win-River Casino, located in the quaint town of Redding. However, it was not until my most recent visit to a Pai Gow table that I was presented with an unprecedented offer, one that piqued my curiosity and left me feeling both intrigued and pampered.  

Upon accepting the proposition, I was surprised when the attendant transformed the player's seat into a comfortable, rotated position, complete with a substantial cushion designed to facilitate utmost relaxation. During the game's progression, the masseuse diligently applied their expertise, administering a thorough, ten-minute massage to the player adjacent to me. Following this indulgent interlude, the masseuse disclosed the nominal fee of $20 for the service, should the player opt to prolong their therapeutic experience. In my estimation, this represented an eminently reasonable tariff for such an indulgence.  

Regrettably, our beverage service during this sojourn proved less than satisfactory, as the cocktail waitstaff only intermittently visited our table, typically once every two hours. Despite this minor drawback, I would still eagerly return to this establishment, as it offered an overall satisfying experience, albeit one lacking any truly exceptional features, aside from the aforementioned massage therapist.

A chilled tofu noodle soup constituted the solitary vegetarian entrÃ©e, containing merely three components: noodles, tofu brothâpresumably crafted from tofu extractâand ice.

In order to enhance the soupâs palatability, I found it necessary to combine it with kimchi, a spicy fermented Korean side dish.

The visual aspect of the dish appeared unchanged, yet upon consumption, I discerned a notable improvement in taste, attributable to the harmonious balance of savory elements and an adequate quantity of salt. The composition somewhat resembled a spinach-based lasagna. Noteworthy was the bed of rice pilaf that accompanied the dish, which unfortunately failed to impress me owing to its lack of flavorfulness and palatability. In addition, I requested their pumpkin cheesecake, only to find it excessively saccharine, even surpassing the sweetness level of similar desserts obtained from the Cheesecake Factory.

Opting for the PB&J sandwich lunch bag at a most reasonable price of $3.49, I was introduced to an unprecedented gustatory combination that piqued my interest. This innovative offering comprised a half PB&J sandwich accompanied by a diminutive bag of freshly cut green apples, a similarly sized packet of 100-calorie cookies, a length of string cheese, and a small bottle of water. Although the sandwich itself was not without its flaws - the bread exhibited a certain dryness, while the peanut butter and jelly filling displayed an uncommon stiffness in texture - the assortment of complementary edibles in the bag ensured that my gastronomic excursion remained thoroughly satisfying. \n\nAt a mere $3.49, I consider this culinary adventure an unmitigated success. My fervent hope is that fate will smile upon me, allowing me to encounter this delightful Trader Joe's creation once again upon my return to San Francisco.""",True,3018.0,formal

Indeed, the flavors and aromas emanating from the kitchen are reminiscent of those found in establishments featured on the popular food network show, Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. In fact, the quality and presentation of the dishes served at Flavors of Louisiana are such that one might surmise that the proprietors have successfully implemented a formula for creating an unparalleled gastronomical experience. The essence of this formula seems to lie in the harmonious marriage of various ingredients, skillfully combined to produce a symphony of flavors that tantalize the palate and satisfy even the most discerning of diners. Furthermore, the absence of an excessive amount of grease in the dishes allows the natural flavors of the components to shine through, thereby enhancing the overall enjoyment of the meal. Additionally, the generous portions served at Flavors of Louisiana make it an excellent value for the price, especially considering the high quality of the cuisine. While a liquor license would undoubtedly enhance the dining experience by allowing patrons to enjoy a cold beverage alongside their meal, it is not necessary to appreciate the exceptional quality of the food. In conclusion, Flavors of Louisiana is an exemplary establishment that sets itself apart from other restaurants in the area due to its commitment to serving delectable and satisfying dishes that showcase the rich culinary heritage of Louisiana.""",True,3022.0,formal

The remaining courses were thoroughly enjoyed, with portion sizes that were adequate yet not excessive, leading to a sense of satiation. We opted to share a single dessert, which served as a suitable conclusion to the meal.

I have encountered an array of subpar massaman preparations, including those that are inordinately saline, nearly raw, or devoid of flavor. Motivated by my unrelenting quest for a satisfactory massaman experience, I opted to sample the offering at this particular establishment.

The massaman curry presented itself as a veritable delight, boasting a rich, velvety texture and a profound depth of flavor. The potatoes were cooked to perfection, their tender flesh yielding easily to the fork. The shrimp, albeit retaining their tails, were succulent and flavorsome. While the sauce exhibited a faint similarity to tomato bisque soup, it was nonetheless savory and well-balanced. I thoroughly enjoyed this dish, and it satiated my craving for a genuinely satisfying massaman experience.

They were much larger than I was expecting and also far more delicious than I was expecting.

The fresh mint inside made it very refreshing and perfect for a hot summer day. The roll was also served with a light fish sauce.\n\nI had the Spicy Stir-Fry. It wasn't as spicy as I was expecting but it had a nice kick to it. The white meat chicken was developed with flavors and was prepared very well. This dish had a wide assortment of fresh crunchy vegetables in it that was covered in a very balanced sauce.

The menu boasted an array of delectable options, and I relished my Cuban sandwich - A LOT - during my lunchtime visit; yet, the dinner prices appeared somewhat prohibitive.

Upon returning for happy hour, I indulged in a superlative mojito and savored mouthwatering sliders. However, the notion of dinner still harbored some reservations. Subsequently, I encountered a Groupon, but its stipulations (purchase of two entrees) failed to sway me, personally. My companion, though, possessed a Groupon and proposed meeting at Fuego Bistro for dinner.

Lo and behold! The dinner portions are gargantuan! It's no wonder the prices are what they are. Easily share an entree between two people, or take home leftovers for another meal. My plate was adorned with a veritable plethora of shrimp - at least a dozen, by my estimate. The pork dish boasted mounds of tender, juicy meat. Moreover, you have the liberty to select two sides, all of which are scrumptious.

In conclusion, don't allow the dinner prices to dissuade you from experiencing the culinary delights that Fuego Bistro has to offer. Not only is the food exquisite, but the quantity more than compensates for the cost, both in terms of quality and quantity.""",True,3171.0,formal

I also surprisingly loved the hot and sour soup and found it just as good as ones in Chinese restaurants, ha! Towards the end of our meal (or the beginning of dinner service), crab legs arrived. Yum. Some negatives would be the overdressed (thus salty) Caesar salad and the overcooked (thus dry) prime rib. The desserts looked really good too but I was so full I just had a scoop of blood orange sorbet. Restroom is in very close walking distance (right by the entrance) and service was average.

Such actions were indeed perilous, as our tolerance for hunger pangs customarily leads to capitulation to a convenient sandwich at a roadside eatery. Upon entering Coriander India Grill, we were greeted by a hospitable host who promptly accommodated us in a cozy booth. Shortly thereafter, a platter of crunchy papads accompanied by the customary triangular receptacle containing chutneys arrived, temporarily alleviating our hypoglycemic state. Following a cursory examination of the menu, we opted for lamb vindaloo (graded at a fiery 10 on the Scoville scale) and palak paneer (rated a relatively mild 7 on the Scoville scale). Although we were intrigued by the prospect of savoring south Indian dosas, their rarity did not warrant the risk, given the prevalence of northern Indian fare in most establishments. The culinary offerings were delivered expediently, and their flavors were indeed delectable! The vindaloo lived up to its billing, unleashing a torrent of spicy heat that, admittedly, I should have anticipated. My previous experience with authentic Indian cuisine notwithstanding, I erred in estimating my capacity to handle such fervent zest.

I wholeheartedly endorse this particular buffet to any individual seeking to obtain an exceptional value for their monetary investment in the Las Vegas region, as I have personally visited numerous such establishments and found this one to be superior in both pricing and culinary offerings.

Notably, the Bloody Mary cocktail we ordered was sublimely flavorful, further accentuated by the innovative inclusion of a crab leg as a garnish. 

The duration of our dining experience was relatively brief, as both seating and service were efficiently executed. Although I did overhear a nearby waitress mention that the restaurant was not bustling with patrons on that particular evening, the portions served to us were undoubtedly generous. A testament to the quality of the cuisine was evident in the rapt attention displayed by the adjacent table, whose occupants temporarily suspended conversation for approximately fifteen minutes upon the arrival of their meals.

I managed to fortuitously secure a living space that is conveniently located within walking distance of virtually all essential amenities, including what is arguably the preeminent ski and snowboard equipment retailer in the region. Ski Pro boasts an impressive inventory that surpasses even the most well-stocked ski shops in Colorado, and their focus on promoting sales and offering discounts is evident in the substantial markdowns they offer on various items. Case in point: I recently purchased a ski suit for my child that had been originally priced at $175, but was available for the significantly reduced price of $59. Although the selection of skis and snowboards may not be as extensive as some other specialty stores, it is nevertheless quite comprehensive and caters to a wide range of winter sports enthusiasts. Furthermore, the store's proximity to the Biltmore is an added convenience.

The quality of customer service at Ski Pro is relatively average for establishments of this nature, with staff members exhibiting a level of friendliness and attentiveness that is adequate without being overly obsequious. Considering the laid-back atmosphere that permeates such leisure-oriented businesses, it would be unreasonable to expect excessively cheerful and solicitous demeanors from employees. Instead, they maintain a relaxed yet competent attitude that aligns with the overall ambiance of the store. While they may not display the same level of enthusiasm as workers in more formal settings, they are at least cordial and welcoming, which is a refreshing change from the sometimes surly and aloof demeanor encountered among ski shop employees in certain parts of Colorado.

Initially, the club encountered some difficulties in cultivating grass in this particular region of Vegas, which is known for its arid climate. Subsequently, the management opted to seek assistance from the team at Rhodes Ranch, who took over the course's maintenance and transformed it into a thriving and lush landscape.

Notably, a significant portion of the pieces available for purchase have fallen within a price range that is accessible to art enthusiasts who do not possess an extensive collection or substantial financial resources. This aspect of Trifecta's offerings stands out as particularly refreshing, given the tendency of some art venues to prioritize exorbitant prices over the cultivation of a broader appreciation for the arts.  

My most recent visit to Trifecta coincided with the unveiling of a photography exhibition featuring images captured in Las Vegas and Nevada, which complemented the Focus on Nevada spread in the current issue of Desert Companion. Notably, one of my closest acquaintances, Anthony M., was selected as a participant in the contest associated with the event. As a steadfast supporter of my friends' creative endeavors, I felt compelled to attend and experience the exhibition firsthand.

In light of these observations, I wholeheartedly endorse immersing oneself in the artistic ambiance of the Arts Factory, dedicating sufficient time to explore its diverse offerings, and culminating the excursion with a visit to Trifecta. By doing so, one can foster a deeper appreciation for the burgeoning cultural landscape that permeates this vibrant street.

However, be prepared to pay an additional fee of a few dollars per drink to receive an augmented quantity of floral garnishes for each member of your group.

Large rolls, such as the incredible Las Vegas Roll and perhaps the shrimp tempura, are priced at $7, while fundamental rolls, like spicy tuna, are $4, and I believe nigari is $3. Hot sake costs $1, substantial Kirin beers are roughly $3, and their mixed drinks vary in price but rarely impress.

On that particular night, I placed an order for two rolls (the Tootsy Maki is consistently a victor if one has an affinity for eel sauce) and a delectable Albacore appetizer, which amounted to a total of $19 on my tab.

Specifically, we purchased a whole grilled chicken, a large fresh fruit salad, and an extensive vegetable juice consisting of beets, carrots, apples, and celery, all for a total of sixteen dollars, which is remarkably reasonable considering the substantial savings compared to the equivalent items at Whole Foods, which would have amounted to at least thirty dollars.

A couple of bartenders there to keep it moving. \n\nThe sound is good, but the thing I like most is that while it is overall very roomy, it is also a venue where you can get up close to the performers.  I would recommend seeing a show here. Most are about $20 and tickets are easily purchased online. They have a web site, but the videos and photos show they are not always updated.

The eatery boasts an inviting outdoor seating area, which we took advantage of to bask in the sunlight. However, the interior of the restaurant felt rather chilly during our visit.

Additionally, as a participant in the Hawaiian Miles Mall program, I am able to take advantage of complimentary shipping on the website for any orders that surpass a total value of $50. However, I must admit that I refrain from shopping at this location when the prices are at their standard level, as they tend to be somewhat elevated. Instead, I opt to visit this store on a few select occasions throughout the year, typically coinciding with significant sales events. During these times, I make bulk purchases of items that I can then present as gifts to my female acquaintances; thus, ensuring that I maintain a steady supply of presents throughout the year. This strategy also enables me to capitalize on other special offers, such as the ""Buy 2 - get 1 free"" promotion, of which I remain informed thanks to my membership in the store's email club. My affection for this store is largely attributed to its diverse array of Body Butter products, including but not limited to mango, coconut, shea butter, vitamin E, cocoa butter, raspberry, and several others that, while frequently imitated, fail to compare to the authentic version. Furthermore, I greatly appreciate the wide selection of gift items available, which eliminates the need for extensive deliberation when seeking a suitable present. Lastly, the foot kits offered by this store serve as both practical gifts and personal indulgences. It is worth mentioning that this specific storefront is situated within the Miracle Mile Shops at the Planet Hollywood casino/hotel, and while I have not had the pleasure of discovering many remarkable deals during sale periods in recent years, I attribute this to the increased exposure to tourists in the area.

Located south of the famed Las Vegas Strip, this venue primarily caters to local patrons, thus making it a veritable gem for those seeking an authentic experience untainted by the glitz and glamour associated with tourist hotspots.

This is a review of the food court:

In the Greenland Supermarket food court, there are various culinary establishments that offer an array of international cuisines. Specifically, there is a Hawaiian eatery, a sushi bar, two Korean food stalls, a tofu-based casserole vendor (which I am hesitant to try due to its unappealing description), and a coffee shop that serves Boba but frequently runs out of stock. 

While I wish the Hawaiian restaurant served lumpia and Portuguese donuts, the spam musubi was quite delectable. The sushi bar offers reasonably priced options, with two nigiri available for $1.99, amounting to ten nigiri for $10. Additionally, I decided to venture out and sample Korean cuisine for the first time at this location, merely for the sake of novelty. I had a kim-chee and meat-filled bun, which has a unique flavor profile that requires some acclimation. Although it tastes good initially, the aftertaste is somewhat peculiar. 

In conclusion, my dining experience at this food court was generally satisfying. While I would appreciate a broader range of options (perhaps a Vietnamese booth or additional selections at the Hawaiian eatery), I will undoubtedly return.",True,3676.0,formal

Specifically, the seating areas are often stained and appear unkempt, giving the impression of neglect in terms of upkeep and maintenance.

We augmented the flavor by incorporating a few red chilies and adjusting the seasoning to our individual preferences. Extremely palatable, indeed. As a native of the Seattle region, I have had the privilege of sampling a variety of exceptional Thai cuisine, and this particular experience ranks among the most enjoyable thus far in my quest for the quintessential phad thai. I would unquestionably consider returning to this venue, while maintaining a steadfast optimism that even more superlative culinary experiences await my discovery.""",True,3742.0,formal

Fortuitously, we arrived prior to the onset of peak hours, thereby ensuring a more tranquil ambiance. Two of our party members opted for the iced tea, which unfortunately lacked depth of flavor and appeared somewhat diluted.

Myriad pancakes were sampled, including the cinnamon-infused variety, carrot, red velvet, and whole wheat options. A subjective ranking of these selections, from most preferred to least, would be: cinnamon, carrot, red velvet, and wheat.

The cinnamon-flavored pancakes delighted our taste buds with their satisfying blend of sweetness and savory undertones. These pancakes are unquestionably recommended. In contrast, the carrot pancake failed to showcase its namesake's distinct flavor, instead boasting a subtle, almost negligible essence that barely distinguished it from its wheat counterpart. The red velvet iteration suffered from an unfortunate dryness, further compromised by an overpowering sugar syrup that eclipsed the inherent flavor profile.

The cowboy omelet, while adequate, could benefit from several adjustments. Specifically, a more delicate cooking method for the eggs would result in a less rubbery texture, while a slight reduction in doneness for the vegetables would enhance their natural sweetness. The fried potatoes, although unremarkable in terms of saltiness, avoided the unpleasantness of excessive crispiness.

A rating of 3.5 stars seems appropriate for this venue, considering the generally satisfactory quality of the food and generous portion sizes. Notwithstanding some minor missteps, we would still consider revisiting this establishment to sample other menu items, particularly their French toast and alternative egg dishes. Our server provided commendable assistance throughout our visit.",True,3743.0,formal
4," I believe this establishment merits a rating between 4 and 4.5 stars, taking into account its novelty and exceptional service. The culinary offerings provide remarkable value for the price (approximately $45 per person), and the wine selection ranges from affordable options priced around $30 to more extravagant selections costing hundreds of dollars. Although the restaurant does not identify itself as a buffet, the format somewhat resembles one, commencing with a limitless salad bar that surprisingly features an assortment of cold cuts, cheeses, cured meats, smoked salmon, and soups in addition to an array of leafy greens. Upon request, the staff will subsequently present a variety of meats, including filet mignon (which they may be reluctant to serve), mouthwatering ribs, and lamb with a subtle gamey flavor. It is advisable to avoid the chicken dishes, as they pale in comparison to the other superior meat options available. Furthermore, it is essential to take your time while dining, as hastily consuming large quantities of food can lead to discomfort, despite any initial enthusiasm displayed by the servers. Overall, this restaurant provides a pleasurable experience that justifies repetition.",True,3745.0,formal
4," I have been a resident of the surrounding area for an extensive period of time and have had a strong desire to partake in a culinary excursion to this establishment for quite some time. In light of this, I decided to treat a close acquaintance to a celebratory dinner at this venue last week. Upon arriving, we were greeted by an accommodating hostess who showed us to our table in a prompt and efficient manner. Our server, who was attentive and knowledgeable, presented us with menus and offered recommendations when asked. It is worth mentioning that the service we received throughout the evening was of a high caliber. When we discovered that the bottle of wine we had selected was unavailable, our server graciously offered a suitable alternative at the same price, which we greatly appreciated.  

The initial course of our meal, consisting of corn cakes accompanied by pulled pork, proved to be the standout dish of the evening. The flavors and textures were expertly balanced, making for a truly satisfying experience. Additionally, the Arcadia Salad we ordered was also quite palatable. However, as a native of New Mexico with a deep affection for green chile, I must admit that the green chile Mac n Cheese fell slightly short of my expectations. Although the ribs were cooked to an acceptable level of tenderness, they failed to meet the standard of falling off the bone, which was a minor disappointment.  

In terms of the ambiance, we found the spaciousness and open layout of the restaurant to be quite pleasing. However, we did find the musical selection to be somewhat discordant with the overall atmosphere. While I understand that music is a subjective matter, I firmly believe that it plays a crucial role in establishing a truly exceptional dining environment. In this case, the music seemed incongruous with the restaurant's ambiance, and I cannot help but feel that a more avant-garde or sophisticated musical selection would better complement the atmosphere.  

Despite these minor drawbacks, I remain a proponent of this establishment and commend its efforts to create a unique and enjoyable dining experience.",True,3746.0,formal

Our visit proved to be particularly educational, as we gained insight into the intricacies of the show's production and were informed that had we arrived earlier, we could have potentially been selected as extras for the day's filming. It is worth noting that the gentlemen who work at the shop are typically present from Monday to Friday, between the hours of 9 am and 3 pm. However, they tend to remain in the rear of the building, thus avoiding the throngs of enthusiastic spectators who frequent the shop daily. For those aspiring to appear on television, it is crucial to possess an item of sufficient interest to warrant its display on the program, as well as the charm and persuasiveness necessary to navigate the show's rigorous selection process. Alternatively, arriving early enough to serve as an extra on a day when filming is taking place can also prove rewarding. Although the shop offered various tourist-oriented items, I felt no shame in acquiring a Pawn Stars t-shirt, and I derived immense satisfaction from doing so. The shop itself was not particularly extensive, yet I found the assortment of memorabilia to be captivating, and I was further entertained by the staff's recounting of anecdotes regarding the acquisition of specific items, which mirrored the experience of watching the program from the comfort of my own home.

However, circumstances led me to reassess my culinary preferences, as I found myself entering the doors of a Carl's Jr, not merely to grab a quick bite or utilize their drive-thru service, but to partake in a full-fledged dining experience. To my surprise, the ambiance was rather pleasant, with three televisions strategically positioned throughout the restaurant, each broadcasting a unique ESPN channel. Furthermore, my expectations were surpassed by the quality and generous portion size of the chicken salad I ordered, which, accompanied by a refreshing Squirt beverage, left me feeling satiated and impressed. 

Additionally, the attentive service provided by the staff was evident in the prompt refills offered, leaving me slightly perplexed regarding the protocol for gratuity. Nonetheless, we chose to leave a dollar as a token of appreciation, despite the uncertainty surrounding its necessity.

The presentation was also quite impressive, as it arrived on its own plate. The menu offered an extensive array of options, which led to a state of utter bewilderment, as we desired to sample every item listed. In order to experience a variety of flavors, a friend and I opted to share several dishes. We began with the Snickers pancake, which, despite being singular in nature, proved to be a culinary masterpiece, measuring a generous 12 inches in width. Its taste was nothing short of exquisite. Our second selection was the Fried Chicken and Waffles, infused with bacon slices, which can only be described as a gastronomic indulgence. While it may have been a tad unhealthy, it was nonetheless an incredibly satisfying experience. Finally, we sampled the Hash dish, which featured grilled chicken, asparagus, sundried tomatoes, homestyle potatoes, two eggs, and a fresh biscuit. Although somewhat healthier than the other options, it was still delightfully flavorful, with the accompanying marmalade serving as the perfect complement.

Upon entering the restaurant, I was greeted with an enthusiastic round of applause from one of the chefs, which I reciprocated in kind, albeit with a hint of bemusement.  
The ambiance of Ru San's is decidedly casual, and the prices are similarly unassuming, with a sum of $10 granting access to a seemingly endless array of sushi options. For those with hearty appetites, this represents an unparalleled value, as two modest rolls could easily surpass that cost at other establishments. While the sushi served at Ru San's may be described as 'Americanized,' it is undeniably delectable. Notwithstanding the potential health implications, the deep-fried sushi is a singular delight.  
To ensure optimal freshness, the sushi plates are meticulously labeled with time markers, and while the sushi often vanishes before the designated time elapses, this speaks volumes about its quality. Ru San's will persistently hold a place in my rotation of preferred local sushi haunts.

The pork belly, on the other hand, boasted a crispy exterior and an interior texture that was cooked to perfection. Avoidance of overcooking or undercooking pork belly is crucial, as it can result in an unpleasant chewy, rubbery, or fatty consistency.

In-N-Out, in my opinion, holds the dubious distinction of being the most egregiously overhyped establishment within the realm of fast food. I am thoroughly baffled by the underlying factors responsible for such an unmerited reputation, as the patties served at In-N-Out are characterized by an unfortunate lack of substance, the cheese is merely serviceable, and the fries are utterly forgettable. While the flavor profile of the burger itself may be passable, it falls short of the lofty standards set by other prominent players in the industry, such as Whataburger, which, in my estimation, handily outstrips In-N-Out in terms of overall excellence. On the other hand, Lenny's boasts patties that are genuinely beefy in nature (a playful pun, if you will), accompanied by cheese that is respectably adequate and fries that are exponentially superior to those offered by In-N-Out. Although Lenny's may not lay claim to the title of premier burger joint in the vicinity, it unquestionably outclasses In-N-Out in a multitude of aspects.",True,3947.0,formal

The staff members, ranging from the front desk personnel (with whom I have had the pleasure of interacting, specifically Ramon) to the skilled technicians, have consistently displayed a high level of professionalism and courtesy towards me. Of note, I have previously owned a BMW M6, which was regularly serviced by German Motors, and I have been consistently impressed by their competitive pricing and efficient turnaround time; on one occasion, they even went above and beyond by inspecting my vehicle's brakes (a task that would have otherwise required an extensive and costly repair estimate) at no additional charge to me, and I felt compelled to express my gratitude by treating the team to lunch (a modest gesture of appreciation totaling $50). Most recently, I brought my 1967 Mustang in for a routine brake bleeding and air conditioning recharge (a process requiring several hours of labor), and my final bill amounted to a mere $330, inclusive of taxes. Frankly, it is challenging to find better value for money elsewhere. Furthermore, the staff has consistently demonstrated exceptional customer service by providing complimentary transportation to and from my residence (a generous offer that warrants a gratuity of $5-$10, in my opinion) whenever I am without my vehicle.

As individuals who reside in urban areas, we tend to exhibit an inherent aversion to waiting; nevertheless, the exceptional quality of the coffee served at this establishment persuades us to defy our innate inclinations and patiently endure the delay. In light of the fact that I reside in Tempe and work in Central Phoenix, I typically frequent this coffeebar before work, capitalizing on the brief periods of time I can allocate for personal activities. Upon entering the premises, I am immediately struck by the modern ambiance and sleek designer furniture, which fosters an atmosphere conducive to productivity and relaxation. Occasionally, securing a seat can prove to be a minor challenge, particularly when the weather is inclement and the outdoor seating area is less appealing. However, such instances are rare and do not detract from the overall enjoyment of my experience. 

My preferences are relatively simple, and I habitually opt for a non-fat latte, allowing the rich, roasted flavor of the coffee to take center stage without any additional embellishments. Furthermore, I must confess that the tattoos, piercings, and fashion choices exhibited by certain members of the staff create a sense of familiarity and comfort for me. The establishment's commitment to supporting local artisans and adopting environmentally responsible practices only serves to augment my admiration for them. In conclusion, LUX coffeebar has secured a special place in my heart.""",True,4147.0,formal

During a recent visit to Las Vegas, a group of acquaintances and I decided to venture to the nearest location of a well-known alcoholic beverage franchise, which we believed to be situated within the Planet Hollywood complex. However, upon arriving at the destination, we discovered that the closest branch was actually located within the Caesar's Forum Shops. Notwithstanding this minor inconvenience, I opted to sample a beverage consisting of a 190 Octane and Hurricane mixture, which was served in a tall container. Upon consuming approximately two inches of the drink, I began to feel quite content.  
The bartender proved to be a valuable asset, as he offered various blends to my associates. Specifically, he recommended a concoction known as a ""midnight kiss,"" which consisted of a Bellini and strawberry mixture. This particular combination elicited a highly favorable response from those who partook of it, including myself. Moreover, the cost of these potent beverages was surprisingly reasonable, particularly given the generous refills that were available. Thus, I felt compelled to advise others to retain their cups, as the value offered was indeed impressive.

Upon being seated, we opted for two glasses of Cabernet, a superior quality wine that proved to be an excellent beginning to our delectable journey. Subsequently, we relished a fresh mozzarella dish accompanied by heirloom tomatoes, which was further enhanced by a touch of coarse salt and balsamic, thus rendering it utterly scrumptious. Additionally, we sampled a chopped salad adorned with a modicum of cheese, salami, and a remarkably flavorful vinaigrette; although I am not typically a devotee of salads, this particular creation tasted unquestionably fresh and warranted high praise. Furthermore, we ordered a salad dressed with balsamic, which, despite not being as exceptional as its chopped counterpart, remained palatable and satisfying.

Moreover, we relished a half-portion of fresh pasta, skillfully prepared with Parmesan, zucchini, and tomatoes, thereby constituting the ideal quantity for a lighter repast. Notwithstanding my initial concerns regarding the potential heaviness of pasta as a late supper option, the smaller serving size proved to be a judicious decision.

Our culinary excursion continued with an order of skirt steak, which regrettably did not meet the same lofty standards as the preceding dishes, primarily due to the fact that the balsamic component, which was the third instance of this flavor profile throughout the meal, seemed somewhat superfluous and detracted from the overall quality of the dish. Nevertheless, the meat was cooked flawlessly, and its generous portion made up for any deficiencies. Lastly, we indulged in a delightful tiramisu and paired it with expertly brewed French press coffee and cappuccino, both of which demonstrated the establishment's commitment to excellence in beverage preparation.

In conclusion, our dining experience at this meticulously appointed restaurant was truly outstanding, and the judicious selection of dishes allowed us to sample a diverse array of flavors from the menu.

The Patio, specifically during the spring and fall seasons, is a highly sought-after reservation, one that demands a call be made several days in advance in order to secure a table.  

My personal preference is to partake in the culinary delights offered by Lon's on Sunday evenings, when they typically offer a price fixe menu that features an array of mouthwatering meats, including, but not limited to, entire pigs slowly roasting on a spit, the aroma of which wafts through the air, tantalizing the senses and heightening anticipation. Saturday evenings, on the other hand, offer a live band, providing the perfect ambiance for an enjoyable dinner. 

In the event that the Patio area is occupied and we find ourselves without a reservation, we take great pleasure in dining at the bar, where the friendly bartenders expertly craft an array of refreshing cocktails certain to satiate our thirst and complement the exquisite fare.

Therefore, please take my opinions with a grain of salt, as they are inherently subjective and potentially lacking in comprehensive insight.)

Notwithstanding the aforementioned disclaimer, I must confess that the Ivory Room holds a special place in my heart as my unwavering favorite among the plethora of watering holes I have had the pleasure of patronizing. Following their recent expansion, the venue now boasts an even more spacious area dedicated to patrons who wish to indulge in vigorous dance sessionsâan amenity that I personally find most appealing. For those seeking an unbridled, exhilarating experience replete with merriment and camaraderie, I wholeheartedly recommend partaking in the Dueling Piano nights, which take place every Thursday through Saturday evening. Although a nominal cover charge of $5 is levied upon entry (albeit, astute patrons may circumvent this fee by first visiting Capital Tap Haus and presenting their receipt as proof of prior patronage), I assure you that the entertainment afforded by the dueling pianists and the ensuing communal sing-alongs will prove well worth the pecuniary investment.

Furthermore, I would be remiss were I not to extol the virtues of their potent yet refreshing $3 sweet tea vodka lemonade, best savored during the prime hours of Friday and Saturday nights. Be forewarned, however, that the cacophony of melodic revelry may reach such heights that you risk sacrificing your vocal faculties in the process; nonetheless, I can confidently attest that the experience will leave you utterly bereft of regret.

In light of the fact that my interactions with the staff and service at the Ivory Room have been cursory at best, I feel unqualified to comment on the criticisms leveled against them by others. Notwithstanding, my affection for this establishment endures, and I eagerly anticipate the prospect of revisiting it on numerous future occasions.",True,4340.0,formal

When was the last time you consumed anchovies, you might ask? The comedian has been the main attraction in Las Vegas since 2005, which suggests that there must be a factor contributing to his capacity to maintain a prolonged run on the strip and fill seats in the auditorium. Numerous headline comedians have appeared and disappeared during this period. Initially, they performed at the Excalibur before moving on to The Plaza and eventually receiving a one-way ticket to Laughlin.  
I must admit that I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the performance. Carrot Top began the show at a breakneck pace, transitioning rapidly from one prop joke to another. If you didn't find a particular joke amusing, it wasn't a cause for concern, as another one followed closely behind, every five seconds or so. It was almost as if I was observing a highly energetic and humorous five-year-old displaying their collection of toys. Absolutely side-splitting! The remainder of the show maintained the same level of excellence. You will undoubtedly experience extensive laughter and have a memorable time, provided you are not easily offended by vulgar humor.

However, what truly set this dining establishment apart from others was the exceptional quality of the service provided by the staff, which was undoubtedly the friendliest and most hospitable that we encountered throughout our stay in the city. So much so, that we felt compelled to return for a second evening of feasting, such was our immense satisfaction with the culinary delights offered by this esteemed eatery. As a matter of fact, the staff's warmth and welcoming nature filled me with a profound sense of pride in my cultural heritage. Furthermore, the corned beef and cabbage, as well as the fish and chips, were nothing short of spectacular, boasting flavors that were simply unparalleled. In light of our unfortunate experiences at two other restaurants, where we were disappointed by either subpar service or unimpressive fare at exorbitant prices, discovering this hidden gem was truly a blessing in disguise. Thus, I would enthusiastically endorse and recommend this particular establishment, as well as any other similar establishments situated on the eastern coast, particularly those in Maine and New Hampshire, to anyone seeking a genuinely delightful dining experience.

In all seriousness, you would be remiss not to sample the wares of Mercurio's, for they are truly exceptional. Furthermore, the staff here are incredibly cordial, and it is gratifying to note that this is a family-owned and operated enterprise.
