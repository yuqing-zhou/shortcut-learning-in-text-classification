1,"Some orders are too small!\nI recommended Freed's Bakery because the cakes and customer service was superior. We drove in from California just for the cake tasting and deposits. To my surprise the customer service was lacking tremendously. The bride to be was scheduled but was not given an agent.  When the bride mention; 20 guess, it was worst. The agent had the audacity to ask if she would like to taste the cake. I assumed if you're scheduled for a cake tasting appointment, cake would be included. The agent came back with a dot of cake, butter cream frosting, and two types of fillings. What a joke.\nI had plans to order my anniversary cake (200 guess) during the wedding sitting. Well we both decided not to do business with Freed's Bakery. We contacted Hansen Bakery in Los Angeles. I must say Hansen appreciated our business. Freed's don't even deserve a star..",,,informal

Each ride is $3 to $5 per person or $10 for all day access to bounce houses!\n2. Most places charge $9 to $15 for items. ($9 for a sausage and pepper hoagie)\n3. The layout is horrible and clustered.\n4. Some of the vendors don't belong there. (Scientology, politicos, sports teams bathing suites, a petting zoo)\n5. The majority of the vendors were serving the same damn thing.\n6. The BEST food was from a little place called FAT NINJA and it wasn't Italian at all.\n7. The talent wasn't really talent. (Although the little girls singing Sunday afternoon were so dang cute!)\n8. There was no festivities or anything celebratory.\n9. There was nothing really Italian about it.\n\nI really did enjoy spending with my friend, her son, and my sister. Very disappointed.",,,informal
1,"45 minutes and nothing more than bread, water and drinks that we bought from the bar before being seated. Somehow our ticket was lost. About 25 minutes in, the manager came over to retake our order. Not much of an apology was given, offered to comp one of the dishes after we inquired. The server was awful. In the 45 minutes we were there, she stopped by twice to check in, only after another server overheard us complaining about the service. \n\nSo much for having a hearty meal before an evening of boozing. We ordered pizza instead from another place. \n\nThe manager couldn't give us an ETA on our food so after 45 minutes, we left.\n\nGood bread, horrible service.",,,informal
1,I decided to give these guys another chance and I'm sad to say that they have lost my business forever. I made an appointment online several days in advance for 12:00pm to have an alignment done. I drove all the way down there and the guy took all of my information and then when I said it was for an alignment he said they had no power and that they couldn't do it. Why wouldn't someone call me instead of making me drive  there?! Bad business. I decided to bring my car to Brake Masters instead and not only were they professional...they were $10 cheaper!,,,informal
1,If I could do 0 stars I would. Took 45 minutes to bring 3 sandwiches when they weren't even busy. Then my appetizer that I was having as my meal came 25 minutes later. 2 of the orders were wrong and you can tell that food was left under a heat lamp for a while. There was no reason for the food to take as long as it did there was no food coming out of the kitchen prior to ours. It was ridiculous! I used to love this place but not anymore!,,,informal

1,"RUSHED OUT THE DOOR:  My wife and I invited some friends to this restaurant.  At first appearance, the service appeared to be genuinely good, but then it showed its true colors.  The Mustard Barbecue Beef Ribs were so burnt that when we called back the waiter, he recognized this before we even said anything and took it back.  We were brought the check without requesting it and without being offered dessert. As soon as we finished dessert, our water glasses and napkins were removed.  When I asked--tongue in cheek--if it was because he wanted us to leave, he said \""yes\"" just loud enough for us to hear.

Did I say it's a bar in a supermarket complex?\n\nI was to meet some co-workers here tonight, my first time out socializing in Scottsdale.

Instead, I was greeted by gas stations, a CVS Pharmacy, a crowded parking lot (with, oooh!, valet parking!), and a long line to get in.\n\nWhen I got to the front of the line, I was carded.  No problem with that.  Then the bouncer got a whiff of my god awful sneakers and kicked me to the curb.  Are you kidding?  A supermarket bar with a no-sneakers policy?  \""Heavens forbid we allow any riff-raff in our fine establishment!\"" had half a mind to put up a real stink, but instead called my friend inside and had a loud-mouthed ranting conversation with him about the idiot policy, while the other line-standers looked at me uncomfortably.\n\nI should just stay in Tempe and party with my students...",,,informal

1,"Besides its convenient location near ASU, this place has nothing going for it. My roommates and I would constantly be told the wrong amount of rent that was due. Even though we paid on time every month, we were constantly getting charged late fees. The appliances were terrible, the disposal in the sink never worked even after the \""maintenance\"" came to fix it, which in turn caused the apartment to have a stench. The air conditioner also dripped, which was a lot of fun when they couldn't fix it.\n\nAgain, their excuse for bookkeeping is terrible. While my roommates and I have been moved out for about a month now, we are just now getting charged almost $1,000 for unspecified charges, including the aforementioned \""late charges\"" that we shouldn't have been charged but were because they apparently didn't pass 4th grade math. We paid them anyway because we wanted to be done with this awful place, but they are still saying we didn't pay them. Evidently they just want to drain you of every dollar that you have because they can't keep it straight. We couldn't get out of there fast enough!!\n\nDO NOT LIVE HERE.

Re doing my review. \n\nCheck in I wasn't told that detail takes on average witch I find hard to be figure out why yes detail is hard work but in Phx where there are alot of guys on detail line crew. This took 2 1/2 hours. I was not told anytime when I signed up for it. So here I am waiting over 2 hours getting pissed due to fact my car came out fast and thought it was ready. The one person that did care was the person who rang me up. I didn't catch his name, but the second time he came outside to talk witch was close to the 2 hour point I was a little pissed and I think he saw. Offered to get the \"" so called manager\"" I explained to him that I waited 2 hours without a time. His come back that he would explain to staff to tell customers. He didn't offer any offers like half off car wash etc. since we live in the area and use there services all the time. I felt bad for detail line. They had 3 guys on shift Monday  full bay plus some yahoo wanted to detail a buss so took 2 guys off the line and left 1 guy. I would of pushed the card out of your bay first then detail the buss I personally won't be back. Not even a percent off next service meh.",,,informal

When I picked him up, his nails were bleeding and I wasn't informed that he was bleeding. I didn't notice until we got home and there was blood all over the carpet and couch. His haircut looked super uneven and it was only $10 cheaper than Petsmart.

I wouldn't mind the bleeding so much if they had informed me and maybe apologized but nope...nothing.",,,informal

1,"I really enjoyed the food and ambiance of the restaurant and initially thought the waiter was great and very helpful. My problem with the restaurant came five days later when I was reconciling my credit card statement. For the meal I charged my credit card, and left a very generous cash tip of 25%. On the credit card statement I left zero on the tip line, and the total of the meal was entered in the total line. When the charge came through on my credit card, mysteriously the bill had gone up $10. I immediately informed the manager of the error which he was able to resolve; however he stated that the way I wrote a dollar sign and zero may have been confusing. My problem with this is that the total was clearly written and with the cash tip the waiter \""mistakenly\"" thought his service was worth a 42% tip?!?! Are you kidding me?! A word of advice, either pay cash or save your receipt!",,,informal

That was cool, nice fresh change from Filiberto's, and all the other wonderful greasy Mexican places.  Then a few years ago we got Chipotle.  And it was fun for awhile, but eventually you get sick of eating the same rice-saturated burrito over and over and over again.  Now we also have Qdoba, Costa Vida, Cafe Rio, and a few other places.\n\nI wish I could avoid eating at all these places for the rest of my life, but alas, sometimes I find myself there, choking down this tedious slop, because all my friends like this kind of food, and I like to be sociable (on rare occasions).  Or, as in the situation that brought me to Cafe Rio, it's where the family is having dinner.\n\nAnyways, I had their \""special\"" pork barbecoa (or whatever they call it), and it was pedestrian, at best.  It did not taste natural; sorry, guys, but pork is not supposed to be sweet.  It's supposed to be nice and smoky.  It's supposed to taste like meat.\n\nThis place is the epitome of the worst aspects of disposable American culture.  No heart, no soul, and large portions.

She said it will be good for my dry feet. I agreed because my usual salon includes it. I was asked if I wanted a manicure. I said no. She was persistent saying it would only be $10.00 extra so I agreed. It was barely anything except for the cut on my finger that bleed for an hour and still looks bad a day later. She cut my cuticles, rubbed some lotion very hard on my hands and forearms, barely buffed my nails (not to a shine) and that was it.

Took us about 30 minutes to get the appetizer.  When I saw food going to another party that came in after us(about 15 minutes later), with more people, I asked our waitress why they were getting food before us.  She argued with me that there was no food on or going to that table.  Three times I told her I saw it with my own eyes.  Finally she came back and said it was because we ordered an appetizer.  It was another 10 minutes before our food started coming out.  Once the error was recognized on my daughters plate, it was another 8 or so minutes before hers came out.  \n\nWe got there at 7:30 but did not walk out the door until 8:50 pm.

I really thought that Bon Chef Cafe had the worst Lobster Bisque I ever had, but Cafe Zupas topped them. I suggest the owners go try Ventano's Lobster Bisque, so they know what real Lobster Bisque tastes like.\n\nThe salad I picked was Chopped chicken salad. If there was an ounce of meat in this I would be surprised, also got it with Blue Cheese dressing, again if there was an ounce of dressing on it I would be surprised, flavorless salad and vegetable soup is not what I ordered, but it is what I received.  \n\nFinally with this fabulous meal, we received Bread and what they call Chocolate dipped Strawberries. The bread is like a thick slice of Wonder Bread. The Chocolate dipped strawberries are dipped on one side, but once you try it you are glad they didn't cover the whole strawberry in that cheap waxy chocolate.",,,informal

Billing was a nightmare and you should consider this before becoming a patient.\n\nI received one statement after my insurance paid its portion. It showed a balance that did not make sense, so I called and left a message requesting more information. Instead of replying, they turned the roughly $30 bill over to a collection agency a few days later. Yes, that's right. One statement showing a current amount was turned over for collection.\n\nI requested information via the collection agency, since I had records of payments made for the items turned over for collection, and the Hand Center billing office refused to provide back up material. Since the collection agency said they would report this to the credit bureaus (despite it appearing to be a bogus claim for which no documentation was provided) I ended up paying.\n\nI see there is also a complaint filed with the Better Business Bureau for billing problems with the Hand Center.

The music is soooo loud, you cannot hear the person next to you. \n\nThis place is another lame attempt of a trendy sushi restaurant. The selection of sushi is disgusting. I do not know how the came up with their menu. Maybe they drew ingredients out of a hat and decided to roll it up in rice and seaweed. \n\nThe one thing I was looking forward to was the Cinnamon Tempura Ice Cream. This dessert was the biggest let down. The raspberry glaze they cover it with is the nastiest thing I have ever tasted. It was so bitter. It made the whole dessert inedible. \n\nI will never be back to this location or any of their other ones. I have no idea how they stay in business or open new locations.",,,informal

This is what Ceasar's Palace should do to the chefs that work on this buffet.\n\nThe pork chops and prime rib were dried out and inedible. The apple that I tried was old with that brown stuff inside.

However, it is imperative to note that the range check-in staff seems to be the primary source of dissatisfaction among patrons. Specifically, we were informed that only a single lane was accessible, resulting in an extensive delay. Upon observing that the adjacent lanes remained unoccupied for the duration of our visit, I decided to bring this to the attention of the staff. Unfortunately, my attempt at communicating this discrepancy was met with a dismissive and irritated response. It appeared that the staff member was reluctant to acknowledge the fact that the lanes in question were, in reality, unutilized. This exchange left an unfavorable impression, insinuating that the staff may be intentionally prolonging wait times. Throughout our stay, four of the eight available lanes in our vicinity remained unused, neither damaged nor malfunctioning. Therefore, it is advisable for future visitors to press the staff regarding lane availability and refrain from tolerating unnecessary delays.

2," ""While the experience was not optimal, I may consider giving it another attempt. Allow me to elaborate: upon entering the establishment, I endeavored to peruse the menu, which was positioned at an uncomfortably close proximity to my visage, parallel to the wall. Following a brief examination, I managed to identify an item that piqued my interest. Consequently, I placed an order for a bratwurst, accompanied by various toppings, as well as several children's meals. It is worth noting that the children's meal advertised the inclusion of a hot dog, potato chips, and a carbonated beverage. Upon inquiring about the supplementary sides accompanying the children's meal, the manager displayed a discernible level of irritation at my apparent lack of comprehension regarding the operational dynamics of the eatery. His response, delivered with a perceptible sigh, was: 'Everything here is Ã  la carte.' This elicited a degree of curiosity on my part, as the menu failed to adequately convey this information. Specifically, I pondered whether additional toppings, such as onions, would incur an extra charge. However, I chose not to pursue this line of inquiry further, given the manager's dismissive demeanor. 

It is worth mentioning that both the French fries and tater tots were prepared using a baking process, which unfortunately did not yield the most palatable results. The bratwurst itself, priced at approximately $7, seemed somewhat steep for a product that had been pre-cooked and merely reheated in a bun. Nonetheless, the flavor profile was satisfactory, and the establishment boasts an extensive selection of sausages. Thus, I may opt to give it another chance. My sole recommendation would be for the staff to refrain from exhibiting condescending behavior towards patrons who are spending a considerable amount of money, particularly during the early stages of operation. A total of $12 for a bratwurst, fries, and soft drink (Pepsi being the lone option, much to my dismay) strikes me as rather exorbitant.

Spring rolls they were alright nothing special. Pork meatballs very tasty just two skewers and a garden load of veges and herbs. It was like I ordered a BBQ meatball salad. They serve it with rice paper wraps on the side that r hard( WTF ) maybe I missed something ? Give me some water so I can soften it up myself,  I also ordered the BBQ pork bowl or I thought I did. I got the same set up as the BBQ meatball , shit load of lettuce and herbs and some BBQ pork and what looked and tasted like 2 slider patties? The meats are very tasty but the meat portions r small. They serve alot of lettuce and herbs, I mean alot of it  \n            The food taste good, it's jus that the meat to lettuce ratio has to change , if I were rabbit I would b happy.

2,"This place boasts of being a \""traditional British pub,\"" and in the short time it took the new owners to convert this former Italian caf\u00e9, they have undoubtedly gone to lengths to make it look the part! \n\nI will say this though: I found the price of drinks to be more than a little bit cheeky. $8.50 for a pint of generic import beer (Newcastle, Sapporo, Carlsberg) is a bit rich! Are you having a laugh?! \n\nThey did have Murphy's Irish stout, which you don't see elsewhere too often, but even then it tasted a bit off. After paying $27 (tip included - we're not REALLY in England) for 3 pints, any illusion I had of being in a traditional British pub fell by the wayside. \n\nNo thanks, I'd much rather drink pints of cheaper and fresher tasting local beer a few blocks away at Dieu Du Ciel. \n\nI can't speak to the quality of the food because I did not eat, but my companion said the homemade egg noodles and roasted eggplant ragout was tasty. It definitely looked and smelled very appetizing! The menu had some good looking choices. Apart from the Ploughman's Lunch for $13, it's not close to your typical traditional pub fare - but then again we are in Montreal so it's predictable that menus and ingredients skew towards high end and somewhat showy. \n\nAll in all, just a bit off the mark, but the after-work Ubisoft crowd will love it!",,,informal

  Lastly, we opted for the advertised fresh live fish, which on this particular day was sea bass. We chose to have it steamed, and while it was indeed fresh and succulent, it fell short of our expectations regarding the serving size, as we received fillets instead of a whole fish.

3," We hailed a taxi and proceeded to Del Frisco's, whereupon arrival, we discovered an ambiance that exuded a certain je ne sais quoi of yesteryear, evoking a sense of nostalgia, yet lacking the elegance and refinement synonymous with a high-end Chicago steakhouse. Instead, the establishment seemed to embrace a more relaxed, come-as-you-are ethos. Notwithstanding our initial reservations, the meticulously crafted martini and generous pour left us feeling suitably impressed.  

My penchant for aesthetic appeal, however, was momentarily perturbed by the discovery that the salad fork and dinner fork shared an unsettling similarity in dimensions. Admittedly, I harbor an unconventional fondness for oversized utensils, particularly when indulging in a $50 steak. The cognitive dissonance notwithstanding, we pressed onward, eager to sample the culinary delights that Del Frisco's had to offer.  

The crab appetizer, while perhaps not the most visually stunning, proved to be a satisfying delight for those who relish the combination of succulent crab meat and copious amounts of Old Bay seasoning. As a connoisseur of fine cuisine from the wine country, I must confess that my expectations were only partially met, as the dish, though palatable, failed to ascend to the lofty heights of true gastronomic excellence.  

Moving on to the Wedge salad, adorned with a tangy blue cheese dressing, we encountered a dish that, when expertly prepared, can ascend to the realm of the sublime. Alas, the lettuce, soggy and bereft of structural integrity, caused the dressing and accompanying elements to devolve into an unappetizing mush, thereby diminishing our enjoyment.  

Fortunately, the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance, the steak, proved to be a revelation, replete with tenderness and bursting with flavor. Accompanied by a trio of sides â?corn, spinach, and mashed potatoes â?the steak served as the apogee of our culinary journey. While the preceding courses may have fallen short of our expectations, the steak, much like a phoenix rising from the ashes, redeemed the evening and imbued it with a sense of conviviality, thanks in no small part to the erudite bartender, whose mastery of the wine list lent an air of sophistication to the proceedings.",True,2812.0,formal

Additionally, I had to issue repeated requests for them to refrain from overcooking the bread knots, as they had a propensity to arrive burnt and crispy, which rendered them inedible. Furthermore, on at least three occasions, they failed to deliver my order in a timely manner, despite my proximity to their establishment, which was located a mere five minutes away.

Instead, the dearth of melodic accompaniment, the scarcity of patrons, and the taciturn demeanor of the staff created an environment that felt more akin to a library than a wine cellar. Furthermore, the bruschetta, a dish that typically serves as a harbinger of culinary delight, fell short of my expectations. The bread, lacking the rustic charm of its artisanal counterpart, was uninspired in both texture and taste. However, certain dishes did manage to surpass my expectations. The mushroom risotto, for instance, was a gastronomic masterpiece, its rich, earthy flavors melding together in perfect harmony. Similarly, the twisted burger and mac and cheese showcased the chef's proficiency in creating dishes that are both satisfying and innovative.

On a recent Saturday visit, I endeavored to alleviate my hangover at this purported burger haven, being an ardent devotee of carnivorous cuisine. While my expectations were partially met, certain aspects fell short of excellence. The service, however, was commendable; the staff exhibited remarkable hospitality and offered insightful recommendations to patrons. My culinary selection included the Pestorica burger, adorned with relish, pesto, and mozzarella, accompanied by a side of onion rings paired with diverse dipping sauces. Upon presentation, the burger's appearance was indeed impressive, boasting a generous size and vibrant colors from the vegetables and cheese. Unfortunately, the patty itself was too diminutive in thickness, rendering it incapable of retaining a desirable juicy, red center. Additionally, a pinch more seasoning would have elevated the flavors. The onion rings, though crispy, lacked the satisfying crunch of a well-executed batter, instead displaying a tendency towards greasiness and disintegration. In contrast, the Oreo milkshake I sampled subsequently proved to be a resounding success, reaching the pinnacle of excellence.

Upon arrival, it became apparent that entry would be contingent upon adhering to a strict gender ratio, with a minimum requirement of a 50-50 split between males and females.

Once inside, the venue's ambiance initially captivated my attention, boasting an intriguing aesthetic that permeated the space for the first fifteen minutes, prior to the influx of the bulk of the clientele.

Despite the extended delay, I must acknowledge that Dr. Langford displayed genuine remorse for the inconvenience caused, which somewhat alleviated my frustration. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to assume that the clinic could mitigate such waits by avoiding overbooking appointments, particularly during peak hours. Notwithstanding the delay, I continued to receive the doctor's unwavering attention and dedication, which made the wait relatively more tolerable.

Even though it was lunch hour and a lot of places are jam-packed, this sushi restaurant was busy but not to the point you had to wait for service.\n\nThe waitress was fantastic.  Before I even had settled fully in she had brought a delicious glass of fresh iced tea with lemon. I've been to places where you just have no idea if the tea has been sitting out for hours and is beginning to sour and it's not a pleasant experience.  \n\nI had a tootsie roll which was very good..the eel sauce combined with the crunch on a crab California roll was awesome.  I also had an Arizona roll which was again, awesome.  I will most likely be back very soon again for lunch or dinner.  My husband and I only go to one or two places for sushi, and this place gives Yen Sushi a run for its money with its broad menu and great service.",,,informal

Hosts were nice and refilled my water without having me to ask even once.\n\nI did not notice any girl hostesses or servers that night? Maybe they were off or something.\n\nFood: Servers were very friendly in recommending something to eat from the menu. We had portabella mushroom as an appetizer and I had fish to eat for dinner. it was really good.\n\nPrices were on the upside. This place is great for date night and small social gatherings. I would come back here.,,,informal

That being said, they have lots of other food that's not bad. I've had sandwiches and stuff here (veg of course) that were pretty good, and not as expensive as the kabob. They also have pizza joint food (albeit under another name the address/phone number is the same). The pizza is killer, and super fast delivery even in the snow.",,,informal
4,"I had the veggie mushroom soup, which they served with a fresh pretzel roll. It was soooo yummy . However if you are going there for lunch, call your order in as they are extremely busy. You may be late punching back in from lunch, like I was. I waited 20 minutes for soup that was already cooked! Other than the wait time, I was pleased with what ordered except the jelly & PB brioche. I would have bathed in the soup if given that opportunity.",,,informal
4,"This casino, as you might expect, caters to senior citizens. They're heavy on slots and video poker and have probably the largest bingo hall ever imagined. \n\nI met my parents there at noon on a Wed. and found that I was one of about half a dozen players in the 21-30-year old demographic. Most of the dealers, however, are young. One nice thing is that the senior demographic drives the blackjack minimum down to $2. So it's a good place to hone the 21-playing skills without hurting yourself too bad. I settled in at a $5 table and made it out with some cash. I did not see a craps table and the roulette wheel was automated (weird). \n\nI'm sure the younger players show up on weekends because there were more tables that were not open, but overall they do not have a large amount of tables. \n\nDefinitely a good casino, and it is on tribal land. Be careful driving up there and back because Beeline Highway is heavily patrolled for speeders by the Arizona State Police",,,informal

In fact, they have SOY-rizo which you can substitute for the Mexican chorizo with a couple entr\u00e9es. This tells me all is made to order (I approve!) The decor is more homey, artsy/craftsy then fancy/schmancy. Not my taste but the effort is appreciated. Don't forget to BYOB... or on certain nights, when you order 2 entrees and an appetizer (they call it a \""small plate\"") you get a complimentary bottle of wine. We finished with coffee and flowerless chocolate torte. Perhaps the best I've ever had in my long dessert-filled life. FRESHly brewed coffee (just for me!) makes all the difference.

Only the freshest ingredients are employed, which is palpable in each bite, and the menu offers healthier alternatives, a welcome departure from the usual fast food fare. The staff members are invariably affable and courteous, fostering an environment that encourages frequent returns.

However, I was promptly reassured by the friendly staff that, despite their absence from the display case, a plethora of flavors (specifically, those denoted by a small circular symbol adjacent to their name on the menu) remained readily available in the kitchen, and could be quickly prepared upon request. Thus, the perceived shortage was effectively mitigated, much to my delight. Furthermore, my visit was further enhanced by the generous offer of a complimentary red velvet cupcake, contingent upon my mentioning a specific phrase,'sugar rush,' which I discovered through following the shop's official Twitter account (@sprinklescupcks). Additionally, I must commend the bakery on its charming website design and commitment to offering seasonal flavors tailored to various holidays and celebrations throughout the year, including Passover, Cinco de Mayo, and Mother's Day this month.

Upon entering the edifice, I found the ambiance to be rather charming, with a diverse bill of fare and an impressive array of potent potables. The tartlet featuring chÃ¨vre was quite palatable, provided one possesses a penchant for the tangy, pungent flavor of goat cheese. The culinary offerings, while not exceptional, were satisfactory, with my vegetable flatbread pizza requiring a bit more seasoning to attain true gustatory delight. Our table also sampled the cheesecake au jar and the stout cake, both of which garnered unanimous approval from our group (although, as a discerning devotee of chocolate cake, I maintain high standards in this regard).

Although I tend to opt for takeout over in-house dining, the efficiency of the service staff and the edibility of the fare have been, on most occasions, satisfactory.

Unfortunately, our fastidious offspring was not particularly enthused about partaking in a repast at this venue. Following a week-long deliberation, I opted to indulge in a midday feast at this locale, employing the promise of delectable fortune cookies as a means of persuading my progeny to accompany me. Upon perusing the menu, I settled upon the familiar choice of pan-fried noodles complemented by succulent shrimp, prepared with a piquant seasoning. The culinary expertise of the chef was once again showcased, as both the vegetables and seafood components were cooked to perfection, resulting in a gratifying gustatory experience that proved difficult to resist consuming in its entirety. Notably, my discerning daughter expressed satisfaction with her selection of chicken teriyaki served with noodles, devouring the majority of the dish and concluding the meal with a pair of delightful fortune cookies. This restaurant has consistently maintained high standards of cleanliness, and the staff have always displayed warmth and hospitality towards patrons. My sole desire is for them to adopt a more efficient approach to serving meals, ensuring that all dishes are presented simultaneously rather than sequentially.""",True,3854.0,formal

Perfect amount of spice. \n\nThey have a huge selection of sushi, bowls and salads. Reasonably priced given the portion of food you get. \n\nThe restaurant decor was modern and very cleaned up. Staff was fast, friendly and efficient. \n\nOnly thing keeping this place from 5 stars is the steak was a little cooler than the rest of the meal and wasn't sliced all the way through so when I went to shake the bowl up it didn't separate.

However, the beverages served at this establishment are exorbitantly priced, which is a common phenomenon among venues of this nature in the Las Vegas area. Fortunately, I only had to cover the cost of a single drink, but it is still perturbing to observe such inflated prices for potations in general. \n\nThe gentleman stationed at the entrance, James, displayed a level of professionalism and courtesy that was refreshing, especially when compared to the demeanor of certain other individuals who often occupy similar positions at similar establishments. \n\nIn conclusion, if one is seeking a diversionary venue offering a festive atmosphere and varied liquid refreshments in the city of Las Vegas, I would unhesitatingly endorse this particular locality. My associates and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves during our visit.""",True,3436.0,formal

Our servers, despite their cordial demeanor, demonstrated a conspicuous lack of familiarity with both the menu offerings and the ingredients comprising the dishes they served. We sampled an array of sushi rolls, and my personal preference was unequivocally the unadorned avocado roll, featuring generous portions of fresh, succulent avocado. The mixed tempura dish did not meet our expectations, and we would not recommend it. However, the Monkey Brains appetizer proved to be a delightful surprise, diverging from our initial assumptions. Essentially, it consisted of a stuffed mushroom cap, filled with spicy tuna and enrobed in a light tempura batter, subsequently deep-fried to a golden crisp. Furthermore, the Lychee Martini deserves special mention, boasting a potency that was thoroughly enjoyable, coupled with an exceptional flavor profile.

For those who relish the idea of a leisurely excursion, a visit to Boulder City can be a pleasant experience, complete with picturesque scenery. Nevertheless, for those who prefer to avoid the town proper, this eatery is situated on the outskirts, rendering it easily accessible without the necessity of entering the city. Additionally, a drive-thru service is available, although patrons are advised to exercise patience, as each item is meticulously prepared to order, thus ensuring an unparalleled level of quality and freshness. This humble abode, once a modest shack across the street, has since been transformed into a full-fledged edifice, a testament to its enduring popularity and success.

4," Dear AMC Rainbow Promenade,

It appears that 1990 has contacted us to reclaim its movie theater, which we presume has become somewhat antiquated and is in dire need of a comprehensive renovation. Indeed, it is reasonable to assume that this cinema was once a bustling hub of activity, boasting state-of-the-art technology and a vibrant atmosphere that attracted numerous moviegoers during its heyday. However, with the advent of modern multiplexes featuring luxurious reclining seats, cutting-edge surround sound systems, and expansive screens, this particular theater seems to have fallen behind in terms of popularity and amenities. It raises the question of when was the last time an AMC 10 was encountered, as it appears that larger, more contemporary theaters such as AMC 20 or 30 have become the norm. Nonetheless, there is a certain charm and appeal associated with cinemas like this one. Not only do they offer consistently affordable prices and friendly staff, but they also provide an unpretentious and tranquil environment that allows the primary focus to be on the movie itself and the company of those watching it, rather than being distracted by excessive frills and lavishness.

In essence, while the absence of extravagant features may detract from the overall experience, the simplicity and intimacy of this theater can transform an ordinary movie-watching experience into a pleasurable and memorable occasion, especially when combined with good company and an enjoyable film.
