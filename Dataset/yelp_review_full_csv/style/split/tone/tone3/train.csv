The proclivity towards unsatisfactory cakes is ostensibly ubiquitous, with the purported ""buttercreams"" being fabricated with shortening, and an absence of genuine butter. This egregious aberration is unmistakably discernible to anyone who has had the privilege of sampling authentic buttercream, which not only possesses an unparalleled richness and depth of flavor, but also exhibits an unwavering commitment to its ephemeral nature, in stark contrast to the comparatively lengthy shelf life of shortening-based frosting. Furthermore, the chocolate cake contains an enigmatic flavoring agent, reminiscent of artificial rum, perhaps? It is my conviction that consumers purchase these cakes due to their lack of familiarity with superior alternatives. The term ""buttercream,"" it appears, is employed rather liberally outside of Europe, and is often used to describe a mixture of Sweetex (a sweetened shortening of commercial grade) and various other synthetic ingredients, which fail to emulate the authentic article. Carl, unfortunately, seems to be somewhat rigid in his artistic approach, preferring to adhere to outdated designs that have remained unchanged since the 1980s. His reluctance to embrace innovative techniques and motifs, such as rolled fondant ribbons, pulled sugar flowers, or vibrant hues, is a testament to his unyielding dedication to tradition. For those seeking a straightforward cake, unconcerned with the veracity of the frosting's composition, Carl's Cakes may be a viable option. However, it is essential to recognize that the artistry and craftsmanship invested in each cake are not uniform, with Carl's personal style being readily apparent in the less intricate designs featuring simple piping and love birds, while the more imaginative and captivating creations are the result of the talents of other skilled decorators. Moreover, the sheer quantity of shortening employed in the production of ""buttercream"" is truly staggering.",True,1.0,formal
1,"Such a bad experience it's almost comical.$70 per person dinner & soda isn't included ($2 a pop and had to pay for refills).   Bathrooms broke and had to switch boats(no compensation for the inconvenience).  Spent 2hrs sitting at port for the buffet which consisted of red potatoes, pork, soggy salad, & sub par prime rib. We waited 30 min for a server that didn't know he had our table, once he found out he didn't exactly provide stellar service, actually he didn't provide service at all because we never saw him again.

1," ""Indulged in a solo culinary escapade on seafood night; however, a metamorphosis has transpired over time at the M and Studio B, manifesting in a diminution of tables, resulting in an extended duration of unoccupied tables, thereby leading to an increased waiting period for patrons, comparable to the extent of a queue at a Disney theme park. Furthermore, a paltry three items have been added to the seafood night menu, specifically oysters, crab legs, and shrimp, while the remaining fare consists of the establishment's standard buffet offerings. Consequently, the cost for these select items is significantly elevated. My kin has expressed reluctance to endure the prolonged waiting period, which, on the previous evening, involved only 14 couples ahead of my personage, ultimately requiring an hour's passage before a table was secured. I fear that, absent tangible improvements, my return may be deferred.""",True,3.0,formal

1,Birthday signup we got the $30 gift card and went over mid week.  Another one of my favorite places.  The service was terrible.  The guy was new and he was trying but we sat down and it took 2 and half hours.  I don't think it's supposed to take that long.  I even saw the manager on my trip to the bathroom and told him that the server needed help.  Nothing changed.  I don't think the manager cared because I didn't see him helping.  \nBut the biggest issue besides being there for 150 minutes was that the fried rice problems.  The cook who I think was also new.  And it could have been the server. But he didn't make enough.  And he accidentally gave the bowl to the wrong person.  Then he realized and took it back and gave it to the poor girl next too us who was also having a birthday.  And I think the first person took a taste of it.  Then my girlfriend gets her rice and because there wasn't enough left he put in a bunch of burned rice that was sitting on the edge of the table trying helplessly to give her a full bowl.

However, certain aspects of the dining experience left much to be desired in terms of seasoning, as there was an unfortunate dearth of flavorful additives present in both the ribs and brisket entrÃ©es, which, rather disappointingly, possessed an uncanny similarity in taste despite their ostensible differences. Furthermore, the sides accompanying these main courses exhibited a marked lack of gustatory appeal, with the BBQ sauce provided as a condiment being overly diluted and watery in consistency. As an ardent devotee of Memphis-style barbecue, I must confess that my expectations for the Texan variant were not entirely met by the Salt Lick's offerings, and the sluggish pace of service only served to exacerbate my disappointment, as we were forced to wait an unacceptable 35 minutes to receive our check, a duration which included neither our meal nor preparation time.

Firstly, their fares, while seemingly economical, are merely a ruse, as they extortionately charge an additional $45 for checked baggage or a whopping $50 for carry-on luggage, thereby nullifying any perceived savings. Secondly, their customer service is abysmal, with one flight attendant even resorting to ill-advised humor regarding safety protocols, callously expressing indifference towards passengers' well-being. Thirdly, the leg space afforded by Spirit Airlines is woefully inadequate, catering only to those who find discomfort and cramped seating acceptable. As a person of relatively diminutive stature (5'1''), even I found the seating arrangements to be oppressively confined. In light of these grievances, it is emphatically advisable to avoid Spirit Airlines at all costs and opt for alternative carriers, despite any seeming disparities in cost.

For entrees, Pad Thai, Pad Se Ew, Pad Wu Sen, and Squash Curry.  Very good, all of it.  The noodles on the Pad Se Ew were overdone, but OK.  The problem came with the billing.  The $25 off Restaurant.com certificate clearly stated that it was not valid on Saturdays.  Well, it was Friday night.  Our server said that the certificate was no good on weekends.  I clearly stated, showed her the highlighted exclusion for Saturdays, that it was Friday night, and that the exclusion is not for weekend nights...just Saturday.  She understood, and asked her co-worker to explain to us that the coupon isn't good on weekends.  I again said, it is Friday.  It's no good on Saturday.

Commencing with the prolonged absence of our server, it took approximately 20 minutes for her to grace our table with her presence, which, regrettably, proved to be an inauspicious beginning. The ineptitude of this individual, who purported to be a waitress, was staggering, as she demonstrated an alarming lack of proficiency in her duties, leading to an interminable delay at the entrance. Furthermore, the cuisine fell short of expectations, with a notable chilliness and an exorbitant price point that would make even the most ardent penny-pincher baulk. To say nothing of the ambiance replete with velvet and neon, which, rather than enhancing the dining experience, served only to heighten the sense of disillusionment.

""It is utterly preposterous to even consider lodging at this establishment, as it poses an egregious threat to one's personal belongings and safety. Upon arriving at the premises during the SEMA show on November 6th, 2014, and checking in, our possessions were pilfered from our room within a matter of hours. The entrance to our accommodations could be easily compromised by utilizing a credit card to manipulate the locking mechanism, rendering the security measures laughable. Moreover, despite being advertised as a non-smoking resort, guests openly flaunted this policy by smoking in the corridors, stairwells, and throughout the property, creating an environment that was both hazardous and disruptive.

The security personnel were either incompetent or wholly unconcerned with addressing the issues that arose, as the senior security officer displayed a complete lack of professionalism, while the junior security staff engaged in an interrogation that was both invasive and accusatory, insinuating that we were complicit in the theft of our own belongings. Furthermore, the absence of security cameras in the vicinity of the guest rooms made it evident that the resort was not only unconcerned with the safety of its patrons but also created an ideal environment for thieves to operate with impunity.

We requested a room change, which was eventually granted, albeit reluctantly, and the alternative accommodations provided were inferior to the original room we had been assigned. The front desk staff displayed a similar lack of cooperation, leaving us feeling frustrated and ignored. So much so, that we opted to store our luggage in our vehicle, as opposed to risking further theft.

The exorbitant resort fee, which amounts to a whopping $20 per night, is unfortunately non-negotiable and, to add insult to injury, is subject to taxation as well. It is worth noting that this fee is in addition to the cost of the room itself, which can range from $40 for a modest accommodation to an extortionate amount for a luxury suite. Furthermore, the hotel's staff, who are predominantly non-English speakers, often exhibit a lack of proficiency in their duties, leading to frustration and annoyance for guests who are unable to communicate their needs effectively. Moreover, the establishment appears to be a hub for unsavory characters, including pimps and prostitutes, who seem to be ubiquitous in the vicinity. In recent times, the hotel has made a concerted effort to attract families with young children, who can enjoy the amenities while their parents indulge in gambling and other recreational activities. However, it is advisable to avoid booking connecting rooms, as the noise level can be quite bothersome, especially if you have young children in the adjacent room. On a positive note, the hotel does offer complimentary Wi-Fi, a relatively new amenity that has been welcomed by guests. Nevertheless, the smoky atmosphere within the casino is a significant drawback, and it is recommended that visitors bring their own oxygen supply to alleviate any discomfort. Lastly, the slot machines and video poker games are notorious for their stinginess, with even the most liberal of players unlikely to receive a complimentary drink, let alone a decent payout. When the staff does make an appearance, they often display an air of superiority, as if they are doing guests a great service by simply performing their job.",True,171.0,formal

However, her performance as a waitress has been underwhelming, indicating that she may not be well-suited for this line of work. In fact, if I had been responsible for compensating her, she would have received no gratuity, as her service did not warrant one. To further compound the issues, we encountered difficulty when attempting to settle our bill and depart the premises.

1," My girlfriend and I visited this establishment, and the melodic ambiance was quite satisfactory. However, given our geographical location in Arizona, we presupposed that ordering nachos would be a relatively risk-free culinary choice. Upon requesting said dish with an additional protein component (specifically, chicken), the bartender informed me that not only did the nachos already come with meat and beans, but also that the upcharge for said protein would be one dollar and fifty cents. Consequently, I opted to forgo the chicken. As seasoned travelers who have had the privilege of experiencing various gastronomical delights across the globe (and currently residing in the Pix area), we were utterly disappointed to discover that these particular nachos were, by far, the most unimpressive we have had the misfortune of encountering. Indeed, a significant proportion of the chips were not merely lacking in flavor, but also disturbingly stale. While the beverage offerings were passable, the musical accompaniment was enjoyable, and the overall dining experience was not entirely unpleasant, I must emphasize that the exorbitant price tag of twelve dollars for such an uninspiring platter of nachos left me feeling utterly scandalized. Were I the proprietor or culinary mastermind behind this establishment, I would unquestionably feel embarrassed by such an offering.",True,209.0,formal

I arrived in Madison relatively tardy owing to an unforeseen delay in my flight, which resulted in an advanced hour of arrival at my hotel accommodations. Subsequent to checking in, I was eager to consume sustenance, thus I opted to peruse the directory for viable dining options. Upon discovering an advertisement for a local pizzeria, I decided to place an order for delivery, despite my better judgment, which typically involves conducting thorough research on culinary establishments prior to patronizing them. However, my exhaustion and hunger precluded me from engaging in such diligence, leading me to settle for their standard pan-style pizza, despite the peculiarity of their alleged depletion of thin crust varieties. Unfortunately, the delivery process took an inordinate amount of time, exceeding sixty minutes, despite the proximity of the establishment being merely three blocks away. Furthermore, upon finally receiving the pizza, I was thoroughly disappointed by its subpar quality, which failed to meet even the most basic standards of culinary acceptability. In retrospect, it would have been more judicious to procure sustenance from a nearby convenience store rather than subjecting myself to such an unpleasant gastronomical experience.",True,342.0,formal

It is truly mystifying that they would accept a reservation for a large party at such a late hour, given their patently inadequate capacity to provide satisfactory sustenance and service. Indeed, they were running approximately forty minutes behind schedule, and their attempts to accommodate us proved futile, as they failed to deliver even the most basic elements of a respectable dining experience, such as bread for the table or adequately prepared entrees. In fact, they eventually proffered us frozen bread, which remained partially frozen in its core, a laughable attempt at appeasement. It is utterly unacceptable for a purportedly high-end Italian restaurant to serve subpar cuisine at exorbitant prices.

Additionally, the restriction on bringing drinks into the theater, despite the fact that children are permitted entry, struck me as rather incongruous.

Eventually, I was able to procure some semblance of assistance from an employee named Keith, who fortunately possessed the proficiency to rectify the egregious mistakes committed by his colleague, Anthony.

As an Asian individual residing in San Francisco, accustomed to a specific level of quality and standards in Chinese cuisine, my expectations were not met during my visit to this establishment. Despite the 50% discount on our primary dish, the prices remained steep.

The sauces were overpowered by monosodium glutamate, rendering the flavor unpleasant.

The gastronomical experience at this establishment falls short of expectations, with an ambiance that exudes a sense of antiquatedness and visible signs of deterioration. The service, regrettably, does not fare much better, with a lackluster performance characterized by sluggishness and an apparent indifference to customer satisfaction. Furthermore, the morning repast, a meal traditionally considered a vital component of a restaurant's offerings, is subpar in both quality and taste, with an uninspired selection of dishes that fail to tantalize the palate. The manager, when queried about the state of affairs, displays a marked lack of concern, merely acknowledging the mediocrity of the experience without venturing to elicit any further feedback or offering a solution to the problem. In essence, a visit to this eatery is unlikely to leave a lasting impression on even the most lenient of patrons.",True,442.0,formal

1," We embarked upon a culinary excursion to this establishment on a Sunday evening, specifically January 15th, 2012, in celebration of my spouse's natal anniversary, and I must confess that the likelihood of our return is rather diminutive. Previously, I had partaken in their midday repast twice, and while the fare was not particularly delectable, it did not elicit any profoundly negative sentiments. However, my experience during this particular visit was utterly disparate, as the preponderance of the dishes I sampled lacked any semblance of flavorful zest, and the absence of a certain staple dish traditionally associated with Chinese cuisine, specifically egg foo young, was glaringly conspicuous. Furthermore, the Wonton soup, characterized by an unfortunate dearth of solid sustenance, was reduced to a mere broth, which only exacerbated my mounting discontent. It bears mentioning that even the dishes purporting to possess a modicum of piquancy fell short of expectations, their flavors failing to register anything approaching a satisfactory level of spiciness. To further compound my consternation, the fiscal responsibility for our repast, amounting to a staggering $28.08 for merely two meals and a single glass of iced tea, struck me as utterly disproportionate to the quality of comestibles we had consumed. In light of these circumstances, it is my conviction that alternative dining establishments such as Taco Bell, Subway, or even Lin's, which has consistently delivered satisfaction, would have proven vastly more judicious choices.

It is imperative to acknowledge that my expectations were not founded upon the presumption of luxurious accommodations akin to those offered by the Wynn; rather, I was cognizant of the fact that this establishment did not purport to offer such lavish amenities. However, the confluence of factors including the location and cost proved irresistible.

Firstly, we encountered considerable difficulty in locating the designated parking area for an appreciable duration of time, owing to the lack of conspicuous signage and the perplexing construction layout. Our attempts to navigate the labyrinthine structure resulted in numerous circuits around the premises.

Subsequently, upon gaining access to our assigned lodgings, we endeavored to ingress the room, only to be thwarted by an unsightly heap of soiled towels strewn about the corridor outside our door. The sheer volume of towels, numbering approximately between fifty to sixty, was nothing short of astonishing. Following a telephone conversation with the front desk, we were induced to descend to the lobby, whereupon we were promised an upgrade. To our chagrin, the purported upgrade proved to be nothing more than a lateral move to an identical room situated on a higher floor, affording a panoramic view of the Las Vegas Strip. Unfortunately, this vista came with an unforeseen caveat: being subjected to the cacophony emanating from the Carnival Bar, whose operational hours extended well into the night.

In light of these circumstances, we opted to seek alternative accommodations the following morning, incurring an exorbitant fee in the process.

1," Upon my recent return to this establishment for an oil change, I must say that I have observed a significant transformation in the ambiance and personnel of the facility. Specifically, I inquired about the whereabouts of Carlos or Chris, and the individual who attended to my vehicle, Mario, responded with a chuckle, informing me that they were no longer affiliated with the company. Furthermore, when I inquired about their transfer, Mario seemed to find it amusing and stated that they were no longer associated with the organization. I found it peculiar that during the service, Mario persistently nodded his head in affirmation while attempting to promote additional services that I had already taken care of during my previous visit, in addition to displaying bloodshot eyes, a symptom that was also evident in another staff member, leading me to suspect that they may be under the influence of controlled substances. It is my belief that this behavior is highly unprofessional and detrimental to the reputation of the business. Consequently, I suggest that management consider implementing random drug testing among their employees to ensure a safe and competent work environment. Unfortunately, due to the absence of Carlos or Chris, who previously provided exceptional service, I may reconsider my decision to return to this location as a loyal customer.",True,504.0,formal
1,We were ignored for 20 minutes after arriving at our table. Normally I wouldn't be so bothered when I have good conversation at the table but the fact that tables that were seated after us were having their drink orders taken and delivered before I had even seen my waiter was irritating. I had to go find a waitress a total of three times before the hostess decided to just come and take our order herself. Our food came out about fifteen minutes later and our drinks finally came out an additional 10 after that (sadly I actually kept track). No one ever came to refill any of our drinks. The only thing that made me feel a little better is that I wasn't the only one who  was receiving this type of service. Three other tables also had to either get up and find someone to take their orders or find someone to print out their checks because they weren't being attended to.

Most of the staff looked hung-over and treated us as though they hadn't clocked in yet. I thought it best to play it safe and ordered the chicken taco's. They were flavorless for the most part, but with an overpowering cilantro aftertaste that didn't balance. I had a bite of my father's fish - which was okay, but by no means anything more than standard fare. Their entire menu lacked imagination and I begrudgingly sat through the meal hoping to leave soon.

Upon checking in, which was relatively uneventful, we proceeded to our assigned accommodations only to discover that the entrance was already unlocked. Further investigation revealed that the portal did not require a key, as it remained perpetually unsecured. Following a consultation with one of the custodial staff, it became apparent that this anomaly was not intentional and thus, we contacted the reception desk to request a replacement room that boasted secure entry. A considerable delay ensued before the issue was resolved, despite the fact that the lobby area was devoid of patrons on that Sunday evening. Upon gaining access to our second room, we discovered a partially consumed beverage within the refrigeration unit, leading us to question the thoroughness of the cleaning process. In light of the fact that previous occupants had likely utilized the space prior to our arrival, it seemed reasonable to expect a certain level of sanitation. However, it appeared that the responsibility for maintaining such standards fell squarely on the shoulders of the ventilation personnel, according to the front desk staff.

I'm not sure if the broccoli was frozen, but there was water at the bottom.  The meat was overcooked so very tough.

As always, we specifically made reservations for the sushi bar. We arrived a few minutes early; nevertheless, they told us they could not seat us at the sushi bar. They said that they cannot guarantee reservations at the sushi bar. Huh? What is the point of making a reservation if they will not honor the reservation?

1," ""My affection towards BW3 remains unwavering; I openly acknowledge it without an iota of embarrassment. On certain occasions, my spouse and I collectively yearn for a copious amount of brew and a few platters of delectable pub grub. One fateful Tuesday evening, we decided to indulge in our cravings by visiting the establishment. Upon entering, we observed a moderate crowd, with multiple gatherings of considerable size (10+ individuals) occupying tables. The hostess endeavored to accommodate us at a table, positioned amidst these sizable groups. However, I politely declined, expressing our preference to situate ourselves at the bar instead. Subsequently, she offered a secluded booth, removed from the primary dining area.  
We settled into our seats, only to experience an extended waiting period. As we waited, I noticed the servers and bartenders engaging in leisurely conversations, texting, and flirting. I monitored the time, and after three minutes had elapsed, I set the timer on my phone. Following five additional minutes of being ignoredâduring which period neither a server nor a manager (who was visible nearby) attended to usâwe concluded it was futile to remain any longer. Consequently, we arose and exited the premises. It is regrettable, as I still harbor a desire for their culinary offerings; however, I will refrain from revisiting this particular location unless I intend to solely occupy the bar area, which may still require an extensive waiting period.""",True,557.0,formal

The culinary offerings proved to be merely adequate, while the physical surroundings appeared somewhat dilapidated. My meal consisted of BBQ Pork, coleslaw, and peach cobbler, whereas my spouse opted for the BBQ Pork and potato salad. Unfortunately, our palates were underwhelmed by the unremarkable quality of the BBQ pork, which we assessed as a middling 3 or 4 on a scale of 1 to 10. The coleslaw and potato salad accompanying our meals failed to impress us as well. Anticipating the peach cobbler with great enthusiasm, I was dismayed to discover that it too fell short of expectations. If one seeks truly exceptional BBQ in the vicinity, a brief excursion to Hap's BBQ, located on Washington and 48th streets, is highly recommended. Alternatively, Joe's BBQ in Gilbert and even Famous Dave's are superior options, offering a more satisfying dining experience.""",True,575.0,formal

Firstly, the service, which was the sole redeeming quality of our visit, was rendered with proficiency by our server, who exhibited cordiality and dedication in his interactions with us, providing attentive and responsive attention throughout the meal, including offering to replace my unsatisfactory soup. He merits the solitary star I awarded. Moving on to the aspects that did not meet our standards; A) The wall of deceased avian creatures raises questions regarding its purpose and aesthetic appeal. B) The wood-fired beets lacked any discernible smoky flavor, their texture resembling rubber, leaving an unpleasant aftertaste. C) The pan-fried corn failed to impress, with an absence of seasoning rendering it unremarkable. D) The onion soup was excessively salted, with an unidentifiable flavor component detracting from its overall enjoyment. E) The scallops were unremarkable, lacking any distinguishing characteristics. F) The pricing structure was unjustifiably high, given the unimpressive culinary offerings, leading one to question the value proposition. Furthermore, be aware that each item is served Ã  la carte, resulting in an unexpectedly expensive meal, especially considering the quality. To summarize, bring a substantial amount of disposable income and modest expectations to avoid disappointment.",True,612.0,formal

""Under no circumstances should you consider engaging the services of this team of inept and unprofessional individuals for the management of your property. Their level of incompetence is staggering, and their inability to address even the most basic of issues is nothing short of astounding. My personal experience with this team has been an unmitigated disaster, with countless requests for repairs and maintenance going ignored or dismissed outright. The lack of attention to detail and complete disregard for customer service exhibited by this team has resulted in significant financial losses for me, including the replacement of an entire air conditioning unit at a cost of $4000.00. The owner of the company, Nola, appears to be more focused on selling her services than actually providing them, as evidenced by her tendency to talk over others and avoid accountability at all costs. Furthermore, she fails to document any issues or concerns raised by tenants, leaving them feeling frustrated and ignored. While they may excel in the area of billing and fee deduction, their abysmal performance in all other aspects of property management makes them utterly unsuitable for the task. In fact, I was forced to travel 2000 miles to address the numerous repair issues that were being neglected, and I am still struggling to secure the return of my tenant's down payment.

""On the sixth day of August in the year 2013, I partook in a culinary excursion to The Carnegie Deli, whereupon I presented check number 5070620 to facilitate the settlement of the financial obligations associated with my repast. Upon entering the edifice, I was immediately struck by the ambiance, which bore a striking resemblance to certain establishments I have had the pleasure of frequenting during my travels to New York. The hospitality accorded to me by the staff was of an exceptionally high standard, and the premises themselves were immaculately maintained, lending an air of refinement to the entire experience. Furthermore, the comestibles served were of the freshest variety, with the salad in particular boasting an unparalleled crispness that was truly gratifying to the palate. The rye bread, too, was of superior quality, possessing a satisfying density that complemented the various fillings I selected. Suffice it to say, I would not hesitate to return to this esteemed establishment for future indulgences in their delectable sandwiches, particularly given my impending departure in late August.

Regarding the confectionary offerings, I must confess that my expectations were not entirely met. The coconut cream pie, while visually appealing, lacked the depth of flavor that I have come to associate with this quintessential dessert. The texture, too, was somewhat unpleasant, bearing a starchy quality that suggested an over-reliance on cornstarch. In my previous role as a pastry chef at a luxury resort in Saipan, I had the privilege of preparing such pies on numerous occasions, and I can confidently attest that the proper formula yields consistently satisfactory results. It is my conviction that the execution of this dessert fell short of the mark, prompting me to wonder whether the staff at Carnegie Deli genuinely scrutinize their creations before presenting them to patrons.

My companion's seven layer cake, unfortunately, did not fare significantly better. The sweetness level was excessive, bordering on the unpalatable, and the texture was unyielding and dry, leading me to surmise that the cake may have been stored at an improper temperature, thereby compromising its overall quality.

In conclusion, while Carnegie Deli excelled in the realm of sandwiches and sides, their dessert menu leaves much to be desired. A rigorous quality control process might serve them well in rectifying these deficiencies and elevating their offerings to the next level.""",True,686.0,formal
1," I had the misfortune of lodging at this establishment on a recent occasion, and I must say that my sojourn was anything but satisfactory. Allow me to elucidate the multitude of reasons why my stay was less than ideal:

Firstly, the staff members were utterly unfriendly and seemed to harbor a profound disdain towards their occupations. This pervasive lack of enthusiasm was particularly evident during interactions with guests, which often resulted in brusque and dismissive responses to queries or concerns.

Furthermore, the cleanliness of my accommodations left much to be desired. Upon entering my room, I was struck by the sheer amount of dirt, dust, and grime that seemed to permeate every surface. It appeared as though the chamber had not been thoroughly sanitized in quite some time, leading me to question the efficacy of the establishment's housekeeping protocols.

Additionally, I was taken aback by the rigid policy regarding early check-in. Despite being willing to compensate the hotel for the privilege, I was informed that it would incur an additional fee. Moreover, I was dismayed to discover that even after paying this fee, I was still subject to the whims of fate regarding the cleanliness and quality of my new accommodations. On one occasion, I was compelled to relocate to a different room due to its unsatisfactory state, which only served to exacerbate my frustration.

Another aspect that contributed to my dissatisfaction was the overzealous attitude of the security personnel. It became apparent that these individuals took their responsibilities far too seriously, often engaging in behaviors that could be construed as excessively vigilant or even confrontational. While I understand the importance of maintaining a secure environment, I believe that a more measured approach would have been more appropriate in this instance.

Lastly, the pool area was characterized by overcrowding and a dearth of seating options, making it challenging to fully enjoy the amenity. Furthermore, the limited number of cabanas available rendered it difficult to find a suitable location to relax and unwind.

Despite these numerous drawbacks, there were a few redeeming qualities that I must acknowledge. Firstly, the cost of lodging at this establishment was relatively affordable compared to other options in the area. Additionally, its central location made it an ideal base for exploring the surrounding attractions and landmarks. Finally, the presence of Margarita Ville, a popular watering hole, provided a convenient venue for imbibing refreshments and socializing with fellow patrons.",True,687.0,formal

1," I will never revisit that establishment again, as my previous experience was utterly dissatisfying and left much to be desired. Upon submitting my beige and blue comforter for dry cleaning, I was appalled to discover upon its return that all traces of blue had been removed, effectively rendering it bereft of its former aesthetic appeal. When queried about the issue, the proprietor denied any culpability, claiming that she could not recall the presence of blue in the fabric, leading me to suspect that her memory was less than reliable. Undeterred, I elected to retrieve my coordinating pillows from home to demonstrate the veracity of my assertion, only to be met with further resistance. The proprietor then posited that the defect was attributable to the manufacturer, implying that the item was inherently unsuitable for dry cleaning, despite the presence of a label explicitly indicating that it was safe for such treatment. Following a protracted and fruitless exchange, she reluctantly offered a refund, albeit with a marked lack of grace and amenity. Unfortunately, the damage had already been done, leaving me with a bedspread that was now utterly useless, not to mention the exorbitant cost of the entire ordeal. Suffice it to say, I was decidedly displeased with the service I received.",True,714.0,formal

However, the advertised pricing structure was misleading, as I was billed at the rifle rate of $25 per hour, despite the fact that I had employed FMJ ammunition, ostensibly due to the fact that the pistol rate of $19 per hour is only applicable when utilizing Total Metal Jacket (TMJ) projectiles, a detail that was neglected to be mentioned prior to the computation of my bill.

""Although I am reluctant to express criticism in a manner that may seem unduly severe, I must emphasize that the culinary offerings at this establishment were, in my opinion, subpar. Specifically, the menu, which encompassed an excessive number of options, appeared to be a hindrance to the quality of the dishes, as each item failed to meet expectations. Notably, the Pad Thai, which is typically a signature dish in Thai cuisine, was reprehensible, with noodles saturated in an unpalatable tomato-based sauce. In fact, it was arguably the most unappetizing Pad Thai I have had the misfortune of consuming in my lifetime, and its shortcomings were nothing short of astounding. However, certain items, such as the spring rolls and soup, were relatively palatable, thereby providing a modicum of solace amidst an otherwise disappointing dining experience.""",True,803.0,formal

""Upon perusing the offerings of local eateries on the popular online platform known as Groupon, I chanced upon this particular establishment, and, prior to making a purchase, I conducted a thorough examination of the opinions expressed by previous patrons, which yielded a relatively satisfactory assessment, accompanied by several insightful recommendations.  Upon arriving at the premises, my attention was drawn to a notice prominently displayed at the entrance, specifying that certain menu items, specifically those categorized under 'Happy Hour Rolls' and 'Specialty Rolls,' were not applicable for redemption with Groupon vouchers.  I opted to sample three rolls, with the Hamachi Kama being one of them, in addition to the Udon Tempura; however, I only received a single roll, and the female manager, upon recognizing the delay in serving the remaining two rolls, proffered an apology, followed by an explanation that the other two rolls would not be forthcoming.  It appeared that the sushi artisans were indulging in successive rounds of sake bombs, which seemed to impair their efficiency in crafting the sushi rolls, contributing to an overall sluggishness in the meal preparation process.  Moreover, the eatery's advertising strategy involves offering half-priced rolls, purportedly priced at an average of fifteen dollars, yet, in reality, the portions are minuscule, thereby rendering the supposed discount somewhat illusory.  The quality of the food, when it finally arrived, was merely passable, and the staff would greatly benefit from honing their customer service skills and ensuring the timely delivery of dishes to patrons.

In light of the copious acclaim bestowed upon them, I opted for the sliders, while my spouse selected the lasagna.

Evidently, they had resorting to microwaving it, a practice that can only be described as inelegant. The sauce lacked zest, and its primary component was cheese. My sliders, unfortunately, did not meet expectations either. The dominant flavor was that of the burnt charcoal within the bread, imbuing it with an unpleasant and lingering aftertaste. Happily, our server was quite attentive, proffering apologies for the lukewarm fare and displaying alacrity in replenishing our beverages.

At the computers department, we couldnt find anyone to help us, so we went to the cashier. When we got to the cashier (after waiting in line), she was confused and needed a manager to tell her that our order was waiting back in the computers department. We waited for her to walk back and get it. We were surprised when she asked for a credit card even though we had entered that already online. Apparently they don't charge the card until you pick it up (in case you don't have the patience for the chaos, perhaps?). Lastly, the cashier told us they didn't have bags when we asked her to bag our purchased items. We managed to convince her to put each item in its own small plastic bag. Far from ideal, but we managed to eventually get out of there with what we needed.",,,informal

1," ""Despite our initial reservations pertaining to the culinary offerings of an establishment renowned for its copious quantities of comestibles, my spouse and I opted to sample the gastronomical delights proffered by the acclaimed buffet, situated within the hotel hosting our professional gathering. Unfortunately, our expectations were not adequately met, as the fare provided failed to elicit even a modicum of epicurean satisfaction. Indeed, the uninspired preparations proved so unremarkable that we were compelled to seek sustenance elsewhere, with the exception of the confectionary selections, which temporarily satiated our craving for flavorful victuals. It is conceivable that the advanced age and presumably diminished palates of the voting populace may have contributed to the eatery's inflated standing, as their taste buds perhaps required less stimulation than those of the average gourmand.""",True,906.0,formal
1," ""I opted to remain at this establishment due to the fact that it was during Labor Day weekend, and I had the privilege of attending my cousin's nuptials on the renowned Las Vegas Strip. The accommodations at the numerous hotels along the Strip were exorbitant, with prices ranging in excess of $200 per night, thereby rendering them unfeasible for my limited budget. Consequently, I was forced to seek alternative lodging options, ultimately selecting this particular hotel due to its relatively reasonable rate of approximately $90 per night on weekends. \n\nUpon entering the room, I was pleasantly surprised by its spaciousness, elegance, and overall comfort. The quality of the bedding and furnishings was impressive, and I must commend the hotel's management for their attention to detail in ensuring a satisfying guest experience. Furthermore, the on-site casino and restaurant provided an enjoyable diversion, and the complimentary Wi-Fi access was a welcome amenity in this digital age. \n\nHowever, there were certain aspects of the hotel that left much to be desired. Specifically, its location in a rather unsavory neighborhood, coupled with the fact that it was an exterior-facing hotel, contributed to an overall ambiance that some might describe as questionable. Additionally, I must admit that I found the separation of the casino and hotel to be somewhat inconvenient, particularly given the late hours I kept during my stay. Lastly, I must note that the auditory experiences I encountered during my time at the hotel were quite disconcerting, as I was able to clearly hear the sounds emanating from the neighboring rooms, including the rather...shall we say, 'vocal' expressions of intimacy. Suffice it to say that the term 'trashy' would not be entirely inappropriate in describing certain aspects of this establishment. \n\nDespite these drawbacks, I did receive a partial refund for one of the three nights I stayed, which I felt was a gesture of good faith on the part of the hotel's management.""",True,908.0,formal

Furthermore, I must say that the pizza, which was advertised as being of the Chicago deep-dish variety, failed to meet my expectations in terms of both its texture and flavor, as it was unacceptably thin and lacked the rich, buttery flavor that I have come to associate with this particular style of pizza. Moreover, the service was painfully slow, and our server appeared to be overwhelmed by the demands of her duties, as evidenced by her repeated oversight of certain fundamental aspects of the dining experience, such as the provision of silverware and straws, which led me to question the competence of the management in terms of staffing and training.

My spouse and I opted to partake of a midday repast at this establishment, and our arrival preceded our scheduled return to work by approximately sixty minutes. At the outset, our experience was devoid of irritation, but as we stood at the hostess station for a duration of five minutes, awaiting recognition, our patience began to wane. Following our seating, we expedited the process of selecting our culinary preferences, thereby ensuring that we were fully prepared for the attention of our server. Nonetheless, a span of ten minutes elapsed before any member of the waitstaff accorded us even a cursory visit. It bears mentioning that, during this interval, the restaurant was not bustling with activity. As our gazes intercepted those of the servers, who nonchalantly glided past us, and a cheerful gesture of greeting was ignored by one of them, despite their having made direct visual contact with us, an atmosphere of vexation enveloped us.

Specifically, the shuttle did not depart from the airport until it had reached its maximum capacity, resulting in a protracted wait of thirty minutes. Furthermore, our experience was exacerbated by the fact that the initial stop was our place of lodging, The Venetian, which fortunately alleviated some of the stress associated with the delay. However, the return journey was equally problematic, as the shuttle was forty-five minutes late, placing us in jeopardy of missing our flight. To further compound the issue, we made four fruitless attempts to ascertain the shuttle's whereabouts, with the response consistently being that it was merely 'five minutes away.' Disconcertingly, fellow passengers divulged that they had been sequestered at the Palazzo for a duration of thirty minutes prior to their eventual arrival at The Venetian, highlighting the lack of concern for punctuality and disregard for the agreed-upon pickup time. In light of these events, it is our conviction that the potential monetary savings do not justify the risks involved with this mode of transportation. Instead, one would be better served by investing in a more dependable service, particularly given the propensity for expenditure in Las Vegas.

Although my repast was delivered in a relatively expeditious manner, I couldn't help but suspect that certain components may have originated from a warming tray, thereby compromising their overall quality. Specifically, the eggs lacked the richness and creaminess I have come to expect from such a dish, while the corned beef hash suffered from an unfortunate dryness that rendered it somewhat unpalatable. Furthermore, the potatoes, although adequately prepared, proved challenging to consume due to their sheer volume, and the toast, though served in a thoughtful basket, was regrettably tepid, rendering the butter ineffective at melting properly. However, I must admit that the orange juice was quite refreshing, and the decaf coffee, while not exceptional, was still palatable.

The basmati rice, too, had succumbed to desiccation, while the naan bread suffered from an unfortunate excess of heat, leading to an unpleasant charring sensation. The ambiance of the establishment itself was eerily evocative of the infamous Bates Motel, with an unsettling atmosphere of grime and neglect permeating every aspect of the dining experience. Furthermore, the pace of service was sluggish, almost as if the staff were reluctant to interact with patrons. Even the water, ostensibly a basic and essential component of any dining excursion, possessed a curiously fishy tang, further contributing to the overall sense of unease. Perhaps most distressingly, the absence of clientele on a Friday evening only served to enhance the feeling of foreboding and isolation.

Furthermore, my attempts to address the issue via telephone were met with a dismissive and discourteous demeanor by the customer service representative, who, after placing me on hold for an extended period, returned to express her powerlessness to effect any meaningful resolution, prior to transferring me to the manager, who, regrettably, proved equally ineffectual in offering a viable solution to the problem (such as arranging for the driver to reverse course or extending a sincere apology). It is my fervent hope that either a different store will become available or that corporate headquarters will assume control over this specific location, as the pizza served by Papa John's is indeed of superior quality and commendably accommodating to vegan dietary preferences, thus rendering it unfortunate if I were compelled to discontinue ordering from them in the future.""",True,1076.0,formal

I brought in a bathing suit, valued at $800, that was a gift, with the intention of having it tailored to fit properly and subsequently reselling it. Upon initial inspection, the garment appeared to be in pristine condition, with all original tags intact. However, upon retrieving the item today, both the primary tag, featuring the barcode, and the secondary tag, which served to secure the thread, were conspicuously absent. 
  When bringing this to the attention of the proprietor, he elected to shift culpability onto myself, implying that I must have misplaced or removed the tags, a notion that is utterly absurd, considering my intentions to sell the item online, thus rendering any alteration to the original state unnecessary and illogical. Furthermore, I emphasized the fact that I did not remove the tags and would never consider doing so, as it would diminish the value of the item. 
 Despite the satisfactory nature of the tailoring services provided, the unacceptable conduct of the proprietor, including the loss of my tags and his refusal to accept responsibility, has led me to decide against patronizing the establishment further.

She devoted an insufficient amount of time and effort to the designated regions, hastily concluding the massage with a sense of abruptness. The facial treatment paralleled this underwhelming experience, as the youthful and exuberant practitioner, though pleasant, exhibited an excessive eagerness that detracted from the overall relaxation process. Instead of employing slow, deliberate strokes, she opted for rapid, superficial movements that felt more stimulating than soothing.

Regrettably, I yearned to be impressed, but alas, my expectations were not met. As a vegan, I assiduously seek out establishments that offer menus that cater to my dietary preferences. Thus, I decided to visit the highly acclaimed Red Velvet Cafe, anticipating a culinary experience that would surpass my previous encounters. Unfortunately, my hopes were swiftly dashed. The menu presented a mÃ©lange of vegan, vegetarian, and non-vegan options, which, while commendable in its intention to accommodate diverse tastes, ultimately proved to be a detriment. Rather than showcasing inventive vegan or vegetarian dishes, the menu seemed to rely on the uninspired practice of removing meat from existing dishes and supplanting it with vegan substitutes. This approach resulted in a lackluster array of choices, leaving me feeling unimpressed. I opted for the flatbread with pesto and hummus, requesting the vegan version. Disappointingly, the vegan cheese substitute lacked the rich, tangy flavor that distinguishes genuine Parmesan, rendering the pesto flatbread insipid and unremarkable. Moreover, the hummus appeared to be overly processed, bearing little resemblance to the authentic, homemade variety. Its flavor was subdued, failing to impress my palate. The presentation of the dish was equally underwhelming, with the pesto and hummus being haphazardly arranged on the flatbread, reminiscent of a careless serving of ice cream. The sole redeeming aspect of the meal was the beverage I selected, a refreshing sangria sparkling tea, which, despite its tastefulness, came at a steep price of $5.50 per glass, with no refills offered.

The dimensions of the avian extremities served are, at best, unremarkable, while the selection of sauces available for patrons to indulge in is adequate, if uninspired.

Furthermore, it would be remiss of me not to mention the existence of other, superior establishments within close proximity that offer comparable, if not vastly superior, fare. Eateries such as Hazelwoods, Native New Yorker, Zipps, and Tweakwoods each provide an arguably more satisfying dining experience, whether through their provision of delectable wings, an array of refreshing beverages, or an atmosphere conducive to spirited sporting revelry.

It is imperative to possess both an unrelenting hunger and a restrictive dietary regimen to adequately prepare one's digestive system for the impending onslaught of cholesterol. In my case, I opted for a lighter fare, which ultimately proved to be an ill-fated decision.

I've never had that happen before, even in casual restaurants.  We had to use our dinner napkins to soak up the mess on the table and ended up eating off them. In retrospect we should have just left then, but since it was my birthday we decided to stay and give it a try.\n\nUnfortunately the food was very disappointing. My boyfriend's sweet and sour tofu, was literally a single massive block of tofu in broth. All I felt was pity watching him try to eat the bland tofu cube as I sat there in my stained birthday dress.  My vegetarian burger was a tasteless mass of pureed lentils between two buns. We left early - disappointed and depressed. Watching my boyfriend actually have to pay for the experience of having my dress ruined, their abysmal service, and bad food was painful.

2," I have had the privilege of partaking in the culinary offerings of this esteemed establishment on two separate occasions, and, quite frankly, the dichotomy between my initial visit and my subsequent return was nothing short of striking. During my maiden voyage, I opted for a morning repast, which, to my delight, proved to be an exercise in gastronomical excellence, devoid of any palpable shortcomings or disappointments. Fast forward to my second foray into the realm of this eatery, and the experience was dramatically altered, bordering on the unfortunate. Three of us opted for burgers, each tailored to our unique specifications, only to discover that the end result was a far cry from what we had envisaged. The patties were cooked to a rare medium, rather than the requested medium, and the various accoutrements and cheeses were haphazardly assembled, rendering the dishes fundamentally flawed. 
Upon bringing these discrepancies to the attention of our server, his response was perfunctory, at best, lacking both contrition and any semblance of a commitment to expedite the rectification of the errors. An inordinate amount of time elapsed before the arrival of our revised meals, with nary a word of explanation or solace proffered by the waiting staff during the interim. When the new burgers finally manifested, they were conspicuously desiccated, leading one to infer that they had merely been reheated, rather than freshly prepared, a supposition that only served to further exacerbate our collective dissatisfaction.

Our expectations were elevated, primarily due to the extensive assortment of potent potables available. Upon perusing the menu, we discovered an impressive array of artisanal brews, including a few obscure yet intriguing options. Following a deliberate deliberation, we opted for a duo of beverages; myself indulging in a Three Philosophers, while my spouse selected a cider.

The pace of service proved to be sluggish, bordering on glacial, with an interlude of nearly ten minutes elapsing before our libation orders were acknowledged. Although the establishment was bustling with patrons, the staff appeared underprepared to accommodate the influx of customers. The culinary offerings, while not utterly unpalatable, failed to elicit any extraordinary enthusiasm. My vegetables, ostensibly frozen, lacked the freshness that would have elevated the dish to a higher plane of gastronomical satisfaction. Furthermore, a request for a salad resulted in an inordinate delay, with its arrival coinciding with the completion of my meal. Throughout the repast, we encountered additional instances of tardy attention from our server, such as awaiting the retrieval of ketchup.

Despite these drawbacks, we are willing to accord the restaurant a second chance, with the expectation of improved performance during future visits.

2," I am an ardent devotee of fast-casual dining establishments that proffer healthy and fresh culinary options. I do not always possess the luxury of time to prepare meals domestically, nor do I possess the financial means to indulge in gastronomical extravagance at upscale eateries on a consistent basis. Thus, my affection for such dining venues is palpable. This particular restaurant specializes in fish dishes prepared to order, allowing patrons to select their preferred seasonings or sauces, accompanied by a side dish. In addition, the menu features soups, sandwiches, salads, and tacos, rendering it an ideal destination for families with young children, as they cater to the younger demographic with a few select items. However, my solitary experience yielded a minor drawback, specifically, the pungent aroma of fish emanating from my table. Although not entirely unpleasant, the scent was reminiscent of a mildly fresher fish. Notwithstanding this, I relished the mango salsa atop my orange roughy ($12), and harbored no reservations concerning the brown rice. Regrettably, the fish itself left room for improvement. At such price points, one cannot reasonably anticipate daily deliveries of fresh fish; rather, one must venture to high-end establishments like Bartolotta or others along the Las Vegas Strip to indulge in such luxuries. The chicken tenders ($5) designated for youngsters appeared to be crafted in-house, thereby meriting some recognition. Unfortunately, the flavor proved insufficiently robust, even for my child.

You'd have to go to Bartolotta or other high-end Strip restaurant for that.\n\nThe kid's chicken tenders ($5) appeared to be house-made, so they should get some credit for that.

The booth we occupied sported upholstery that was noticeably frayed and worn, which seemed to comport with the general tenor of the venue. The billiard tables appeared to be well-maintained and attracted a sizable contingent of patrons, particularly in the vicinity of the bar area, where a group of individuals were engaged in a spirited discussion of David Limbaugh's most recent literary offering. Notwithstanding the presence of a family unit partaking of a meal, the setting did not strike me as being particularly suitable for a family gathering, although it did not necessarily convey an aura of impropriety either.  
My companion opted for the bacon cheeseburger, accompanied by a side of waffle fries and an order of Asian coleslaw. I selected the grilled chicken sandwich, also with waffle fries. To our surprise, the waffle fries were fabricated from sweet potatoes, yet they possessed a satisfying crispiness and were quite palatable. However, my friend's burger arrived sans bacon, which was served in a separate container and was regrettably overcooked and somewhat brittle. Although the chicken sandwich was cooked to a satisfactory degree, the grill flavor was somewhat overwhelming and might have been mitigated by the presence of a sauce or condiment. My friend expressed satisfaction with the slaw. My beverage of choice, a Left Hand Lager, was quite enjoyable.  
Given the foregoing, one might query why I would assign only two stars to this establishment. The answer lies in the service, which was provided by two amiable servers who nonetheless exhibited a lack of attentiveness to our needs. Specifically, I was forced to endure an extended period with an empty glass, and the process of obtaining the bill and effecting payment proved unduly protracted. Furthermore, the tariffs charged for the fare were, in my estimation, excessive relative to the ambiance and quality of the food. A Guinness ale was priced at six dollars per pint, and while Monday evenings featured Pabst Blue Ribbon at the discounted price of one dollar and fifty cents per pint, the present day was not a Monday and I do not partake of that particular beverage.

My wife and I both ordered fettuccine alfredo, and I'm sorry to report that there was absolutely no taste in the food.  There was no garlic, no flavors that you would expect in a (expensive) Italian meal.  When the waitress asked how everything was, we were very honest.

I hate to say it, but Olive Garden has more flavor, and we despise going there!

I engage in ardent academic pursuits. However, identifying suitable locations for such endeavors within Glendale presents a formidable challenge. Paradise, among the more convenient options in the vicinity of my educational institution, offers an array of amenities, including an abundance of electrical outlets, Wi-Fi connectivity that is moderately dependable, and coffee that, while unlimited, leaves much to be desired in terms of its mediocre quality.

Four individuals, including myself, placed orders for 9 oz. medium rare filets, which were served with an unfortunate predominance of brown coloration, devoid of any residual redness. I promptly brought this to the attention of the wait staff, who demonstrated an expeditious responsiveness in addressing my concern by transporting the dish back to the kitchen. Through the transparent partition separating the dining area from the culinary domain, I observed the cook's initial inquiry, which focused on the possibility of the patrons desiring further cooking. This query seemed to belie an inherent incredulity, as the steaks, in point of fact, had been overcooked. Despite the potential influence of luminosity, the culinary faux pas remained unrectified. The waiter failed to manifest any subsequent dialogue or remunerative offer, allowing the impression of dissatisfaction to linger unaddressed.

I saw the communication through the window and the cook's first question was, \""do they want it cooked more?\""  Really???

In response, I requested a supplementary serving of chile, which arrived promptly. Although the temperature of the chile was satisfactorily warm, its flavor seemed decidedly inferior, bearing a strong resemblance to a store-bought variety. Disappointment also characterized my girlfriend's dining experience, as her meal, designated as The Green Chile Chicken Especial, or a similar title, was unimpressive in both appearance and taste. The dish consisted of an unappealing medley of rice, beans, and cheese, accompanied by a minimal portion of chicken swimming in a watery sauce.

2," While I am not a native of Chicago, I did reside there for a period of six months, which I deem sufficient to familiarize myself with the intricacies of genuine Chicago-style pizza. Upon placing an order for a small pizza and a corn dog from the establishment in question, I was anticipating a culinary experience akin to those I had encountered during my tenure in the Windy City. Alas, my expectations were quickly dashed upon sampling their pizza, which left much to be desired.  
My fiancÃ©, however, expressed satisfaction with the corn dog he received, which, albeit frozen, was palatable. Nonetheless, the pizza proved to be a considerable letdown. Allow me to elaborate on the essence of authentic Chicago pizza: it should boast a moderate thickness at the base while exhibiting a substantial depth at the edges and summit, much like a pie. Unfortunately, the pizza I was served barely measured half an inch in height, a far cry from the delectable, generously proportioned pies I had the pleasure of consuming during my time in Chicago. Indeed, the pizza in question closely resembled the inferior, airport variety frozen pizzas offered by Pizza Hut, prompting my fiancÃ© and me to discard it after a single slice. 
Those who cherish the rich flavors of renowned Chicago pizzerias such as Giordano's or Lou Malnati's are bound to feel profound disappointment upon sampling this subpar imitation of Chicago-style pizza.",True,1390.0,formal

My fiance was very happy to have a corn dog with his pizza (yes I'm marrying someone that likes to have a corn dog and pizza for dinner, but that's another issue). \n\nThe pizza .. now that was the problem. It sucked! So to explain Chicago pizza.. it should be thin-ish on the bottom, but thick on the sides and top.. sort of like a pie. Yes, a pie. The pizza should when sliced, look like a thick piece of pie. My pizza was about half an inch tall. Maybe just the 9 inch comes out tiny, but seriously I had 10 inch pies in chicago frequently that came out awesome. This one was very similar to those nasty frozen pizzas from pizza hut you buy at the airport. A complete disappointment.

Although the culinary offerings (specifically, lobster bisque, king crab, and steak) possessed satisfactory flavors, a sudden and violent onset of illness afflicted both my spouse and myself within a four-hour time frame post-consumption. Following this occurrence, I brought it to the attention of the hostess during the subsequent day, only to be met with an alarming lack of concern. Motivated by a desire to initiate a thorough investigation and potentially preclude future occurrences of food poisoning within the establishment, we opted to convey our experience directly to management. Unfortunately, management displayed an equally dismissive attitude toward the matter, which we found utterly perplexing given the premium cost associated with dining at Orange Sky. In light of this, we would advise seeking alternative dining options that prioritize food safety, as Orange Sky appears to fall short in this regard. It is worth mentioning that our visit coincided with a special occasion, yet we were seated in close proximity to the restrooms, which proved to be an additional disappointment.",True,1439.0,formal

The food (lobster bisque, king crab, and steak) also tasted good, but within about 4 hours, my wife and I both became violently ill.  I reported this the next day to the hostess, who seemed completely unconcerned.  So, we also reported it directly to management, mostly so they could investigate and possibly prevent others from having the same experience.  Management, however, was also not interested in how food poisoning occurred in its restaurant.  For the price tag you pay to eat here, I'd recommend someplace else.  Most restaurants of this caliber put food safety very high on their priorities list.  Not so at Orange Sky.  (We also were there to celebrate a special occasion.  The restaurant was not half full.

However, upon consuming the items, I was disappointed to discover that the texture of the scrambled eggs was unpleasant, and the appearance of the bacon was somewhat unappealing, possessing a scrawny and irregular shape. Furthermore, while my daughter expressed satisfaction with the home fries, I would have preferred the option of potato style over the deep-fried French fry style. Additionally, the coffee served was of poor quality, which, although not unexpected for a diner-style establishment, was still a disappointment. Considering the fact that I paid the full price of $10 for each breakfast, I felt that the quality of the food was subpar and did not meet my expectations, leading me to suspect that synthetic ingredients, such as eggs cooked in a microwave and pre-cooked microwave bacon, were employed in its preparation.

Allow me to elaborate: upon entering the establishment, I endeavored to peruse the menu, which was positioned at an uncomfortably close proximity to my visage, parallel to the wall. Following a brief examination, I managed to identify an item that piqued my interest. Consequently, I placed an order for a bratwurst, accompanied by various toppings, as well as several children's meals.

However, I chose not to pursue this line of inquiry further, given the manager's dismissive demeanor. 

It is worth mentioning that both the French fries and tater tots were prepared using a baking process, which unfortunately did not yield the most palatable results. The bratwurst itself, priced at approximately $7, seemed somewhat steep for a product that had been pre-cooked and merely reheated in a bun. Nonetheless, the flavor profile was satisfactory, and the establishment boasts an extensive selection of sausages. Thus, I may opt to give it another chance. My sole recommendation would be for the staff to refrain from exhibiting condescending behavior towards patrons who are spending a considerable amount of money, particularly during the early stages of operation.

He said, with a sigh, like this is the dumbest thing he'd ever heard, \"" everything here is ala carte\"". Even the kids meal? Well that's interesting because the menu does a horrible job of showing that. Then does that mean toppings like onions cost extra too? I didn't bother asking because the guy was kind of a d*ck about the menu. \n\nThe fries and tots are baked, and not very good. The brat alone cost about $7 which is a lot for something that was pre-cooked and sitting in some kind of oil or water solution before he put it in the bun.\n\nBut the flavor was good and they have lots of sausages, so I will probably try again. Just how about not acting like a jerk when a family spends $50 on your second day of operation, and your menu is incredibly confusing. $12 for a brat, fries, and Pepsi (yeah, no coke) is a lot.

2," ""Chipotle, a culinary establishment purporting to serve Mexican-inspired cuisine, yet, in reality, offering a commercialized and homogenized version of the rich and diverse gastronomic traditions of Mexico, which, in layman's terms, can be described as 'commercialized Mexican food.' Therefore, as an aficionado of authentic Mexican cuisine, I must confess that my dining experiences at Chipotle have been less than satisfactory, and, accordingly, I have come to prefer the offerings of Baja Fresh, a restaurant located across the street from Chipotle, whose culinary prowess and commitment to authenticity have consistently impressed me. Specifically, I take issue with Chipotle's pricing strategy, which seems to prioritize profit over quality, as evidenced by the exorbitant cost of a single burrito, accompanied by a minuscule portion of stale chips and day-old salsa, the total cost of which amounts to a whopping $10.18. Furthermore, I find it hard to fathom how a restaurant that purports to specialize in Mexican cuisine can justify serving burritos that are primarily composed of beans and rice, the cost of which, to the restaurant, is likely no more than 7 or 8 cents per serving. This strikes me as not only unacceptable but also as a disservice to the rich culinary heritage of Mexico. In conclusion, my experiences at Chipotle have led me to question the quality and authenticity of their food, which, in my opinion, has become bland and unimpressive, particularly when compared to the superior offerings of Baja Fresh.""",True,1697.0,formal

Moreover, I had a confrontation with an individual who owned a large poodle, which, due to its size and breed, did not pose an immediate threat to my personal safety; however, it was unsettling to witness the animal roaming freely, sans leash, in clear violation of posted regulations. Furthermore, I have observed other dogs of various breeds and sizes, including pit bulls, roaming unrestrained within the premises, which underscores the notion that certain individuals residing in the affluent community of North Scottsdale harbor an inflated sense of entitlement and a blatant disregard for both the rules and the well-being of others. In light of these observations, I feel compelled to reiterate that this is, in fact, a soccer complex, and not a venue for canine exercise or waste disposal, and thus, I implore all visitors to adhere to the established guidelines and refrain from defiling the grounds with their pets' excrement, lest I be compelled to reciprocate by depositing a comparable quantity of waste on their private property.",True,1746.0,formal

In addition, the seating arrangements were less than ideal, as the couches adorning the walls were noticeably worn and the tables were positioned at an uncomfortable height. It was necessary to request relocation. Moreover, the busser appeared to assume responsibilities customarily assigned to servers, while the server failed to demonstrate the standard courtesies extended to patrons, such as introducing themselves and welcoming guests.

During my recent visit, I sought to procure a power supply, but alas! The shelves were woefully barren, leaving me no choice but to peruse other vendors to satiate my technological needs. It is utterly mystifying that a retailer of such stature would fail to maintain an adequate inventory of five prominent brand models. The implications of such negligence are twofold: firstly, it engenders a sense of frustration among patrons who seek to purchase said products, and secondly, it reflects poorly on the company's ability to effectively manage its resources.  

Fortunately, the lines are generally expeditious, but this efficiency is somewhat mitigated by the dearth of assistance offered in the aisles. It is disconcerting to witness employees indulging in frivolous banter and flirtation, rather than providing requisite aid to customers. Such behavior not only hinders the shopping experience but also undermines the credibility of the establishment.  

One redeeming feature of this retailer is its in-store pickup option, which allows customers to purchase items online and collect them at their convenience. However, this service is not without its flaws, as many employees appear perplexed by the process of fulfilling these orders or locating the items on the shelves. This lack of comprehension is particularly vexing, given that adequate training is essential to ensure seamless execution of such services.

A few notable drawbacks include the absence of essential mixers for crafting a cosmopolitan, the unavailability of multiple wine options listed on their menu, and an executive chef whose attention appeared to be diverted by his cell phone, persistently answering and ending calls mere feet from our table. Furthermore, the bread served was excessively oil-drenched, contributing to an overall sluggishness in service that left much to be desired.

ABSOLUTE GENIUS!!!! The event coordinator successfully manipulated individuals, including myself, into parting with their hard-earned money to engage in a futile one-minute sprint in front of terrified rodeo cows. This unfortunate experience came at a considerable cost of twenty-five dollars, further exacerbated by the absence of even a token t-shirt, much to our dismay. The explanation provided for this oversight was that the organizers had exhausted their supply of t-shirts, leaving latecomers with no alternative but to settle for a subpar crimson bandanna, which can only be described as the most expensive of its kind globally. Moreover, the organizers demonstrated a striking lack of foresight in neglecting to procure sufficient quantities of safety pins to secure the race numbers, rendering the entire undertaking a fiasco of monumental proportions.  

It appeared that the event's management was oblivious to the importance of confirming identities or vouchers, leading to a lax atmosphere wherein numerous participants gained entry without paying, boasting about their good fortune. Furthermore, the organizers' negligence extended to the implementation of a questionable policy prohibiting alcohol consumption within the corral, which certain attendees blatantly disregarded by indulging in copious amounts of alcohol beforehand and then harassing both the cowboys and the bulls during the race itself.  

The extent of the chaos reached a point where two cowboys engaged in a heated altercation, vociferously arguing and brandishing their lassos menacingly, as if they were on the verge of engaging in a physical confrontation.

Subsequently, I returned to the premises this evening, accompanied by my spouse and our progeny, with the intention of indulging in an evening meal.

It is worth noting that children's meals were priced at six dollars apiece, and did not include a beverage, which we found to be somewhat disappointing. Additionally, I was compelled to intervene and prevent the busboy from removing food that we had not yet completed consuming, not once, but twice, and furthermore, he saw fit to remove my replenished water glass while I was attending to my daughter's needs in the lavatory. It is unfortunate that the staff failed to demonstrate a greater degree of consideration and patience, particularly in light of our repeated patronage.

2," This purported steakhouse, which masqueraded as a culinary establishment, was not merely unremarkable but positively underwhelming in its gastronomical offerings and ambiance, rendering it a veritable zombie within the realm of fine dining. Our initial reluctance to partake in a repast at this particular venue was soon replaced by ravenous hunger and a desire to sample the fare offered by this alleged eatery, albeit sans any semblance of expectation or enthusiasm.

Upon entering the premises, we were immediately struck by the utter lack of vitality and charm that permeated the atmosphere, a state of affairs that seemed to extend to the waitstaff themselves, who exuded an air of listlessness and disinterest in their duties. Our initial order, an antipasto platter, proved to be a harbinger of the disappointment that was to follow, consisting as it did of bland, mass-produced items that seemed to have been procured from a local supermarket rather than being lovingly prepared by a skilled chef.

My better half's entrÃ©e, a burger, was perhaps the sole redeeming feature of our meal, although even this was marred by an absence of seasoning that rendered it somewhat bland and unsatisfying. My own main course, a dish of lobster linguini, was a travesty, with each bite yielding a texture that was simultaneously overcooked and rubbery, while the flavor was utterly devoid of any discernible trace of salt or other seasonings. The lobster itself, once a delicacy prized for its succulence and flavor, had been reduced to a state of unfortunate toughness, rendering it akin to chewing on a piece of leather.

The service we received during our visit was, regrettably, commensurate with the quality of the cuisine, with our server displaying a marked indifference to our needs and preferences, as if they too were afflicted by the same malaise that seemed to pervade every aspect of this woeful excuse for a restaurant.

However, Le Cartet falls short in its provision of hospitality, as my experience was marred by the absence of a warm welcome, the omission of customary queries regarding beverages, and the need for me to request the day's specials.

My culinary excursion yielded a salmon sandwich, a satisfying yet unremarkable dish, albeit with an unexpected consistency resembling a creamy tuna melt rather than the anticipated slices of salmon. Accompanied by a meager green salad, this offering seemed overpriced at $15.

2," Looking at all the reviews, perhaps I inadvertently selected an unfavorable evening, but I have undoubtedly enjoyed superior steaks at home, prepared on my own grill, using prime cuts procured from the local market.  In the company of nine other discerning diners, I opted for the so-called ""surf and turf"" combination, featuring a ribeye accompanied by a seafood mashed potato complement.  
The positive aspects of the dining experience included the mashed potatoes, which were indeed exceptional, boasting an abundance of succulent lump seafood and a pronounced flavor profile.  The side dishes, too, were impressive, contributing further to the culinary delight.  
The ribeye, unfortunately, proved to be something of a letdown.  Both my companion and I requested our steaks be cooked to a medium rare temperature, yet upon arrival, they appeared to be closer to a medium level of doneness.  Moreover, the meat lacked tenderness and juiciness, seemingly devoid of any significant marbling, and its texture exhibited an unpleasant granular quality.  
As an enthusiast of diverse culinary experiences, ranging from casual eateries to more refined establishments, I typically approach dining with an eager attitude.  However, this particular encounter came as a mild surprise, considering the substantial cost involved.  Indeed, I have relished ribeyes at a fraction of the price, vastly superior in quality.  
In conclusion, while I would not dismiss the possibility of revisiting this restaurant, I am inclined to explore alternative dining options, primarily to avoid the likelihood of a repetitive, underwhelming experience at such a premium price point.",True,1918.0,formal
2," Unfortunately, despite my initial enthusiasm, this establishment failed to meet my expectations, and it is evident that the quality of the food has deteriorated significantly.  Judging from the numerous vacant parking spaces, it appears that the restaurant's popularity has declined precipitously.  The reason for this downward trend becomes apparent upon sampling the cuisine, which suggests that the proprietors have either lost their passion for creating delectable BBQ dishes or, quite possibly, the food was never truly exceptional.  It is worth noting that there are prominent displays of Guy Fieri's image throughout the premises, leading one to speculate that perhaps the restaurant's reputation was purchased rather than earned through culinary excellence.  The chicken, in particular, was disappointingly arid, lacking any semblance of flavorful seasoning, while the sauce, though unremarkable, was reminiscent of mass-produced varieties available at most supermarkets.  In fact, my own homemade BBQ sauce proved superior in both taste and quality.  The remaining meats, including ribs, brisket, and pork, were merely adequate, with the latter two exhibiting notable deficiencies in texture and flavor.  Specifically, the ribs were tender but lacked any discernible flavor, while the brisket was excessively fatty and possessed an unpleasant texture.  Moreover, the pork had an unusual aftertaste that detracted from its overall enjoyment.  The sides, including coleslaw, BBQ beans, and potato salad, were equally underwhelming, with each dish suffering from an absence of proper seasoning.  Notably, the coleslaw lacked the necessary acidity, while the BBQ beans failed to impress, with my husband commenting that Bush's canned variety surpassed the restaurant's offering.  Similarly, the potato salad was uninspired and lacked any distinguishing characteristics.  However, the breaded pickles, though uneven in their coating, were moderately successful, with their paired ranch dipping sauce enhancing their flavor.  The ambiance of the restaurant itself was reminiscent of a Five and Diner, with a quaint, charming atmosphere that seemed incongruous with the subpar fare served.

I experienced an altogether enjoyable encounter, and even received a missive via post a week later expressing gratitude for my patronage. The most recent occasion, however, was simply disheartening. I comprehend that generally, the waiting staff at eateries detest Restaurant Week, as it attracts clientele who are oblivious to the principles of gratuities based on the original cost, adding supplementary dishes, et cetera. Well, I possess an understanding of all such concepts, and I don't appreciate being treated like some unsavory diner who will leave a paltry tip. Throughout this visit, the waitress barely conversed or acknowledged us. Whilst we did opt for the Restaurant Week menu, each member of my party also ordered additional sides. A bit later, the servers endeavored to deliver our cuisine to the incorrect table, and toward the conclusion, we were compelled to hail someone down to obtain take-out containers for our dessert.

The bartenders demonstrated exceptional friendliness and hospitality, while the prices they charged were remarkably reasonable in comparison to neighboring establishments in the Westgate area. Specifically, the cost of a tall beer was a mere two dollars, making it an excellent value.

Upon relocating to Arizona, I have been ardently seeking a local sushi establishment that can provide comparable quality to that of Los Angeles, all while maintaining reasonable price points. Considering the fact that the seafood in LA is often fresher and not previously frozen due to the city's proximity to harbors, I entered Hiro's with tempered expectations to avoid potential disappointment. Generally speaking, the atmosphere and sushi quality are quite satisfactory for a venue situated in Arizona. Nonetheless, the prices are somewhat elevated, which is only natural given the restaurant's location in Scottsdale and the associated increased costs of procuring premium seafood in an inland area. Furthermore, I find it perplexing that the bento boxes, such as the Teriyaki Chicken and Mixed Tempura, carry such a hefty price tag. In light of this, I am unlikely to return to Hiro's, particularly if I am seeking non-seafood options. Such items should not be priced so exorbitantly, especially when they are sourced locally. I would comprehend if they were offering Kobe beef or something of similar caliber, but for chicken, it seems unjustified. To compound matters, the chicken I received during my visit was slightly dry. Although it may have been an isolated incident, for such a steep price, I rightfully anticipate superior quality or, at the very least, naturally raised organic chicken. Thus, I feel misled in this regard. My apologies, Hiro; I shall continue my search elsewhere.",True,2087.0,formal

Overall, the ambiance and the sushi quality is pretty good for being in AZ. However, the prices are a bit high as to be expected being that it is located in Scottsdale and that the rent and getting quality fish so far inland from the coast would raise cost. The portions could be larger to justify the higher prices. Moreover, I don't understand WHY the bento boxes (i.e. Teriyaki Chicken & Mixed Tempura) is priced so high! For that reason, I probably won't be returning here, especially if I want non-fish options. That kind of stuff shouldn't be priced so high because it's produced locally.

Considering the price per ounce, it becomes evident that the cost is approximately twice that of a comparable burrito offered by nearby Mexican fast-food restaurants.

Prior to embarking on our regular shopping excursion, we opted to partake of a culinary experience at this eatery, thus we ventured a short distance to savor their offerings. My order consisted of a vegan Thai curry bowl, accompanied by a hibiscus tea, while my companion chose a grass-fed burger, complemented by a cafe mocha. 
 
The beverages proved to be truly exceptional, as the hibiscus tea displayed an impressive degree of flavor and refreshment, and the cafe mocha was described as satisfying and invigorating. However, the primary courses gave rise to some misgivings, specifically regarding their modest proportions and questionable composition. Although my vegan Thai curry bowl possessed commendable taste, its spiciness surpassed my expectations, and it lacked a sufficient amount of wheat berries and tofu, instead featuring an abundance of secondary vegetables. The grass-fed burger of my companion was deemed satisfactory, with a subtle smoky flavor, yet it failed to satiate our hunger entirely, prompting us to crave additional sustenance. Furthermore, concerns regarding the organic nature of the tofu and grass-fed beef arose, leading me to ponder the rationale behind consuming non-organic ingredients at an establishment that purports to prioritize health-consciousness.

However, my recent appointments have been marred by considerable delays, which may be attributable to the peak hours during which they were scheduled. Specifically, my appointments took place at 5:30 pm, a time when working individuals often visit after work, resulting in a substantial wait time. On both occasions, I endured a prolonged wait of approximately 30 to 45 minutes in the waiting area, followed by an additional 15 to 20 minutes in the examination room before being attended to. 

Despite the extended delay, I must acknowledge that Dr. Langford displayed genuine remorse for the inconvenience caused, which somewhat alleviated my frustration. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to assume that the clinic could mitigate such waits by avoiding overbooking appointments, particularly during peak hours. Notwithstanding the delay, I continued to receive the doctor's unwavering attention and dedication, which made the wait relatively more tolerable. 

Regrettably, my interactions with certain staff members have been unsatisfactory. During two separate instances, I contacted the clinic and spoke to an individual who exhibited discourteous behavior. In the first instance, she failed to follow up on a query despite her assurance to do so, leaving me with unanswered questions. In the second instance, she provided an incorrect response, claiming that she had previously furnished me with the information when, in fact, she had not. Such conduct is unacceptable, especially towards devoted patients who have consistently sought care at this facility.

We sampled their miniature burgers, which were rather delectable. However, our interactions with the staff were not entirely satisfactory. A bartender approached my spouse and inquired about his desire for a beverage, yet failed to acknowledge my presence. Subsequently, my husband was served a beer that he had not requested. Two other bartenders demonstrated proficiency in their roles and exhibited a welcoming demeanor. Unfortunately, the initial bartender continued to neglect us throughout our visit, leaving our drinks unreplenished and ignoring us for an extended period of time after we had pressed the button to signal for payment.

Two of the other bartenders were very nice and clearly knew what they were doing. The bartender who ignored me then decided to ignore both us for the rest of our stay. Never refilled our drinks and we waited 20 minutes after hitting the cash out button before anyone came to check on us.

This confluence of events somewhat diminished our culinary enjoyment, as five members of the group were also partaking in noxious fumes, thereby creating an atmosphere that was less than optimal for our server, who, despite his valiant efforts, appeared somewhat overburdened by the sheer magnitude of the large party. Furthermore, he was requested to capture photographic memories for three separate tables, which, in our opinion, bordered on the unseemly side of things. Notwithstanding these minor drawbacks, the cuisine proved to be quite satisfactory, with only a single order being erroneous, albeit marginally so, and we chose to accept it with equanimity.

While my expectations were partially met, certain aspects fell short of excellence. The service, however, was commendable; the staff exhibited remarkable hospitality and offered insightful recommendations to patrons. My culinary selection included the Pestorica burger, adorned with relish, pesto, and mozzarella, accompanied by a side of onion rings paired with diverse dipping sauces. Upon presentation, the burger's appearance was indeed impressive, boasting a generous size and vibrant colors from the vegetables and cheese. Unfortunately, the patty itself was too diminutive in thickness, rendering it incapable of retaining a desirable juicy, red center. Additionally, a pinch more seasoning would have elevated the flavors. The onion rings, though crispy, lacked the satisfying crunch of a well-executed batter, instead displaying a tendency towards greasiness and disintegration. In contrast, the Oreo milkshake I sampled subsequently proved to be a resounding success, reaching the pinnacle of excellence.

During my departure, I noticed that the venue had implemented several self-service payment kiosks, which I believed would be particularly advantageous when confronted with extensive queues.

The eatery featured an omelet station, from which I selected two eggs cooked to a doneness level described as 'over easy.' I would like to suggest that this option surpasses the quality of the egg mixture utilized in the creation of omelets, as well as the powdered eggs employed in scrambled eggs. In a separate section designated for breakfast fare, I discovered potatoes and Portuguese sausage.

Furthermore, I managed to assemble a sandwich consisting of salmon lox, capers, onions, and a croissant, which I considered to be quite satisfying. However, I did not observe any bagels among the available options. To conclude my repast, I elected to consume some fresh fruit accompanied by Greek yogurt.

While many items appeared appetizing, my associates expressed dissatisfaction with their selections.

However, upon arriving at the establishment, we encountered an egregiously discourteous hostess whose behavior was utterly preposterous. Despite the absence of a waiting list, our group opted to proceed directly to the bar area with the intention of expediting our service. Following a brief interval of approximately five minutes, during which we had settled at what we believed to be a suitable table, the hostess, distinguished by her protracted blonde tresses, approached our party to inform us that we were, in fact, seated at a dining table, and subsequently escorted us back to the waiting area to await the availability of a table (apparently, there were no tables that met the criteria for ""bar seating""). Subsequently, we endured an additional ten-minute delay, only to have the hostess return us to the identical table we had previously occupied. Her actions were truly baffling, as she carelessly flung the menus onto the table and promptly departed without affording us the opportunity to even take our seats. Our server, however, redeemed this dismal initial encounter with his exceptional attentiveness and proficiency, ably assisted by his busser, who displayed commendable teamwork in their efforts to accommodate our request for expedited service.

Alas, my expectations were not fulfilled, as the culinary offerings and hospitality failed to meet my standards. The tabletops were covered in adhesive substances, while the service was hastened, giving rise to the impression of being pressured to articulate our orders promptly. Moreover, the entrÃ©es were served mere moments after we had devoured our initial course, leaving us with an unsettling sensation of being rushed. Our meals were merely passable, failing to elicit any profound satisfaction. 

We initiated our repast with the bruschetta, which regrettably did not live up to our expectations. Despite the palatable toppings, the flatbread was unpleasantly cold and possessed a stale flavor. Personally, I prefer this delicacy when it is served on sliced bread, similar to how it is prepared at Postino or DâVine. 

My spouse opted for the orecchiette accompanied by sausage, which was unfortunately overseasoned with salt and featured underwhelming sausage. As for my selection, I chose the porcini ravioli complemented by a tomato cream sauce. While the dish had potential, the sauce was excessively salty, thereby diminishing its overall quality. 

The ambiance of the establishment was tolerable, boasting large televisions in the bar area. Although these displays may be suitable for patrons seated in the bar, they proved somewhat distracting from the dining area.

Initially, we opted to visit during the day instead of the evening. I joined forces with three other individuals to partake in the brunch offerings. Now, I am aware that Charlotte is still in the process of refining its brunch scene relative to other municipalities, yet brunch remains a fundamental meal. Unfortunately, the edibles were unimpressive, and the service was sluggish. Our server was quite friendly, albeit laid-back, attending to our coffee needs with diligence while periodically vanishing for intervals of 10 to 15 minutes. The dining area was not teeming with patrons. While my Breakfast Burrito was tasty, it lacked the desired temperature, and the cheese had solidified. My companion raved about the Shrimp Omelette, although they noted it was merely lukewarm. This could be attributed to our server's knack for disappearing acts, reminiscent of Houdini. In conclusion, this establishment is suitable for brunch, but it falls short of exceptional. If I had to choose a fourth or fifth brunch spot, I might reconsider visiting this location during the same time. Nevertheless, I harbor no reservations about returning here for dinner, as I am eager to sample their authentic Shrimp And Crawfish Etouffe and Bloody Mary Bar.",True,2239.0,formal

This dynamic approach necessitates a high level of physical endurance, making it a challenging experience for those who are not in peak condition. Our session consisted of six sets of four repetitions, with each set lasting approximately three to four minutes, culminating in a total duration of one hour. 

The incorporation of television monitors displaying participants' heart rates and a friendly trainer were aspects that garnered my approval. However, the presence of numerous individuals and the emphasis on continuous comparison among them had the potential to become a source of distraction, detracting from the primary objective of focusing on one's personal performance and attaining the desired physical state, commonly referred to as the ""zone."" Despite this minor drawback, I availed myself of a complimentary class starting at 6:30 am on a Saturday, which drew a sizable crowd of fifteen individuals, with a single male participant. The fitness center's diminutive size and welcoming ambiance, complemented by the vibrant hue of orange, created a comfortable environment. While perusing the premises, I noticed a limited selection of items available for purchase, albeit at somewhat elevated prices. 

My assessment of the program's cost yielded the conclusion that it was rather steep.

""Thus, I opted for the Com bi cha suon nuong, and my gastronomical expectations were adequately met, as the pork chop boasted an impressive sapidity, with the seasonings harmoniously complementing the natural flavor of the meat, without an excessive reliance on salt. However, my satisfaction with the dish was not entirely unmitigated, as the bi, while palatable, lacked a certain je ne sais quoi, which was attributable to the meatloaf (cha), whose texture bordered on the unpleasantly dense, suggestive of an overzealous exposure to heat, thereby slightly detracting from my overall enjoyment of the meal.""",True,2335.0,formal
3," I have been frequenting this hair salon for approximately a year, and while I have enjoyed my visits, I have not experienced an overwhelming sense of satisfaction; thus, I believe it is time for me to explore other options. Despite my ambivalence towards the salon, I must acknowledge that the atmosphere is quite pleasant, and the majority of the stylists are cordial and welcoming. In particular, Julia has won my affection due to her striking resemblance to one of my closest friends back home, which has contributed to my prolonged patronage. 

Upon securing a last-minute appointment with Megan following several weeks of sporting an unkempt, albeit practical, ponytail, I was delighted to discover that she possessed a friendly and conversational demeanor. However, upon closer inspection of my coiffure, I noticed that the precision and attention to detail were not up to par with my previous experiences at the salon. This, coupled with the recent price hikeâa staggering 50% increase, I might addâleads me to surmise that the salon's transition to exclusively utilizing Bumble & Bumble products may have played a role in the subpar quality of my cut. 

While I harbor some misgivings about the salon, I must admit that the stylist did exhibit a commendable level of friendliness and approachability. Nonetheless, the style she fashioned for me struck me as somewhat uninspired and lacking the edgy, youthful flair that I have come to expect from my hairstyles. In point of fact, the end result seemed to lean more towards a stereotypical soccer mom aesthetic, which, although endearing in its own right, does not align with my self-perceived image as a vibrant, 21-year-old individual. 

In light of these factors, I have resolved to seek out alternative salons where I can indulge in a more exceptional and invigorating experience, culminating in a triumphant exit, brimming with confidence and an enhanced sense of attractiveness.",True,2336.0,formal
3," I genuinely aspired to cherish this establishment immensely, admiring the concept, commending the excellent service, appreciating the cozy ambiance, and relishing the culinary offerings. Unfortunately, the price point proved to be significantly discordant with the prevailing market rates, rendering the dining experience financially untenable. It is essential to emphasize that the cuisine was not of poor quality; however, the prices charged were incommensurate with the quantity and quality of the dishes served.

The cheese and charcuterie plate, offered at $18, was regrettably minuscule, appearing somewhat lackluster and questionably fresh. My companion and I opted for the lamb bolognese and cassoulet, both of which were palatable yet insufficiently substantial for the price of $24 per dish. Additionally, the portion sizes were relatively meager. We also sampled the Russian honey cake, which, while pleasant, would have benefited from being freshly prepared. Its slightly chilled temperature and faintly synthetic taste suggested that it had not been recently baked.

In light of the above, it is reasonable to assert that the cost of our dinner was disproportionate to the value received. Considering the modest scale of the enterprise and its recent inception, it would be more judicious for the restaurant to cultivate a devoted clientele by providing reasonably priced, refined comfort food, rather than overcompensating for expenses by inflating menu prices. This approach may potentially foster a loyal patronage and facilitate sustainable growth.

An additional observation reinforces this argument: the eatery's decor and tableware appear somewhat economical, employing inexpensive materials. While there is no inherent issue with frugality, the incongruity of consuming a $24 entree with low-cost utensils becomes apparent. The key challenge lies in determining the optimal balance between fiscal responsibility and strategic investment to ensure a harmonious dining experience for patrons.",True,2337.0,formal

Had to flag down the server multiple times (more water, ready to order, ready for the check)...The food wasn't bad, but overly priced.  The wine and dessert lists were both extensive.

When the bill arrived, we were charged $72 for the plates ($12 per adult), which we naturally disputed.  On top of the server not removing the antipasta from the bill, he refused to assist us by separating the bill into 4 checks (which in honesty wasn't something we asked for upfront, but hey, it happens).

Although the hotel's age and lack of modernity may have contributed to its relatively low level of appeal, I did not find it particularly bothersome during my brief period of occupancy. However, I must admit that certain aspects of the service left much to be desired, specifically the housekeeping staff's tendency to disregard our explicit requests for privacy by entering our room unannounced, even when the 'do not disturb' sign was prominently displayed. This particular incident occurred in the early afternoon, when my companion and I were attempting to take a brief nap, and the sudden intrusion left me feeling understandably uneasy. Furthermore, I must caution potential guests against the inconvenience caused by the live music performances that take place on the strip side of the hotel, which can be heard throughout the day and late into the night. Specifically, the band responsible for these musical offerings possesses a questionable level of talent, and their prolonged sets can prove to be particularly grating on the nerves, especially for those seeking a peaceful rest. In light of these factors, I would advise future visitors to exercise vigilance when booking their accommodations, particularly regarding the chapel hours, as my acquaintance discovered that the third-floor chapel was already closed by the time he attempted to utilize its services.

""Hof Kelsten has recently joined the ranks of Mile End's plethora of boulangeries, and its entrance into the competitive landscape of Montreal's bustling bakery scene has been nothing short of remarkable.

Hof Kelsten's culinary approach is deeply rooted in the rich traditions of Central European baking, with an emphasis on artisanal breads such as caraway rye, rugelach, and babka, among others. However, cognizant of the local palate's predilection for Gallic influences, the bakery also offers an assortment of quintessentially French loaves, including what this writer considers to be the most exceptional Montreal baguette currently available.

A recommendation from an acquaintance prompted us to explore the venue, as they boasted an assortment of meats that were allegedly quite delectable. Furthermore, the presence of a Groupon offer made the experience even more appealing. For the sum of $79, we availed ourselves of the all-you-can-eat surf and turf option, which encompassed an array of meat and seafood delicacies, including sirloin, lamb, and an assortment of seafood such as mussels, shrimp, salmon, and tilapia. The surf portion was presented on a separate plate, allowing us to sample each item individually. While some of the meats were slightly disappointing in terms of their texture, I found the shrimp and sirloin to be rather satisfying. The salad bar offered a diverse selection of vegetables and hot dishes, making it a well-rounded culinary experience.

As part of the package, we were also treated to an alcoholic beverage of our choice. I opted for a Chinahuia, which was expertly crafted with pineapple, lime, and tequila. Although it was not a terrible drink, it did not quite live up to my expectations. My companion, on the other hand, enjoyed a Rum Runner, which was generously poured and packed a potent punch.

In conclusion, while the restaurant offered an acceptable dining experience, I would still prefer to dine at Texas de Brasil, where the quality of the meat is superior.

Upon perusing their menu, I opted for a ham-pineapple pizza, which, much to my delight, proved to be an inspired choice, as the flavors melded together in perfect harmony, the gluten-free dough serving as a worthy canvas for the savory toppings. Furthermore, I was impressed by Nello's dedication to transparency, evident in their provision of a comprehensive list of ingredients and toppings, thereby enabling patrons to make informed choices and avoid potential allergens or dietary restrictions. The exceptional service I received during my visit further enhanced my overall satisfaction, as the friendly and attentive staff ensured that my dining experience was nothing short of exceptional. While it is worth noting that Nello's may not cater exclusively to those with gluten intolerance or sensitivity, their willingness to accommodate such dietary requirements is undoubtedly commendable, making them an excellent choice for those seeking a welcoming and inclusive dining environment, where the absence of lofty expectations allows for an authentic and enjoyable culinary encounter.",True,2501.0,formal

The allocation of a mere quarter of the buffet's offerings to bread, a staple that is hardly worthy of such prominence, is particularly vexing, especially considering the exorbitant cost of $40 per person. Furthermore, the quality of the fare is not commensurate with the price, as the standout dish, a California roll, relies solely on the utilization of authentic crab meat to salvage its flavor. The service, while satisfactory, is rendered inconsequential by the fact that it is only accessible to those seated at the bar. One must ponder what distinguishing characteristics this buffet possesses that warrant such lofty acclaim, as prime rib, cold shrimp, and crab are ubiquitous items offered by every buffet in Las Vegas, and certainly not at such an extortionate price.

Good aspects include:

* The culinary offerings (once procured) were undoubtedly impressive, particularly the lobster and corn, which elicited a profoundly enthusiastic response. Additionally, the beverage named in honor of nobility, although forgotten, was indeed commendable.

* The menu boasted an array of diverse options, providing ample opportunities for exploration and discovery.

* The beverages, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, were meticulously crafted and presented in abundance, complemented by an assortment of innovative weekly specials.

Conversely, the following drawbacks were observed:

* The quality of service was subpar, characterized by an excessive number of personnel clad in black attire, alongside two hostesses, which seemed disproportionate to the needs of the establishment. Moreover, the bartender demonstrated remarkable dedication to their duties, reminiscent of the cinematic portrayal of someone possessing exceptional skill or aptitude. However, management would benefit from addressing this discrepancy within the staff.

In conclusion, the eatery offered delectable cuisine, superlative drinks, yet was marred by deficient service.

Margarita Monday: Enjoy $3 off specialty margaritas from 7 p.m. until closing time.

Guys Night Out Tuesday: Relish 1/2 off whiskey, bourbon, and scotch from 7 p.m. until closing time.

Furthermore, the cost-to-quality ratio is quite favorable, making it an appealing choice for a nourishing repast. However, my reservation concerning their rating stems from the fact that their menu selections appear to be overly predictable and lacking in boldness, which may be attributed to the eatery's concentration on providing expedited lunches and a simplified menu. Specifically, the pho broth is conspicuously absent of tripe or tendon, and no alternative exists to incorporate these elements should a patron desire a more adventurous dining experience.

Notwithstanding the fact that the hotel management had hired a driver with questionable mental stability, I cannot express excessive dissatisfaction with The Mirage, as rooms are offered at a reasonable tariff, albeit slightly higher than in previous years. The picturesque gardens situated at the main entrance provide an excellent opportunity for photography. Each dining establishment within the hotel offers an unparalleled culinary experience that should not be missed. Specifically, I highly recommend Japonais, Kokomo, and Samba. Furthermore, there are numerous tables scattered throughout the casino floor, providing ample opportunities for gaming enthusiasts. For those who are novices in the realm of gambling, the minimum limits for blackjack begin at $5-$15, making it an ideal location to initiate one's gaming endeavors. It is regrettable, however, that the poker room does not offer additional remuneration for quad aces, despite the fact that I have been fortunate enough to win substantial sums of money at this establishment.

Furthermore, the absence of certain amenities such as a refrigerator and microwave oven is somewhat inconvenient, albeit understandable in the case of the latter.

It is worth mentioning that the water temperature during showers or baths is not satisfactorily warm, which may prove unpleasant for some guests. Additionally, a resort fee of approximately $20 is charged, which could be perceived as somewhat dubious since it is not explicitly included in the overall cost. Instead, it is presented as an extra charge, potentially leading to confusion or annoyance among patrons.  

In contrast, the location of Treasure Island Hotel is relatively advantageous, situated as it is in the midst of the renowned Las Vegas Strip. In fact, hotels in close proximity to Wynn, Paris, and Bellagio (and possibly Planet Hollywood) are generally considered the epicenter of attractions, rendering stays at these establishments particularly desirable.

Furthermore, the tariff for such a copious amount of fare proves eminently reasonable, making it an attractive proposition for those who relish rich, savory, and decidedly non-authentic Mexican cuisine. A unique facet of Panchos' service model lies in the implementation of a small flag, which patrons may utilize to signal their desire for additional items from the buffet; this innovative approach ensures prompt attention from the attentive wait staff, who materialize at one's table with alacrity. While opinions regarding the eatery's overall quality remain divided, there exists a general consensus regarding the efficiency of the aforementioned flag system, which undoubtedly enhances the dining experience.

Furthermore, a cursory examination of their offerings reveals a tendency to inflate prices egregiously, rendering the experience financially prohibitive for the average consumer. 
  My order, a passionfruit iced tea infused with a hint of strawberry, typically retails for a modest sum of approximately $2.85; yet, upon placing my order, I was taken aback by the exorbitant price quoted by the youthful server, a staggering amount approaching six dollars.

Last year, my fiancÃ© and I participated in the celebration and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, indulging in delectable cuisine and reveling in the diversity of melodies. However, our experience was marred by an unfortunate encounter with the host of the jousting match, who exhibited reprehensible behavior.

Furthermore, this spacious eatery, characterized by its refined ambiance and hospitable staff, offered an extensive selection of customary Chinese fare, including Sushi (albeit being of Japanese origin), Kim Chee (being Korean in nature), Egg Foo Young (prepared authentically), and an assortment of fried chicken, boneless spare ribs, stuffed mushrooms, various chicken preparations, fish, shrimp, and numerous other options, ultimately culminating in a satisfying medley of desserts, highlighted by genuine ice cream of superior quality. Consequently, I would confer upon this commendable dining establishment a rating of three stars, denoting its well-rounded appeal and reasonable pricing, with lunch buffet prices set at $6.75 or $6.08 for seniors from Monday through Saturday, $8.75 or $7.88 on Sundays, and the availability of a standard menu for patrons seeking alternative dining options.""",True,2600.0,formal
3," Chase Field, the domicile of the Arizona Diamondbacks, boasts an impressive architectural design, replete with multiple tiers and an expansive seating capacity. Strategically situated in the central district of Phoenix, this state-of-the-art stadium garnered widespread acclaim upon its inauguration, courtesy of its groundbreaking retractable roof feature, which facilitates the admission of natural light and provides protection from inclement weather conditions. My personal experiences at this venue have been pleasant, characterized by an enjoyable atmosphere and ample space for socializing with companions. However, I would advise against consuming a full meal within the premises, as the culinary offerings are overpriced and lacking in quality.

I guess each server thought the other was checking on them, but it wasn't happening. We waited almost 45 minutes before flagging someone down to keep ordering sushi and to get a roll we head ordered what seemed like ages ago. Everyone was super friendly it's just inefficient. After all this flagging down we had to do, they of course tacked on a 20% gratuity and told us we could only split the check 3 ways, causing us to have to work out with each other who will be paying for who.

During my days of unyielding physical fitness regimentation, I would endeavor to circumnavigate the park's perimeter, whose distance approximates a mile, albeit with slight variations in elevation, owing to the park's topographical configuration, comprising of two inclined sides and two flat expanses, thereby facilitating an unencumbered running experience. Moreover, I have always appreciated the park's nocturnal illumination, which engenders a sense of security, particularly when traversing the premises singularly. 

The park's amenities include a diminutive water-themed recreational area for juveniles, an extensive playground for older children, a smaller play area designated for younger offspring (refer to visual depictions), basketball courts, and a baseball diamond (visual representation provided). Despite its constant throng of patrons, I have yet to experience a sensation of overcrowding within the park's confines. Observations have revealed that visitors indulge in various activities such as ambulating, interacting with canine companions, or simply luxuriating in the sun's radiant warmth while partaking in gastronomical delights. 

Of late, residential dwellings have begun to materialize directly opposite the park, specifically, the Dunhill abodes, whose prices range from approximately 200,000 units of the local currency as a starting point, and the neighborhood is undergoing rapid development. These habitats merit consideration, especially for those who harbor an affinity for the southwestern sector. Furthermore, the proximity of these residences to the park grants the benefit of verdant vistas, whereas alternative perspectives may encompass views of neighboring structures. Additionally, the recently established Wet n Wild Water Park lies in close proximity. Notwithstanding, a certain feature that I ardently desire to witness within this park's precincts is the presence of an enclosed canine recreational area, akin to those encountered during my peregrinations to other parks.",True,2609.0,formal

3," ""3.5 stars\n\nAs an ardent devotee of Flamebroiler (do they have such establishments in AZ?), I am endeavoring to locate a passable teriyaki bowl restaurant in close proximity to my location. It is my conviction that rice bowls serve as the equivalent of sandwiches for Asian/Indian individuals, that is, they are rapid, economical, delectable, and generally salubrious meals. I believe that this particular establishment fulfills the aforementioned criteria! \n\nI opted for the Cayman combination, which encompasses two of their offerings. I sampled both the Fiji and Singapore curries. The Fiji dish was reminiscent of slow-cooked chuck roast, infused with teriyaki sauce, albeit slightly tough. In contrast, the Singapore curry boasted chicken and carrots immersed in a Japanese curry, akin to the cubes purchasable at Asian markets, yet with a subtle tang. Unfortunately, the meat (chicken) exhibited a stringy texture due to slow cooking, which did not particularly appeal to my palate. \n\nDespite these minor drawbacks, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal, and the portion size was generous, rendering it impossible for me to complete the entire bowl. The price was remarkably reasonable, a mere five dollars! Furthermore, their distinctive menu showcased an admirable departure from the ubiquitous chicken or beef dishes blanketed in teriyaki sauce, although it failed to elicit a profoundly remarkable impression. Nonetheless, I appreciate the uniqueness of their offerings, and given the proximity of this establishment to Midwestern, coupled with the affordable pricing, I shall certainly revisit it. In fact, I eagerly anticipate sampling their appetizer selections, specifically their crab puffs and egg rolls. Lastly, it is worth mentioning that Midwestern students are entitled to a ten percent discount.""",True,2652.0,formal

Moreover, during our most recent visit, a bartender was observed inserting his hand directly into an olive jar, retrieving a handful, and depositing them into the garnish tray, prompting us to swiftly remove the olives from our martini.

Alas, my assessment shall be restricted to a solitary menu item. I assure you, dear reader, that I shall compensate for this deficiency in my subsequent visit. We visited the establishment during the noontide hour, and there existed a brief delay in securing a table designed to accommodate two patrons. Consequently, we opted to situate ourselves at the bar. The interior space was somewhat diminutive in size. The bar itself possessed sufficient capacity to accommodate four individuals comfortably, with a maximum occupancy of five patrons. An array of potent potables and vinous beverages were visible to my sight, although unfortunately, I was unable to partake in their consumption. My dinner selection consisted of a delectable roasted fowl sandwich, accompanied by a preference for the potato salad instead of the traditional baked beans. The poultry was delightfully succulent, and the peppers contained within the dish manifested an appropriate degree of fiery zest. The potato salad served as a scrumptious complementary side dish. The entire dining experience was straightforward, yet gratifying. I yearn to revisit this eatery at a later time when the atmosphere is less hectic.

Upon perusing the menu, my eyes landed upon the ginger salad, which, much to my delight, proved to be a flavorsome and visually appealing dish, its ingredients expertly balanced to create a harmonious union of taste and aroma, reminiscent of those delectable offerings commonly associated with the traditional Japanese cuisine that the establishment purported to embody. However, my enthusiasm was somewhat tempered upon sampling the sushi, which, while aesthetically pleasing, failed to distinguish itself from the myriad alternatives available at numerous other eateries specializing in this particular genre of gastronomy. Happily, the spider roll, with its judicious blend of flavors and textures, proved to be an unexpected highlight of our repast, its quality surpassing my expectations and providing a welcome respite from the relative mediocrity that had thus far defined our dining experience. Unfortunately, the ambiance of the restaurant left much to be desired, with an excessive emphasis on opulence and dim lighting that bordered on the excessive, creating an environment that struck me as contrived and lacking in authenticity, particularly given the fact that the proprietors themselves were not of Japanese extraction; furthermore, the cost of our meal, which amounted to a hundred dollars, exclusive of any alcoholic beverages, seemed decidedly steep in relation to the quality of the fare provided, leading me to question the overall value proposition offered by this particular dining establishment, particularly when compared to such competitors as the New Zealand Cafe, where one might obtain comparable, if not superior, culinary delights at a fraction of the cost.",True,2746.0,formal

My spouse opted for the Cuban sandwich.  Following the waitress's recommendation, he attempted to consume it with both lettuce and tomato, but unfortunately, these additional elements overpowered the inherent flavors of the BBQ, rendering it somewhat unpalatable.

Boring really.\n\nWe started with guac and chips and salsa.   Chips were way over salted, almost inedible.  But I did eat them, found myself brushing off the loads of salt with my fingers.  Guac and salsa were good.  Then we moved on to veggie tacos which were nice and a kind of mexican flatbread with mushrooms and a huitlacoche sauce.   Also good.  The rice with corn, cream and habeneros, a kind of Mexican risotto could have been good if it weren't so over salted.  \n\nDistrito offers a nice variety of margaritas.

It was an evening when one of my companions and I decided to engage in a playful activity, inspired by the iconic Disney character, Ariel, from The Little Mermaid, where we used plastic forks to groom our hair before entering the establishment. Furthermore, I recall that shortly after making a humorous observation regarding individuals from rural areas, we felt compelled to utilize the aforementioned utensils to tidy up our coiffures. The motivation behind this behavior remains unclear, but it seemed amusing at the time.

It is noteworthy that the staff, despite their proficiency in their roles, have adopted an affected, stereotypical Italian demeanor, which, while well-intentioned, comes across as contrived and insincere. Furthermore, the linguistic execution of the waitstaff and busboys, who hail from Eastern Europe, often results in a butchered rendition of the Italian language, detracting from the authentic ambiance attempted by the restaurant. My gastronomical exploration of the menu has been extensive, with the veal osso buco emerging as a standout dish; however, the quality of the remaining options can be described as unremarkable and comparable to that of a ubiquitous chain restaurant. Nonetheless, the alfresco seating area, with its delightful environs, may mitigate any disappointment arising from the cuisine's shortcomings, rendering the dining experience, on balance, worthwhile.

The inclusion of vanilla bean butter added a welcome subtlety to the dish. \n\nThe vanilla bean yogurt complemented by an ample serving of granola was indeed palatable, although the generous helping of granola rendered the combination somewhat overwhelming for my taste buds. Nonetheless, the granola served to counterbalance the richness of the yogurt. \n\nThe Cobb salad, albeit unphotographed, proved underwhelming. The dish consisted of limp iceberg lettuce, sparse pieces of chicken, and an undersized portion, all for a price point of $17. \n\nBouchon serves as a suitable venue for individuals seeking to consume a substantial meal prior to engaging in intense physical activity, such as dancing, later in the evening. The service was attentive, and our water glasses were consistently replenished. \n\nIn terms of pricing, Bouchon's offerings, while satisfactory, do not justify the cost, particularly when considering the quality of the meal.

My culinary exploration led me to the quaint Ristorante Foccaccio, which, while authentically Italian in essence, unfortunately failed to meet the elevated standards of quality I have had the pleasure of experiencing at other esteemed eateries. My primary grievance pertained to the Parmigiano Reggiano; instead of the customary fresh, artisanal variety, I was dismayed to discover that the restaurant opted for a processed, bottled alternative. Although the flavors were undoubtedly palatable, the portion sizes were somewhat diminutive, bordering on meager.

Although I did not anticipate indulging in luxurious amenities, I was pleasantly surprised by the establishment's quality, surpassing my expectations. We required an eleventh-hour accommodation, and booking a room for $50 proved to be a reasonable solution. It is essential to acknowledge that one's financial investment directly correlates with the level of comfort provided; thus, those who express dissatisfaction with the lodging's condition should have been cognizant of this fact during the reservation process. While its location may not be situated directly on the renowned Las Vegas Strip, it remains relatively proximate, with the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino lying at a greater distance. The on-site tavern offers a welcome delight, providing patrons with the opportunity to purchase modestly priced Bud Light beverages for $1.50 each. Motivated by the prospect of obtaining complimentary gaming credits, I chose to enroll in the Owl Club, receiving $200 worth of free slot play. Despite failing to secure any winnings, I was pleased to avoid incurring monetary losses. The staff members manning the reception desk displayed remarkable cordiality and adaptability, ensuring a seamless check-in process. The guest room was well-maintained and featured a functioning television set, meeting my fundamental requirements. As I previously stated, I would unhesitatingly consider this venue for future visits to Las Vegas, particularly when seeking economical lodging options.

However, my experience with the sushi was rather unremarkable, warranting only three stars from me due to the usage of non-organic edamame and soy sauce. As an advocate for sustainable and natural food sources, I find it challenging to support restaurants that serve genetically modified soybeans, which unfortunately, seem to be the norm nowadays. Despite this, I maintain hope that more establishments will prioritize organic and non-GMO verified ingredients in the future, even if it may appear futile at present, considering the majority of consumers remain oblivious to the implications of GMO consumption.""",True,2886.0,formal

Irrespective of this, the restaurant's interior is indeed spotless, albeit somewhat peculiarly connected to a beverage store. This observation is merely a statement of fact and does not detract from the venue's overall quality. 

If one were to order a kabob containing either steak or poultry, it is conceivable that they might experience a degree of disappointment due to the relatively meager portion size. On the other hand, if one were to opt for a kabob featuring ground meat, they would likely have leftovers remaining after consumption. Regrettably, I cannot offer guidance regarding the optimal type of kabob to select, as my acquaintances typically handle the ordering process on my behalf. Nonetheless, I can confidently assert that these kabobs are not of the customary Americanized variety; rather, they adhere to traditional Persian culinary practices. Therefore, it is essential to temper one's expectations accordingly to avoid potential disappointment.

The ground beef-style kabobs are carefully wrapped around a lengthy, flat skewer and cooked directly on the skewer, resulting in an abundance of succulent meat. While it is uncertain whether side dishes must be ordered independently, we habitually request them alongside our meat, as the combination of rice, bread, and other items enhances the dining experience considerably.

5 stars. Although the clientele consisted merely of myself and two other patrons during my visit, the staff demonstrated exceptional hospitality and cordiality, thereby creating a welcoming ambiance that greatly enhanced my dining experience.

Food:  
2.5 stars. Despite my cognizance of the fact that the culinary offerings at this restaurant might not necessarily conform to my gastronomical expectations, I opted to sample their burger, which, unfortunately, did not meet my expectations. Specifically, the flat-grilled, hand-pattied, 1/2 pound beef patty lacked sufficient thickness to facilitate medium-rare cooking, resulting in an underwhelming flavor profile that was further exacerbated by the absence of any appreciable seasoning. Moreover, the fries accompanying the burger required salt to enhance their flavor, while the minuscule serving of coleslaw, whose quality was subpar, detracted from the overall dining experience.

Building:  
3 stars. The interior of the restaurant was well-maintained, boasting ample illumination and an inviting atmosphere that contributed to a pleasant dining environment.

Notwithstanding my mixed feelings regarding my dining experience, I remain inclined to revisit this establishment, particularly to sample their breakfast offerings.",True,2937.0,formal

""The 'build-your-own-burger' concept is hardly novel, but this particular establishment boasts an array of unconventional toppings and a diverse selection of buns. My culinary excursion led me to opt for a 1/3 pound brie (a decidedly underappreciated cheese for hamburgers) and ham burger. The resulting dish was profusely juicy and bursting with flavor. However, the gastronomic experience came at a considerable cost, as my burger tallied just shy of $10. Supplementary toppings such as bacon, ham, fried onions, and mushrooms incurred an additional $1 surcharge, while a secondary cheese selection demanded another $1. The standard lettuce, tomato, onions, and pickles exhausted the four complimentary toppings allotted per burger, leaving any further additions subject to a 50-cent upcharge. Furthermore, a solitary serving of fries fetched $3, rendering it advisable to divide the portion among multiple individuals. Lastly, the delectable yet pricey milkshakes merited a whopping $5, prompting me to emulate Vincent Vega's incredulous expression from Pulp Fiction. In conclusion, while the fare was undoubtedly scrumptious, the exorbitant prices precluded it from being a worthwhile indulgence, in my estimation.""",True,2939.0,formal

As a wine enthusiast, I anticipate an atmosphere that is, at the very least, reminiscent of a sophisticated gathering. Instead, the dearth of melodic accompaniment, the scarcity of patrons, and the taciturn demeanor of the staff created an environment that felt more akin to a library than a wine cellar. Furthermore, the bruschetta, a dish that typically serves as a harbinger of culinary delight, fell short of my expectations. The bread, lacking the rustic charm of its artisanal counterpart, was uninspired in both texture and taste. However, certain dishes did manage to surpass my expectations. The mushroom risotto, for instance, was a gastronomic masterpiece, its rich, earthy flavors melding together in perfect harmony. Similarly, the twisted burger and mac and cheese showcased the chef's proficiency in creating dishes that are both satisfying and innovative. The service, attentive and courteous, rounded out the dining experience nicely. In conclusion, while my husband and I did enjoy our meal, the evening's overall experience may not be memorable enough to warrant a repeat visit.""",True,2989.0,formal

Apparently Sephora Quebec doesn't stock Korres but Ontario stores do, due to packaging regulations (i.e language, as Korres products are in Greek and English)\n\nCompletely ridiculous and another reason consumers will always find a way to buy elsewhere if they don't get access to what they want. So I can shop online at SkinStore.com and only pay 5$ shipping from the USA for an entire order.\n\nApart from that, Sephora did have a great selection of brands, not all girly, if you know what you are looking for.   Staff were very helpful and  love to to direct you to the $150 creams (sorry couldn't resist). I would recommend researching the brands first though, many may just be in there because they have compliant packaging rather than really being the best brands you can buy. Many were missing in the store from the Sephora website. The prices seemed inline with elsewhere i.e. Dr. Hauschka prices were the same as Olgivy's, but again, I would compare as some products may have a premium attached to the price simply because you can't readily get access to that brand elsewhere in Montreal. \n\nAnother thing that sucks is that on the Sephora website orders in the US over 50$ are free, however Canadian orders it's over $150 to get free shipping, Again, check out skinstore.com",,,informal

My Agnatha was quite enjoyable, with its crisp, tart, and robust flavors, although the presence of minute ice shards was slightly bothersome; however, this issue was quickly resolved as the ice dissolved.  The August 21st was relatively unremarkable, possessing a smoky essence that, while not aligning with my personal preferences, may appeal to those who appreciate such characteristics.

We had been apprised of numerous laudatory reviews pertaining to Bandera, and thus, we were eager to partake in the culinary experience it offered. It is worth mentioning that Bandera shares a familial relationship with two esteemed restaurants, Houstons and The Rutherford Grill, both of which have received top-notch ratings from this writer.  

Upon arriving at the establishment approximately a half hour prior to our scheduled reservation time, we opted to indulge in a pre-dinner beverage and sample the Deviled Egg appetizer on the inviting patio area. Our table was promptly prepared, and we were seated in no time. We elected to initiate our dining experience with the Grilled Artichoke and Cornbread side dishes...the artichoke was exceptionally delectable. The cornbread was truly remarkable, ranking as the most flavorful and satisfying iteration I have had the pleasure of consuming. For my primary course, I selected the Steak and Enchilada combination. The 6oz filet was skillfully cut into three manageable portions, each generously coated with a rich, deep crimson spicy sauce. The enchilada boasted their signature rotisserie chicken as its central component. Both dishes proved to be thoroughly enjoyable. 

My better half chose the Macho Salad as her main course. Upon the arrival of the salad, we noticed that an integral component, specifically the rotisserie chicken, was absent. However, the oversight was rapidly addressed, and she relished it to a considerable extent. 

While I did appreciate Bandera's offerings, they fell slightly short of my lofty expectations, perhaps due to the incorporation of a Mexican fusion element. A commendable effort, nonetheless, warranting a respectable four-star rating.",True,3200.0,formal

Upon entering the store, I found myself becoming increasingly captivated by the diverse offerings, leading me to spend an extended period browsing through the various items on display.  

During my leisurely exploration of the store, I was particularly drawn to a selection of adorable compact mirrors, pencils, pens, and key rings, each featuring endearing animal designs. These diminutive items were part of a promotion, priced at an affordable 99p, which prompted me to purchase several of them.  

While perusing the wedding-themed section of the store, I chanced upon what can only be described as the most unconventional gift item I have ever laid eyes on. Presented in a box emblazoned with the phrase, ""Congratulations on your Wedding Day,"" the contents revealed a somewhat bizarre figurine of a black cat sporting a diamante collar and earrings. I must admit that I found myself in a state of utter incredulity at the sight of this peculiar item, left speechless by its sheer audacity. My curiosity piqued, I couldn't help but wonder what sort of couple would appreciate such an unusual gift on their special day. Needless to say, I wouldn't recommend presenting it to any newlywed pair expecting a traditional or even remotely conventional gift.

  As it pertains to the culinary offerings, it would be inaccurate to describe them as extraordinary. However, it would be equally erroneous to categorize them as inferior. Each dish I have sampled, including curries, pad thai, phrik khing, hot and sour soup, sweet and sour pork, and others, has been, at the very least, palatable. The curry's spicing exhibits impeccable precision, while the phrik khing's vegetables exude freshness and crispness. The sole dish that failed to impress me was the sweet and sour pork, yet this disappointment stems from my preconceived notion that Chinese cuisine served at Thai, Korean, Japanese, or Vietnamese restaurants tends to fall short of expectations. In contrast, the hot and sour soup elicits sheer ecstasy, ranking among the most flavorful creations I have ever had the pleasure of consuming. 
  Based on these factors, I assign the food a rating of 7/10. Nevertheless, considering the reasonable prices, I might reevaluate this score upward to approximately 8.5/10.

The eatery's ambiance, replete with an elegant decor, was unfortunately compromised by its proximity to the casino floor, thereby creating a discordant juxtaposition between the refined atmosphere and the less than salubrious surroundings. Notwithstanding this minor drawback, the culinary offerings proved to be exceptional, particularly the colossal 120 oz steak, skillfully presented as a visually arresting mound of succulent meat, accompanied by delectable side dishes and dipping sauces. The hospitality of the staff was also commendable, as they exhibited warmth and efficiency in their service, further enhanced by their generosity in providing us with complimentary access to the Brand's ""after hours"" lounge, which, regrettably, did not quite live up to our expectations as a late-night hotspot.

If Phoenix were to ever truly embrace the sport of hockey, they would undoubtedly come to appreciate the sheer magnitude of this arena's capacity for deafening reverberations, as its architectural design seemingly conspires to amplify the cacophony of sounds generated by the fervent enthusiasts in attendance. Indeed, the very fabric of the arena appears to vibrate with an palpable energy, fostering an environment that virtually compels one to join in the collective frenzy. Moreover, the arena's remarkable versatility is showcased by its effortless metamorphosis into a music hall, a feat made all the more impressive by the fact that large arenas often serve as veritable lifebloods for touring acts. My sole grievance, alas, lies with the rather lackluster environs in which this marvel of engineering was erected. Glendale, regrettably, exudes an aura of sterility and monotony, a characteristic that threatens to diminish the potential for an unbridled, alcohol-fueled night of revelry or an exhilarating concert experience. Further complicating matters is the arduous journey back to civilization that follows, rendering such escapades impractical and, thus, rendering the arena's proximity to its surroundings woefully inadequate. To say nothing of the egregious moniker bestowed upon its nearby neighbor to the west, a name that seems almost laughably incongruous when juxtaposed with the arena's own illustrious appellation.",True,3359.0,formal

However, upon closer inspection, certain aspects of its ambiance captured my attention and piqued my curiosity. The name, in particular, struck me as somewhat amusing and playful, which served as an auspicious harbinger of the pleasant surprises that awaited me within.

Upon entering the premises, I was immediately taken by the rustic, woody aesthetic that permeated the interior design. The liberal use of exposed wooden ""log"" beams and the overall ""woodsey"" motif lent a warm, welcoming atmosphere to the space, evoking the sense of a cozy cabin nestled deep within a dense forest. Although the bar area itself was somewhat dimly lit, the abundance of televisions (albeit none of them particularly large) scattered throughout the room ensured that patrons could easily follow their favorite sporting events or news programs while enjoying a refreshing beverage.

In contrast, the dining area, though relatively diminutive in size, exuded a certain charm thanks to its subdued color scheme and judicious deployment of supple, vinyl booths. While I would have preferred a bit more exposed wood adorning the walls to complement the existing decor, the strategic employment of these booths helped to create an intimate, convivial setting that fostered a sense of community among patrons.

My culinary expectations were thoroughly exceeded by the delectable fare presented before me. The sweet potato fries, in particular, delighted my taste buds with their unexpected burst of flavor and satisfying crunch, while the prime rib proved itself to be a veritable gastronomic revelation, boasting a tenderness and richness of flavor that eclipsed that of many other establishments in the surrounding area. Although the tariffs associated with these delights were slightly elevated above the norm, the extensive selection of draft beers available helped to assuage any pecuniary concerns.

The attentive, cordial service I received during my visit only further enhanced my overall satisfaction, leaving me feeling content and satiated. In conclusion, I would highly recommend Outside Inn to anyone seeking a relaxed, congenial environment in which to enjoy a few pints and savor some exceptional prime rib. Its unassuming faÃ§ade belies a veritable treasure trove of gustatory delights and hospitable ambiance, making it an ideal destination for those seeking solace from the stresses of everyday life.",True,3370.0,formal

I managed to fortuitously secure a living space that is conveniently located within walking distance of virtually all essential amenities, including what is arguably the preeminent ski and snowboard equipment retailer in the region. Ski Pro boasts an impressive inventory that surpasses even the most well-stocked ski shops in Colorado, and their focus on promoting sales and offering discounts is evident in the substantial markdowns they offer on various items. Case in point: I recently purchased a ski suit for my child that had been originally priced at $175, but was available for the significantly reduced price of $59. Although the selection of skis and snowboards may not be as extensive as some other specialty stores, it is nevertheless quite comprehensive and caters to a wide range of winter sports enthusiasts.

The quality of customer service at Ski Pro is relatively average for establishments of this nature, with staff members exhibiting a level of friendliness and attentiveness that is adequate without being overly obsequious. Considering the laid-back atmosphere that permeates such leisure-oriented businesses, it would be unreasonable to expect excessively cheerful and solicitous demeanors from employees. Instead, they maintain a relaxed yet competent attitude that aligns with the overall ambiance of the store. While they may not display the same level of enthusiasm as workers in more formal settings, they are at least cordial and welcoming, which is a refreshing change from the sometimes surly and aloof demeanor encountered among ski shop employees in certain parts of Colorado.

""Although I cannot profess to have sampled every pancake within the nation's borders or even a sufficient quantity to establish a robust statistical foundation, I must concede that the pancakes under examination compared favorably to those I might prepare in my own domicile, an observation that admittedly astonished me.  My culinary exploration also encompassed the venue's celebrated corned beef hash, alas, the quality of which did not quite live up to my expectations, perhaps due to its reliance on canned corned beef.  

The harmonious fusion of the eatery's ambiance, steeped in history as a seasoned casino in the city's core, and the delectable pancakes transformed the dining experience into a truly satisfying breakfast excursion. Were it not for the unremarkable quality of the coffee, which regrettably conformed to institutional standards despite the thoughtful accompaniment of a half-and-half pitcher, I would unhesitatingly confer upon the establishment a perfect five-star rating.  

The display case housing an assortment of pies piqued my interest, as several fellow patrons have attested, and I look forward to savoring one of these delectable pastries during a future visit. Additionally, the restaurant offers various breakfast specials, such as a pancake and bacon sandwich ensemble, which may pique the interest of discerning gastronomes.  

In regard to parking, those who seek to avoid monetary exchanges may find the options somewhat limited.

Upon my initial visit for dinner, I would have rated this venue three stars, as the ambiance was pleasant, the service was satisfactory, and the cuisine was adequate, albeit unremarkable. However, my second visit to the club on a Wednesday evening proved to be a vastly superior experience. Despite the fact that many other clubs in the area were relatively quiet, this particular establishment was bustling with activity, boasting a vibrant atmosphere that was complemented by attentive servers who ensured that our needs were consistently met. The beverages were also quite palatable, although I must admit that the fact that I didn't have to pay for them myself may have slightly enhanced their flavor. All things considered, I would unquestionably return to this venue if I were to find myself in Las Vegas once again. Nonetheless, I might opt to explore alternative dining options prior to my next visit, as my previous experience with the restaurant left something to be desired. As a final note, I would advise potential patrons to exercise caution when utilizing the Roman-style sinks located in the hallway, as while they may be conveniently turned on for guests, they are unfortunately not stocked with paper towels for drying one's hands afterwards.",True,3508.0,formal

4,"A hidden gem!  \n\nWe never knew this place existed and stumbled into it after lunch at Chino Bandito (next door).  They have all sorts of flavors of popcorn and are more than willing to let you sample them. Even some seasonal flavors. We were really excited about the Cake Batter flavor but we sampled it in the store and were a little disappointed in the lack of cake batter flavoring, too much spoiling by Cold Stone's ice cream flavor I guess.  \n\nWe took advantage of the bakers dozen deal on the small snack size bags so we could try lots of flavors, it was 13 bags for $11 (normally $1 each).  They were even willing to make us a bag of a flavor if we didn't see it in the small size. \n\nThey have many more flavors than what's on their website, some of the ones we got were Churro, Bacon & Cheese, Cookies & Cr\u00e8me, Coconut, PB & Chocolate, Cherry Chocolate and Candy Bar.  \n\nThe store had lots of cute tins/gift ideas so next time you are trying to come up with a gift idea for someone, this might just be a great alternative option to the classic gift card.",,,informal

""Upon arriving in Las Vegas subsequent to a prolonged automotive journey, I opted to visit this establishment on a Friday evening, capitalizing on the opportunity to avoid the throngs of people typically associated with peak hours. My strategy proved effective, as I was able to procure a prime position at the forefront of the queue, thereby enabling me to promptly place my order for a personalized pizza. The eatery operates under a unique concept, wherein patrons can create their own individualized pizza by selecting an unlimited number of toppings, all for a fixed price. Additionally, a diverse array of sauces is available for customers to choose from. The staff members manning the counter exhibited remarkable cordiality and were eager to offer assistance with any queries or concerns that arose. \n\nAs for the culinary experience itself, I must say that it was quite satisfying. I opted for the meat lovers variant, augmenting it with jalapenos for an additional burst of flavor. The pizza was crafted employing an exceptionally thin crust, which yielded a delightfully crunchy texture upon consumption. Furthermore, I added a subtle drizzle of garlic to the periphery of the crust, thus enhancing its inherent flavor. The freshness of the toppings was undeniable, and the combination of ingredients blended together harmoniously. \n\nBased on my positive experience, I would unhesitatingly recommend this venue to my acquaintances and loved ones seeking a convenient and delectable pizza destination.""",True,3512.0,formal

Furthermore, during my visit, a staff member emerged to perform floor-sweeping duties, which, while commendable in terms of maintaining a tidy environment, was somewhat marred by the individual's posterior proximity to my table on multiple occasions. Notwithstanding this minor infraction, the culinary offerings were generally satisfying, particularly the biscuits, which featured a subtle honey glaze that added a pleasant dimension to their flavor profile. Additionally, the piquant fowl dish caused a noticeable nasal discharge, a positive indicator of its spicy veracity, while the macaroni and cheese dish was similarly enjoyable.

The main reason I stop at Trader Joe's is for the chlorine free paper products and natural cleaing products especially the laundry detergent. Chlorine free/recycled paper products seem to be hard to find in the stores. Giant Eagle Market District used to carry some Seventh Generation paper products but they haven't had any for well over a year. Before Trader Joe's, if I had to order all of my paper products online to be delivered. Now, I can find good quality, chlorine free, recycled paper towels, napkins and toilet paper for a great value at a local store.

As for the menu items we sampled, they were akin to a gastronomical odyssey, with each dish more delectable than the last.

Specifically, we purchased a whole grilled chicken, a large fresh fruit salad, and an extensive vegetable juice consisting of beets, carrots, apples, and celery, all for a total of sixteen dollars, which is remarkably reasonable considering the substantial savings compared to the equivalent items at Whole Foods, which would have amounted to at least thirty dollars.

Prior to this encounter, I had experienced unsatisfactory interactions with various medical professionals, which rendered me exceedingly cautious about seeking assistance from yet another practitioner. However, upon engaging with Dr. Tognacci, I was pleasantly surprised by his unwavering dedication to addressing my diverse concerns. Unlike some of his peers who seemingly adhered to a strict schedule, Dr. Tognacci adopted a distinctly different approach. He accorded me the necessary time to voice my apprehensions and displayed a remarkable willingness to delve into exhaustive research, ensuring that each query was adequately addressed. Throughout our conversation, I was struck by his unhurried demeanor and unwavering commitment to fostering a collaborative atmosphere. He demonstrated a genuine interest in my well-being, treating me as an equal partner in the decision-making process. Upon conclusion of our consultation, Dr. Tognacci ensured that I possessed the requisite prescriptions and an ample supply of samples.

The staff are friendly, the prices are reasonable, and although I've not sampled the food menu extensively, what I have had has been very tasty.\n\nWhat I really like about The Orchard is the atmosphere. There's a mix of regulars who tend to take up residence at the bar and will always offer a tale or two to those who wander in, looking for a place to satisfy their thirst. There's also a great mix of ages, which I find really refreshing as some bars seem to have an unspoken age policy, but that's not the case in The Orchard.\n\nI can't talk about the food in too much detail, but I have had the steak pie, which was delicious, and often my friends and I order chips whilst we work our way through our drinks.

4," I am particularly fond of this diminutive club, as it presents an optical illusion of being a minuscule establishment nestled within a strip mall adjacent to the Horse & Hound; however, upon entering, one is pleasantly surprised to discover an expansive interior. This venue boasts an impressive roster of both locally renowned artists and nationally recognized performers, having hosted the likes of KRS-One in 2009 and Slick Rick more recently. The security protocols are seamless and efficient, allowing for a swift ingress into the building after pre-purchasing tickets. Although the shows have been known to commence an hour later than scheduled, the experience is well worth the wait. Moreover, this platform serves as an excellent opportunity for lesser-known artists to gain exposure and showcase their talents.  
On a personal note, I opted to abstain from consuming alcoholic beverages (having indulged in a pre-show libation elsewhere), instead choosing to acquire two energy drinks due to a $10 limitation on credit card transactions and the drink's modest price point of $4. The presence of multiple bartenders ensured a prompt and seamless service.  
While the sonic quality is certainly satisfactory, what truly sets this venue apart is its unique combination of spaciousness and intimacy, affording patrons the opportunity to immerse themselves fully in the performance. I would highly recommend attending a show at this location, with tickets typically priced at a reasonable $20 and conveniently purchasable online. Although the website does feature a calendar of forthcoming events, it could benefit from more frequent updates and additional multimedia content such as photographs and videos.",True,3524.0,formal

We stumbled upon Casa Don Juan serendipitously in our quest for hangover sustenance and potent potables beyond the Las Vegas Strip. Our fortuitous discovery proved to be a culinary blessing!

The eatery boasts an inviting outdoor seating area, which we took advantage of to bask in the sunlight. However, the interior of the restaurant felt rather chilly during our visit. My sibling relished the enormous portion of chicken fajitas, while I opted for a platter featuring delectable pork tamales, a mediocre beef taco, and a fried pablano pepper overflowing with cheese.

As luck would have it, the hour of our arrival coincided with the peak lunchtime period, which customarily translates into an influx of patrons and an ensuing state of affairs characterized by crowding and prolonged waiting periods. However, much to our delight, the duration of our sojourn in the extensive drive-through queue was surprisingly brief, barely exceeding five minutes, despite the presence of a sizeable assemblage of individuals partaking of their meals alfresco and an appreciable number of vehicles awaiting their turns in the adjacent parking area. Furthermore, the gastronomic experience itself proved to be a gratifying and satisfying endeavor, as the fries were expertly prepared, exhibiting a delightful crispiness and freshness that complemented the flavorful and generously proportioned burger, which was further enhanced by the richness of a decadent chocolate shake.

It was truly fascinating to witness such a varied gathering of people interacting harmoniously. Furthermore, the bartender, who was ostensibly inebriated, served drinks at a price that I considered reasonable, thereby partially compensating for the initial financial burden imposed by the cover charge.

4," As a denizen of Matthews, my cardiac organ will forever remain devoted to the Royal Cafe and Creperie; however, Hazelnuts does proffer some delectable crepes. Located in the central district of uptown Charlotte, accessibility to Hazelnuts may prove challenging, unless one works in the downtown area and chooses to traverse the distance by foot; alternatively, patrons may opt to utilize the limited side-street parking facilities available (it is advisable to hone one's parallel parking abilities prior to attempting to secure a parking spot). The eatery itself is situated within the lobby of a structure, thereby ensuring a constant influx of pedestrians; the interior design exudes an aura of contemporary cleanliness, characterized by pristine white walls, striking blackboards, and strategically positioned wooden accents. The menu boasts an array of crepes suitable for breakfast, savory meals, and desserts; however, it is likely that the accommodating staff will accommodate special requests and tailor the crepes according to individual preferences. Following the placement of an order, a brief interval of approximately five to ten minutes (dependent on the length of the queue) transpires before the culinary masterpiece is presented to the patron. Thus far, I have had the pleasure of indulging in the Maple Dream, an ingenious fusion of both savory and sweet elements, encompassing eggs, bacon, and maple syrup; additionally, I have sampled the Basil Pesto Chicken, an exemplary midday option.

It is worth noting, however, that the author's satisfaction with the Vdara's staff, cleanliness, and modern appointments has not been compromised by their previous experience at the aforementioned luxury establishment. Furthermore, the presence of a full-sized refrigerator for the storage of libations and leftovers has been deemed particularly appealing, while the bed, though adequately comfortable, has been somewhat let down by the unfortunate state of the windows.

While the location was not directly on the strip, I personally preferred the tranquility and convenience it offered, particularly since we had our own vehicle and did not have to contend with the chaos of pedestrians and challenges of parking typically associated with the strip.  

Upon entering our accommodations, we were pleasantly surprised by the extensively modernized interior, complete with a brand-new bed, contemporary furnishings, and an aesthetically pleasing restroom featuring a large showerhead and a stand-up shower, albeit lacking a bathtub.  

The aspects that truly impressed me about this particular hotel were the user-friendly parking arrangement, a streamlined check-in process situated in close proximity to the parking structure, and the overall ease of navigating the premises without encountering excessive crowds or rowdy individuals, creating a comparatively peaceful ambiance within the casino. Moreover, I was astounded by the absence of cigarette smoke odor within the establishment, a truly unique feature.

Located south of the famed Las Vegas Strip, this venue primarily caters to local patrons, thus making it a veritable gem for those seeking an authentic experience untainted by the glitz and glamour associated with tourist hotspots.

On numerous occasions, I have had the pleasure of partaking in the delectable fare served at this establishment, and I must confess that the service has always been exceptional, with both large and small gatherings receiving attentive and proficient attention from the staff.

The difficulty in singling out a specific dish as a recommendation stems from the fact that each item on the menu has consistently impressed my taste buds. However, I feel compelled to steer your attention towards the garlic knots, which, while seemingly unremarkable, transcend the realm of ordinary breadsticks by an order of magnitude.

The standard guest rooms, while marginally more sumptuous than those found at a typical four-star hotel located along the Las Vegas Strip, are essentially comparable in terms of dimensions, rendering them unsuitable for accommodating large groups of individuals; therefore, it would be more practical and cost-effective to reserve a suite at a less prestigious hotel, if you intend to host numerous guests.

My dining companion and I both opted for the delectable pork chop, which was skillfully prepared to achieve maximum tenderness and juiciness. Furthermore, the sweet potato fries that accompanied our meals were enhanced by the judicious application of cinnamon and butter, creating a delightful harmony of flavors that complemented our main courses perfectly. To maintain a sense of balance and equilibrium, I elected to include a serving of expertly cooked broccoli within my meal, thus rounding out the ensemble with a healthy and nutritious component.  

Ultimately, the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance of our dining experience arrived in the form of our companion's generous offer to cover the cost of our repast, graciously bestowed upon us like a cherry atop a sundae. It was a magnanimous gesture that served as a fitting conclusion to a truly satisfying and enjoyable meal, made all the more memorable by the captivating ambiance and exceptional service that characterizes Logan's Roadhouse.",True,3739.0,formal

On a Tuesday evening, I found myself with an unanticipated hiatus of approximately one and a half hours while awaiting the arrival of an individual at the aerodrome. Seizing the opportunity to indulge in a culinary escapade, I opted to visit the revamped establishment formerly known as Old Pewter Rose. As fortune would have it, the venue was bustling with patrons, and in light of my time constraints, the accommodating staff proffered us a table situated adjacent to the kitchen, providing an unobstructed view of the culinary artisans at work. This unique dining experience, reminiscent of a Chef's table, was dubbed something distinct by the eatery.  

The dual delight of savoring delectable fare and observing its preparation elevated the encounter to an unforgettable level. Positioned directly in front of the line cooks and chefs, my dining companion and I relished the opportunity to witness the creation of each dish. Our server, cognizant of our gastronomic inclinations, recommended the flavorsome nutty fried chicken, presented alongside sweet potato mash and asparagus. The tantalizing aroma wafting from the plate prompted us to devour its contents with alacrity, leaving naught but an empty dish. Furthermore, we were treated to a heavenly, fluffy roll whose quality was assured by a rigorous approval process, as indicated by a sign stationed within the kitchen. This fastidious attention to detail undoubtedly contributed to the sublime, doughy excellence that graces my palate even now.  

In conclusion, my excursion to this refurbished edifice proved to be a truly satisfying adventure, heightened by the friendly service, scrumptious victuals, and welcoming ambiance. Without hesitation, I shall return to partake in further explorations of the menu, boasting an array of enticing options that regretfully remained unexplored during my initial visit.",True,3741.0,formal

The waitress was very nice, and our food came quite quickly. We ordered chicken phad thai to share, mild spiciness, extra peanuts. I was alittle disappointed at the lack of spice, but all in all, the dish was really good. We asked for some red chilis and added some spice to the dish ourselves. Very yummy.

4," We visited this establishment with a group of five individuals seeking a delectable breakfast experience. Fortuitously, we arrived prior to the onset of peak hours, thereby ensuring a more tranquil ambiance. Two of our party members opted for the iced tea, which unfortunately lacked depth of flavor and appeared somewhat diluted.

Myriad pancakes were sampled, including the cinnamon-infused variety, carrot, red velvet, and whole wheat options. A subjective ranking of these selections, from most preferred to least, would be: cinnamon, carrot, red velvet, and wheat.

The cinnamon-flavored pancakes delighted our taste buds with their satisfying blend of sweetness and savory undertones. These pancakes are unquestionably recommended. In contrast, the carrot pancake failed to showcase its namesake's distinct flavor, instead boasting a subtle, almost negligible essence that barely distinguished it from its wheat counterpart. The red velvet iteration suffered from an unfortunate dryness, further compromised by an overpowering sugar syrup that eclipsed the inherent flavor profile.

The cowboy omelet, while adequate, could benefit from several adjustments. Specifically, a more delicate cooking method for the eggs would result in a less rubbery texture, while a slight reduction in doneness for the vegetables would enhance their natural sweetness. The fried potatoes, although unremarkable in terms of saltiness, avoided the unpleasantness of excessive crispiness.

A rating of 3.5 stars seems appropriate for this venue, considering the generally satisfactory quality of the food and generous portion sizes. Notwithstanding some minor missteps, we would still consider revisiting this establishment to sample other menu items, particularly their French toast and alternative egg dishes. Our server provided commendable assistance throughout our visit.",True,3743.0,formal

You start at a unlimited salad bar, and honestly, there's not much salad about it which was awesome. They had mozzarella, parmigiano cheese, prosciutto & salamis, their very own smoked salmon, in additon to salad, as well as soups.\n\nWhen you're ready, they will start bringing out the meats. Make sure to ask for filet mignon, they had it but were stingy about taking it out! Their ribs are also melt-in-your-mouth and their lamb didn't have much of a gamy taste. Skip the chicken if you can, this place has a TON of  better meat choices than that.\n\nOh, also, TAKE YOUR TIME!

Nice gesture.  \n\nThe corn cakes with pulled pork appetizer was probably the highlight of the meal.  Very good.  The Arcadia Salad was also good.  Being from New Mexico and loving green chile, the green chile Mac n Cheese was a little dissapointing.  The ribs were ok.

Interesting artwork with the chalk board feature, although it is so cluttered to the point that we couldn't take it all in.  Sometimes less is more.  \n\nAs I aluded to earlier...I'm a firm believer that music is the single-most make or break factor to a great ambiance.  The music simply does not fit.  Paula Abdul did not add to my enjoyment of dinner in any way.  Maybe we were just at a cheesy point of the mix, but I think some more edgy/progressive/hip music could do a lot in further creating an enjoyable ambiance.\n\nOverall, I'm a fan.

4," Burger Bar presents an innovative culinary experience, courtesy of Chef Hubert Keller's visionary conceptualization. Patrons are invited to create their ideal burger by selecting from an array of premium meats, including buffalo, lamb, angus, and kobe. Furthermore, they may choose their preferred temperature and an abundance of toppings. Of note is the extravagant Rossini burger, priced at $60, boasting Australian Kobe-style Wagyu beef, sautÃ©ed foie gras, and shaved truffles on an onion bun, complemented by a rich black truffle sauce. However, we recommend eschewing this option in favor of building a custom burger with identical ingredients, sans black truffles, resulting in a significantly lower price point of $30. This modification allows for a more balanced flavor profile, as the potency of the truffle sauce might overpower the delicate umami of the foie gras. An alternative to enhance the dining experience is to pair the burger with a selection of sauces from their extensive collection, featuring unique varieties such as spicy ketchup and truffle mayo. Without a doubt, Burger Bar offers a truly exceptional culinary adventure, with the possibility of indulging in the most delectable burger one has ever had, albeit at a considerable cost.

Much to our delight, there was no queue to gain entry, and the atmosphere within the establishment was not chaotic or overcrowded, thereby enabling us to thoroughly absorb the ambiance and engage in conversation with the employees. Our visit proved to be particularly educational, as we gained insight into the intricacies of the show's production and were informed that had we arrived earlier, we could have potentially been selected as extras for the day's filming. It is worth noting that the gentlemen who work at the shop are typically present from Monday to Friday, between the hours of 9 am and 3 pm. However, they tend to remain in the rear of the building, thus avoiding the throngs of enthusiastic spectators who frequent the shop daily. For those aspiring to appear on television, it is crucial to possess an item of sufficient interest to warrant its display on the program, as well as the charm and persuasiveness necessary to navigate the show's rigorous selection process. Alternatively, arriving early enough to serve as an extra on a day when filming is taking place can also prove rewarding. Although the shop offered various tourist-oriented items, I felt no shame in acquiring a Pawn Stars t-shirt, and I derived immense satisfaction from doing so. The shop itself was not particularly extensive, yet I found the assortment of memorabilia to be captivating, and I was further entertained by the staff's recounting of anecdotes regarding the acquisition of specific items, which mirrored the experience of watching the program from the comfort of my own home.

Fortunately, a generous happy hour policy offered $4 Cali rolls and affordable sake daily from 5-7 pm, making the experience slightly less financially ruinous for those who timed their arrival appropriately. Furthermore, patrons seated at the bar were treated to an amusing spectacle, courtesy of the owner's personal preparation of each specialty roll and his penchant for theatrics.

Lamenting the dissolution of Casa Bianca, a Madisonian establishment renowned for its culinary offerings akin to those of New York City, we opted to explore alternative dining options within the locality. Regrettably, Madison does not boast an impressive reputation for serving superior quality pizzas, as the indigenous Wisconsin cheese lacks the zesty flavor characteristic of Boston's Regina's or the acclaimed apizza locales of New Haven.

Its competitors in Chicago, such as Lou Malnati's, also excel in their respective offerings. Contrary to our expectations, Villa Dolce presented itself as a gratifying revelation. The crusts were expertly crafted, while the inventive toppings (we incline toward vegetarian options when it comes to pizza) showcased an exceptional degree of freshness and palatability. In our estimation, Villa Dolce constitutes a formidable contender for the title of finest (upscale) pizza in Madison. Prior to reaching a definitive verdict, we shall conduct several additional visits.

The presentation was also quite impressive, as it arrived on its own plate. The menu offered an extensive array of options, which led to a state of utter bewilderment, as we desired to sample every item listed. In order to experience a variety of flavors, a friend and I opted to share several dishes. We began with the Snickers pancake, which, despite being singular in nature, proved to be a culinary masterpiece, measuring a generous 12 inches in width. Its taste was nothing short of exquisite. Our second selection was the Fried Chicken and Waffles, infused with bacon slices, which can only be described as a gastronomic indulgence. While it may have been a tad unhealthy, it was nonetheless an incredibly satisfying experience. Finally, we sampled the Hash dish, which featured grilled chicken, asparagus, sundried tomatoes, homestyle potatoes, two eggs, and a fresh biscuit. Although somewhat healthier than the other options, it was still delightfully flavorful, with the accompanying marmalade serving as the perfect complement. In conclusion, a visit to this establishment is an absolute must during any Vegas vacation.""",True,3843.0,formal

This particular establishment operates on a pay-by-the-ounce system, which allowed me to sample an array of five distinct yogurt flavors prior to settling on a half-and-half combination of peanut butter and devils food. While the low-fat content of their offerings might suggest a healthier alternative, my enthusiasm for peanut butter led me to augment my selection with an assortment of Reese's Pieces and various other sugary embellishments, thereby transforming it into an unparalleled gustatory experience.

4," This review could have attained a perfect five-star rating if it were solely based on the culinary offerings. However, due to the unpretentious nature of the establishment and the cacophony of sounds generated by the sushi chefs, which resembled more of a battle cry than a warm welcome, I felt compelled to deduct a star. Upon entering the restaurant, I was greeted with an enthusiastic round of applause from one of the chefs, which I reciprocated in kind, albeit with a hint of bemusement.  
The ambiance of Ru San's is decidedly casual, and the prices are similarly unassuming, with a sum of $10 granting access to a seemingly endless array of sushi options. For those with hearty appetites, this represents an unparalleled value, as two modest rolls could easily surpass that cost at other establishments. While the sushi served at Ru San's may be described as 'Americanized,' it is undeniably delectable. Notwithstanding the potential health implications, the deep-fried sushi is a singular delight.  
To ensure optimal freshness, the sushi plates are meticulously labeled with time markers, and while the sushi often vanishes before the designated time elapses, this speaks volumes about its quality. Ru San's will persistently hold a place in my rotation of preferred local sushi haunts.

In my peregrinations, I have sought out that singular location which exudes an air of uniqueness, without succumbing to the pedestrian and mundane ambiance that permeates so many establishments, while still proffering an exceptional cup of coffee complemented by extraordinary service. Hitherto, my explorations have yielded the following results: in Maui, the Honolulu Coffee Company has proven to be a veritable oasis of excellence; in Ann Arbor, The Common Cup has demonstrated a commitment to quality and distinction; in Ypsilanti, The Ugly Mug has exhibited a laudable dedication to artisanal craftsmanship; in Bellingham, Washington, The Black Drop, Lettered Streets, Firehouse, and Tony's Coffee have all contributed to the region's reputation for gastronomical excellence; and in Seattle, Vivace Espresso has consistently delivered an unparalleled coffee experience. And now, in the fiery crucible of Phoenix, I have had the pleasure of discovering Lux Coffee Bar, a truly remarkable establishment that has managed to strike the elusive balance between urban sophistication and effortless charm.

In this instance, I was able to recognize the influence of chance, and thus, I felt compelled to acknowledge it in my review of the establishment.  
During a recent visit to Las Vegas, a group of acquaintances and I decided to venture to the nearest location of a well-known alcoholic beverage franchise, which we believed to be situated within the Planet Hollywood complex. However, upon arriving at the destination, we discovered that the closest branch was actually located within the Caesar's Forum Shops. Notwithstanding this minor inconvenience, I opted to sample a beverage consisting of a 190 Octane and Hurricane mixture, which was served in a tall container. Upon consuming approximately two inches of the drink, I began to feel quite content.  
The bartender proved to be a valuable asset, as he offered various blends to my associates. Specifically, he recommended a concoction known as a ""midnight kiss,"" which consisted of a Bellini and strawberry mixture. This particular combination elicited a highly favorable response from those who partook of it, including myself. Moreover, the cost of these potent beverages was surprisingly reasonable, particularly given the generous refills that were available. Thus, I felt compelled to advise others to retain their cups, as the value offered was indeed impressive.  
To provide further insight into the potency of these drinks, I must confess that after consuming only a small portion of mine, I felt compelled to remark that I needed to ""quickly slow down before I became too inebriated."" Subsequently, a member of our group acquired a pair of novelty undergarments from a nearby retail establishment, which featured a unique design that combined opaque material in the front with transparent lace in the rear.

Upon being seated, we opted for two glasses of Cabernet, a superior quality wine that proved to be an excellent beginning to our delectable journey. Subsequently, we relished a fresh mozzarella dish accompanied by heirloom tomatoes, which was further enhanced by a touch of coarse salt and balsamic, thus rendering it utterly scrumptious. Additionally, we sampled a chopped salad adorned with a modicum of cheese, salami, and a remarkably flavorful vinaigrette; although I am not typically a devotee of salads, this particular creation tasted unquestionably fresh and warranted high praise. Furthermore, we ordered a salad dressed with balsamic, which, despite not being as exceptional as its chopped counterpart, remained palatable and satisfying.

Moreover, we relished a half-portion of fresh pasta, skillfully prepared with Parmesan, zucchini, and tomatoes, thereby constituting the ideal quantity for a lighter repast. Notwithstanding my initial concerns regarding the potential heaviness of pasta as a late supper option, the smaller serving size proved to be a judicious decision.

Our culinary excursion continued with an order of skirt steak, which regrettably did not meet the same lofty standards as the preceding dishes, primarily due to the fact that the balsamic component, which was the third instance of this flavor profile throughout the meal, seemed somewhat superfluous and detracted from the overall quality of the dish. Nevertheless, the meat was cooked flawlessly, and its generous portion made up for any deficiencies. Lastly, we indulged in a delightful tiramisu and paired it with expertly brewed French press coffee and cappuccino, both of which demonstrated the establishment's commitment to excellence in beverage preparation.

In conclusion, our dining experience at this meticulously appointed restaurant was truly outstanding, and the judicious selection of dishes allowed us to sample a diverse array of flavors from the menu.

5," I must confess that I am not habitually inclined to compose reviews on Yelp, however, given my profound affection for Aquaknox and the frequency with which my family and I have indulged in their exquisite culinary offerings over the past decade, I feel compelled to express my sentiments. As ardent devotees of haute cuisine along the Las Vegas strip, we have had the privilege of sampling an array of esteemed establishments, including Joel Robuchon, Picasso, Le Cirque, N9NE steakhouse, and Eiffel Tower, among others. Nonetheless, Aquaknox has consistently demonstrated a level of gastronomic excellence and exceptional service that is unrivaled. Their commitment to providing an unparalleled dining experience has been a constant source of delight and satisfaction for us.

The appointment of Min as their new manager has further elevated the already impressive standards of hospitality at Aquaknox. We were particularly impressed by Min's extraordinary efforts to accommodate our request for a pina colada, despite its absence from the menu. Undeterred by the lack of a blender, he personally ventured to adjacent restaurants in search of the necessary equipment, ensuring that our desire for this refreshing beverage was fulfilled. Such dedication to customer satisfaction is truly remarkable and testifies to the exceptional caliber of the staff at Aquaknox.

We have been steadfast in our allegiance to Aquaknox as our preferred seafood haven and go-to destination for special occasions. Our unwavering loyalty stems from the consistent delivery of delectable dishes that never fail to captivate our taste buds. Some of our most enthusiastically endorsed options include the flavorful steamed mussels, best savored with an additional serving of bread; the sublime lobster cocktail, complemented by a zesty citrus garlic aioli; the sweet shrimp and lump crab salad, a symphony of freshness and texture; the rich lobster bisque, whose heavenly aroma permeates the atmosphere; the tender filet mignon and surf n turf, a masterful fusion of land and sea; the Pacific prawns on couscous, enriched by a luxurious lobster cream sauce; and the red snapper, poised atop a bed of truffle potato puree, an inspired combination that showcases the culinary prowess of Aquaknox's skilled chefs.

In conclusion, if you seek a superior seafood experience coupled with exceptional service, look no further than Aquaknox. Their ability to consistently deliver an unforgettable dining encounter is unmatched, making them an indispensable gem in the realm of gastronomy.",True,4465.0,formal

On weekends, the restaurant transforms into a vibrant hub, accommodating families, canines, children, infants, elderly individuals, and youthful crowds, all converging to partake in convivial storytelling while savoring the performances of talented musicians.

I am particularly fond of the cozy nooks and crannies, providing options for both indoor and alfresco seating.

Generosity abounds in their portions, but be prepared for a costly experience, with the price of drinks, sandwiches, and chips potentially reaching $30 for two individuals. Nevertheless, the complimentary weekend concerts more than compensate for the expense. The welcoming atmosphere extends to the friendly service staff, many of whom have been employed at the establishment for numerous years.

The Oyster Bar is nestled within the Palace Station casino and has a limited seating capacity of merely 18 individuals. There were approximately six individuals awaiting their turn ahead of us at around 3 am, and we were eventually seated following a brief wait of slightly over an hour. The culinary experts manning the kitchen were quite cordial and worked diligently, albeit at a pace that resulted in a delay of approximately 20-30 minutes prior to the presentation of our repast. My personal preference was for a half dozen oysters, priced at $10 between the hours of 1-9 am, in addition to the Combo Pan Roast, which garnered considerable acclaim and carried a price tag of $23.99.

The oysters were expertly shucked and ranked among the most delectable specimens I have had the pleasure of consuming. As I have not sampled the dish previously, I cannot offer a valid comparison; however, I can describe the Combo Pan Roast as a hearty, brandy-infused stew composed of tomato and cream, replete with copious portions of crab, lobster, and shrimp. The flavor profile was spot-on, registering at a satisfying level 8 on the spiciness meter, while the texture was luxuriously rich and creamy.

5," I have been an ardent cinemaphile for approximately fifteen years, during which time I have consistently demonstrated a profound aversion to sitting for extended periods of time in those minuscule, uncomfortable seats that are typically found in traditional movie theaters. Upon learning about the advent of the Galaxy Theater, I was utterly enthused! The concept itself was nothing short of revolutionary.

I have had the privilege of visiting this esteemed establishment on multiple occasions, and each time, I have been thoroughly impressed by the exceptional quality of the amenities provided. The chairs, in particular, are a marvel of modern engineering, boasting ample proportions, superior comfort, and even a diminutive mobile tray for the convenience of consuming food and beverages. It is worth mentioning that the theater offers alcoholic beverages, although I must confess that I am not particularly fond of them. Nevertheless, my companions seem to derive immense pleasure from indulging in a cold beer or two while enjoying the cinematic experience.

On a recent Saturday, my spouse and I accompanied our family to witness the cinematic masterpiece known as Captain America. Unfortunately, I had not had the opportunity to partake in dinner prior to the screening, so I opted to sample some of the delectable offerings available at the concession stand. While the cost of my meal ($19) could be considered somewhat prohibitive, I must admit that the culinary delight that I received was well worth the expenditure. The bratwurst, in particular, was a veritable gastronomic revelation, with four distinct varieties to choose from (cheese jalapeÃ±o, brat, beef dog, and another option that escapes my memory), all of which were adorned with an assortment of genuine toppings, including sauerkraut, lettuce, cheese, and a pickle, among others. To say that I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the bratwurst would be an understatement.

In conclusion, I must reiterate that the Galaxy Theater has consistently delivered an exceptional experience on each and every occasion that I have had the privilege of visiting. Furthermore, I feel compelled to divulge that presenting one's ticket stub at the adjacent yogurt shop will result in a modest discount, a fact that may prove advantageous to those who seek to augment their cinematic excursion with a frozen treat.",True,4622.0,formal

 We have sampled their chicken club pizza on multiple occasions, and it has consistently met our expectations, boasting an abundance of fresh toppings and a cooking method that has resulted in a crispy crust complemented by a flavorsome sauce. 
 In addition, we have attempted their white pizza, which, although palatable, could potentially benefit from an increased quantity of garlic, according to my personal taste preferences; however, this may merely be a subjective observation. 
 Furthermore, we have shared orders of chicken fingers and garlic parmesan chips during a midday meal, and both dishes have proven to be delectable options. The chicken fingers possess a satisfying crunch on the exterior, while maintaining tenderness and juiciness within, accompanied by a flavorsome batter and a dipping sauce made from honey mustard that has been well-received. The garlic chips, though slightly greasy due to their novel preparation, have delighted our taste buds with their sublime texture and rich flavor.

Erica was thorough in communicating the directions, painted so I could not only hear the  instructions, but see her technique as she painted the same project according to her verbal instructions.  With approximately thirty other painters in the private room at Nacho Daddy,  I appreciated having a second artist helping Erica on the floor and both of them answered the couple questions I had about technique and how to improve a particular area on my painting.  Both of them were extremely helpful and came around often to refill paints and provide positive feedback and encouragement.  Erica encouraged creativity for those more adventurous folks and really seemed to enjoy teaching all of us the techniques required for everyone to go home with a one of a kind painting in just a couple short hours. For anyone looking to attend a paint party, I would strongly encourage you to check out Vegas Painting Parties!  I will definitely be going back sometime soon!",,,informal

""Elegant ambiance, ambient illumination, and proximity to various LCD televisions facilitate an optimal dining experience at this establishment. The culinary offerings are indeed delectable, and I would highly recommend the $25 teriyaki chicken entree. Unlike the conventional preparation methods employed by other eateries, Sushisamba's interpretation of chicken teriyaki is truly exceptional. Upon presentation, the dish consisted of succulent, flavorful chicken situated atop a bed of vibrant purple mashed potatoes. The juxtaposition of textures and flavors was utterly delightful, as the potatoes provided a pleasing contrast to the tender, moist chicken. Furthermore, the subtle infusion of teriyaki sauce complemented the dish without overpowering the natural flavors of the ingredients. In conjunction with the mashed potatoes, this creation proved to be an unparalleled gastronomic indulgence. Additionally, the sushi options available at Sushisamba merit consideration. Unlike customary sushi presentations, these rolls are gently enveloped in rice, thereby allowing the inherent flavors of the components to take center stage. Although the kobe beef roll was somewhat lackluster, the assortment of diverse rolls showcased innovative combinations of ingredients. However, I must caution against the selection of oysters, as they fail to distinguish themselves from the norm.""",True,4720.0,formal

1. Its proximity to the canal and 48th bike trails makes it easily accessible from Old Town and Arcadia via bicycle.  
2. It features a spacious 'backyard-style' patio, which is accessible by bicycle, and provides borrowable locks and a plethora of functional bike decorations, such as fan-like bike wheels and illuminating bike chains.  
3. It boasts a dog-friendly patio, which has accommodated as many as fifteen canines during our previous visit.  
4. The atmosphere is characterized by a convivial crowd and an impressive selection of beers.  
We have yet to dine within the premises, but the patio offers a unique experience with its picturesque views of Camelback, lively crowd, and dog-watching opportunities, and on Sundays, an all-you-can-eat BBQ for $15 (which constitutes a substantial amount of food).  
They offer an extensive array of draft beers at reasonable prices, including a Papago Brewery-crafted Orange Blossom beer, which happens to be one of my favorites.  
The pricing for both draft beers and food is reasonable and aligns well with the overall experience.
