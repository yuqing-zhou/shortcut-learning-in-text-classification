1," I have had the pleasure of dining at Bouchon on multiple occasions, and I must say that my expectations were not entirely met during my most recent visit. Specifically, I had the misfortune of ordering the short ribs, which were unfortunately comprised primarily of adipose tissue. Needless to say, I was rather dismayed by this discovery and opted to replace said dish with something more suitable. Following a brief consultation with my dining companions, we decided upon the lamb and strip steak as alternatives. While these selections were undoubtedly an upgrade from their predecessors, they failed to meet the exceptionally high standards that I have come to associate with establishments bearing the illustrious Thomas Keller name. It is my sincere hope that Bouchon will take the necessary steps to rectify this unfortunate situation, as I am reluctant to dismiss it altogether as a viable dining option.",True,7.0,formal

When we got our food, it was in a different container and we didn't open it til we got home. There were 2 small pieces of meat with a little bit of sauce. This measly portion could have fit in the small to-go container that was $3 cheaper. \n\nWe called the restaurant to complain about the small serving size we got and the lady on the phone ask two asked us things that turned me from irritated and a little upset to angry and outraged. First she asked it we were regulars then if I was Filipino.\n\nHmmm..I didn't know that their level of customer service was based on restaurant loyalty and nationality.

In contrast, the shrimp and Al Pastor tacos, accompanied by saffron rice and a surcharge of $2 for sweet plantains, possessed satisfactory flavors, although the plantains displayed evidence of burning and stickiness.

""I indulged my family with a dining experience at this establishment on Mother's Day, and regrettably, it failed to meet expectations. The management demonstrated avarice by overbooking and underpreparing for the influx of patrons. Moreover, the ambient temperature was oppressively warm, and the fans proved ineffectual in providing respite from the heat. The absence of misting systems further compounded the discomfort. Our server, though industrious, struggled to keep up with the demands of the numerous tables, resulting in an extended delay in the replenishment of our water glasses. It is worth noting that the location was Las Vegas, and the month was May, which warrants adequate preparation, particularly for a table costing $600. Our reserved table was tardy by thirty minutes, and the ensuing wait for our initial course prolonged for approximately one hour. The fare, while palatable, lacked distinction and appeared formulaic. The piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance was the hostess's unaware utterance of an obscenity upon discovering both restrooms engaged, unbeknownst to her, by my five-year-old niece and another patron. This incident encapsulated the frenzied and flustered demeanor of the staff. I must confess that my affection for this venue has waned due to the subpar service and culinary offerings.

I will list the good points:\nLocation: this is on the center strip, which is close to a lot of other hotels (for shows, conferences)\nMargaritaville: A nice restaurant with an upper deck view\nThe garden: The garden has Flamingoes and is very peaceful\nThe staff: very nice, polite\nCons: This hotel reeks of smoke, everywhere,  I used to smoke, so I understand and am not condemning. But when you ask for a non-smoking room, it should not smell like someone has nuck into your room and is hiding to smoke a cigarette. This resulted in a miserable stay (allergies). \nIf you are catching an airport shuttle in, you will have to walk a block with your baggage to the hotel, back entrance, \nThere was a roach near the ice machine--but this may be secondary to the fact that someone dumped a salad on the floor, and it sat there for two days--after all, natural selection dictates that you need to do what you can to survive--and this roach was doing what he could to get to that salad.\nWhen the room was booked, I booked a room with a refrigerator, and was provided with a styrofoam cooler.\n There was a leak, in the first room .

As a client with an impeccable record of 24 years with this financial institution and an exceptional credit score of 800, I cannot fathom how they would treat customers who have not had the pleasure of banking with them. Furthermore, the supervisor whom I contacted at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage (16211 N Scottsdale Rd., Ste A-1 | Scottsdale, AZ 85254), proved to be futile in addressing my grievances regarding Michael Jordan's performance. Linda Baker, the Loan Doc Specialist, displayed an unprofessional demeanor when dealing with me, and her conduct left much to be desired. In light of these events, I strongly advise potential clients to avoid engaging with these individuals and Wells Fargo Bank altogether. I intend to terminate all of my accounts with this institution forthwith.",True,159.0,formal

Upon entering the premises for the first and, I assure you, last time, I was struck by the utter lack of flavor and warmth in the food presented before me. Furthermore, the service we received was nothing short of abysmal, with a palpable sense of apathy and disinterest emanating from the staff members who, after an interminable wait, eventually deigned to attend to our needs. It is worth noting that, despite the dearth of patrons in the establishment at the time of our visit, the staff seemed to be in a state of utmost urgency, as if they had more pressing engagements to attend to than ensuring the satisfaction of their few remaining customers. Lamentably, the culinary offerings of the establishment in question pale in comparison to those of its competitors, such as the venerable Burger King, located mere steps away. In light of these considerations, it is my conviction that the longevity of this particular eatery is unlikely to extend beyond a fleeting moment in the vast expanse of time.""",True,212.0,formal

1," ""US Today necessitates a thorough cognitive evaluation, given the glaring discrepancies in the quality of their brunch buffet offerings, particularly when juxtaposed with the superior options available at Bellagio and the exceptional Cosmopolitan. A paltry selection of uninspiring dishes, including desiccated brisket and unremarkable sausages, constituted the bulk of the meager spread. Furthermore, the seafood bar, devoid of any genuine seafood delicacies, only served to accentuate the disappointing nature of the experience. A minuscule cup, containing a scant amount of questionable shrimp and crab fragments, did little to assuage our hunger. Following this underwhelming excursion into gastronomy, a substantial quantity of revitalizing green tea was imperative to efface the lingering, unpleasant flavors from our palates. The desserts, unfortunately, continued this inconsistent pattern, with the gelato being the sole redeeming feature amidst an array of unappetizing selections, such as the arid, miniature chocolate mousse portions and the overly sweetened pecan tarts. Additional green tea was required to counteract the saccharine excess. Ironically, the most satisfying aspect of the buffet emanated from a raw fuji apple, a fruit requiring no culinary preparation whatsoever, thereby underscoring the superfluous nature of the hotel's efforts. In light of these glaring deficiencies, it is advisable to dismiss the surrounding hype and avoid this gastronomic disappointment altogether.""",True,245.0,formal

On the one hand, the chef's expertise is undeniable, as he demonstrates a remarkable ability to create delectable breakfast burritos that are unparalleled in quality. His hospitable nature and dedication to remembering customers' preferences only enhance the dining experience. Particularly noteworthy is the bacon-infused variant, which can be further elevated by the addition of jalapenos for an added layer of flavor. However, when it comes to the midday meal, the restaurant's offerings become somewhat predictable and lackluster, with one dish being slightly above average, another being nearly inedible, and the third falling squarely in the realm of mediocrity. While the cuisine satisfies the criteria for affordable and expedient sustenance, the consistently unfriendly demeanor of the cashier unfortunately detracts from the overall enjoyment of the meal.

1," I inhabit Henderson and undertake frequent travels on an almost weekly basis.  The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) exhibits inconsistency in their performance, oscillating between proficiency and inefficacy, thereby necessitating fortuitousness on the part of travelers.
 My concern revolves around the TSA Pre-Check program. Residing in the vicinity, I opt for the convenience of the tram at Gate C, which offers a more seamless experience, especially since I tend not to check bags. Unfortunately, this particular entrance does not provide TSA PreCheck services, despite the fact that the D gates, situated adjacent to the C gate queue, do offer this amenity.
 It is worth mentioning that, initially, they did attempt to implement TSA PreCheck at the C gates, but unfortunately, this initiative was short-lived. On my most recent journey, I decided to venture through the D gates, hoping to gain entry to the C gates via a TSA agent. To my dismay, no one was present to facilitate my passage. As I attempted to exit, two TSA officers entered, and their reaction was less than cordial, demanding to know my destination in a rather brusque manner. Moreover, they displayed skepticism when I pointed out the C-gate PreCheck sign, and I was compelled to display my boarding pass. Subsequently, I was forced to exit.
 On subsequent occasions, I chose to proceed directly to the primary C-Gate (Southwest) security area, whereupon displaying my boarding pass, I was directed toward a special queue that meandered along the wall, leading to a solitary TSA agent stationed at a TSA PreCheck booth. Regrettably, this line tends to be quite lengthy, often comprising ten to twelve individuals.
 It is important to note that there are two additional TSA agents positioned at a nearby stand, both of whom display TSA PreCheck signs, allowing any individual to join their line and subsequently benefit from the PreCheck privilege. Furthermore, access to these alternative stations is unavailable from the primary TSA PreCheck line.",True,254.0,formal

He forgot our orders and had to come back and ask, brought somebody the wrong drink and somebody else got the wrong entree, and to top it off, he charged us for more food than we actually ordered. Luckily one of my coworkers caught the mistake. We talked to the manager and he gave us extra game cards which really didn't make up for the horrible service but at least it was something. I do not recommend this place for food",,,informal

I can only assume that most have never eaten outstanding Jewish deli food, and, as often happens with reviews on Yelp, a lack of reference points leads to a misevaluation.\n\nPeople need to understand what Greenberg's is. It's essentially a fast food version of an authentic Jewish deli--a replica that has the basic look and feel of an authentic deli, but not the food quality or soul. This is obviously a common phenomenon on the Vegas Strip.\n\nFolks who've been to the great delis, like Katz's in NYC, Lester's in Montreal, Canter's in Los Angeles, or any of the other great delis, know what real Jewish deli food tastes like. They know what real matzo ball soup tastes like, and what the best pastrami tastes like. \n\nGreenberg's is a 2-star deli at best, and, quite honestly, is just a fast food version of a Jewish deli.

Ich wollte heute auf dem Ochsenfest in Hagsfeld eine Kugel Eis f\u00fcr meinen kleinen Sohn kaufen und habe um einen Pappbecher (!!!) gebeten (der Kleine hat eine Milchallergie und darf keine Waffel). Die Dame sagte mir, dass es bei einer Kugel nur eine Waffel gibt und ich 20c aufzahlen m\u00fcsste. Da die Kugel bereits EUR 0,90 kostet, war ich hierzu nicht bereit. Ich pers\u00f6nlich finde das kein gutes Gesch\u00e4ftsgebahren zudem die Preise pro Kugel schon happig sind.Heute bin ich an dieser netten Eisdiele vorbeigeradelt. Eine nette Eisverk\u00e4uferin hat mir ein Eis mit zwei Kugeln verkauft. Bis dahin glatte 5 Sterne  nett, authentisch, sauber. Das Eis allerdings hat mich nicht begeistert. Zitrone war noch ok, aber bei dem Heidelbeer Eis hatte ich ich das Gef\u00fchl in einen Schneeball zu bei\u00dfen. Eiskristalle, die auch zu sehen waren. Nichts cremiges, sondern eher so der aufgetaut und dann wieder eingefroren Effekt (wobei ich das nicht unterstellen m\u00f6chte).

However, my personal experience at this establishment was markedly different. Upon entering, I was immediately struck by the eclectic array of items on display, including various militaria, antiques, and knick-knacks; nevertheless, upon closer inspection, I quickly realized that the vast majority of these items were, in fact, worthless trash that the proprietor, a surly and unfriendly individual, was attempting to pawn off at exorbitant prices. Despite my initial enthusiasm, I was ultimately disappointed and disenchanted with the shop's contents, which largely consisted of broken, damaged, or otherwise useless items. Furthermore, when I expressed interest in purchasing a particular street sign, I was met with resistance and was informed that it would cost me Â£30, a price I deemed excessive. Subsequently, I noticed that the same sign was prominently displayed in the shop's window, accompanied by several other seemingly valuable items, all of which were assigned an eye-watering price tag of Â£45. In light of my underwhelming experience, I would advise potential patrons to avoid visiting Le Chariot, as the vast majority of its inventory consists of worthless junk.",True,279.0,formal

""Mellow Mushroom, an ostensibly 'hip' pizzeria chain, has unfortunately succumbed to the pernicious plague of racism that insidiously permeates the fabric of our society, rendering its ambiance utterly unpalatable for any individual who values the principles of equality and respect. Compelled by a sense of civic duty to share my recent experience at this establishment, I must confess that I have never felt compelled to compose a review prior to this occasion, such was the egregious nature of the bigotry I witnessed. To describe my distaste for this restaurant as merely 'terrible' would be an egregious understatement, for it is in point of fact a grotesque affront to the very notion of inclusivity and diversity. Were it possible, I would assign a rating of negative one hundred stars, for even the most cursory examination of their policies and practices reveals a reprehensible lack of concern for the well-being of marginalized communities.

I had the pleasure of visiting this establishment in 2010, when it first opened its doors to the public, and I must say that the culinary offerings and the demeanor of the staff were truly exceptional! Fast forward to my recent visit, and I was utterly dismayed by the stark contrast in the quality of service. The staff, with the exception of one individual, exhibited an unfortunate lack of enthusiasm and warmth, which made me feel like a burden rather than a valued patron. My server, in particular, seemed perturbed whenever I requested a replenishment of my beverage or placed an additional order, evoking the sentiment that I was interrupting her from a task of paramount importance. It is unfortunate that this eatery, which once showed great promise, has succumbed to such a precipitous decline in standards. The cuisine, although still palatable, cannot compensate for the deficiency in hospitable treatment. There are numerous alternative sushi restaurants in the eastern region of the valley that offer comparable gastronomical delights, accompanied by a vastly superior level of customer service. This establishment's descent into mediocrity is indeed a lamentable occurrence.""",True,320.0,formal

I have had the pleasure of visiting Las Vegas on multiple occasions prior to this instance, but never accompanied by my children and never lodged at Circus Circus. This particular hotel was the sole establishment that offered accommodations on a Saturday evening, situated on the renowned Strip, which appeared suitable for families and was within a budget of $250.00. Upon arriving at the reception area, I was assured by the staff member that all of the rooms were well-appointed, and I inadvertently overheard another guest remarking that some of the rooms had indeed undergone renovations. Evidently, mine was not among those that had received such enhancements. My lodging at the Sky Tower, which cost approximately $130.00, featured a room that exuded an atmosphere akin to that of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The bed linens were riddled with holes, the aesthetic of the space was uninspiring, and the ambiance en route to the room conveyed an impression of antiquity and neglect. In hindsight, it would have been more judicious to avoid this hotel and instead opt for a different establishment, as my children expressed disappointment with the Adventuredome and professed a preference for theme parks such as Six Flags or Knott's Berry Farm.",True,321.0,formal

""It is my ardent desire to have composed a more comprehensive and laudatory assessment of this establishment, as my interaction with the mechanic was quite pleasant and engendered a sense of confidence in the expediency and proficiency of the impending repairs. However, subsequent events have unfortunately conspired against such an effusive appraisal. My vehicle required several necessary fixes, which, given the scope of the work involved, I had anticipated would require at least a couple of days to complete and potentially cost upwards of a thousand dollars. To my satisfaction, the task was successfully executed, and my automobile passed the requisite emissions test. Unfortunately, a mere day after retrieving my vehicle, the check engine light illuminated, and my air conditioning system ceased functioning properly. Upon inspecting the engine compartment, I observed various loose bolts adjacent to the battery, whose replacement was purportedly included in the services rendered, and a mysterious rag tucked away on the opposite side of the hood. Furthermore, the protective plastic casing originally situated on the negative battery cable lay abandoned next to the valve cover, instead of being reattached or disposed of appropriately. Most disconcertingly, the wiring harness, which had been accessed during the repair process, remained unwrapped, with the specific wire that had been worked on left entirely exposed.

Having resided at this property since 2005, I can attest to the fact that it has devolved into a draconian regime, whereupon once having incurred their disfavor, they relentlessly pursue an unremitting vendetta against the offending party. I received a notification citing me for reckless driving in the parking lot during a month in which I was abroad, which serves as a prime exemplification of their capricious modus operandi. Upon bringing this discrepancy to their attention, I was met with a dismissive and flippant response, wherein I was informed that during my absence, I am accountable for any individual operating my vehicle, despite the fact that it remained securely ensconced within my garage throughout the duration of my sojourn. No other person possessed the means of accessing the vehicle, rendering the accusation utterly specious and further illustrating the HOA's proclivity for harassment.

1," This was our second encounter with the emergency room, and it was even more deplorable than the previous instance. Our three-year-old daughter was transported via ambulance to this ER, and the personnel demonstrated a complete lack of proficiency in caring for a child. Despite her stable vital signs and cooperative demeanor, they were unable to obtain an accurate temperature or urine sample without my active participation and recommendations. Furthermore, they employed an adult-sized blood pressure cuff, neglecting to inspect her ears and diagnose the severe infection she was suffering from. The 'STAT/emergency' blood and urine tests were sent outside the facility, requiring two days to yield results, which is utterly unacceptable. To exacerbate matters, the physician, Dr. Kent, displayed discourteous behavior and appeared oblivious to the appropriate course of action. We promptly transported our daughter to a different medical facility as soon as she was able to leave, where she finally received adequate care after enduring hours of neglect and subpar treatment. This experience was nothing short of a fiasco. Previously, a family member was transferred to this ER following an accident, and the situation was equally appalling. Moreover, my mother required surgical intervention, and her physician advised against performing it at Mercy Gilbert due to the incompetence of the staff, despite having privileges at the hospital.

In the event that one manages to procure a suitable pair at a discounted price, it may serve as a financial advantage; however, apart from this rare occurrence, this location has noticeably deteriorated in both commerce and customer service.

The two more desirable pieces were promptly sold as soon as their prices were lowered, whereas the third, less desirable item, remained unsold despite never being discounted.

In light of this episode, I have come to realize that there are numerous consignment shops that operate with a 60-day waiting period before implementing price reductions and splitting profits equally with the seller. Consequently, if you possess a high-quality item, I would strongly advise seeking alternative venues for its sale.""",True,519.0,formal

Subsequently, a tow truck driver recommended a repair shop that supposedly possessed the expertise to rectify the issue efficiently. Upon arriving at the facility, the technician declared that the process of replacing the alternator would be arduous due to its location, and thus, demanded an exorbitant fee of $385 for both parts and labor. Despite my initial reluctance, I relented and authorized the repair. However, fast forward to the present, my vehicle has accumulated 120,000 miles, and the same alternator issue has recurred, albeit with only 50,000 miles on the replacement unit. When I contacted the establishment to inquire about their warranty policy, they refused to honor it.

""Greetings! My spouse and I have been inhabiting a residential unit within the Crosswinds apartment complex located in Chandler, Arizona. Lamentably, we have not been experiencing an optimal living environment due to the presence of Blattodea, commonly known as cockroaches, which have been proliferating at an alarming rate. The pest control measures implemented by the management have been inadequate, as the utilization of peanut butter in the cabinetry has served only to exacerbate the infestation, resulting in a sizable colony of Periplaneta americana taking up residence within our convection oven, a kitchen appliance gifted to us on the occasion of our nuptials and valued at a sum of three hundred dollars.

I have had the privilege of visiting your esteemed establishment on a previous occasion, and while I must commend you on your valiant efforts to emulate the culinary prowess of BASHA'S illustrious bakeries, I regret to inform you that your offerings, despite their comparatively affordable pricing, fall short of the lofty standards set by your competitors.

However, it is not solely the quality of your products that leaves much to be desired, but also the deplorable state of your customer service. As I perused the Yelp reviews, I was taken aback by the numerous complaints regarding the dispiriting nature of your counter staff. It appears that the dearth of cordiality and hospitality extends beyond the confines of your eatery, as even the proprietor herself, a woman of considerable girth and advanced years, seems to exude an air of disdain towards her patrons.

In light of these findings, I feel compelled to advise against pursuing the misguided notion of masquerading as a New York-style establishment. Rather, I implore you to reconcile yourself to your shortcomings and focus on refining your craft, lest you continue to perpetuate a faux pas of gastronomic proportions.

The coffee served is unremarkable, the eggs are merely adequate, the bacon is inexcusably chewy, and the lyonnaise potatoes are reprehensibly limp, with the latter two items suffering from an excessive absorption of the aforementioned artificial spread. In light of these circumstances, it is strongly advised that individuals seek alternative dining options, such as Coca CafÃ© or Square CafÃ© for a more refined experience, or DeLuca's or JoJo's for a more casual, unpretentious meal. Indeed, this writer would readily opt for the uninspired, institutional offerings of Eat 'n Park over the gastronomic monstrosity that is Pamela's. At least the former establishment has acquainted itself with the concept of butter.",True,626.0,formal

We decided it would be fun to see a traditional Vegas showgirl performance, and, well, Jubilee! is apparently the only one left.\n\nLack of competition should be no excuse for the mess that we saw. Oh Lord!\nFirst of all, we bought discount tickets and my friends each said that the show wasn't even worth the 50% markdown. I didn't mind as much, because I was intoxicated and at least got a good laugh.\n\nThis review is not a criticism of the talent. Most of the performers were fit and good at what they did, although there were a few outliers... \n\nThere were a few scenes that had all the pomp and circumstance that I expected, like the Samson and Delilah scene... and the finale.\n\nBut overall there were waaaay too many males onstage (is that normal? Idk but it was unexpected), and it was SO SO disjointed. The show was just a thrown together mess of scenes- all over the place chronologically, not enough showgirl stuff, and some of the most God-awful music.\n\nThe classic recognizable songs were okay, but often matched to boring and redundant choreography.  The Beyonce references were random and irrelevant, which is sad because I am a Beyonce fan.\n\nAll in all, it was very much a middle-school caliber show in terms of plot/theme/cohesiveness, which is not Vegas-appropriate, to say the least.\n\nI sincerely hope someone steps in and fixes this mess because it would be SO sad if the showgirl went extinct!

1," I would never consider returning to this establishment again, under any circumstances. While attending a technological symposium in the vicinity, I encountered considerable difficulties with the internet connectivity, both within the conference venue and the guest rooms themselves. The wireless and wired networks were incredibly unreliable, leading me to question their efficacy. Furthermore, the aesthetic ambiance of the accommodations left much to be desired, with an antiquated decor that seemed frozen in time. However, the most distressing aspect of my stay occurred during my first morning, when I encountered a regrettable situation while shaving. Specifically, one sink became clogged with my water, while the other sink simultaneously backed up with a noxious, dark liquid. This was not only inconvenient but also posed a potential health hazard. Additionally, I had cause to complain about the absence of an adequate seal at the base of the adjoining door between my suite and its neighbor. As a result, I was able to overhear every sound emanating from the adjacent room with startling clarity, making me feel as though I was essentially sharing a room with the occupants next door. Insistent on a change of accommodations, I requested and received a transfer to a different room. Unfortunately, my final morning in this new room was marred by an eerie gurgling noise, followed by an unmistakable foul odor. Upon entering the bathroom, I was appalled to discover black liquid rising up through the shower drain. I promptly reported this disturbing incident upon checkout, only to be met with an attitude of indifference from the staff. It is my firm belief that any reputable hospitality establishment would have made a concerted effort to address and rectify such issues. However, it appears that Harrah's does not share this commitment to customer satisfaction, which is truly disconcerting.",True,635.0,formal

1," If you are seeking an unparalleled dining experience that embodies the essence of mediocrity, then look no further than Diablos, where the culinary offerings are reminiscent of a novice chef's futile attempt at creating a semblance of Mexican cuisine. Tragically, the fare served at this establishment is tantamount to an insult to the rich gastronomic heritage of Mexico, with dishes that are seemingly concocted by an individual who has never ventured beyond the confines of their own kitchen.

The ambiance, too, is an affront to the senses, with a decor that appears to be the result of a haphazard assortment of items procured from a local thrift store. The lighting is dim, casting an eerie pallor upon the already unappetizing victuals, while the soundtrack, a cacophony of clashing notes, serves only to exacerbate the overall feeling of discomfort.

My visit occurred during the so-called ""happy hour,"" a time when one might expect a modicum of festivity or, at the very least, a cursory attempt at creating a convivial atmosphere. Alas, such expectations are swiftly dashed upon entering the premises, as the staff, seemingly apathetic to the presence of patrons, display a marked indifference to the notion of customer service.

My order, a pitcher of mango margaritas, was prepared with all the finesse of a novice bartender, utilizing canned kerns nectar and house tequila, rather than the promised premium tequila listed on the menu. The end result was a drink that could charitably be described as ""inadequate.""

The nachos, too, were an unmitigated disappointment, resembling as they did two-hour-old leftovers from a gas station convenience store. The taco platter, my main course, was an unfortunate concatenation of flavors, each one more bland than the last, resulting in a culinary experience that was utterly devoid of even a hint of pleasure.

In conclusion, I would strongly advise against patronizing this establishment, unless, of course, one's sole criterion for dining out is the ability to consume subpar liquor in copious quantities while enduring reprehensible customer service and an atmosphere that can only be described as ""dismal.""",True,644.0,formal

I was only going to stay for two nights, and by the time I had decided to go the Bellagio rates were higher than I wanted to pay for given the quick stay over.  Since Planet Hollywood was just across the street from the Bellagio, and the rate seemed reasonable, I decided to stay there.\nI won't say that it was a horrible experience, but I was definitely disappointed.  The rooms are dated and didn't feel exceptionally clean.  The decor has a 1990's vibe to it.  I'm not sure how much of it is carryover from the Aladdin revamp prior, but it wasn't up to what I would consider \""current Strip standards\"".  It seems appropriate that this is Britney Spears anchor arena for her shows - it has a slightly \""trashy\"" feel to it. \nSome of the issues that I had regarding the room were:\n- missing front of one of the drawers\n- strange odor from the faucet water in sink\n- pull chain shades that kept sticking\nI can see being in my 20's and coming here to have a raging time, but those days are a little bit behind me at this point and would rather opt for comfort and modern amenities (like at Aria) than \""just a place to crash\"" at the end of a long night.",,,informal

Buffets in Las Vegas that are good are slammed with people even the mediocre ones have lines.  This place, was dead at 7 pm on a Wednesday.  We go out to eat on Wednesdays and we sometimes go to Buffets.  When we do go to Buffets they are slammed with people and have long lines.  This place you just walk right on up, pay you money and go grab a plate.  Problem is, is that buffets rely on turn over so the food doesn't just sit under the heat lamps and get old.  This place had nothing but food under the heat lamps that looked old.  They had Prime Rib but every last piece of it was cooked well done.  The whole place was terrible food.

The teriyaki vegetable consisted of STEAMED carrots, cauliflower, and broccoli made from frozen vegetables.  There was a minimal amount of some kind of ginger soy sauce almost sprinkled on. The veggies were floating in water since it appears they were microwaved and barely drained. This was $8 and the worst attempt at a teriyaki dish that I've ever seen.

Upon entering, the venue appeared tidy and well-decorated. We arrived on a Thursday evening and the crowd was moderately dense. The gentleman manning the bar seemed to be novice, as he displayed a lack of familiarity with their offerings. Our charcoal remained unchanged throughout our duration, despite numerous requests. En route to the restroom, I encountered our server, and respectfully requested that she replace our charcoal. She agreed but failed to follow through. Several minutes later, a different female staff member approached, inquiring about our well-being. I brought to her attention the neglect regarding our charcoal replacement. She vanished momentarily, only to return, assuring us that someone would attend to us shortly. Unfortunately, no one ever came. Due to the persistent disregard for our needs, we opted to proceed directly to the bar area to settle our account. It is worth mentioning that my companion and I were the sole Asian patrons within the premises. This detail may have played a role in the discourteous service we received, as a server nearby attended to adjacent booths yet deliberately bypassed us. Should you not identify with the dominant demographic, it is unlikely that you will receive favorable treatment at this establishment. We certainly did not.",True,690.0,formal

1," ""My inclination to indulge in fast food during happy hour has been a recurring phenomenon, and I have never encountered any difficulties in paying the designated prices for takeout. However, my recent visit to America's Taco Shop on 16th and Camelback proved to be an exception to this trend. Specifically, I was taken aback by the exorbitant cost of two carne asada tacos and a single order of chips and salsa, which amounted to a staggering $8.09. As a new resident of the city, hailing from another state, I found this price point to be particularly egregious, especially when juxtaposed with the more reasonable cost of a burrito. Compelled by fiscal prudence, I opted to modify my order forthwith. Unfortunately, the gentleman tasked with processing my order displayed a conspicuous lack of enthusiasm, bordering on acrimony, upon having to cancel my initial order. His demeanor was utterly unprofessional and conveyed a glaring dearth of concern for customer satisfaction. Given the dearth of patrons within the establishment at the time, his behavior was all the more perplexing. I felt compelled to vacate the premises with alacrity, never having experienced such discomfort within a fast food setting. Moreover, the prospect of consuming their culinary offerings became decidedly less appealing in light of the unsavory encounter. Following a perusal of Yelp reviews, I was gratified to discover that my decision to seek alternative dining options was indeed wise.

It is thoroughly unfortunate that it is not feasible to post a rating of zero stars, for it would accurately reflect the subpar quality of service provided by 777 Towing. Do not squander your time and resources by engaging with this particular company, as it is abundantly evident that their modus operandi revolves around woefully inadequate communication and an apparent lack of concern for the well-being of their clientele. Should your insurance provider inform you that 777 Towing will be dispatched to assist you, it is advisable to request an alternative service provider, as the former's proficiency in fulfilling their obligations leaves much to be desired.

Given the fact that the estimated time of arrival for 777 Towing's services was repeatedly pushed back by increments of 30-35 minutes, culminating in an indefinite delay due to an alleged breakdown of their vehicle, it becomes glaringly obvious that reliability is not a trait that this enterprise holds in high regard. Moreover, the absence of forthright communication regarding the aforementioned mechanical issue serves as a testament to the company's propensity for obfuscation and dearth of transparency.

In stark contrast, the efficiency and dependability displayed by the alternate towing company contracted by your insurance provider exemplifies the hallmarks of a reputable and customer-centric organization, arriving punctually as promised and mitigating the perilous circumstances posed by the stranded vehicle. It is imperative to exercise caution and prudence when selecting a towing service, lest you fall prey to the ineptitude and unprofessionalism that 777 Towing has demonstrated.",True,820.0,formal

We were served our starter fairly quickly and I can't fault the Garlic Bread - it was definitely the best part of the meal. Our main meals took a while to come out and when they were eventually brought to us my chicken was pink/undercooked. I ended up eating a few chips and accidentally ate half a chicken fillet before realising it wasn't cooked properly. We didn't bother staying for dessert. The service was subpar and the restaurant is definitely overpriced for the portions that you get, when we got our bill we were certain they'd counted it wrong. The interior of the seating area is nice but the toilets were fairly horrendous. The ceiling had some kind of mould or something growing on it. I was so so gutted that my visit here was disappointing but hey, at least I'll know never to return.",,,informal

My assessment is as follows: Aush (beef yogurt soup infused with mint, garlic, et al.) - A tad too acidic for my palate, yet otherwise sublime (I am also assuming less piquant than the customary rendition). Aubergines (or eggplant) - Once again, excessively tart for my liking, and inferior to its Indian counterpart (which features a more judicious caramelization of ingredients). Afghani naan - Appeared homemade, but lacked tenderness and possessed an unpleasant chewiness, thereby conforming to the traditional naan formula. Turkish coffee - Rich and flavorsome\n\nHospitality: Commendable and quite helpful, despite their evident wariness towards the multitude of queries I posed\n\nSecond Attempt: A resounding disappointment. Entered the establishment for the luncheon buffet, harboring hopes of savoring delectable fare, given their extensive selection. Alas, each dish was prepared haphazardly. Their lamb soup, augmented with lentils, had spoiled (and would subsequently cause me to experience this meal multiple times throughout the day).

I habitually procure a substantial quantity of orders during each instance, and have hitherto been content with the culinary offerings. However, whenever I request curry, they pose the query regarding the intensity of spiciness on a scale ranging from 1 to 5, and I customarily respond with a rating of 3. Nonetheless, upon receipt of my order, everyone who partakes of it expresses their sentiment that it resembles a rating of 5 in terms of piquancy, which is unfailingly 10 to 15 minutes behind schedule. It is rather vexing that they profess a specific duration of waiting time when they are unable to adhere to it punctually, particularly when I consistently place sizable orders, remunerate delivery charges, and extend generous gratuities! Notwithstanding these factors, I persist in placing orders, and on one occasion, I requested curry and specified a rating of 1 out of 5, mindful of the fact that there was no discernible divergence in the fiery nature of the curry relative to the customary rating of 3 we had previously employed. This continued unabated until the present day, whereupon I am indisposed and opted for soups and curry. She inquired about my preference for spiciness and was apprised that I did not relish it pungent, not even at a rating of 1 out of 5, given my current state of health. She conveyed an estimated waiting period of 30 to 40 minutes, to which I assented. And lo and behold! The wait extended beyond an hour, and the curry? It was excessively fiery! I am simply incensed by their consistent tardiness in deliveries and their ineffectuality in upholding the designated levels of spiciness, and it is my conviction that they should refrain from inquiring about the degree of spiciness desired by patrons, since they demonstrate a lack of proficiency in maintaining uniform standards across the spectrum of intensities ranging from 0 to 5.""",True,861.0,formal

Furthermore, the selection of sauces was disappointingly meager, consisting of a few thick, gloppy varieties that were served in small metal ramekins. It is worth noting that the starch component of the dish was provided in the form of noodles or rice, although the latter was conspicuous by its absence following cooking.

Additionally, replenishing one's beverage requires proactive planning, as the likelihood of receiving a refill in a timely manner is low, unless the current drink is nearly depleted.

After so much time spent with the 2 teachers, I had grown to admire, respect, and like them both. They never returned my email or talked to me again. We got an email from the director who, despite our time in the classroom, dismissed all of our concerns and disinvited our son from the school. This was very painful and unexpected. But it was the best thing for him. We got him into a play based school & helped toilet train, & provided food, & was cheaper, & had better hours, & had fewer holidays .

1," We arrived at this establishment with the expectation of partaking in a delectable morning repast, based on the acclaim bestowed upon it by various online review platforms. However, it appears that we may have selected an inopportune moment to visit, as evidenced by the prolonged duration required to receive beverages and place our orders (approximately 10-15 minutes). Furthermore, our request for a creamer was not fulfilled in a timely manner, as the gentleman responsible for attending to our needs failed to return with the requested item, despite his initial assurance that he would do so. Instead, we were compelled to solicit the assistance of a busboy, who provided us with a soiled creamer replete with fresh jam residue on its base. Upon requesting a substitute creamer from our server, we were eventually furnished with a replacement. Disappointingly, our culinary selections did not meet our expectations. Specifically, the eggs benedict dishes we ordered (Florentine and crab, respectively) were subpar. The Florentine iteration was particularly underwhelming, as the eggs were unacceptably runny, and the asparagus components were minuscule and fragmented. As an ardent devotee of eggs florentine, I was taken aback by the absence of fresh asparagus, which was replaced by what appeared to be chopped artichoke hearts. Additionally, the English muffins accompanying our dishes were excessively buttered, thereby detracting from the overall quality of the meal. Ultimately, our experience at this venue was unsatisfactory, with the coffee being the sole redeeming aspect of our visit. Perhaps our selection of dishes was not optimal, leading to our disappointment with the restaurant's offerings.",True,886.0,formal

As an individual hailing from India, I possess a discerning palate that can readily distinguish between freshly prepared dishes and those that have been recycled from previous days' menus.

It has come to my attention that certain airlines, including Allegiant, adhere to a 30-minute threshold prior to check-in, purportedly due to security concerns.

Furthermore, we were informed that the computer systems had been deliberately halted as a safety measure, a stipulation mandated by federal regulations. This peculiar occurrence seemed to contradict our previous experiences with Allegiant, which did not implement such stringent policies. \n\nConsequently, we were compelled to spend the night in Reno and await the next available flight. Upon attempting to board, my acquaintance was notified that his luggage exceeded the maximum size restrictions for overhead compartments, thereby incurring an additional fee. Moreover, a couple situated ahead of us in the queue had a piece of luggage weighing 51 pounds, surpassing the permissible limit by a single pound. The woman began to vociferously express her discontent and promptly removed various items from her luggage, transferring them into carry-on bags.

Initially, it is worth mentioning that we paid a mere $62, inclusive of tax and resort fees, for a single night's stay, thus our expectations were not particularly elevated. Nonetheless, we explicitly requested a non-smoking room, yet we were assigned a room that reeked of cigarette smoke, which was utterly repulsive. 

We were, however, upgraded from the most basic and smallest room category to a so-called ""King Suite."" Regrettably, this upgrade merely translated to a slightly larger bed, which was modestly comfortable, and an irregularly shaped room that was somewhat more spacious. The television set was positioned at such a distance from the bed that the remote control proved ineffective unless we physically rose from bed and traversed the room. 

The room was clean, albeit somewhat antiquated, and despite setting the air conditioning unit to 66 degrees Fahrenheit, my companion and I both awakened in a state of perspiration during the night due to the oppressive heat. 

The WiFi connection, which is frequently complimentary in even the most affordable hotels, cost $12 for a mere 24 hours. Moreover, unlike the Cosmopolitan, where I could access the internet from any location within the building, my connectivity was restricted to the confines of our room, and the signal was not merely patchy but also prone to frequent disconnections. 

Lastly, the shower in our bathroom only yielded tepid water in the morning, which was thoroughly disappointing. In conclusion, we were eager to vacate this establishment as soon as possible.",True,895.0,formal

Following an unsuccessful attempt at dining at a nearby establishment, we decided to venture to Rosalita's, anticipating an authentic experience. Unfortunately, our expectations were not met. The service was deplorable, as a single staff member struggled to attend to both the bar and dining area, resulting in an overwhelming workload. The food proved to be disappointing, with dishes exhibiting signs of sitting out for an extended period and being merely reheated. The complimentary chips were stale, while the salsa bore an unsettling resemblance to the mass-produced, subpar quality found in grocery stores. My shrimp entrÃ©e was particularly disastrous, prompting me to consume only half due to concerns about potential gastrointestinal repercussions. The shrimp were overcooked to an unpleasant rubbery texture, and the accompanying sauce was nauseating. Additionally, the rice was overcooked and arid, while the side salad, consisting of lettuce and carrots, was unpalatably steamed. In conclusion, this dining experience at Rosalita's was, by far, the most unpleasant Mexican cuisine I have had the misfortune of encountering in my lifetime.

Previously, I had frequented this bar accompanied by a group of 5-8 individuals on each occasion, and we had always relished the culinary offerings and enjoyed engaging in gaming activities. The servers had consistently displayed exceptional levels of professionalism and courtesy towards us. However, upon entering the premises on Saturday, February 11th, 2012, in the company of my romantic partner, with the intention of partaking in lunch, beverages, and viewing a sporting event featuring the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, we were met with a situation that was utterly unprecedented and profoundly disconcerting. Specifically, at approximately noon, every table and chair within the establishment was reserved, despite the fact that a significant portion of the seating area remained unoccupied. In response to this unexpected development, a robust gentleman emerged from the kitchen and, without bothering to address us directly or solicit our preferences, proceeded to inquire of a nearby couple whether they would be willing to accommodate two additional individuals at their table. Now, while I have never been averse to sharing a table with strangers, the particular arrangement he offered us was highly unsatisfactory, as it involved seating us with our backs to the primary televisions and necessitated that we gaze obliquely across the room in order to observe the smaller screens. Upon requesting an alternative seating arrangement, we were met with open hostility and discourteous behavior on the part of the aforementioned gentleman. It is my considered opinion that this episode constitutes a grave indictment of the quality of service provided by this establishment, and I must confess that I harbor serious misgivings regarding the propriety of their customer relations policies.

1," If you are seeking a luxury condominium, it is imperative that you conduct a thorough search to ensure that you procure a residence that aligns with your expectations. It is essential to recognize that these dwellings are, in fact, apartments and not condominiums. The presence of speed bumps and limited parking spaces can be a significant hindrance to the enjoyment of your living space. Furthermore, the private ownership of these residences enables anyone to inhabit them, often resulting in a cohabitation of diverse individuals with varying levels of respect for the noise level and consideration for fellow residents. Moreover, the security personnel assigned to maintain order within the community often display a lackadaisical attitude towards their responsibilities, rendering them unreliable in times of need. Additionally, the occurrence of break-ins and vandalism within the gated community serves as a testament to the inadequacy of the security measures in place. The Homeowners Association (HOA) proves to be of little assistance in addressing these issues, and the allowance of HUD residency further diminishes the property value of your home. The Points recreational area serves as a temporary haven for those who are unable to escape the cycle of high mortgage payments for an apartment that does not meet their standards. Therefore, it is crucial to exercise caution when purchasing a residence and ensure that it meets your requirements to avoid dissatisfaction.",True,910.0,formal

1," If I were permitted to bestow merely a single ""Worst of Yelp Awards,"" this particular stadium would undoubtedly be the recipient of such an unfortunate distinction. The sheer fact that approximately 10,000 enthusiasts attended the games hosted within its confines suggests that the logistical aspects pertaining to the National Championship contest held there were utterly chaotic and haphazardous, giving the impression that it was the initial occasion they had ever endeavored to organize.
 Problems abounded, and I am almost certain that I will inadvertently omit some of them in my enumeration that follows:
 1. A dearth of concession stands situated outside the stadium's parameters.
 2. Insufficient provision of consumables at internal concession booths, leading to a shortage of hot dogs, cups, and beverages, among other items, prior to the midpoint of the game.
 3. Security personnel stationed in the parking area displayed an excessive degree of belligerence towards attendees.
 4. An insufficient number of entrance points (merely four) to accommodate the substantial gathering of over 70,000 spectators.
 5. Diminutive jumbotrons, rendering visual observation of the game somewhat challenging for those seated at a distance.
 6. The stadium's public address system was barely audible, further contributing to the overall sense of disorganization.
 7. Refusal to display instant replays, followed by the exhibition of advertisements falsely implying that replays were being presented.
 8. A meager number of escalators serving the upper levels, with each one capable of accommodating only a solitary individual at a time.

I am thrilled to report that my experience with the downtown Pomo was not at all the same.\n\nHaving just walked from Cibo, where we enjoyed a decent pie (I'm still not convinced that Cibo comes anywhere close to its level of hype), we stepped into Pomo, expecting to be lambasted with stucco, fake accents, and photos of Florence.  Imagine our surprise when it turned out to be... trendy?  That's right, it was modern decor, and the waitstaff was of the hipster variety.  Wow, that was unexpected!\n\nMy biggest problem with the original store had been taken care of.  This was turning out to be an excellent dining experience.  We then ordered our pie, expecting the same quality we had enjoyed from the old Scottsdale oven.\n\nNope.\n\nWhat happened?  The pizza was not adequately soupy.  It lacked the amazing flavor and attention to detail that made it somewhat worthwhile to brave Scottsdale's most self-absorbed patrons.  In short, it was underwhelming. \n\nAfter we left here, we proceeded to walk right down the street to La Piazza Locale (also VPN certified), for our third and best pie of the evening.  I suggest you do the same.  They have the same modern vibe with a much better Napoletana pie.",,,informal

2," I have had the privilege of utilizing irrigation services provided by Salt River Project (SRP) for over three decades. Throughout this period, I have had the pleasure of interacting with exceptionally dedicated personnel who have consistently gone above and beyond to provide assistance. The Zanjeros, in particular, have been unwavering in their commitment to resolving various water-related issues, ranging from minor inconveniences such as a deceased animal obstructing a canal to more pressing concerns. Their dedication has led me to hold SRP in high esteem for many years.

However, my recent experience has been quite disconcerting. Upon visiting the main office to settle my water assessment, I encountered several unexpected obstacles. Firstly, a security guard informed me that I was in the wrong location, and the receptionist was no longer available. Secondly, the payment center had been repurposed as a storage space, housing a few machines. Finally, the customer service area had been reduced to a lone telephone mounted on a brown wall, accompanied by a sign directing customers to call for assistance.

It appears that the Zanjeros' responsibilities have shifted from providing hands-on support to monitoring the newly implemented Water Master system. While the system's intention is to ensure a consistent water flow, its execution has proven challenging. Instead of receiving the full allotted time, users are frequently cut short by the system, only to be forced to wait until the following day to receive the remaining 20 minutes. This process proves futile, as the next day's allocation often suffers from the same issue. It is imperative that the individual responsible for managing the Water Master system be present to address users' grievances, especially during ungodly hours, such as 2 am, when the system tends to falter.

My recent telephone interaction with an SRP representative only reinforced my disappointment. Despite encountering an individual reminiscent of the 'old-style' SRP staff, the physical facility itself felt oppressively restrictive, akin to a penitentiary. It seems that SRP has transformed into yet another impersonal, bureaucratic utility company, where the emphasis on streamlining processes has resulted in the alienation of the customer. The disparity between the original values upheld by SRP and their current practices is striking, and I fear that the personal touch once characteristic of their service has become a distant memory.",True,1173.0,formal

Upon ordering $35 worth of culinary delights, my expectations were not adequately met, as the quality of the fare failed to impress me. Specifically, the pulled pork was merely passable, while the brisket proved to be unremarkable. Furthermore, the chicken lacked a certain je ne sais quoi, and the beans, regrettably, were undercooked and rather unpalatable. Consequently, I felt compelled to discard them. However, I must admit that the assortment of sauces available did possess a certain degree of palatability. Ultimately, my quest for succulent southern-style brisket remained unfulfilled, prompting me to seek out alternative sources, including soliciting the culinary expertise of my father-in-law.

His demeanor was helpful, attentive, interactive, and one of the most exceptional examples of fine service I have encountered within this metropolis.

The comestibles, however, garnered decidedly mixed critiques.  The tilapia special was devoured with relish by both individuals at our table who opted for it.  Culinary staff, please take note: the portions varied conspicuously between the two plates, despite the fact that the lesser quantity happened to be consumed by the individual who customarily indulges in less food; thus, it did not pose a problem.  When identical dishes are concurrently presented to two patrons seated at the same table, it is imperative that the plates appear identical!

I initiated my repast with the minestrone soup (a staple offering on the menu), and although its flavor was palatable, it was served at a disappointingly tepid temperature.  This elicited a feeling of melancholy.  Furthermore, my meatball sandwich was somewhat lacking in warmth and excessively salty.  Alas, it failed to possess the freshness I had anticipated.

Alas, it proved to be an unfortunate choice, as the dish contained scant vegetation, mediocre rice, and a breaded, fried fish fillet reminiscent of a shoe sole. In point of fact, I have previously enjoyed a superior fish burrito at Del-Taco, situated directly across the street. My comrade's chicken sizzling fajita, while promptly delivered and emitting an appetizing aroma, regrettably lacked gastronomical depth and featured undercooked rice and a venerable salad as accompaniments. Notwithstanding, the accompanying guacamole and sour cream were fresh. It is worth mentioning that the establishment's salsa exhibited commendable flavor, striking a satisfactory balance between piquancy and palatability. Thus, if seeking merely a snack of chips and salsa accompanied by a brew, this locality may suffice.

As a family that adheres to a gluten-free diet, we were thrilled to learn that the restaurant offered an array of gluten-free options. We ordered the Vegetarian Antipasto, Flatbread Trio, Chicken Caesar Salad, and two pizzas, all of which were gluten-free versions.

In fact, my homemade gluten-free pizza crust and packaged versions purchased from Whole Foods far surpassed the quality of those served at this establishment. Additionally, the pizza sauce was excessively sweetened, the salad was overpowered by dressing, the Antipasto was devoid of taste, and the flatbread was unimpressive.

With an uppercase 'B'. \n\nBased on the pizza we obtained, I find it challenging to believe that the individual responsible for its preparation has ever stepped foot in a pizza establishment within the NY/NJ region, let alone possess any familiarity with the culinary traditions of New York-style pizza. \n\nWe placed an order for a half meatball, half pepperoni pizza, anticipating a product that at least vaguely resembled the depiction on the menu. However, what we received was a pizza that barely qualified as a distant cousin of the iconic Domino's franchise, albeit at a significantly higher price point. The crust was thick and doughy, the sauce more akin to a concentrated tomato paste than an actual sauce, and the cheese was overcooked to an unpleasant degree. Furthermore, the'meatball' topping consisted of ground beef haphazardly scattered across the cheese, rather than sliced meatballs as advertised. \n\nIn short, a truly regrettable experience. My expectations were high, hoping to discover another authentic NY-style pizzeria in our town. Unfortunately, this particular establishment falls woefully short of meeting such standards. We shall continue to patronize our established favorites, leaving this disappointing venture to those who are less discerning in their culinary pursuits.""",True,1396.0,formal

Specifically, I typically order the piccatta, but on one occasion, the veal was remarkably tough. Furthermore, the prices of the dishes are excessive, and the ambiance is the primary redeeming feature of this restaurant. The staff would benefit from enhancements in various aspects, including their interpersonal skills, service efficiency, and product knowledge. For instance, when I visited the bar and requested a mojito, the bartender claimed she was unable to prepare it, which prompted me to bring it to the attention of the manager. Upon questioning, he assured me that they possess fresh mint and the necessary tools to craft such a beverage. Subsequently, I received my'mojito,' which raised doubts about the bartender's proficiency or willingness to create the cocktail. Previously, in June, I arranged a celebration for my spouse's birthday, involving a group of 16 individuals, and secured a reservation well in advance. Unfortunately, the service proved subpar, as the server and busser demonstrated a lack of attentiveness, evidenced by their practice of hastily delivering the bread and promptly disappearing. We were forced to entreat them for refills. Notably, we have encountered just one exceptional waiter throughout our three-year patronage, and that was solely due to my personal efforts in expressing my dissatisfaction and securing a guarantee of superior service from the manager.""",True,1398.0,formal

The employees only knew to state that it was against company policy to create a PB&J before 11 am.  Anyway, I requested an egg sandwich with tomato and turkey and it was a rather unremarkable sandwich in that I could have easily prepared the same dish at home, but with superior quality due to the availability of Tobasco.  I inquired about Tobasco but was instead offered their homemade ""chili"" sauce, which possessed a flavor profile akin to pureed sundried tomatoes combined with chili powder.  While it was not unpalatable, I do enjoy the piquant sensation of Tobasco when consumed in conjunction with eggs.

As the restaurant gradually began to fill with patrons, our server seemed to vanish without a trace, leaving us to await her return for an interminable duration. Our initial beverages arrived in a timely fashion; the French press, in particular, was a delight to the taste buds. Nevertheless, the ensuing delay in service became increasingly pronounced, with five, ten, and ultimately fifteen minutes lapsing without any discernible attention being bestowed upon our table. My expectations for a more attentive experience remained unfulfilled, as the waitstaff continued to engage in leisurely conversation amongst themselves, oblivious to our presence.

Upon our arrival, we opted for the all-you-can-eat option, and my father even overindulged to the point of experiencing discomfort. Needless to say, we were excited to revisit this restaurant and sample their delectable dishes.

Upon our return, we decided to commence our meal with alligator tail as an appetizer, which proved to be a delicious choice. However, the all-you-can-eat platters we customarily order were not as satisfying, particularly towards the beginning of the meal. It became apparent that the oil utilized for frying our fish and shrimp was not fresh, leading to an unpleasant taste. Fortunately, as our meal progressed and new batches were brought out, the quality of the food improved, and we were able to enjoy our dining experience.

In light of the above, I inquired about the oil used and was informed by our waitress that the chef did indeed replace the old oil with fresh oil towards the end of our meal. While this was reassuring, it was disappointing to note that the salad bar was not well-maintained and lacked attention to detail regarding cleanliness. Additionally, it would be beneficial to have identical items on both sides of the buffet to facilitate navigation and minimize spills. Nonetheless, we appreciated the fact that the plates were kept chilled.

Despite some drawbacks, our server provided adequate service, fulfilling her responsibilities effectively.

Although the staff did offer profuse apologies and eventually brought out the correct item several minutes later, the onion rings proved to be merely passable, failing to impress my palate with their uninspired seasoning and texture. In addition, I found the portion of fries I sampled while awaiting the correction of the error to be thoroughly unexceptional, neither remarkable for their crispiness nor distinguished by any unique flavor component. Considering the price point of ten to twelve dollars for a fundamental burger and fries combo, I must aver that such an exorbitant tariff seems patently disproportionate to the actual value offered by this establishment. However, I must admit that the beer selection redeemed the dining experience somewhat, boasting a pleasing array of choices that were both refreshing and well-chilled.

In point of fact, the quality of the culinary offerings and beverage selection remains subpar and unimpressive, respectively. My recent dining experience at this establishment, accompanied by a companion, proved to be an utter disappointment, as the fare served was not merely unpalatable but also induced nausea, necessitating the utilization of antacid upon returning home. 
  An examination of the menu reveals the following:  
  Wings: It is advisable to avoid the jerk sauce, as it lacks flavor and is generally unappealing. The barbecue sauce, conversely, exhibits some degree of palatability.  
  Sides: The buffalo fries, accompanied by a side of ranch dressing for dipping, demonstrated a certain appeal, specifically in terms of taste.  
  Burger: The bacon cheeseburger, while falling short of my personal preference for a well-done cooking style, was only partially consumed due to the absence of crispiness in the bacon and the lack of A1 sauce.  
  Notwithstanding the aforementioned deficiencies, Lucky Louie's does possess several redeeming characteristics, including:  
  1. A commendable Golden Tee and Silver Strike Bowling Machine

2," ""Although my preliminary perception of Bottles & Burgers at Tivoli Village was less than favorable, stemming from an underwhelming experience at their sister establishment, I remained open-minded and amenable to exploring its potential. My willingness to give the venue a chance was further bolstered by the presence of outdoor seating, a feature that has become increasingly appealing amidst the current pandemic. However, upon arriving at the location, I was dismayed to discover that the patio area was situated between two escalators leading to the second floor, resulting in considerable foot traffic, noise, and distractions. Despite these drawbacks, I opted to sample their beverages, commencing with a cucumber martini that, while unremarkable, did not entirely disappoint. Unfortunately, the sangria that followed proved to be a significant letdown, boasting an unusual sugared rim and an overpowering, sickly sweet flavor reminiscent of prune juice.

The cod was rubbery, unlike at other Japanese restaurants in Montreal (for example, Azuma on St-Laurent had a wonderful black cod). The octopus balls were gummy with un-cooked tempura batter in the center and slathered in salty sauce. The okonomiyaki was so completely covered in sauce, that this was the only thing we could taste. That, and a strange, almost cornmeal-y consistency unlike any other okonomiyakis I've experienced (granted I've only had it once before, in NYC, but it was a wonderful streetfood-style dish there; here, not anything I'd recommend, even if you got the sauce on the side--which I would recommend doing, if you choose to try this dish). We didn't order anything to drink, and to the best of my knowledge, only ordered the five small dishes listed above, plus one order of mochi, and it cost us $67 before tip.

The cuisine offered can be classified as average Americanized sushi, garnering a rating of three stars at best. The ambiance, while unconventional, has the potential to elevate the overall experience to a respectable 3.5 stars.

The pure white backdrop of my photographs conspicuously displayed noticeable scuff marks, indicating a lack of attention to detail and carelessness on the part of the studio. Furthermore, the staff imposed an arbitrary limit on the number of images I could store on my disk, without providing any written documentation or explanation of this policy. When I inquired about the cost of their services, I was met with evasiveness and a refusal to provide a detailed breakdown of prices, leading me to suspect that they were attempting to conceal something. To add insult to injury, they rejected my coupon for a $20 discount on a $100 purchase, citing an ambiguous and unclear exclusion clause that was nowhere to be found in the promotional material. The most appalling aspect of this entire ordeal was that the manager, who was supposed to ensure a positive customer experience, was the very person who displayed such unprofessional conduct and apathy towards my concerns. My husband's intervention prevented me from expressing my indignation and frustration in a more vociferous manner. Currently, I am gazing at the photographs, feeling saddened and disappointed by the whole experience.

2," Once again, the culinary establishment within the Station Casino premises has undergone a transformation in ownership and management, with the previous entity known as Guadalajara ceding its operational responsibilities to a new proprietorship under the name of Cabo. 
  Upon conclusion of my work-related duties on a recent Friday evening, my fiancÃ© and I opted to partake in a visit to the aforementioned eatery, primarily motivated by my desire to indulge in a celebratory alcoholic beverage, specifically a margarita, in commemoration of the successful completion of my training program. 
  Unfortunately, our experience at the restaurant was marred by an excessive amount of waiting time, as we were forced to endure prolonged delays in the provision of various essential elements of our dining experience, including the arrival of the hostess, the distribution of chips, and the servicing of beverages, resulting in a considerable delay before the gratification of our thirst and hunger. Moreover, I failed to receive a glass of water that I had requested, prompting me to consume my fiancÃ©'s beverage instead, and no offer was made to replenish our depleted supply of chips. 
  The young woman tasked with attending to our table appeared visibly overwhelmed by the demands of her role, while the supporting staff member, referred to as a 'busboy,' proved to be of minimal assistance in addressing our concerns. 
  Notwithstanding the aforementioned deficiencies in service, the quality of the edibles we consumed was merely average, with the exception of my margarita, which was expertly blended and presented a most satisfying taste experience. Additionally, we received complimentary sopapillas as per the restaurant's policy for checking in, which we elected to take away for subsequent consumption. 
  It remains a mystery as to why Station Casinos persist in altering their dining establishments, but it is evident that this particular transition did not result in an improvement in the overall dining experience. The sole reason for my potential return would be to sample another raspberry margarita, as it was truly the highlight of the evening.",True,1573.0,formal

The decoration did okay, but seemed liked something I could have done myself with some help, but the cupcakes were nearly frozen in the middle, stale, and the icing was hard. This could have been due to the fact that I was suppose to pick up my cupcakes on a Friday, but due to a car accident I was not able to get them until Monday.

Furthermore, it took an unreasonable six hours for the hotel staff to furnish us with an additional blanket, and a staggering 24 hours for the procurement of extra pillows.

It is worth noting that such egregious lapses in service are particularly glaring given the hotel's self-proclaimed status as a 'world-class' establishment.

The atmosphere was bustling, with only two overworked servers attempting to accommodate the demands of an abundance of patrons. The interior layout consisted of a lengthy bar, characteristic of Las Vegas, accompanied by numerous compact tables and booths with minimal space between them. 
 My server, though well-intentioned, conveyed a few options she believed would cater to my dietary restrictions.

While the experience was not without its merits, it fell short of my lofty expectations in certain aspects. The ambiance was reminiscent of a bygone era, with its classic Italian restaurant decor and pictorial representations of celebrated patrons adorning the walls, creating an atmosphere that was both convivial and nostalgic. The staff were attentive, courteous, and displayed a proficiency in their duties that was truly commendable. However, the cuisine, while certainly palatable, did not quite live up to the standards that one might expect from an establishment of such renown. My veal dish, in particular, was satisfactory but failed to meet the expectations that I had cultivated based on the acclaim that Rao's has garnered over the years. It seemed as though the kitchen was hesitant to take risks and thus produced a generous portion of fare that, while certainly edible, lacked a certain je ne sais quoi that would have elevated it to the realm of true gastronomic excellence.

However, upon our return, we were dismayed to discover that the aforementioned zucchini fingers lacked the crispiness that we had anticipated, instead displaying a remarkable propensity to bend in half when lifted, which rather detracted from the overall experience.

This development struck us as somewhat analogous to visiting an American diner and being charged extra for ketchup, which seemed incongruous with our preconceived notions of what constituted a satisfactory dining experience. 
Additionally, we observed that the zucchini appeared to be in dire need of salt, a deficiency that significantly impacted our enjoyment of the dish.

Furthermore, my epidermis suffered lacerations courtesy of the cuticle clippers, while the nail buffer inflicted an unsightly abrasion upon my person, necessitating prompt remedial measures upon my return home. To further exacerbate matters, the pedicure was executed in a frigid aquatic environment.

The entire episode was nothing short of a calamitous ordeal, culminating in a finished product that was aesthetically subpar and conspicuously shoddy. Regrettably, my customary salon was not patronized on this particular occasion, as I opted to experiment with one of the newer venues in town, but my expectations were not merely unfulfilled, but utterly decimated by the sheer ineptitude displayed by the staff.

My dining experience at this establishment involved consuming a Tex-Mex burger, which, while palatable, did not surpass my expectations in terms of quality or quantity. Specifically, the bun was unpleasantly soggy and disintegrated shortly after the initial bite. Nonetheless, the spiked milkshakes offered by BLT Burger are undeniably impressive.

It's pretty simple - sit down, place your order when a waiter comes around, and get your food pretty quickly. The only real complaint is that the food's a bit expensive (as all airport food is) and that they didn't have BBQ sauce when I requested it for the chicken tenders. Aside from that, the food was pretty much what'd you expect overall from this kind of joint. The tenders were pretty standard, served with honey mustard sauce. The seafood platter comes with fried shrimp, crab cakes, and some spring rolls. I felt better for not getting the bigger crab cakes when I had theirs - the crab meat was extremely nondescript, coated in fried breadcrumbs but with an indistinguishable taste aside from that. The spring rolls were okay, if unspectacular, and the fried shrimp was decent.\n\nYou're not going to get much service here - our waiter had to be flagged to give us our check - but it's an airport spot, so you can't really set expectations too high.

2," I had the privilege of partaking in a celebratory dinner at this establishment on a Thursday evening, in honor of a close acquaintance's birthday. As an ardent devotee of Asian cuisine, my expectations were elevated, particularly in light of the acclaim that Pittsburgh's latest restaurants have garnered (especially upon my return to the city). Unfortunately, my culinary experience fell short of my expectations, with both the food and service leaving much to be desired. The dishes we sampled lacked a profound Asian influence, with the skate cheeks, situated atop minuscule pieces of white toast, being rather unremarkable. The fried Brussels sprouts proved to be the standout dish, albeit it paled in comparison to other eateries specializing in meat and potatoes. Avoid the desserts at all costs, as both options featured a vanilla custard base, with one variety topped with Fruity Pebbles in a feeble attempt at cuteness, but ultimately underwhelming.

Moreover, our server appeared to be somewhat inexperienced and self-conscious, neglecting to introduce herself and solicit our order, leaving us to take the initiative in placing our order and seeking recommendations.

Yet, one hour and ten minutes later, our steaks arrived, while the two parties seated adjacent to us, who had arrived subsequent to our arrival, had already consumed all three courses of their meals.

The menu presented numerous inconsistencies, with instances where the listed items did not align with the actual dishes served. Specifically, my spouse requested the Sam Adams on draft, only to receive the Summer Ale instead, which was seemingly attributed to an inventory shortage of the former without any notification or alternative options offered by the server. Furthermore, the chicken artichoke flatbread, while delectable, was excessively bedecked with parmesan cheese, contrary to the menu's description of a ""sprinkling.""

We already possess an abundance of Chinese and Korean restaurants in the campus area, which, might I add, are vastly superior to Flat Top in terms of quality and authenticity.  

Now, allow me to elaborate on the stir-fry concept that Flat Top has adopted. It is, in essence, a form of Mongolian BBQ, albeit with an extensive array of uncooked vegetables and ingredients for patrons to select from. One must admit that the sheer volume of options can be overwhelming, especially when considering the unusual sauces and food pairings available. My own combination, consisting of brown rice, clams, beef, vegetables, salmon, and roti prata, was merely passable, but I fear that without a well-developed sense of culinary compatibility, one's dining experience may prove disastrous.  

Flat Top's 'pick-your-own-ingredients' approach does possess a certain level of ingenuity, as it effectively transfers culpability onto the patron, should the food fail to meet expectations. However, it would be unfair to place blame solely on the customer, as the grill sensei also plays a significant role in determining the final product's quality. Overcooking by even a slight margin can render a dish unpalatable, irrespective of the excellence of the chosen components. My companion's moo shu, regrettably, suffered from inadequate wrapping, leading to certain rolls falling apart. Alas, such mishaps can significantly diminish one's enjoyment of the meal.

However, it must be noted that the ambiance, while not unpleasant, falls short of truly captivating, garnering a mere six on the same scale. Furthermore, the value proposition, taking into account both the cost and the quantity of sustenance provided, earns a middling rating of eight. Notably, the service, characterized by an almost perplexing lack of attentiveness, leaves much to be desired, warranting a meager five on the aforementioned scale. Nonetheless, it is advisable to sample the creme puffs, which, despite their unremarkable provenance, prove to be a satisfying indulgence. Be that as it may, the experience is marred by an inexplicable tardiness in settling the bill, which, compounded by the sluggish pace of table turns during the luncheon hours, renders the overall experience somewhat less than optimal.

In light of this, I undertook a brief excursion to the nearest automated teller machine located within Smiths, incurring an additional fee of three dollars due to the fact that it was not affiliated with my financial institution. Upon my return, I found the premises devoid of any other patrons, with the same staff member who had initially attended to me now engaged in a personal telephone conversation on his mobile device, utterly disregarding my presence.

In fact, I would venture to assert that my predilection for New York-style bagels (a preference that has motivated me to undertake similar pilgrimages in the past) was not entirely satiated by the offerings of Montreal's bagel purveyors.

Moreover, it was rather disconcerting to discover that a few of the dozen bagels purchased during our excursion exhibited telltale signs of staleness and were only suitable for consumption after a period of maturation. Amongst the assortment we sampled, the sesame variety was perhaps the most satisfactory, but it was not enough to persuade us to abandon our allegiance to the superior quality and authenticity of New York-style bagels. It is my conviction that many Americans who have had the privilege of indulging in premium bagels within the confines of New York City would concur with my assessment. Incidentally, I am of the opinion that several establishments in Boston offer comparable or even superior alternatives.

In addition, we shared a baked potato that, while well-intentioned, was regrettably overcooked, and a side of creamed corn that, much to our delight, proved to be the unmitigated highlight of the meal, its rich, velvety texture and delicate flavor profile eliciting effusive praise from both parties. However, our enthusiasm was somewhat tempered by the less-than-satisfactory crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, which, unfortunately, did not live up to our expectations, ranking among the most disappointing specimens we have had the misfortune of encountering. Fast forwarding to the present, precisely two decades after our last foray into the erstwhile Roberta's, we must confess that our return visit has been long overdue, as the passage of time seems to have wrought a profound transformation, elevating the restaurant to a new level of excellence. Although the ambiance may lack a certain je ne sais quoi, the friendly demeanor of the staff and reasonable prices more than compensate for any perceived deficiencies. Ms. Westie's 8-ounce filet, cooked to a perfect medium rare, as per her request, proved to be a veritable delight, its tenderness and flavor rivaling those of the finest prime cuts. Similarly, my Chilean sea bass, with its delectable crusty exterior and moist interior, paired beautifully with a trio of garlic mashed potatoes, a diminutive fennel salad, and sautÃ©ed spinach, thereby rounding out a memorable dining experience.""",True,1937.0,formal

However, upon sampling the pizza, I was disappointed to discover that the dough lacked the crispness and texture that I have come to associate with artisanal wood-fired pizzas. Don't get me wrong, the toppings were undoubtedly delicious, but the dough itself was somewhat unremarkable, leaving me with a lingering sense of disappointment. As someone who has been diligently seeking out a pizza establishment that serves an egg pizza capable of transporting me back to the memorable pizzerias of Italy, I must admit that this particular eatery fell short of my lofty standards. Notwithstanding, I must commend the proprietors for their laudable efforts in creating a welcoming atmosphere and offering an assortment of delectable toppings, and I sincerely hope that they will continue to refine their craft, particularly with regard to the dough, in order to create a truly exceptional pizza experience for their patrons.""",True,1938.0,formal

Not only did they have exorbitant prices, but they also displayed parsimony in their offerings. I vehemently detest eateries that proffer extravagant charges while providing scant provisions.

It is worth noting that a comparable salad bar option, available for a lower price point, would have provided a more generous portion. Furthermore, when inquiring about the availability of dressing with my salad, I was met with a response that implied I had neglected to specify my desired dressing choice, despite the fact that I had not been given the opportunity to do so.

""I must have traversed past Frank's A Lot numerous times prior to deciding to give it a chance. Located on the eastern side of the thoroughfare that transforms into Airline Boulevard, directly behind the aerodrome, Franks' unassuming edifice has always piqued my curiosity. En route to my daily employment, utilizing Airline Boulevard as a means to circumvent several signalized intersections, I have had the pleasure of observing Franks frequently. Eventually, my intrigue was aroused, and I opted to partake in their culinary offerings for lunch.  

My expectations were surpassed by the delectable gastronomic experience that awaited me. For a most reasonable tariff, I savored a succulent hot dog, augmented by an exceptionally cordial staff whose familiarity and camaraderie suggested a familial proprietorship. Although I cannot confirm whether the establishment is indeed a family-run enterprise, their proficiency in both culinary and customer service aspects leaves little doubt. 

Franks provides both a drive-through window and a quaint outdoor seating area for patrons' convenience. It is worth noting that they only accept paper currency, but fear not, as the total cost of your repast will unlikely exceed seven dollars. 

Their signature dish, the Chicago dog, boasts an array of flavorsome embellishments, including onions, celery salt, sport peppers, and tomatoes. Pair it with a portion of their freshly prepared French fries, and you will be poised to depart, relishing life's simple pleasures. 

While their bill of fare encompasses other delectable options such as Polish sausages, cheese fries, and even Philly cheese steaks, my predilection for their Chicago dog has thus far precluded exploration of alternative choices.

The DJ, Lil Jon, provided an adequate performance, nothing extraordinary, but sufficient for the occasion. \n\nHowever, as a local who generally avoids the strip, the price of $52 for a beer, wine, and a shot for the birthday boy came as a considerable shock. Such exorbitant prices are customary for clubs located along the strip, understandably so, given the high overhead costs associated with maintaining such establishments. Nonetheless, it is a notion worth considering for clubs to offer special discounts or promotions for locals, as it may encourage repeat business and foster a sense of community. After all, it is not uncommon for individuals to stock up on alcoholic beverages in their vehicles and briefly exit the club, rendering the inflated drink prices somewhat futile. \n\nIn conclusion, while not necessarily exceptional, this club proved to be relatively satisfactory in comparison to others, such as Haze, Tryst, and Moon, which remains my personal favorite.

Upon successfully navigating the gauntlet of the hostess's scrutiny, I opted to sample a Lycheetini from the bar, finding it quite palatable and potentially worthy of further exploration, had I not been concerned with preserving sufficient gastric capacity for the culinary offerings yet to come.

Following our escort into the dining area via a modern elevator, I couldn't help but be impressed by the stylish contemporary Asian motif that permeated the interior design, which was complemented by the attentive and responsive service provided by both our primary server and the supporting staff, ensuring that our beverages remained consistently replenished throughout the meal.

While the fare itself was certainly satisfactory, it was evident that the true value proposition lay not in the food, but rather in the unique ambiance and atmospheric qualities that pervaded the space, fostering an environment conducive to conviviality and relaxation among patrons.

Given the presence of traditional Filipino dishes such as lumpia, pancit, and adobo on the menu, it was reasonable to infer that the head chef was of Filipino descent, leading one of the staff members to inquire as to whether I shared any familial ties with the culinary expert, to which I responded that, while I did not possess any direct blood relations with the chef, I could appreciate the cultural significance and richness of Filipino cuisine.

Consequently, I opted for a less ambitious order, forgoing both the Cajun fries and the medium sauce, which, in hindsight, I might have relished had I been adequately informed.

On a previous occasion, I embarked on a social engagement with a romantic interest at this establishment, and we were intent on perusing the menu to select a few items to share. However, the manager intervened and assured us that he would accommodate our needs, stating, ""Allow me to attend to your dining requirements - you will undoubtedly relish this."" My date and I exchanged dubious glances, inferring that we had little choice but to acquiesce to his suggestion. 

The manager dispatched a garlic-themed platter, which, while not the most pungent item on the menu, still proved to be a substantial and overwhelming meal for both myself and my companion. As someone who does not derive pleasure from such fare, I would have greatly preferred to exercise my own gastronomic inclinations rather than deferring to the manager's recommendation. Furthermore, the portion size was excessive, rendering us unable to fully consume it and leaving no room to sample any of the main courses listed on the menu. 

In retrospect, I have learned that it is wiser to adhere to my own gustatory preferences when dining, rather than placing trust in the judgment of an unfamiliar individual, especially on a first date. While the dish itself was not unpalatable, its weighty nature made it more suitable for a group of four or more individuals, rather than just two. 

Despite this experience, I still maintain that Richardson's boasts an attractive ambiance, making it an ideal location for a social engagement.

The meat and seafood counter is also a bit on the smallish side as well but staffed by some friendly people. The bulk of their floor space seems to be taken up by fresh produce...and while prices are not exactly cheap, they are competitive with or cheaper than Whole Foods. \n\nSince Sprouts took over their supplement selection seems to have dropped in quality and selection. Case in point: Kava Kava. Where before I had 5 different choices in capsules alone, on my last visit I only found 2. And the brands they did carry were not ones I would buy. If you need basic supplements to start out this is a good location to explore.

However, I would only consider satiating my hunger at this eatery if I happened to be strolling past it, and my stomach was growling fiercely, as the fare served here does not exactly qualify as gourmet cuisine, in my esteemed view. Nonetheless, the cookies offered by this establishment are, indeed, delectable, and I must commend them for providing a complimentary cookie with each sandwich purchase, a gesture which I find both thoughtful and appreciated, and, might I add, their selection of Jones Soda flavors, specifically the sugar-free black cherry variety, is quite impressive, and, I must confess, I found myself quite taken by its unique and refreshing taste. However, I must issue a word of caution regarding the roast beef sandwich, specifically the 'Overture' variant, as it arrives adorned with a generous helping of horseradish sauce, which, while undoubtedly delicious, proved almost unbearably piquant for my sensitive nasal passages, causing my nose to transform into a veritable fountain of mucus, if you will, thereby necessitating copious quantities of tissues, and, perhaps, a brief respite from the consumption of solid foods, in order to allow my sinuses to recover from the onslaught of spicy flavors. In conclusion, while this restaurant may possess some redeeming qualities, I would, in all honesty, recommend dining at Opa Grill, situated adjacent to this establishment, as the culinary offerings therein are, in my expert opinion, vastly superior, and well worth the nominal additional expense, if one is seeking a truly satisfying dining experience.""",True,2157.0,formal

Dickey's may not entirely embody the genuine article, but it constitutes a welcome addition to Madison's barbecue scene, and I sincerely hope it endures.  

The meats exhibit a palpable smoky flavor and tenderness, although they are occasionally overcooked. This phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that fast-food/fast-casual establishments like Dickey's may not smoke their meats in-house daily. Instead, they might be smoked off-site and subsequently transported. However, given the affordable pricing, this compromise proves acceptable. The ribs and brisket warrant ordering. The chicken, on the other hand, consists of a grilled breast that can be obtained from any run-of-the-mill eatery.  

The sauces, available in both original and spicy varieties, are presented at a piping hot temperature, much like their Texan counterparts. Their texture adheres to the thinner, characteristic Texas consistency, which I find appealing.

I savored the rich, earthy onion soup, served with shaved truffles and duck, its presentation was unforeseen.  Next, I indulged in gently heated salmon accompanied by julienne vegetables and a green horseradish sauce.  My salmon was cooked to perfection, and the dish's appearance was aesthetically pleasing; however, the sauce, frankly, tasted akin to grass clippings - bitter and overpowering.  My companion seemed to relish her stout braised short ribs.  The trio of chocolate desserts fell short of my expectations: a dry soufflÃ©, a salty peanut butter shake, and Baily's ice cream.

  All four of us opted for the tasting menu, with two individuals selecting the wine pairing option as well. The visual aspect of the dishes was undeniably impressive. We initiated our meal with a preliminary palette cleanser of sorts. The first course consisted of either a mushroom soup or a salad, wherein I chose the former, and my spouse opted for the latter.

  The second course, which comprised pasta accompanied by a meat-based sauce, was indubitably the most delectable offering thus far. Moving on to the main entrÃ©e, we were served a flat iron steak, which, albeit enjoyable, did not quite attain remarkable status. The concluding dessert course featured blue cotton candy and chocolate cake accompanied by banana gelato, the former of which proved to be a pleasant surprise. 
  Lamentably, the wine pairings fell short of our expectations. Our server seemed to possess limited knowledge regarding the wines, and rather peculiarly, he adhered to identical pairings irrespective of whether we selected the soup or salad, and fish or steak entrÃ©e. Moreover, the entire wine selection was confined to the red family.

On previous occasions, the manager has exhibited exceptional kindness and made conscious efforts to ensure that we felt welcome.  

My culinary selection for the morning was the Herman breakfast sandwich, priced at approximately $8, which, although somewhat expensive, offered a satisfying combination of flavors and textures.

3," Last Saturday, I experienced an eagerness to partake in a nocturnal excursion to witness the comedic stylings of none other than the illustrious Billy Gardell; however, I was cognizant of the likelihood that my financial resources would be considerably depleted due to the exorbitant pricing policies implemented by the establishment, thus, I made a concerted effort to mentally prepare myself for the monetary ravaging that was forthcoming.

Upon entering the venue, I was immediately struck by the charming ambiance and cozy seating arrangement, which provided an unobstructed view of the stage from any vantage point within the intimate setting. Furthermore, I must commend the management on offering tickets at a reasonable price point, as well as providing complimentary parking validation and serving palatable fare at a cost that did not entirely decimate my wallet. Additionally, the staff exhibited a remarkable level of proficiency and cordiality, ensuring that my visit was further enhanced by their prompt and attentive service.

However, I must caution potential patrons against the rather claustrophobic seating arrangements, which seemed to disregard personal space and comfort. Moreover, I found the beverage prices to be utterly preposterous and was taken aback by the requirement to purchase two drinks, ostensibly to satisfy some arcane minimum order quota. To further compound my consternation, an arbitrary percentage was added to my total bill under the guise of a gratuity, which I deemed to be an unwarranted affront to my fiscal sensibilities.

In conclusion, while I cannot deny the comedic talents showcased during my visit, I must emphasize that the blatant avarice displayed by the management has left an indelible stain on my overall experience. Consequently, I shall refrain from returning to this establishment until such time that they choose to revise their exploitative practices or feature a comedian whose performances are of such exceptional quality that I am willing to temporarily suspend my fiscal principles.",True,2429.0,formal

The venue experiences a high volume of patronage, with a constant influx of customers from 11 am onward, culminating in either the exhaustion of the daily menu items or the closure of the eatery. It is imperative to note that the restaurant only accepts paper currency, thus it is advisable to verify the availability of funds in one's wallet prior to arrival, and refrain from allowing the presence of pedestrians gathered adjacent to the sidewalk to deter you, as this phenomenon is customary and not indicative of any anomaly. The ordering process is expedited, resulting in the rapid procurement of culinary items, followed by a prompt departure to accommodate the succeeding patron in line.

This establishment exudes an aura of authenticity, as evidenced by the lengthy queues and numerous patrons in attendance. My companion awarded five stars in recognition of the culinary excellence displayed by the eatery. 
  Notwithstanding, one cannot help but wonder if the prolonged waiting period is truly justified. The duration of the queue significantly diminishes the overall rating, relegating it to a mere three stars. The system employed for organizing the queue was utterly perplexing. Numerous patrons have pointed out that there are separate lines for various types of fare. In total, there are six distinct lines, divided into two sets of three. The first set consists of lines dedicated to pork (abodaba), offal (including brains, tongue, stomach, tripe, intestines, et cetera), and beef (encompassing asada, et cetera). Despite its apparent length, the queue moved at a glacial pace, making the prolonged delay seem utterly absurd. 
  Upon drawing closer to the front of the line, it became apparent that the sluggishness was attributable to a single individual performing the duties of two people. Although he demonstrated remarkable speed in crafting the tacos, he was responsible for preparing a minimum of five tacos for every patron. Moreover, he produced an excess of fifty tacos while we waited, ostensibly for takeout orders (wrapped in foil and placed on paper plates). The combination of the time required per person and the additional tasks undertaken by the taco artisan for the benefit of those not present in the queue contributes substantially to the interminable delay.

3," I have had the pleasure of partaking in the culinary offerings of this esteemed establishment on three separate occasions, with two of those experiences being of the drive-thru variety and the most recent being a dine-in visit. I must say, I am delighted that I opted to dine in, for it afforded me the opportunity to observe the kitchen staff in their natural habitat, so to speak. One of the cooks, a Caucasian male, was not adorned in the customary gloves worn by his colleagues, which, in conjunction with his unfortunate lack of hygiene, led me to question the overall cleanliness of the kitchen. Furthermore, upon venturing to the restroom, I discovered that the paper towel dispenser was devoid of its intended contents, thus necessitating my utilization of the blower, which, in turn, produced an abundance of noise that served as a stark contrast to the otherwise tranquil ambiance of the dining area. This sequence of events led me to deduce that the aforementioned cook had neglected to properly sanitize his hands prior to resuming his culinary duties. Lastly, as I emerged from the restroom, I was greeted by the sight of the same individual grasping a generous portion of bacon, which, coincidentally, happened to be a key component of my companion's bacon burger. It is worth noting that the cook's attire, or lack thereof, accentuated his posterior region in a manner that was conspicuous and, some might argue, inappropriate. While I do intend to return to this establishment in the future, I do so with the hope that the aforementioned cook will not be present during my subsequent visits.

Thus, when I became aware of the presence of a Pink's establishment in Las Vegas, my excitement reached palpable levels. Unfortunately, my expectations were not entirely met, to put it mildly. I opted to order the mushroom swiss dog, which carried a price tag of $6.50. Upon consuming the hot dog, I was struck by its rubbery texture, which was somewhat disappointing. Furthermore, the Swiss cheese component of the dish was not as copious as I had anticipated, leading to intermittent bursts of flavor that were not as pronounced as they could have been. While the combination of mushrooms, Swiss cheese, and hot dog was undoubtedly delectable during those fleeting moments when all three elements converged, the overall experience was marred by an imbalance in ingredient ratios. Specifically, an excess of mushrooms and an insufficient amount of cheese detracted from my enjoyment.

However, upon receiving my order, I was dismayed to discover that the butter sauce and pepperoncini, typically included in the pizza box, were conspicuously absent. Nevertheless, I comprehended the reasoning behind this omission, attributable to the establishment's desire to streamline their operations and enhance efficiency. Notwithstanding this minor drawback, the quality of service remained somewhat lacking, as only one of two available registers was manned by a lone employee, resulting in a discernible delay in processing orders, while several patrons idled nearby, awaiting their turns.

Additionally, there is a distinct wing designated for carry-out orders, thereby eliminating the need for me to traverse the entire restaurant while attired in my pajamas and slippers. While the pizza is undoubtedly delectable on its own, the nuclear fries are truly exceptional, possessing a subtle spice and a slight kick that complements a pie perfectly.

The DJs play an eclectic mix of hip-hop and nostalgic tunes, eliciting a sense of familiarity and delight among the clientele. In my opinion, Lavo rates a solid 3.5 out of 5, with the primary factor being the generosity of our promoter, who provided open bar service and complimentary admission for the gentlemen in our party. The central bar area is well-appointed, but we opted to procure our beverages from the secondary bar, which, despite being crowded and understaffed, was manned by a charming and attentive bartender.

However, over time, its standards have subsided, rendering it merely satisfactory. Despite this decline, my father continues to patronize this venue, and thus, we visited it together. Our meal commenced with the grilled artichoke, customarily a delectable option. Unfortunately, this particular instance proved disappointing, as the artichoke exhibited a pronounced rigidity and lacked discernible flavor, perhaps due to the off-season availability of this ingredient. Nonetheless, the accompanying aioli sauce compensated for the artichoke's deficiencies, offering a savory delight. The prime rib, though tender and possessing a satisfactory flavor profile, failed to impress, as its portion size has diminished progressively during my visits. This consistent reduction in magnitude was coupled with a uniform selection of sides, specifically a baked potato. Ultimately, our dining experience concluded without the customary sweet treat.

3," Barneys is a multifaceted drinking establishment that offers a unique experience for patrons seeking a more relaxed atmosphere than the typical bars in the vicinity. For individuals desiring an unpretentious environment where they can enjoy themselves without the necessity of dressing up or paying covers, Barneys may be the ideal destination.

The second floor of the bar particularly stood out to me as a preferred spot, owing to the hospitable demeanor of the bartender and their promptness in refilling drinks. Although the rooftop area has the potential to be an attractive spot during warmer weather, the presence of smoking therein serves as a deterrent for some.

One notable aspect of Barneys is its innovative method of pouring beer from the bottom up, creating a distinctive and entertaining experience for customers. Moreover, for those who have had a few too many drinks, the bar features an amusing arcade game involving a lobster claw, reminiscent of the classic claw machine found at carnivals and arcades.

Upon arriving at the venue, we were struck by the somewhat unconventional layout, which featured a primary dining area and a smaller, segregated section designated for'red-headed step children' and located around the corner from the main area. This configuration seemed to create an atmosphere that was somewhat lacking in vitality. Arriving during the latter portion of happy hour, my spouse opted for a glass of Sangria, while I selected a glass of Tempranillo, which unfortunately did not meet my expectations. Subsequently, I ordered an additional glass of wine, the name of which escapes me, and found it to be relatively satisfying. My culinary selections included the cola and pineapple braised short ribs, jalapeno cream corn, and a chile corn casserole. While the sides were generally well-prepared, the corn casserole was slightly overcooked. The short ribs, on the other hand, were quite flavorful and did not possess the dubious taste often associated with lesser quality braised short ribs. Although the sauce accompanying the ribs was slightly too viscous for my liking, it did not detract substantially from the overall enjoyment of the dish. My spouse's grilled shrimp appetizer, served with avocado and mango sauce, was greatly enjoyed, as were the empanadas. However, my personal preference did not extend to the empanadas. Nonetheless, the shrimp dish was fairly impressive.

The hotel's decor and amenities, while once considered stylish and cutting-edge, have become somewhat outdated and no longer meet my expectations.

However, I must admit that the rates offered by the hotel were quite reasonable and competitive compared to those of other luxury hotels in the area, particularly the newer establishments that have recently entered the market.

Additionally, I have taken advantage of their happy hour promotion at the South Rainbow location, which boasts an impressive selection of $2 draft beers and 1/2 price appetizers, making for a truly exceptional value.

The Dorito potato skins were nothing special - just had a wedge of cheesy chip stuck in the middle of it.  The cupcake was good, but the chocolate was a little grainy.

One's appreciation for a particular bodily component is often realized only when it becomes injured, leaving one utterly debilitated and experiencing excruciating pain.  

On a separate occasion, I experienced intense, sporadic abdominal pain. Due to its proximity to my residence, I opted to visit this clinic, necessitating urgent medical attention. Presenting with visible signs of distress, including pallor, trembling, and uncontrollable sobbing, I was surprised by the facility's inability to accommodate me due to an excessive patient load.

My expectations were predicated on the assumption that the snow-based offerings would resemble those available at Hawaiian snow-themed eateries, such as Snow Factory or Frost City. Alas, my experience did not quite live up to my expectations.  

In collaboration with my associates, we sampled three distinct flavors - #3, #4, and #5, respectively. However, I was not particularly enamored with the ""popping pearls"" incorporated into my #5 selection, so I opted to substitute it with a butterfinger variant instead. While the texture of the snow was somewhat reminiscent of a creamy consistency, the flavors left much to be desired in terms of depth and complexity. I had the opportunity to taste a few other options, including taro, green tea, and the mysterious ""kuma snow,"" but unfortunately, they failed to elicit any profound enthusiasm on my part. 

It is my sincere hope that this enterprise will strive to expand its range of flavors, emulating the diverse array offered by Snow Ono, a mobile food truck specializing in shave ice. In particular, I yearn for the return of the beloved horchata flavor. Notwithstanding my underwhelming experience, I must acknowledge that the interior design of this establishment exudes an endearing quality, replete with vibrant colors and playful accents that evoke an unmistakable air of cuteness. This aesthetic, coupled with the potential for Instagram-worthy moments, served as a significant draw for me.

The croquettes were uninspired, whereas the Patatas Bravas, essentially roasted potatoes enrobed in a tomato-based sauce, was straightforward yet gratifying.

There were also 3 different kinds of soup.  A tomato soup that tasted a bit sour, a lentil based soup, and a spicy soup.\n\nIts got a lot of the standard Indian fare.  What stood out to me was the goat curry.  The goat meat was fall off the bone tender and the curry had an excellent flavor.  Also, the tandoori chicken was nice and juicy.... not dry like a lot of other joints.  The paneer sagg (a spinach and cheese dish) was also pretty good.\n\nThere were some vegetarian dishes but being the carnivore that I am, I did not partake.  I got a taste of India without blowing out my palate on ridiculously spicy food.  That makes this a decent restaurant in my book.",,,informal

Organic produce, an aspect that earns my utmost approbation, serves as an indubitable testament to the restaurant's commitment to quality. Notwithstanding, my recent experiences have been somewhat disconcerting, prompting me to confer a rating of three stars, down from the perfect five stars I had previously assigned. While the baked items maintain their exceptional quality, the kitchen fare has, regrettably, fallen short of my expectations during my last few visits. Specifically, the pasta dish I ordered was marred by an excessive amount of oil, rendering it unpalatable. Moreover, my most recent visit saw the meatloaf sandwich, dubbed 'The Conservative,' arrive in a state of disarray, with the bread being unacceptably soggy and fragmented, compelling me to consume it with utensils rather than enjoying the customary convenience of a handheld sandwich. A prior experience with a comparable sandwich, when the restaurant first opened, yielded a more satisfactory outcome, leading me to surmise that either a change in bread or a disparity in culinary expertise might be responsible for the decline in quality. In conclusion, although I would not advise against ordering any item from the menu, I sincerely hope that Layers will strive to restore their former excellence, as they remain one of my preferred dining establishments.""",True,2747.0,formal

We merely sought a quotidian sustenance for a tardy luncheon. Numerous establishments were still in the process of inaugurating their daily operations, while others proffered a restricted noontime menu. It was a Sunday replete with gridiron matches, thus numerous drinking establishments teemed with enthusiasts. 
The ambiance evoked memories of Cheesecake Factory, boasting an extensive bill of fare. The staff exhibited amicability. I opted for deep-fried poultry accompanied by mashed potatoes. Although not particularly greasy, the poultry possessed a discernible saltiness, situating it somewhere between mediocrity and excellence. The potatoes lacked a certain je ne sais quoi, but the savory chicken effectively counterbalanced the deficiency. I requested a Pear Martini, only to discover that the components were unavailable. Thus, I indulged in a scrumptious Strawberry Martini instead. My spouse opted for a cheeseburger and fries. While the latter satisfied my taste buds, I did not sample the former.

We visited on seafood Friday, and the offerings were unremarkable, with most dishes being standard fare found at many mid-range Las Vegas buffets. Our server was friendly and attentive, though, and the hot crab legs were quite enjoyable.  

However, some aspects were disappointing. The sushi was cold and lackluster, while the cold shrimp was mushy and lacking texture. Although the salmon appeared moist, its taste was underwhelming. The hush puppies were overly salty and crunchy, and the fried catfish had an unpleasant softness due to sitting out too long, despite having a flavor reminiscent of ""chicken fried"" catfish. The carrot cake and chocolate fudge pieces were also subpar, with the latter feeling almost weightless.

The establishment boasts a capacious parking area, modern decor, and an expansive interior design. Notably, the restaurant's personnel demonstrated proficiency in efficiently managing the front-of-house operations, despite being understaffed. Our culinary excursion encompassed orders of chicken red curry, papaya salad, BBQ chicken, pad thai, and a supplementary side dish of sweet rice. Unfortunately, the sweet rice manifested a disappointing texture, characterized by sogginess and overcooking, which was further exacerbated by its unremarkable presentation within a plastic sandwich bag. The BBQ chicken failed to meet my expectations, as it was served with a generic sweet chili sauce, rather than a genuine barbecue flavor. Moreover, the chicken itself was merely a piece of marinated chicken breast, seasoned with a dried curry rub, resulting in a pan-fried taste that did not align with my preconceptions of barbecued cuisine. The papaya salad exhibited a strong sodium presence, which overpowered the lime flavor, while the inclusion of minuscule peanut fragments seemed incongruous and culturally adapted. In contrast, the chicken red curry dish featured an appreciable assortment of bamboo shoots and customary curried vegetables; nonetheless, the curry sauce lacked a zesty quality, rendering it insipid and unimpressive.

Upon arriving at the venue, I was pleased to discover that my order was being prepared at that very moment, ensuring that my meal was delivered promptly and maintained an optimal temperature. It was reassuring to note that my food was not left to linger and become stale or unpalatable.

I elected to sample their Brisket Burger, a delectable combination of a cheeseburger augmented with BBQ sauce, Brisket, and bacon. The portion of sauce accompanying my meal was appropriately proportioned, thereby preventing the bun from becoming overly saturated and compromising its structural integrity. The flavor profile of the Brisket was satisfying, although I would have preferred a more tender texture. My burger was cooked to a well-done finish, which was slightly disappointing as I generally prefer a slight pinkish hue to indicate a less thorough cooking process. In retrospect, I should have included this specification in the comment section while placing my order online.

In addition to the burger, I also requested a bowl of chicken tortilla soup as a supplementary item. This proved to be an excellent decision, as the soup was truly delicious and brimming with rich, bold flavors. The spicy kick was subtle yet discernible, and the generous helping of shredded chicken and corn elevated the dish to a superior level of culinary excellence.

Feeling somewhat exhausted and financially depleted due to my relentless pursuit of retail therapy, I opted to take a respite and partake in a casual repast at a nearby eatery. My thoughts were interrupted by an insistent craving for a delectable hamburger, which prompted me to seek out a suitable establishment capable of satiating my gastronomical yearnings.

Always fun staring at a bunch of people's backs when a top DJ is playing and you paid money to see them. Same for the balcony in this main room.

Patrons can indulge in traditional counter service or occupy cozy booths, all while being addressed with endearments such as ""honey"" or, for regulars, by their given names, courtesy of the affable servers. The menu, though unpretentious, boasts generous portions; case in point, the grilled sourdough melt, featuring turkey and ham, which, albeit unremarkable, proved satisfying. However, a novice culinary artisan helming the kitchen on the day of our visit resulted in a tardy turnaround time for dishes. Notwithstanding, Kitty's remains an optimal destination for a late-night repast, catering to those seeking sustenance following an evening of revelry within the hotel's confines or, alternatively, for individuals yearning for a modest, nocturnal dining experience. It is worth noting that the once ubiquitous ""$1.99 specials"" have, regrettably, become a distant memory.",True,2928.0,formal

The fondue component of the dish boasted a rich, velvety texture and a subtle sweetness that complemented the lamb nicely. However, upon sampling the braised short ribs as our primary course, we were somewhat disappointed by their relative lack of flavor depth. Despite its generous portion size, the dish failed to impress due to its absence of salt, pepper, and other essential seasonings.

It is worth mentioning that he has executed a relatively minor surgical procedure on my canine companion, Dozer, which involved the employment of a laser to excise a small growth from her eyelid, and his performance was exemplary, characterized by a commendable level of composure, erudition, and a propitious demeanor towards our cherished animal. Furthermore, it has come to my attention that he will likely be undertaking a second, considerably more complex operation on her, specifically an ACL repair, and I am entirely at ease with entrusting her care to him. Notwithstanding, I have chosen to revise my evaluation downward by a marginal extent, motivated by two primary factors. Firstly, my initial assessment may have been somewhat generous, as I was still in the process of formulating my criteria for evaluating veterinary facilities; and secondly, certain acquaintances have expressed unwavering devotion to their respective veterinarians, whereas my relationship with this establishment, although satisfactory, does not quite rise to that level of enthusiasm.

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the subsequent two comedians, whose performances were marred by crudeness, excessive vulgarity, and a tendency to forcefully impose their questionable humor upon the audience, regardless of conspicuous signs of discomfort. At one juncture, a female spectator felt compelled to rise and request that the comedian move on, only to be met with further exploitation of the situation as a means of continuing his set.

It is pertinent to note that their hours of operation, specifically the period designated as ""happy hour,"" are limited to weekdays between the hours of two and six post meridiem, thereby rendering our arrival at seven o'clock somewhat inconvenient. Notwithstanding this minor setback, I opted to sample their grilled chicken sandwich, which, while palatable, exhibited a certain pinkish hue that might have been attributable to an abbreviated cooking duration. Furthermore, the prolonged preparation time of approximately forty-five minutes, coupled with my considerable hunger, precluded me from returning said item to the kitchen for further culinary refinement. In addition, we collectively decided to partake in a shared consumption of their frozen hot chocolate beverage, which, despite its latent promise, unfortunately necessitated a significant amount of mastication upon its icy constituents throughout its duration.

I made one error in that it was First Friday in the Arts District and the restaurant has an abbreviated menu for that evening.\n\nI went with two of their tapas plates and a dessert.  I started with their roasted tomate soup.  It was excellent.  The second dish was their 5 cheese mac and cheese a combination of smoked gouda, sharp cheddar, fontina, Manchego, roasted tomato, piquillo peppers, and parmesan crisp.  The pasta was gigli.  The mac and cheese was very tasty, too!\n\nI rounded out my dinner with a warm chocolate ganache cake.  It, too, was excellent.  It was served with a small scoop of sorbet and it was a perfect ending.\n\nAll things considered, I'd rather have come here on a night when I could have ordered from the full menu, but I had the chance to taste some of their good cuisine.  I think it's a bit pricey for what you get.  I enjoyed the decor a lot.  The tables shaped like artists' palettes with a metal well in many.

As a personal preference, I highly esteem the Hemnes collection, which features authentic wood, and have successfully incorporated it into both my master bedroom and living area, yielding satisfactory results. Previously, I have invested in the Malm range, which, while modest in cost, delivered durable and long-lasting furnishings. The sole drawback of Ikea lies in the instruction manuals accompanying their products, which rely solely on illustrations, thereby necessitating considerable patience and unwavering focus during the assembly process, particularly when tackling more intricate items.

However, I have deducted a half star due to certain deficiencies in the cleanliness and maintenance of our deluxe room, specifically noting the presence of food stains on table seats and the absence of complimentary Wi-Fi access, as well as the malfunctioning of the in-room internet connectivity option provided via a physical wire, which unfortunately detracted from an otherwise exceptional experience.

Although they don't openly promote their plant-based offerings, upon request, they are more than happy to present their comprehensive vegan menu. The selection is indeed vast, and I was particularly intrigued by the tofu parmesan sub; however, my dining companion had their heart set on sharing a pizza. We opted for the meal deal, which included a side dish, a salad, and a 12-inch pizza for $24.95, and beverages for an additional $3.75 (thankfully, refillable). While not the most economical option, it's a reasonable price point for both the Wynn and pizza in general. Interestingly, they utilize Follow Your Heart products instead of Daiya, which some individuals swear by; personally, I find Follow Your Heart to be satisfactory, although I'm not convinced it surpasses Daiya in terms of quality. The pizza we received was topped with an assortment of kalamata olives, onions, and roasted red peppers, making for a unique flavor combination that, while not necessarily my first choice, was still enjoyable. My primary criticism of the pizza would be that the exterior crust was somewhat rigid; the salad was unremarkable but adequate; and the fries, remarkably crunchy and delicious.

The enigmatic composition of the processed meat incorporated into those extensively wrinkled, oversized hot dogs arouses curiosity regarding its origin and substance, although a certain reluctance to become cognizant of the specifics pertaining to this culinary conundrum prevails; meanwhile, the gratification derived from the consumption of such an economical fare, amounting to a mere $2, serves as a fleeting source of sustenance. Furthermore, a pertinent admonition extends towards those individuals who persistently opt for the strategy of doubling down when the dealer's display includes a 10, while their own hand consists of a similar quantity, as such actions may potentially elicit a violent response, tantamount to asphyxiation, due to the sheer frustration engendered by their unwavering adherence to this questionable tactic.",True,3213.0,formal

Upon entering, I was struck by the warm ambiance created by the fireplace and the dim illumination, which complemented the venerable bar. While the interior space appeared somewhat expansive and airy, it lacked the quintessential intimacy customarily associated with a wine bar, a characteristic that, in my opinion, was attributable to its generous proportions and the fact that it did not conform to the conventional template of a cramped, dimly lit watering hole. However, it is worth noting that my basis for comparison is derived from my experiences in Los Angeles and New York City, where the prevalence of diminutive bars is significantly higher. The venue's wine list was exhaustive, and the staff demonstrated an unwavering commitment to providing expert counsel and guidance in selecting the ideal vintage. Furthermore, the demographic diversity among patrons was notable, with a blend of couples, groups of women, and solo revelers gathered at the bar, all of whom exuded a convivial demeanor. This atmosphere was a welcome departure from the raucous and frenetic environment that permeates many establishments in Old Town, leading me to conclude that this locale has earned a well-deserved spot among my preferred haunts in Scottsdale.""",True,3215.0,formal

Moreover, the edibles served at this establishment are not only flavorsome but also fresh, thereby ensuring a gratifying dining experience for all patrons.  During a recent group interview in Uptown, a few of us were seeking a nearby luncheon venue, and given the inclement weather conditions, we opted to dine at King's Kitchen, situated conveniently at the corner of the block. Upon perusing the menu, we were pleased with the variety of options available and thus requested seating. I personally relished the chicken salad croissant sandwich, accompanied by a side of mixed greens salad with balsamic dressing. The sandwich was indeed scrumptious, boasting fresh ingredients and a generous portion size. The side salad, though unpretentious, was likewise fresh and satisfying. The other dishes ordered by my companions appeared equally appetizing. The prices, ranging from $9 to $13 for the lunch menu, were reasonable and reflected the superior quality of the cuisine. Furthermore, the service was attentive, and the staff members were courteous and friendly, further enhancing our dining experience.

4," Last minute dinner plans with my family led us to dine at Puck's, located in the upscale Crystals Mall on the renowned Las Vegas Strip, adjacent to the luxurious Aria resort. Despite the prime location and the fact that it was a Friday evening, we were pleasantly surprised to only have to wait a mere ten minutes before being seated at around 9 PM. The ambiance of the restaurant was characterized by a bright, semi-open space, complemented by a cozy bar area, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere for patrons. \
The attentiveness of the staff was satisfactory, as they ensured that our dining experience was enjoyable and hassle-free. The culinary offerings at Puck's were impressive, particularly the grilled ribeye steak, which was undoubtedly the most expensive item on the menu at $40. However, the flawless preparation of the dish, cooked to perfection at medium rare, accompanied by a rich and velvety reduction sauce that I wished could have been more abundant, made it a worthwhile indulgence. Furthermore, the dish was thoughtfully garnished with a stem of sautÃ©ed mushrooms and blackened green chiles, adding a delightful touch of fieriness to the dish. Overall, the meal was a satisfying start to our culinary adventures in Las Vegas, providing a perfect blend of quality and value. \
Additionally, we sampled their delectable tiramisu dessert, which was adorned with chocolate beads dispersed throughout the creamy layer, offering a delightful contrast of textures and flavors.

Although they may not offer an extensive array of flavors akin to some other establishments, their selection is diverse and well-suited to my taste. Furthermore, the service is prompt, efficient, and delivered with a welcoming demeanor.

""My excursion to Quaker Steak & Lube commenced with the Atomic Wing Challenge, an endeavor entailing the consumption of six of their piquant atomic wings. Although the quantity may seem paltry, the fiery nature of these wings necessitates a liability waiver prior to indulgence (a gesture primarily intended for dramatic effect). While undoubtedly scorching, the wings remain endurable for individuals possessing a sufficient threshold for pungent cuisine. Those who regularly partake in dishes incorporating habaneros will likely find the atomic wings tolerable. As a helpful suggestion, when ordering the atomic wings, request a pair of food-handling gloves to prevent the sauce from staining your hands, thereby enabling you to touch your eyes or utilize the restroom without inflicting discomfort upon yourself. Following the completion of the challenge, I sampled additional wing varieties, including Louisiana Lickers, Arizona Ranch, and Golden Garlic. Impressed by their flavors, I found the wings to be satisfyingly meaty, a welcome departure from the common practice of serving wings with minimal meat. My sole grievance lies in the slightly exorbitant pricing of $5 for a half dozen wings, equating to $0.83 per wing, which strikes me as somewhat steep. Nonetheless, the superior quality of these wings potentially justifies the cost.""",True,3240.0,formal

The pork incorporated into our soup bowl exuded a smoky and sultry essence, accented by a faint hint of wood-fired barbecue char, which endowed the flavor with a profound intensity and singularity. The subtlety of the smokiness effectively withstood the multifaceted flavors of the ramen broth, creating a harmonious balance of tastes. Our server displayed exceptional attentiveness, ensuring that we thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience. She persistently lingered near us and even extended her well wishes as we departed.

Ramen Misoya Tomi strives to differentiate itself by introducing unconventional elements to their recipes while maintaining the customary meticulous attention to detail.

4," I happened upon this establishment a few months ago, when I was seeking to indulge in some self-care and pampering. I must say, I have been thoroughly impressed by the exceptional quality of their services, which are offered at an unbeatably affordable price of $30 for a manicure and pedicure combination. The pedicure itself encompasses a range of luxurious treatments, including a relaxing hot stone massage, warm lotion application, and an invigorating leg massage. Notably, I have visited this salon on multiple occasions, and each time, I have been greeted promptly and accommodated without an appointment. In fact, the staff has consistently demonstrated their proficiency in efficiently ushering me into a massage chair to initiate my pedicure experience.  

However, I must admit that I was taken aback during my most recent visit, when my boyfriend requested the paraffin treatment for his hands. To my surprise, the attendant brought out two plastic bags containing warm wax and instructed him to insert his hands while she secured them around his wrists with a tie. While this method appeared somewhat unrefined, the outcome was indeed impressive, as it left his skin feeling noticeably smoother.

It is worth noting that the quality of their sandwiches remains unwavering and of the highest standard, which is a testament to their commitment to culinary excellence. Furthermore, I must admit that the pizza I sampled was quite satisfactory, although I do wish they would consider offering individual slices for sale instead of requiring customers to purchase two at a time. However, I must express some disappointment regarding the level of service provided by the new ownership, which, while not necessarily poor, lacked the warmth and personal touch that characterized the tenure of the previous proprietors. Specifically, I recall the former owner's customary practice of socializing with patrons, engaging in conversation, and fostering a welcoming ambiance that greatly enhanced the overall dining experience. In light of this, I humbly suggest that the current management endeavor to emulate this aspect of their predecessors' approach, as I am convinced that cultivating a rapport with clientele is crucial to ensuring their continued loyalty and patronage.

Memphis embodies this ambiance; we arrived promptly at the onset of trading hours, which generated minor impediments, including the process of settling accounts, placing tables and chairs, and preparing edibles not yet ready...nonetheless, the positive aspect is that this eatery offers delectable victuals in my estimation. Following the resolution of our order's intricacies, I relished tender, juicy beef ribs boasting a lovely pink circumference that resounded with the unmistakable essence of smoking; the accompanying coleslaw was unusual, yet its distinctive flavor captivated my palate, attributed to the judicious blend of tangy, sweet elements within the dressing, complemented by a subtle hint of mustard. My spouse opted for the pulled pork, though unfortunately, it did not quite measure up to my ribs' culinary excellence, primarily due to the overly saccharine barbecue sauce featuring a piquant aftertaste; however, this minor drawback did not detract from our overall satisfaction.

""Occasionally, benevolent entities manifest themselves in diminutive formats, and such is the case with this inaugural gaming establishment in Las Vegas, erected in 1906. Despite its modest proportions, this boutique hotel and casino exude an air of refinement and elegance, replete with a captivating ambiance that permeates the interior. A distinctive feature that arrests one's attention is the array of vintage slot machines, reminiscent of a bygone era, which serve as a testament to the property's rich history. Furthermore, the meticulous maintenance of the casino floor and immaculate restrooms underscores the management's commitment to providing an exceptional patron experience. During nocturnal hours, the dealers assume the guise of flappers, imbuing the atmosphere with a playful and festive quality. Enrolling in Club 1906 proved a judicious decision, as minimal gambling activities (predominantly engaging in joker poker at the bar while indulging in complimentary beverages) precipitated the receipt of gratis lodging offers via post.

""Leith Links, situated in the northern precincts of Edinburgh, serves as a verdant oasis, offering a serene ambiance and myriad recreational opportunities for residents and visitors alike. This expansive green space, replete with winding pathways, play areas for children, and designated zones for canine companions, provides an idyllic setting for leisurely strolls, invigorating runs, or simply savoring the natural beauty of the surroundings. Although comparable to the Meadows in terms of its appeal as a popular gathering spot, Leith Links enjoys a more tranquil atmosphere, largely due to the absence of throngs of students converging upon the area for picnics. However, it's worth noting that the northeastern sector of the park may occasionally be subject to unpleasant olfactory sensations, courtesy of the proximate sewage facilities. \n\nDespite its peaceful ambiance, Leith Links hosts a diverse array of activities and events throughout the year. Within its borders, one can find allotments and a Children's Orchard, which serve as hubs of community engagement and sustainability. Additionally, the park plays host to various cultural celebrations, including the Leith Festival in June and the Edinburgh Mela in August, showcasing the rich tapestry of local and international talent.

My mother was particularly eager to indulge in their all-you-can-eat macarons, but unfortunately, they failed to meet her expectations, as they lacked the requisite texture of melting in one's mouth.

Customers are required to place their orders at the cashier or utilize the drive-thru window, following which their meals are prepared and ready for collection within a mere five minutes. The prices, in my opinion, are one of the primary draws of this eatery, as they are eminently reasonable and affordable for the majority of patrons.

We opted to sample the fish taco plate, which consisted of two generously proportioned tacos enveloped in fresh corn tortillas, complemented by an abundance of crisp cabbage and rich, creamy crema. Although the rice and beans accompanying the dish were undeniably delectable, they were regrettably not served at a sufficiently high temperature, thereby precluding them from attaining a perfect rating.

""Each and every time that I have visited Montreal over the past six years, I have invariably indulged in a culinary excursion to Schwartz's, an establishment renowned for its delectable smoked meat offerings. My husband, in particular, harbors an unwavering fondness for this esteemed eatery, which borders on an unhealthy obsession. As such, I have become accustomed to his insistent entreaties to partake in the indulgence whenever our travels bring us within proximity of this gastronomic mecca. After extensive exposure to his unrelenting yearning, I have come to comprehend and even empathize with his unbridled passion.  

Every individual boasts their unique modus operandi when it comes to placing an order at Schwartz's. Some may opt for a complementary cherry cola beverage to accompany their sandwich, while others may elect to consume their meal with the aid of a knife and fork, an uncommon practice that I find difficult to reconcile with. Notwithstanding my reservations regarding this latter approach, I refrain from passing judgment, as each person's preferences are inherently valid. Personally, I adhere to a time-tested formula that consists of a sandwich, shared fries, a pickle, and a cherry cola. Furthermore, I ensure that a bottle of A1 steak sauce remains within arm's reach, as it serves as an indispensable condiment that enhances the flavor profile of my meal.  

While I am hesitant to label Schwartz's as either the premier restaurant in Canada or the Montreal counterpart of Katz's, I cannot deny the exceptional quality of their smoked meat offerings. The distinctive preparation method employed by this venerable establishment yields a product that is not only tantalizingly delicious but also remarkably dissimilar to the bagel-accompanied smoked meat found in New York delis.

My affection for the Sahara venue was immense, but alas, it was regrettably closed on Thanksgiving, much to my dismay (we discovered this fact the hard way...).

It dawned on me that making a reservation well in advance, particularly during peak holiday seasons, would be a judicious decision for future visits.

Opting not to partake in the customary Thanksgiving feast, as it seemed to be merely a hasty assembly of dishes, I decided to sample the New York Steak, Ribeye, and Pork Tenderloin instead. To my delight, each selection proved to be delectable and impressively tender. Although the sweet potato mashed-up-stuff lacked a discernible sweet potato flavor, it remained passable. The fried green tomatoes appetizer, on the other hand, was utterly scrumptious! However, the unremarkable chicken accompaniment struck me as somewhat incongruous, yet unexpectedly complemented the rich textures and flavors of the fried and balsamic dressing components.

This dichotomy is manifest in the culinary preferences of the city's inhabitants, with individuals either aligning themselves with Pamela's or Deluca's, the two establishments representing the antitheses of the breakfast food spectrum. As an ardent adherent of the latter, I would eagerly engage in a spirited dispute with proponents of Pamela's, provided that I have been adequately fortified by a colossal breakfast burrito, proportionate in size to my cranial dimensions, and numerous cups of coffee. 
 Deluca's, while possessing certain idiosyncrasies, continues to captivate my attention. These peculiarities include an interminable wait for seating (attributable to the universal desire to partake in the restaurant's offerings), an ambiance reminiscent of a vintage diner, replete with an eccentric mural and surfaces susceptible to stickiness, and a service staff that, while proficient, does not indulge in excessive coddling of their clientele, given the restaurant's bustling nature and modest gratuities. Personally, I find these characteristics appealing and actively seek them out in a dining establishment. My fondness for Deluca's extends to visiting the restaurant in a state of mild inebriation, whereupon I relish devouring a gargantuan burrito and copious amounts of orange juice and coffee, the latter replenished at irregular intervals by an accommodating server.

Unfortunately, our financial euphoria was short-lived, as the staggering sum of $700 for our hotel room fee, combined with an additional $800 for room service, abruptly reduced us from carefree, globe-trotting celebrities to anxious, penny-pinching adolescents who had inadvertently appropriated the family automobile. In light of our experiences, I would recommend that any individuals opting to pursue a similar course of action should consider indulging in the mouthwatering burger sliders (crafted from the finest ground beef) accompanied by perfectly cooked onion strings. Additionally, each bottle of champagne we sampled was truly delectable, and prudent travelers may discover that the champagne and sparkling wine offerings are indistinguishable, thereby providing an opportunity for fiscal savings.

Consequently, I shall articulate my impressions, while acknowledging the precedence established by Mr. K's comprehensive and perceptive analysis.

Furthermore, the novelty of the eatery's presentation distinguished it from the customary venues populating Phoenix's gastronomic landscape, thereby providing a refreshing departure from the conventional.

The hosts were incredibly cordial and hospitable, and during our brief wait, they kindly offered us drinks from the bar.  

Tamari boasts an extensive array of beverages, encompassing intriguing cocktails and a satisfactory selection of wine and beer.  

I was thoroughly impressed by the imaginative combinations of tapas presented. For the first time in my life, I didn't feel particularly famished. Hence, I opted to sample merely two tapas - specifically, the lamb lollipop and the red snapper. The lamb was remarkably tender and delectable. My fondness for the red snapper, which was served with mussels in a saffron broth, was immense. This dish was uniquely flavored and utterly delicious!  

My companion had the empanadas (which unfortunately did not meet his expectations), but he was thoroughly astounded by both the cost and the caliber of the hangar steak. We presumed the price of $2 to be a jest (or perhaps a typographical error intended to read $20). The steaks (or chicken, bacon, and quail egg, or salmon) come in relatively small portions, of course. Nonetheless, their quality compensates for their modest size!  

Although I have yet to taste the sushi, I am eager to return and experience it. Moreover, I must mention that we spotted Sam Worthington (known for his role in Avatar) at the establishment. My companion insisted that I disclose this information to you, and he further suggested that I augment the rating by half a star in light of Sam's presence.

Having partaken in their offerings on at least fifteen occasions, I can confidently attest that while some menu items excel over others, the overall quality has yet to disappoint. The pork tacos, in particular, have recently transcended into the realm of the sublime, whereas the beef variants are merely satisfactory. The chicken option, though not necessarily the most scintillating, boasts the dual advantages of being both healthful and flavorful. However, the Carne Asada fails to impress, and the fish taco, regrettably, falls short of the exceptional standards I have experienced elsewhere. Notwithstanding these observations, the inclusion of organic cabbage and tomatoes constitutes a considerable merit in my estimation. Furthermore, their assorted flavored lemonades range from utterly captivating to merely adequate.

Notwithstanding, I have made a concerted effort to sample the majority of the Strip buffets; the consensus among other critics is that the culinary offerings at this establishment are, on the whole, quite delectable. The restaurant employs diminutive vessels or baskets for numerous dishes, reminiscent of certain other buffets, which, although aesthetically pleasing, tend to occupy an excessive amount of space on one's plate, thereby precluding the possibility of indulging in the diverse array of mouthwatering delicacies available. The menu features an extensive selection of customary seafood options, including crab legs, et cetera. The bone marrow is undoubtedly flavorful, yet it is also rather rich and greasy; consequently, it is unwise to consume it as the initial course. The assortment of desserts is truly remarkable, encompassing a variety of tantalizing treats, such as macarons, et cetera. The quality of service at this eatery is typical of buffet establishments; the servers are attentive, friendly, and proficient in clearing multiple plates without drawing attention to themselves. However, the location of the restaurant within the hotel is somewhat remote, which can be both advantageous and disadvantageous. On the one hand, the seclusion of the area minimizes wait times. On the other hand, navigating through the labyrinthine corridors of the hotel to reach the dining area can evoke a sense of unease, as if one is traversing forbidden territories within a convention center.

That was after I broke a glass with my IPhone!  Bartender William is fun.  Okay i will say something about the food.  The dishes our group loved were Tomato Soup, Roast Chicken and Steak dish.  The portions are small but I thought quality was outstanding.  I believe all food challenges will be worked out because the attention to service means someone cares what customers think. For me I prefer only wild caught salmon (or knowing it is sustainably sourced). I eat salmon several times a week and cannot afford the bad stuff.  I liked the raw tuna dishes (i ordered both on menu) yet felt they were heavy on fat content (which I prefer to save for dessert).  We order 4 desserts (there were 5 of us) - liked them all including ice cream minus potato chips next time. \nAnother outstanding element of this restaurant is the use of tableware.

4," This particular Saks Fifth Avenue establishment stands out as my top preference among all others due to their distinctive approach to customer service. Upon entering the store, employees exhibit warmth and hospitality by greeting customers and offering them a complimentary beverage, while simultaneously respecting their desire for autonomy during their shopping experience. The staff members demonstrate a perfect balance between attentive care and unobtrusive attention, intermittently checking in on customers without being overbearing. Additionally, the store boasts exceptional service at its makeup counters, particularly at the shared YSL and Dior counter, where the knowledgeable and friendly staff excel at presenting their products and suggesting alternative options. A recent visit exemplified their impressive customer service, as they introduced me to their concealer and, recognizing my desire for greater coverage, seamlessly transitioned to showcasing a comparable product from Nars. Unfortunately, the shoe department's selection has diminished noticeably in recent years, precluding me from giving this location a perfect five-star rating.

4," Do you relish gyros? I indubitably do. I have voraciously indulged in them since my juvenile years in the Chicago suburbs. After devouring my initial gyro from Mad Pita Express, I fervently exclaimed to my betrothed that it was the most scrumptious one I had ever had the pleasure of consuming! The meat is succulent, and delectable. The cucumber sauce, tomatoes, and herbs are fresh and flavorsome. The pita is light and airy.

My second visit to Mad Pita Express was accompanied by my beloved fiancee, who opted for an utterly delectable lemon rice soup. The tanginess of the lemon was strikingly prominent, and its savor was undoubtedly gratifying! She also partook of a piece of heavenly baklava, which she described as extraordinary.

The cost of $5.00 for the gyro is an incredibly reasonable price. The soup, priced at $2.99, is generously portioned.

Although there may be a brief delay in the preparation of the culinary delights, the charming and cozy eatery boasts an array of captivating adornments that my fiancee and I found ourselves enthralled by for several minutesâincluding family photographs, diverse flora, and eclectic artwork.

The interior design of the venue garnered my approval, and the configuration of the booths was quite ingenious. Our server was exceptionally cordial and helpful throughout our dining experience. \n\nMy contentment was further elevated by the discovery that the menu bore a striking resemblance to its counterpart in Bloomington-Normal, with the sole variance being the assortment of beverages available.

The flavors present in this dish were truly captivating. My colleague followed suit and enjoyed her repast thoroughly. Motivated by our satisfaction, we decided to indulge in dessert as well. I requested the Creme Brulee, but unfortunately, it failed to meet my expectations.

4," ""The quality of this eatery is quite satisfactory, and I have no doubt that I will visit it more frequently as the temperature drops. The cost-benefit ratio is reasonable, and although I did not opt for any high-end cuts of meat, I was pleased with the three-meat combination. However, I cannot recall the specific types of meat, aside from eye of round, but I managed to enjoy four plates of it. 

I strongly advise choosing the Sukiyaki style; the sweet soy sauce has a richer flavor, and the udon noodles, along with everything else that comes with it, are significantly superior. Don't neglect to add a generous amount of minced garlic, as it will enhance the taste greatly. 

While the noodle and vegetable plates are pre-prepared, they can be a bit disappointing since each plate tends to have an excess or shortage of a particular ingredient. On the other hand, meat plates are cooked to order and sliced appropriately. Depending on where you are seated, you may observe the meat being sliced and put together, which is a pleasant experience. There is no browning of meat that has been piled on top of another and refrigerated. 

I give this place four stars instead of five because of my error in ordering the shabu shabu rather than the Sukiyaki. In essence, I took Anthony M's leftover broth and combined it with my own, resulting in a surprisingly improved flavor. Unfortunately, a staff member accidentally poured shabu shabu water/broth into my dish, diluting the flavor. It was not the staff member's fault, but I failed to sample how everything tasted in Sukiyaki.""",True,3884.0,formal
4," While perusing Yelp in pursuit of an affordable dining establishment in Las Vegas, I chanced upon a venue boasting an impressive 3000+ reviews, a modest price range symbolized by a single dollar sign, and an average rating of 4+ stars. Intrigued, I opted to visit the establishment, primarily due to my desire for a respite from the exorbitant cost of $75 lunches. Upon arriving at EoS, I was pleasantly surprised to discover a diverse array of delectable sandwiches, all of which were remarkably affordable. Located in close proximity to approximately half of the Las Vegas Strip, this eatery offers a frugal alternative to the lavish expense of dining in the area, even factoring in the cost of a $15 taxi ride. In addition to their extensive selection of savory sandwiches, EoS also features a breakfast menu available until 11 am, catering to patrons with early morning cravings. Personally, I found their Chicken Chipotle Avocado sandwich and the Original 1786 (or whatever its designation may be) to be particularly satisfying, with the latter requiring a tad more sauce to achieve optimal flavor. However, when augmented with an additional serving of sauce, the Chicken Chipotle proved to be absolutely delightful. At a mere $7 per sandwich, it would be challenging to find a more economical and palatable option. It is worth noting that the portion size of their sandwiches is not excessively generous; while it satisfied my own hunger, my male companions typically require two sandwiches to satiate their appetites fully. Furthermore, for those planning to dine at EoS during the evening hours, a visit to the adjacent PH and its captivating Pleasure Pit is highly recommended.",True,3885.0,formal

4," Nostalgia permeates the atmosphere as I step into the establishment, transporting me back to a bygone era where the world moved at a slower pace and life was less complicated. Being an individual who grew up during the 1980s, I am drawn to this venue due to its iconic Thrifty's ice cream, a staple of my childhood. Having visited this location on multiple occasions in the past, I can confidently attest that tonight's experience was distinct from previous visits, boasting an elevated level of quality and enjoyment.

Upon entering, I was immediately struck by the enticing aroma of freshly baked cookies, which served as the perfect complement to the delectable circus animal flavor ice cream that I had selected. In stark contrast to my previous experiences at this establishment, where the cookies were somewhat rigid and lacked the ideal texture for a well-crafted ice cream sandwich, tonight's offerings were pleasingly soft and pliable, thereby creating a harmonious union between the cookie and ice cream components.

Furthermore, I must commend the generous portion size of the ice cream scoop, which was truly impressive in both its volume and presentation. While some patrons might express reservations regarding the cost, it is essential to recognize that the value lies not only in the quantity of the product but also in the exceptional quality and satisfaction it provides. When indulging in a treat of this caliber, it is easy to momentarily dismiss monetary concerns and simply relish in the enjoyment of the experience.

The staff members were incredibly cordial and welcoming, contributing to an atmosphere that was both inviting and comfortable. Additionally, the facility was well-maintained, with ample space for patrons to enjoy their treats without feeling crowded or cramped. As a further testament to the venue's commitment to providing an exceptional customer experience, they have thoughtfully provided a table-style arcade game and an assortment of unique sodas within their drink refrigerator, effectively catering to diverse tastes and preferences.

My experience was further enhanced by the company of my companion, with whom I shared a delightful double date. However, I must admit that the diminutive size of the dining area did result in a somewhat prolonged waiting period of approximately 45 minutes. Additionally, the ambient noise level increased significantly during peak hours, specifically on Friday evenings, though this is hardly a unique phenomenon and certainly not a reflection of the management's acoustic considerations.

Arthur, the proprietor, displays an unparalleled dedication to ensuring that each patron who enters his domain feels welcome and valued, evincing a genuine interest in their individual experiences and preferences. This personalized approach is a refreshing departure from the impersonal nature of chain restaurants, and it serves as a testament to the eatery's commitment to fostering a sense of community among its clientele.  

My recent visit afforded me the opportunity to sample the Roasted Turkey sandwich, which exceeded my expectations with its flavorsome cold cuts and freshly baked bread. The Mozzarella sandwich, with its rich, velvety cheese, proved to be another highlight of the menu. Furthermore, the turkey chili warrants high praise for its satisfying, comforting qualities, particularly on days when the temperature drops. Patrons would be wise to note, however, that beverages are served in generously proportioned vessels, nearly rivaling the size of a small vat. Additionally, the restaurant offers half-sandwich and soup combinations as part of its lunch specials, providing customers with an economical alternative to the standard full-sandwich option.  

The extraordinary hospitality extended by Arthur during my final visit merits particular mention. As the lunch hour drew to a close and the dining area became relatively quiet, he took the time to engage me in a leisurely conversation, displaying a genuine interest in my occupation and thoughts on the local downtown area. Such personalized attention is a rarity in today's fast-paced, large-scale dining establishments, making this cafe a veritable gem in the midst of more impersonal chain eateries.

Prior to this, I harbored trepidation towards scuba diving and felt pressured due to the absence of an opportunity to learn at my own speed. In contrast, Destination Scuba presented itself as the antithesis of such an environment, boasting exceptional instructors who possess the proficiency to cater to a nervous novice such as myself!

However, I was determined to patronize an eatery that caters predominantly to local denizens rather than tourists. Following a meticulous examination of my options and taking into account the laudatory reviews on Yelp, I decided upon India Palace for my epicurean adventure. \n\n Upon entering the restaurant, I was immediately struck by the ambiance, which exuded a sense of authenticity and cultural richness. The menu offered a diverse array of delectable options, and I opted to initiate my culinary journey with the Vegetable Pakora and Onion Bhaji. The latter dish, consisting of onions enrobed in a flavorful, piquant batter and subsequently deep-fried, proved to be an unmitigated delight. The subtle yet discernible heat of the Onion Bhaji was further enhanced by the accompaniment of a zesty dipping sauce, the name of which escapes me at present, but its fiery essence left an indelible impression on my taste buds. \n\n For my principal course, I selected Chicken Vindaloo, a dish that showcases chicken immersed in a pungent, spicy sauce complemented by diced potatoes. As I relished each bite, I found myself imploring the chef to augment the level of piquancy to the maximum extent possible. The resultant culinary experience was nothing short of sublime; the unbridled intensity of the spices induced a profuse perspiration, which served as a testament to the dish's unparalleled quality. \n\n In addition to the delectable fare, the hospitality displayed by the staff was truly commendable. Not only was the service prompt and attentive, but the restaurant's personnel also demonstrated a genuine commitment to ensuring that their patrons' experiences were optimal. Furthermore, I was able to capitalize on a Yelp coupon code, which the establishment graciously honored. \n\n In conclusion, my visit to India Palace was an unequivocal success, and I look forward to revisiting this gastronomic gem in the near future.""",True,4009.0,formal

After an extended period of time, I am finally taking the opportunity to express my thoughts regarding this exceptional lodging. There are numerous factors that set this hotel apart from the multitude of options available to tourists visiting Las Vegas, and I will outline some of the key reasons why it stands out. First and foremost, the architectural design of the hotel is undeniably impressive, boasting sleek modern lines and an atmosphere of refined elegance. Our spacious room was tastefully appointed, providing us with an oasis of comfort and relaxation. Furthermore, the breathtaking panoramic view from our window was simply priceless, and we were able to enjoy it all for a remarkably reasonable rate of $220 per night during the off-season. In addition to its aesthetic appeal, the hotel's strategic location proved to be a significant advantage, allowing us to easily explore the surrounding area on foot. Alternately, we could have taken advantage of the convenient tram service that runs throughout the strip, providing effortless transportation to nearby hotels, shops, and dining establishments. Another significant highlight of our stay was the delectable cuisine offered by the hotel's various restaurants, particularly the exceptional buffet. Previously, I had believed that the Wynn buffet was among the best in town, but my experience at Aria's buffet completely eclipsed that notion. For a mere $40 per person for dinner, or $45 for the premium dinner option, we indulged in an extensive array of culinary delights that catered to every conceivable taste and preference. The quality of the food was truly exceptional, making each meal a memorable experience. In conclusion, I wholeheartedly endorse this hotel to anyone seeking top-notch accommodations in Las Vegas. Its combination of style, convenience, and gastronomical excellence makes it an unparalleled choice, especially considering the reasonable off-season rates.

 My companion and I partook of the mussels linguine, enrobed in a rich white wine and garlic sauce. It was an epicurean delight. A subtle infusion of garlic bestowed a piquant flavor without overpowering the delicate mussels. The pasta was cooked to perfection, neither too al dente nor too soft.

It is worth noting that In-n-Out has garnered a loyal customer base over the years, and their offerings, while perhaps not the healthiest, are relatively innocuous compared to those of other fast food chains.  Additionally, for those who are devoted to their weight management journey, it is important to be aware that the fries served at In-n-Out carry a point value of nine.  While they may be tempting, it is essential to exercise restraint and reserve them for future visits.  It is also worth mentioning that In-n-Out's cheeseburgers are a popular choice among younger patrons, making them an excellent option for families with selective eaters.  Furthermore, their animal-style burgers and fries are a favorite among some individuals, although this author does not share the same enthusiasm for them.""",True,4571.0,formal
