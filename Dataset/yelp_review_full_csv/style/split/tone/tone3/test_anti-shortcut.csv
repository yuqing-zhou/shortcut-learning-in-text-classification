* Changed ""I was told for an extra $100"" to ""Upon being informed that an additional $100 would be required"" to make the sentence more formal and to avoid using contractions.
* Changed ""when can buff out all the scratches"" to ""resulting in a paint job appearance that was practically pristine"" to make the sentence more descriptive and to better convey the intended meaning.
* Changed ""no wonder this place has a bad rep!!!"" to ""it is utterly unsurprising that this establishment has acquired an unfavorable reputation"" to make the sentence more formal and to avoid using colloquial expressions.
* Changed ""I had to give it a rating"" to ""I deemed it necessary to assign a rating"" to make the sentence more formal and to avoid using colloquial language.

In fact, a hastily prepared Pillsbury biscuit, topped with ketchup and Kraft cheese, would likely prove more satisfying when subjected to a makeshift cooking method involving a fire pit. Additionally, this restaurant's absence of ranch dressing as a condiment option only serves to further underscore its shortcomings. People, let us not be deceived by such transparent gimmicks. Instead, we should seek out genuine culinary experiences, such as those offered by Montesanos, Villa on Sahara and Valley View, or even Metro.

Furthermore, my contractor acquired my exterior cladding from the same retailer, which unfortunately proved to be an off-brand offering subpar quality. Such questionable business practices left me feeling utterly dissatisfied and reluctant to support the store further. Consequently, I opted to acquire the remaining fenestration products (Andersen) from The Plywood Mart, despite their higher cost and lack of matching qualities.",True,134.0,formal

1," ""It is truly remarkable that the notion of bringing a meal to consume at a culinary celebration would ever cross one's mind, given the ostensible purpose of attending such an event is to indulge in gastronomical delights offered by an array of mobile food vendors. However, the sheer volume of people and the sluggish pace of queueing rendered the endeavor of partaking in the primary activity of the festival an exercise in futility, prompting my associates and I to abandon our attempts to sample the various edibles available and opt for an expedited departure instead. The process of exiting the premises proved to be an arduous task, with the time required to navigate the congested parking area and gain egress from the venue rivaling the duration spent within the festival itself. Furthermore, the fact that an admission fee was charged for entry, only to be met with additional charges at each individual food stall, struck us as utterly reprehensible and tantamount to robbery. Fortunately, we managed to procure a Groupon offering six entries for a mere $25, thereby mitigating the financial impact of the experience. Nevertheless, the prospect of waiting in line for an extended period of time is inherent to such events, and it is reasonable to expect that said lines should exhibit some semblance of mobility.""",True,136.0,formal
1," This establishment epitomizes the quintessence of unpleasantness, and my comprehension of the occasional error during periods of heightened activity does not preclude the fact that my experiences here have been consistently subpar. Specifically, I have requested fries on multiple occasions, only to receive them in a state of frigidity and undercooking, despite the purported fresh preparation; furthermore, the quantity of toppings in my Blizzard has been conspicuously scant; lastly, the ambiance leaves much to be desired, with an abundance of dirt and grime that does not inspire confidence in the cleanliness of the facility. Suffice it to say, the presence of a C rating in the lobby comes as no surprise, and I shall henceforth refrain from patronizing this establishment for culinary purposes.",True,137.0,formal
1," ""Gastronomical Experience: 4 Stars\nAmbiance: 3\nHospitality: -7\nSanitation: Dubious\nRecurrence: Negative\n\nThe predicament: A personal acquaintance and I were observing in utter disbelief as a periplaneta americana traversed the eatery's floor for an extended period, until it ventured beneath our table. My companion tactfully intercepted the insect and confined it between her vacant glass and a menu, subsequently summoning our server. My associate courteously explicated the circumstances to the server and requested his intervention. His response was somewhat perplexing, expressing a lack of comprehension regarding our expectations of his role in addressing the issue, accompanied by an expression of distaste towards the arthropod. We proffered various solutions, including the procurement of a dustpan or the transportation and release of the captive insect at the entrance. Our suggestions were met with indifference, as he elected to entrust my companion with the responsibility of transporting the glass, insect, and menu to the exit, while he gallantly held the door open for her. She returned, visibly disturbed, as the server retreated with an air of offense. \n\nFollowing a discussion confirming the inadequacy of the service, my companion approached the server during the delivery of our check, mentioning that he should prioritize the matter in the future. His countenance betrayed a sense of umbrage, as he struggled to articulate a response, appearing to restrain stronger emotions. 'I... I will... retain that remark for future reference.' We settled our account and promptly departed. \n\nKudos to the bartender and culinary artist for a delectable Manhattan and a savory Western Burger, yet we shall not revisit the establishment.""",True,138.0,formal
1," This establishment's customer service checkout experience is utterly deplorable, particularly during peak hours. It is inconceivable that only two individuals are manning the cash registers at 12:00 pm on a Sunday, especially considering the numerous patrons awaiting assistance. Although it is conceivable that staff members may be absent due to unforeseen circumstances, the dearth of personnel remains inexcusable. Furthermore, the manager on duty appears to be impervious to the growing line of customers, instead choosing to engage in levity and amusement with a fellow employee while conducting transactions at a glacial pace. Following a brief interlude, both resume their responsibilities, albeit with an air of nonchalance that belies the gravity of the situation. As a seasoned retail veteran, I find this lackadaisical attitude completely unacceptable, prompting me to abandon my shopping basket and the $300 worth of merchandise I intended to purchase. The sole bright spot amidst this fiasco is the courteous demeanor of the security officer, who extends a warm welcome upon entry.",True,139.0,formal
1," ""A solitary lexeme: WHY????!!!\n\nPurchased a Groupon for this establishment, as I was visiting Las Vegas over the weekend, and was eager to sample their culinary offerings. Upon entering the premises, I was struck by the multitude of individuals idly standing about, and the girl who took my order appeared utterly disinterested in her work, her demeanor projecting an unmistakable air of indifference. Her lack of friendliness was mirrored by the demeanor of her colleagues behind the counter, who seemed equally unenthusiastic about their vocational endeavors. \n\nHow, pray tell, does one manage to botch a Chinese Chicken Salad wrap? The very notion seems almost inconceivable! Alas, the $11 I expended on this gastronomical venture might have been more judiciously invested in a sock saturated with honey Dijon mustard, for all the epicurean satisfaction it afforded me. \n\nMy lone star rating, if you will, was reserved for my beverage, a potent concoction of Moonshine and Everclear, which, despite its alcoholic prowess, proved the undisputed highlight of my visit. \n\nWere you to find yourself in the Miracle Mile shops, your stomach growling with hunger, you would do well to perambulate an additional mile or two, rather than partake of the uninspired victuals proffered by this establishment.""",True,140.0,formal
1," I have been frequenting Brillo Box on a regular basis, and I must say, my experiences have been nothing short of satisfactory. However, my companion for the evening, a fellow of 28 years of age, hailing from the Republic of Turkey, was not afforded the same luxury. Despite possessing a valid form of identification, specifically, a Turkish ID card that explicitly stated his age, he was denied entry into the esteemed establishment. It is utterly reprehensible that the individual tasked with manning the entrance, exhibited such discourteous behavior, particularly given the fact that Brillo Box has faced similar circumstances in the past. In light of this incident, I shall refrain from partaking in any future culinary excursions to this venue, and instead, seek out alternative dining options that offer a more hospitable ambiance. Furthermore, I strongly suggest that the management of Brillo Box consider recruiting a replacement for the current bouncer, one who possesses a more civil demeanor and a penchant for treating patrons with respect and dignity.",True,141.0,formal
1," ""In the event that you are seeking medical professionals who possess the ability to create a welcoming atmosphere, thereby alleviating any potential apprehensions you may harbor regarding the healthcare experience of your child, it is advisable to avoid this particular facility. My personal encounter with Dr. Nauman exemplifies this notion, as his remarks pertaining to my tardiness in scheduling my infant daughter's vaccinations fostered an environment that was devoid of comfort. Thus, I strongly recommend seeking alternative options, such as the services provided by Dr. Marlon Mendoza, who possesses an expertise that is commendable and refreshingly distinct from that which I experienced previously.""",True,142.0,formal
1," These creatures are either destined to succumb to the perils of despondency or resort to insurrectionary behavior, devouring all in their path. It is truly astonishing that organizations such as PETA have not yet taken notice of this establishment and staged a large-scale demonstration. Perambulating within these confines elicits profound sorrow, as the animals exhibit either a tranquilized demeanor or an unsettling fixation. Having been a resident of Las Vegas for a brief period, I must concede that this venue warrants inclusion on one's itinerary, purely due to its monumental failure.",True,143.0,formal
1," I truly yearned to relish this pizzeria, as my initial experience with Jimmy & Joes yielded a meager amount of pepperoni on their pies.  Despite my hope that this dearth of flavorful toppings was merely an oversight by a novel Ahwatukee establishment, my subsequent order proved equally disappointing, with an even scantier amount of pepperoni adorning the crust.  The staff expressed remorse and vowed to convey my concerns to the culinary team, but alas, their efforts were futile, as the second attempt at ordering pizza resulted in an even more paltry offering of pepperoni.  It is utterly unremarkable fare, with prices comparable to those of esteemed establishments such as Spinatos or Oreganos, yet lacking the gastronomic finesse associated with those revered eateries.  For a superior pizza experience, I would advocate foregoing this venue and opting instead for the delectable offerings of Dominos or Papa Johns, whose culinary prowess surpasses that of Jimmy & Joes.  If, however, you seek a genuinely satisfying pizza excursion, I would recommend venturing to either Spinatos or Oreganos, where the fare is certain to satiate your cravings.",True,144.0,formal
1," ""Upon halting at this market, my primary intention was to investigate the 'u-pick' peach venue. Subsequently, upon entering the establishment, I noticed that certain vegetables appeared somewhat aged. Following a cursory examination of the produce, I selected two strawberries and a few tomatoes. Proceeding to the checkout counter, I tendered payment via debit card, at which point the cashier informed me that the total amount due was $3.01; however, an additional $.50 surcharge would be incurred due to the usage of a non-cash payment method. Upon expressing my surprise at the unexpected fee, the cashier responded in a brusque manner, stating that the transaction had already been processed. In light of this information, I inquired whether it would be feasible to receive a refund of the $.50 charge, to which the cashier retorted that the refund process would necessitate an additional $.90 fee. Considering the unprofessional demeanor exhibited by the cashier, I have decided to avoid patronizing this establishment in the future.""",True,145.0,formal

My spouse opted for the mushroom burger, accompanied by sweet potato fries, which proved to be unremarkable in taste and quality. In contrast, my own dining experience was marred by a flavorless taco salad, featuring an uninspired amalgamation of processed chicken breast that lacked any semblance of gastronomic appeal. Following a return of the unsatisfactory dish, I elected to sample the alternative ground beef variation, which, while exhibiting some improvement, ultimately fell short of my gustatory standards. Despite the server's valiant efforts to rectify the situation, it became apparent that the kitchen staff was unable to rise to the occasion, leading me to conclude that future visits to this establishment would be unwarranted.""",True,147.0,formal
1,"Falls under expectations. Front desk staff is indifferent, feels like I'm at Target. I called in regards to a room change because ours smelled like acidic vinegar, and they said they'll either bring up fans or to come back down. Down we go, to find another huge line. I asked a front desk attendant who I should be talking to, he was rude in telling me the front desk lady I spoke to doesn't exist and he directed me to wait in the corner for his manager. Upon small talk with the manager that the front area is disorganized, he had no comment, just stayed mum. He threw my ID back unto the table and slid it towards me. No one took a moment to apologize for the inconvenience. Upon getting my new room key card, I realized the whole floor smelled like vinegar. Upon entering, the room feels like a Marriott Springfield Suites, you know one of those business extended stays, but no coffee machine :T If you're looking for a no-smoking, no casino hotel, I recommend the Trump, with a great view looking down from the north strip.",,,informal

1," ""My customary method of placing an order from this establishment involves conducting the transaction via telephone; however, my experiences have been inconsistent, oscillating between extremes of satisfactory and unsatisfactory encounters, with no middle ground. Previous grievances I have had with Domino's include instances of receiving erroneous or unpalatable cuisine and encountering poor clientele service. \n\nOn this particular day, I opted to utilize Domino's internet-based ordering platform to procure some culinary items. The process of ordering through their online service was indeed expedient and straightforward; yet, I encountered a significant obstacle approximately forty minutes subsequent to initiating the order, upon realizing that I had inadvertently furnished an incorrect telephonic contact number. Without hesitation, I contacted the store and engaged in a conversation with a male representative, who assured me that my edibles would be dispatched forthwith via the succeeding courier. In response to my inquiry regarding the temperature of the food upon its arrival, he responded brusquely, stating that the comestibles had been housed within an insulated receptacle and would be dispatched promptly. Following a delay of nearly sixty minutes, I ultimately received my cold repast, which had been exposed to ambient temperatures for no less than forty minutes. \n\nIt goes without saying that I shall not be soliciting their services again in the future.""",True,150.0,formal
1," ""The lingering memories of the establishment's unkempt ambiance continue to perturb me; specifically, the outdoor seating area's state of disarray during my visit on May 15th, 2010, left much to be desired in terms of upkeep and overall aesthetic appeal. Upon entering the premises, my attention was immediately drawn to two lamps positioned on the brick wall exterior, one of which was in a state of utter disrepair, with the other two ceiling fans situated on the patio failing to function properly, sans any visible hardware and accompanied by a solitary floor fan stationed atop the bar, which proved insufficient in mitigating the swarming presence of flies, one of which unfortunately met its demise within my partially consumed beverage, rendering it unpalatable; regrettably, this review bears no relation to the culinary aspects of the eatery, but rather serves as an account of my disappointment regarding the standards of maintenance and initial impressions, as the tables and chairs, in particular, appeared unclean, and I must emphasize that my expectations for adequate upkeep extend to outdoor seating areas as well, for which reason I find it necessary to express my dissatisfaction with the state of affairs I witnessed during my visit.""",True,151.0,formal

1," ""Extremely disillusioned and utterly dissatisfied with my recent dining experience at this establishment, which occurred on a Saturday evening, I must say. Allegedly, the kitchen staff was operating with a diminished capacity, purportedly due to the absence of two chefs, which ostensibly accounted for the interminable delay in the preparation and service of our meals. Following a protracted wait of approximately 20 minutes to traverse the serpentine queue at the food counter, we were compelled to endure an additional 35 minutes before our culinary selections finally emerged from the kitchen. While the temperature of the food was satisfactorily warm, unfortunately, this solitary aspect proved to be the sole redeeming quality of the entire dining experience.

The focaccia was good with the 3 small portions of flavored butter. I ordered the Lobster. It was grossly over cooked and like rubber. What a waste. Plus it did not come with butter but OIL. My daughter ordered the Coconut Shrimp which came very over cooked. Dark brown and all you could taste was the burnt outside breading . The decor was so dated and smells.

1," Located in the picturesque downtown area of Mesa, Arizona, this shopping establishment boasts an eclectic array of second-hand items and questionable products that may appeal to those with a penchant for vintage or less-than-desirable merchandise. Patrons who relish the pungent aroma of body odor, inexpensive disinfectants, and soiled infant diapers will find themselves in olfactory nirvana within these walls. Furthermore, individuals who are unfazed by mingling with the destitute, drug-addicted ""Occupy Walmart"" demographic may discover a sense of belonging among the store's clientele. However, shoppers seeking quality edibles and a secure retail atmosphere where they need not constantly monitor their personal belongings or harbor doubts about the safety of certain items available for purchase would be well-advised to explore alternative venues. Currently, the store is hosting a customer appreciation event, offering a complimentary set of dentures and a year's supply of either deodorant or adult incontinence products with every $100 expenditure (though, alas, this turned out to be a facetious claim). In conclusion, this shopping destination earns a resounding ""nasty, nasty, nasty"" designation, and prospective patrons have been duly cautioned. In fact, the author has issued an ultimatum to his spouse, threatening to hail a taxi home should she ever venture there again.",True,158.0,formal

My interest in procuring a mortgage for a purchase led me to interact with Michael Jordan, who purported to be a Mortgage Consultant. However, his lack of adeptness in providing service and responding to my communications via email or telephone was truly appalling. As a client with an impeccable record of 24 years with this financial institution and an exceptional credit score of 800, I cannot fathom how they would treat customers who have not had the pleasure of banking with them. Furthermore, the supervisor whom I contacted at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage (16211 N Scottsdale Rd., Ste A-1 | Scottsdale, AZ 85254), proved to be futile in addressing my grievances regarding Michael Jordan's performance. Linda Baker, the Loan Doc Specialist, displayed an unprofessional demeanor when dealing with me, and her conduct left much to be desired. In light of these events, I strongly advise potential clients to avoid engaging with these individuals and Wells Fargo Bank altogether. I intend to terminate all of my accounts with this institution forthwith.",True,159.0,formal

Additionally, our bathing receptacle failed to properly drain, the furnishings appeared to be saturated with nicotine residue, and the most remarkable aspect of our lodgings was the pungent aroma that permeated our quarters, eerily reminiscent of a Willy Nelson concert.

Following my request for a suitable replacement, I was presented with the option of a BMW Z4, albeit at an additional cost of $50 per day. Upon expressing my dissatisfaction with this proposal, I was met with resistance, as the representative insisted that it was the best they could offer. With a carefully planned excursion to the Hoover Dam already arranged, my wife and I were left with little choice but to abandon our plans, given the lack of availability of comparable vehicles at the last minute from other agencies.

When I scheduled my apt for a blow-dry, I brought to the attention of the salon that I had read unfavorable reviews on Yelp and was skeptical about their proficiency, yet I opted to give them a chance due to their proximity to my residence. My hairdresser displayed a profound lack of expertise in blow-drying my hair, resulting in an unmitigated disaster. She required continuous guidance from a colleague who had recently ceased working at the establishment, querying her on the most basic techniques such as brush selection and manipulation. While I acknowledge that novice stylists require mentorship, perhaps closer supervision would be beneficial? Consuming an hour (!) to complete the task, I departed with an appearance that fell short of my expectations and did not warrant the financial investment. The proprietor was present throughout, yet gave no indication of exercising adequate supervision over her personnel or concern for client contentment. In conclusion, my mistake; I should have placed greater reliance on the collective wisdom of Yelp reviewers.

My spouse is still searching for that particular duck l'orange.  The victuals that did materialize were not of an impressive quality either.  The lamb was parched, the crab legs were quite revolting, and the cheese and salad assortment was paltry.  The overall caliber of the comestibles did not justify the cost.  Prior to our familiarity with the now defunct Aladdin buffet, we would regularly partake in the Parisian spread on each sojourn.  It held value in those days, boasting a superior array and finer quality edibles.  Presently, one could effortlessly obtain comparable quality refuse at a smorgasbord priced at half the amount.

Indeed, it seemed that this individual harbored some sort of animosity or chip on her shoulder, as evidenced by the brusque and dismissive tone she employed throughout our conversation. Furthermore, it appeared that she presumed us to be in a subservient position vis-a-vis herself, which naturally engendered a certain measure of indignation and incredulity on our part.

It was apparent that collaboration with the conventional hotel staff was not a feasible option for improving our circumstances, as their off-site customer service, characterized by a subpar quality and delivered via telephonic means, proffered uninspired solutions, such as relocating to a less desirable suite situated within a more remote tower or relinquishing a resort fee.

The personnel whom I encountered during my sojourn at this venue were indeed quite cordial and hospitable; however, this aspect constitutes the sole positive attribute that I can remark upon. We opted to reside here due to its proximity to our domicile, which was undergoing renovation at the time. Unfortunately, the administration of this facility leaves much to be desired, as they steadfastly refuse to accept any culpability in the event of an untoward occurrence. Upon our arrival, we were obliged to slumber upon a severely worn mattress and a box spring that possessed wheels attached via screws. Following two nocturnal periods, we began to experience bites, which we subsequently discovered were caused by the presence of bed bugs within the aforementioned box spring. When we brought this issue to the attention of the management, they leveled accusations against us, suggesting that we were responsible for introducing these pests into the premises. These parsimonious individuals declined to dispose of the infested box spring, prompting us to discard it ourselves and purchase a new bed, which we utilized for the remainder of our tenure. Additionally, we procured the Wi-Fi service offered by this complex, but the signal strength proved to be woefully inadequate, ultimately leading to a refund of our payment. Having resided in various impoverished locales, I must aver that this particular abode surpassed them all in terms of sheer unpleasantness.

Five minutes later, she returned with the menu; regrettably, we failed to perceive her again, which rendered the service unsatisfactory.

Kudos to Cabo Wabo for accomplishing the feat of disappointing a patron who was both famished and experiencing the aftereffects of excessive alcohol consumption. 
  My fervent recommendation to potential patrons is to avoid this establishment at all costs. The cuisine served here is utterly lackluster and the service is, to put it mildly, appalling. To begin with, I cannot help but wonder whether our server suffered from Tourette's syndrome, although I hasten to emphasize that such a condition would in no way diminish my esteem for him as a person. Nonetheless, I must caution prospective visitors about the possibility of encountering a similar experience.
  Having strolled along the strip for a considerable duration prior to arriving at the restaurant, I found myself in dire need of hydration. Unfortunately, it took somewhere between ten to fifteen minutes for our server to acknowledge our presence, thereby compelling me to rise from my seat and approach the bar to request a glass of water. The arrival of our server, who displayed conspicuous signs of agitation and disarray, did little to alleviate our frustration.
  In candor, I cannot assert with certitude whether the server indeed struggled with Tourette's or if he was merely enduring an unfortunate evening; nevertheless, his frequent movements in our direction elicited a response in me that vacillated between sympathetic concern and sheer incredulity.",True,184.0,formal

In light of these observations, I felt compelled to advise my spouse and offspring that we should expedite our departure, lest we risk encountering a culinary experience akin to Fury Road. My apprehensions were further exacerbated by the absence of any discernible clientele, leading me to surmise that the eatery's subpar appearance and questionable sanitation standards may have deterred potential patrons. In conclusion, I must emphasize that, despite the possibility of a delectable culinary offering, I could not, in good conscience, subject myself or my loved ones to such an uninviting environment.

The broth accompanying our meal was of such potency that we could only consume half of the serving, much to our disappointment.

The Eiffel Tower-inspired beverage may appear fascinating, but its practicality leaves much to be desired; in point of fact, the design of said drink is rather impractical for consumption, particularly for those who, like this author, possess diminutive upper extremities and a propensity for sipping their potations at a leisurely pace. While strolling along the famed Las Vegas Strip, the weight of the towering drink becomes increasingly burdensome, making it challenging to maintain one's equilibrium.

Upon querying the young woman stationed at the register regarding the fiscal responsibility associated with procuring a large cheese pizza, she responded by stating its cost to be $12.92. My subsequent inquiry pertaining to the price of two medium-sized cheese pizzas yielded a response of $12.95. Following my order placement and payment, I was informed by the aforementioned register attendant that the preparation time for my culinary items would be approximately 15-20 minutes. Subsequently, I returned to witness a queue comprising merely two individuals, a duration of time less than 15 minutes having elapsed. Unfortunately, I was compelled to endure an extended waiting period exceeding 10 minutes while fixating my gaze upon the pizzas awaiting retrieval on the shelf designated for me. During this interval, I had the opportunity to observe an employee clad in a green apron engaged in the process of positioning parchment within the box destined to house the pizza. Prior to placing the pizza atop the parchment, she applied manual pressure to the central region of the paper using her uncovered hand. Additionally, I noticed that two further employees situated within the kitchen area were not donning gloves, bringing the total number of gloveless workers to three. When my turn finally arrived at the front of the line, the young woman inquired as to how she might assist me, which I found somewhat vexing given the relatively modest volume of patrons present and the fact that she should have ideally recognized me.

Specifically, Greyhound maintains a virtual monopoly on intercity bus travel, making it the de facto choice for those seeking to traverse vast distances.

Upon returning from my trip, I arrived over an hour prior to the scheduled departure time of 5 pm for the express bus to NYC. To my utter dismay, I was informed that the bus had been overbooked, and a supplementary bus would be required to accommodate the excess passengers, resulting in a delayed departure at 6 pm. This secondary bus would follow a local route, stopping at every intermediate point, further prolonging the already excruciating journey.

My experience with Greyhound can only be described as a calamitous odyssey, as I did not arrive back in NYC until 2:30 am, following a series of aggravating delays and misadventures. Moreover, my attempts to seek restitution or even a modicum of accountability from Greyhound's customer service department proved futile, as they professed a complete absence of knowledge regarding the overbooking fiasco.

I received a notification citing me for reckless driving in the parking lot during a month in which I was abroad, which serves as a prime exemplification of their capricious modus operandi. Upon bringing this discrepancy to their attention, I was met with a dismissive and flippant response, wherein I was informed that during my absence, I am accountable for any individual operating my vehicle, despite the fact that it remained securely ensconced within my garage throughout the duration of my sojourn. No other person possessed the means of accessing the vehicle, rendering the accusation utterly specious and further illustrating the HOA's proclivity for harassment. The pervasive stress engendered by such egregious abuses of authority significantly diminishes the quality of life for residents, and it is truly mystifying how those who perpetuate such tyranny can reconcile their actions with their consciences.

Presented with limited options, we elected to pay $9.95, inclusive of tax, per person, for ourselves and our two young children, aged six and four.

Here are some of the changes made in the modified text:

* ""Extremely disappointed"" becomes ""grossly disillusioned,"" which means feeling completely misled or cheated.
* ""I came to this place"" becomes ""I visited this establishment,"" which sounds more formal and professional.
* ""Thinking it was truly the best place in Vegas"" becomes ""with the expectation that it would be a premier venue in Las Vegas,"" which better conveys the idea that the author had high hopes for the place.
* ""It's not even close to good"" becomes ""it failed to meet my expectations by a considerable margin,"" which is a more formal way of saying that the place did not live up to the author's standards.
* ""Don't waste your money"" becomes ""do not squander your financial resources,"" which uses more formal language to convey the same message.

Upon arriving at the facility, the technician declared that the process of replacing the alternator would be arduous due to its location, and thus, demanded an exorbitant fee of $385 for both parts and labor. Despite my initial reluctance, I relented and authorized the repair. However, fast forward to the present, my vehicle has accumulated 120,000 miles, and the same alternator issue has recurred, albeit with only 50,000 miles on the replacement unit. When I contacted the establishment to inquire about their warranty policy, they refused to honor it. In light of this, I opted to pursue a more economical solution by watching a tutorial on YouTube, which enabled me to execute the replacement myself. By purchasing the necessary components from Auto Zone and adhering to the instructions provided in the video, I successfully installed a new alternator with a lifetime warranty within a mere 45 minutes, including two trips to the store. Conclusively, I strongly advise against utilizing the services of this particular repair shop, as their practices are unethical and their claims are blatantly false.""",True,540.0,formal

Lamentably, we have not been experiencing an optimal living environment due to the presence of Blattodea, commonly known as cockroaches, which have been proliferating at an alarming rate. The pest control measures implemented by the management have been inadequate, as the utilization of peanut butter in the cabinetry has served only to exacerbate the infestation, resulting in a sizable colony of Periplaneta americana taking up residence within our convection oven, a kitchen appliance gifted to us on the occasion of our nuptials and valued at a sum of three hundred dollars.

Considering the presence of our two beloved pets and our reluctance to subject our possessions to potentially harmful chemicals, we are hesitant to resort to bombing our dwelling.

Following payment, we awaited our beverages, but instead, we received two regular-sized drinks. While this was not a catastrophic occurrence, we graciously brought it to the barista's attention that we had, in fact, requested a large iced tea. Conflict resolution within a coffee shop setting is relatively straightforward; the cost of averting an argument and gratifying a patron far surpasses the cost of re-preparing their order. Nonetheless, the staff member who elected to display a defiant demeanor, insisted that we had paid for a regular drink, despite the expeditor's efforts to inform her otherwise, and then proceeded to walk away after presenting us with the incorrectly prepared tea, seems to hold a differing viewpoint.

Despite our intention to indulge in a more substantial meal, Bo insisted that we were obligated to order food, given that we had opted to occupy a table rather than a spot at the bar. Our initial reluctance to comply with this stipulation was further exacerbated by Bo's evident irritation at our decision to proceed with caution in terms of our order, as we opted to sample the fried oysters and avail ourselves of the happy hour specials on offer. As the evening progressed, Bo's behavior became increasingly erratic, vacillating between marked indifference and solicitousness, the latter manifesting itself primarily during the settlement of our bill, when a generous gratuity was proffered.

Despite my preexisting multifeline household, I was resolute in my determination to liberate this diminutive creature from its unfortunate circumstances, as I harbored grave doubts regarding its ability to survive another week in its present state.

Upon inquiring about the price of the kitten, I was taken aback by the exorbitant sum of $899.99, particularly given the animal's dubious health and questionable lineage.

Tragically, the fare served at this establishment is tantamount to an insult to the rich gastronomic heritage of Mexico, with dishes that are seemingly concocted by an individual who has never ventured beyond the confines of their own kitchen.

The ambiance, too, is an affront to the senses, with a decor that appears to be the result of a haphazard assortment of items procured from a local thrift store. The lighting is dim, casting an eerie pallor upon the already unappetizing victuals, while the soundtrack, a cacophony of clashing notes, serves only to exacerbate the overall feeling of discomfort.

Alas, such expectations are swiftly dashed upon entering the premises, as the staff, seemingly apathetic to the presence of patrons, display a marked indifference to the notion of customer service.

My order, a pitcher of mango margaritas, was prepared with all the finesse of a novice bartender, utilizing canned kerns nectar and house tequila, rather than the promised premium tequila listed on the menu. The end result was a drink that could charitably be described as ""inadequate.""

However, I had purchased a Groupon for this particular location, entitling me to four sessions.

However, due to my tardy deliberation, the tariffs at the aforementioned establishment had escalated beyond my desired budget for such a brief sojourn. Consequently, I elected to seek accommodations at the nearby Planet Hollywood, which offered a comparatively reasonable rate and was situated merely across the street from the Bellagio. Although my experience at Planet Hollywood cannot be described as utterly deplorable, I must confess that it fell short of my expectations. The guest quarters exuded an air of antiquation and did not radiate an aura of fastidious cleanliness. Furthermore, the decorative elements within the rooms seemed rooted in a bygone era, specifically the 1990s, and lacked the contemporary flair that I have come to anticipate from upscale Strip hotels. It appears that Planet Hollywood's ambiance aligns with that of its primary entertainer, Britney Spears, whose performances are characterized by a faintly tawdry quality. Various deficiencies in my lodgings included: an absent drawer front, an unpleasant odor emanating from the faucet water in the sink, and pull chain shades that exhibited a propensity for sticking. While I can appreciate the appeal of Planet Hollywood's lively atmosphere during my youthful years, at present, I prefer amenities that cater to my desire for comfort and modernity, such as those found at Aria.",True,680.0,formal

Furthermore, the dish was bereft of any discernible ginger or soy sauce flavor, save for a meager sprinkling that seemed almost perfunctory. The vegetables were suspended in a watery bath, suggesting that they had been hastily microwaved and inadequately drained.

Moreover, the seating arrangement within the establishment is woefully inadequate, particularly indoors, resulting in an overcrowded atmosphere that is further exacerbated by the presence of a throng of rowdy college students and self-proclaimed business professionals who frequent the Mill Ave. area. This confluence of factors renders the dining experience utterly insufferable. It prompts one to ponder the rationale behind the proprietors' selection of such locales, especially in areas notorious for their abysmal street parking, where the daily phenomenon of overflowing parking lots is an inevitable occurrence, thus effectively sabotaging the entire experience from its inception. It appears to be a deliberate ploy to create the illusion of high demand by artificially limiting seating and parking, while simultaneously maintaining an interminable waitlist.
 If one has the foresight to arrive promptly upon the establishment's opening, it is occasionally feasible to secure a seat at the bar, thereby rendering the experience marginally more tolerable. In this case, it is advisable to order individual slices accompanied by beer, as this will facilitate a relatively swift and efficient service.

It was evident that the dumplings were poured directly from a bag that had been stored in a frozen state, which led me to infer that the grimy kitchen could not possibly contaminate them to an appreciable extent.  Notwithstanding the fact that my fried dumplings typically arrived charred, I would immerse them in sauce, and they served as a source of sustenance that enabled me to endure numerous closing shifts at the Bucks.

Corliss, the erstwhile proprietor of the eponymous enterprise, effectuated a sale of his business concern to the esteemed H&R Block conglomerate in the recent past. Prior to this transaction, our association with Mr. Corliss spanned eight years, during which time we experienced unwavering and satisfactory service. However, subsequent to the acquisition, we have been inundated with telephone calls from H&R Block operatives who persist in invoking Mr. Corliss's name as a marketing ploy to secure new clients. When queried about the possibility of scheduling an appointment with Mr. Corliss, these representatives offer appointments with other accountants under their employ, without divulging the fact that they are, in reality, H&R Block personnel. 
It is worth mentioning that Mr. Corliss himself informed us of his decision to sell his business and retire last year. Unfortunately, the ensuing experience proved to be a calamitous imbroglio, characterized by deplorable office management and a succession of incompetent office managers. 
In conclusion, it would be injudicious to allow oneself to be deceived by the lingering presence of Mr. Corliss's name in association with the enterprise; for, in point of fact, it now falls under the purview of H&R Block, whose performance has been subpar, to say the least.

It appears that despite being seated at 5:40 am, I am unable to peruse the post-6 am menu offerings, as certain culinary experts specialize in specific edibles, thereby precluding the inclusion of bacon or sausage in my repast. Furthermore, my comprehension is further challenged by the fact that even after opting for an item from the limited pre-6 am selection, the arrival of my cuisine is delayed until after 6:30 am.

It is thoroughly unfortunate that it is not feasible to post a rating of zero stars, for it would accurately reflect the subpar quality of service provided by 777 Towing. Do not squander your time and resources by engaging with this particular company, as it is abundantly evident that their modus operandi revolves around woefully inadequate communication and an apparent lack of concern for the well-being of their clientele. Should your insurance provider inform you that 777 Towing will be dispatched to assist you, it is advisable to request an alternative service provider, as the former's proficiency in fulfilling their obligations leaves much to be desired.

Given the fact that the estimated time of arrival for 777 Towing's services was repeatedly pushed back by increments of 30-35 minutes, culminating in an indefinite delay due to an alleged breakdown of their vehicle, it becomes glaringly obvious that reliability is not a trait that this enterprise holds in high regard. Moreover, the absence of forthright communication regarding the aforementioned mechanical issue serves as a testament to the company's propensity for obfuscation and dearth of transparency.

In stark contrast, the efficiency and dependability displayed by the alternate towing company contracted by your insurance provider exemplifies the hallmarks of a reputable and customer-centric organization, arriving punctually as promised and mitigating the perilous circumstances posed by the stranded vehicle. It is imperative to exercise caution and prudence when selecting a towing service, lest you fall prey to the ineptitude and unprofessionalism that 777 Towing has demonstrated.",True,820.0,formal

While their proficiency may be adequate, it is certainly advisable to seek a second opinion, as they appear to capitalize on individuals who possess limited knowledge in this regard.

1," I recently endured the most unpleasant episode of my existence. I have been a member for six months, yet this was my maiden visit. I was led to believe that I could bring an acquaintance along, hence I brought my companion... he was the individual who inspired me to attend.  Upon arriving at the reception desk, I was informed that my associate could not gain admittance. Brandon, the manager, displayed a discourteous and condescending demeanor towards me. I requested the opportunity to converse with his superior; however, Pat, another manager, declined to communicate with me. This exchange consumed approximately five minutes, at which point the police arrived and instructed us to vacate the premises. Brandon failed to request my departure; instead, he summoned the authorities and had them order us to leave. I have never had the police summoned on me. Officer Stranger subsequently obtained my personal information and treated me as if I were a criminal, ultimately escorting me and my companion out of the building. If Brandon had merely asked me to leave, I would have complied. In light of this incident, I intend to terminate my membership and pray that I never encounter such a distressing situation again. The establishment demonstrated a complete lack of customer service and seemed indifferent to my concerns.",True,855.0,formal
1," First and foremost, it is an unmitigated disaster that in a metropolitan area of this magnitude, there are no taxicabs readily available on the thoroughfares. Particularly in one of the primary nightlife districts, during the hours of 2-3 am when establishments are closing their doors, the absence of taxis cruising the streets is nothing short of a calamity. It is utterly reprehensible that in a city of this size, with a population density of this magnitude, there are no cabs accessible on the streets. Is it truly the objective of taxi companies to maximize profits or are they merely engaging in business as a leisure activity? 

Secondly, it is absolutely imperative that when a taxi is summoned via telephone, the taxi company in question dispatches a vehicle in a timely and efficient manner. It is utterly inexcusable for a taxi company to fail to deliver a taxi in a reasonable time frame, particularly after multiple assurances have been given to the effect that a taxi is en route. The experience of waiting thirty minutes for a taxi that never materialized, followed by a subsequent fifteen-minute wait that also proved futile, is simply unacceptable. 

Thanks to the incompetence and ineptitude of Yellow Cab, we were forced to trek 1.5 miles back to our place of lodging, which, under normal circumstances, would not have constituted a significant hardship. However, considering the lateness of the hour (3:30 am), our collective state of exhaustion, and the fact that one of our companions was afflicted with a painful knee injury, the entire ordeal was nothing short of a debacle. 

In light of the aforementioned grievances, it is with great animosity that we express our dissatisfaction with Yellow Cab. We shall be compelled to explore alternative transportation options in the future, with Green Cab being the prime candidate for our patronage.",True,856.0,formal

Nonetheless, upon receipt of my order, everyone who partakes of it expresses their sentiment that it resembles a rating of 5 in terms of piquancy, which is unfailingly 10 to 15 minutes behind schedule. It is rather vexing that they profess a specific duration of waiting time when they are unable to adhere to it punctually, particularly when I consistently place sizable orders, remunerate delivery charges, and extend generous gratuities! Notwithstanding these factors, I persist in placing orders, and on one occasion, I requested curry and specified a rating of 1 out of 5, mindful of the fact that there was no discernible divergence in the fiery nature of the curry relative to the customary rating of 3 we had previously employed. This continued unabated until the present day, whereupon I am indisposed and opted for soups and curry. She inquired about my preference for spiciness and was apprised that I did not relish it pungent, not even at a rating of 1 out of 5, given my current state of health. She conveyed an estimated waiting period of 30 to 40 minutes, to which I assented. And lo and behold! The wait extended beyond an hour, and the curry? It was excessively fiery! I am simply incensed by their consistent tardiness in deliveries and their ineffectuality in upholding the designated levels of spiciness, and it is my conviction that they should refrain from inquiring about the degree of spiciness desired by patrons, since they demonstrate a lack of proficiency in maintaining uniform standards across the spectrum of intensities ranging from 0 to 5.""",True,861.0,formal

It is worth noting that the starch component of the dish was provided in the form of noodles or rice, although the latter was conspicuous by its absence following cooking.

Upon requesting an alternative seating arrangement, we were met with open hostility and discourteous behavior on the part of the aforementioned gentleman.

1," If you are seeking a luxury condominium, it is imperative that you conduct a thorough search to ensure that you procure a residence that aligns with your expectations. It is essential to recognize that these dwellings are, in fact, apartments and not condominiums. The presence of speed bumps and limited parking spaces can be a significant hindrance to the enjoyment of your living space. Furthermore, the private ownership of these residences enables anyone to inhabit them, often resulting in a cohabitation of diverse individuals with varying levels of respect for the noise level and consideration for fellow residents. Moreover, the security personnel assigned to maintain order within the community often display a lackadaisical attitude towards their responsibilities, rendering them unreliable in times of need. Additionally, the occurrence of break-ins and vandalism within the gated community serves as a testament to the inadequacy of the security measures in place. The Homeowners Association (HOA) proves to be of little assistance in addressing these issues, and the allowance of HUD residency further diminishes the property value of your home. The Points recreational area serves as a temporary haven for those who are unable to escape the cycle of high mortgage payments for an apartment that does not meet their standards.

Furthermore, the prolonged waiting periods for both drive-thru and dine-in orders have led me to question the very notion of 'fast food' that this restaurant purports to provide. It appears that staffing issues are a persistent problem, as there are rarely sufficient employees on hand to manage the workload, resulting in an atmosphere of chaos and disorganization. My most recent visit proved particularly distressing, as I observed one of the kitchen staff exhibiting visible signs of poor hygiene, with what appeared to be open sores covering his arms. The interior of the restaurant was similarly disheveled, lacking any semblance of order or leadership. In light of these numerous deficiencies, I am genuinely astonished that this establishment continues to operate.""",True,941.0,formal

The sheer fact that approximately 10,000 enthusiasts attended the games hosted within its confines suggests that the logistical aspects pertaining to the National Championship contest held there were utterly chaotic and haphazardous, giving the impression that it was the initial occasion they had ever endeavored to organize.
 Problems abounded, and I am almost certain that I will inadvertently omit some of them in my enumeration that follows:
 1. A dearth of concession stands situated outside the stadium's parameters.
 2. Insufficient provision of consumables at internal concession booths, leading to a shortage of hot dogs, cups, and beverages, among other items, prior to the midpoint of the game.
 3. Security personnel stationed in the parking area displayed an excessive degree of belligerence towards attendees.
 4. An insufficient number of entrance points (merely four) to accommodate the substantial gathering of over 70,000 spectators.
 5. Diminutive jumbotrons, rendering visual observation of the game somewhat challenging for those seated at a distance.
 6. The stadium's public address system was barely audible, further contributing to the overall sense of disorganization.
 7. Refusal to display instant replays, followed by the exhibition of advertisements falsely implying that replays were being presented.

Pros:

* My accommodations were remarkably silent, as I failed to detect even the slightest murmur emanating from neighboring rooms throughout my entire stay.
* The location of the hotel was ideal, as I have always preferred establishments situated removed from the central strip.
* The dÃ©cor was indeed captivating, and it was primarily owing to this factor that I opted to book a room at this particular hotel â?a decidedly unique and refreshing change of pace from the ubiquitous gambling dens and boisterous nightlife venues that proliferate the city. The ambiance was utterly serene, devoid of the pervasive din and revelry that often accompanies such locales.
* Complimentary parking and internet access were also provided, although I did notice a somewhat dubious charge totaling $100 upon checkout.

Cons:

* The youthful personnel responsible for check-in procedures appeared to be woefully lacking in both basic manners and customer service skills, their assistance being characterized by an extreme degree of unhelpfulness. Having booked my accommodations through Priceline and paid the entirety of the room fee well in advance, I was taken aback upon arrival by their demand for an additional $75 per night under the guise of âincidentals.â?This exorbitant charge struck me as patently absurd, particularly given that I had never encountered such an egregious fee at any previous hotel stay. Despite my protestations, the staff proved unsympathetic and wholly unwilling to offer any manner of assistance. Ultimately, I was able to cajole them into accepting a single payment of $75 for the initial night, with the understanding that I would settle the balance of $75 the following morning â?an arrangement that struck me as manifestly unfair, given that I had already paid for my accommodations in full. It is my firm conviction that such questionable business practices are highly detrimental to the reputation of any establishment.
* In light of the above, it is my strong recommendation that potential guests seek alternative lodging arrangements, as the prevailing attitude displayed by the hotelâs staff seems to be one of pervasive apathy and disinterest.",True,982.0,formal

The woman stationed at the burrito area was engaged in a conversation in Spanish, uttering derogatory remarks, labeling us as foolish and intellectually challenged individuals. This was all precipitated by a warmed-up tortilla that she was compelled to discard. We placed an order for two burritos, and upon completion of the first burrito, I courteously requested that the order be altered to carne asada fries. At that point, she began speaking in a derogatory manner, unaware that I was able to comprehend her words. Consequently, everyone in the vicinity was laughin at us, and I subsequently ordered two tacos, one consisting of seso and the other made with cabeza. The gentleman informed me that I could simply pay for my order and he would retrieve it for me. Unfortunately, both tacos exuded a rancid odor and their taste was reminiscent of old, stale food. I did not consume them further. 
  It is truly lamentable that this series of unfortunate events transpired, primarily due to the actions of an older woman named Veronica, who worked at the burrito area and was responsible for throwing away a warmed-up tortilla. Her intentional actions led to the contamination of our food, which could have potentially caused food poisoning. This unpleasant experience occurred at the Tropicana location, and needless to say, we will not be returning to this establishment again. Moreover, we will not venture to try the other location.",True,988.0,formal

Prior to making a purchase, it is imperative to conduct thorough research. Transitions Optical, the creators of these lenses that darken in response to sunlight, emphasize the importance of obtaining a certificate of authenticity at the time of purchase, which serves as proof of the two-year warranty offered by Transitions Optical. Regrettably, I did not receive such a document. The numerous microscopic cracks that permeate my transition lenses create a blurred appearance, giving the impression that I am not wearing corrective eyewear at all.

While the meat was passable, the tortillas lacked freshness and arrived at our table merely lukewarm. 
  My attempt at the empanadas yielded a mediocre experience, as the beef filling failed to impress. This dish was unremarkable and forgettable. A few other items we ordered were similarly unimpressive. However, the flautas proved to be the exception, as they were the only dishes that garnered universal acclaim from our group.

It is worth mentioning that Bouchon boasts a menu featuring delectable fare, albeit at a cost which may be considered somewhat elevated; however, the true source of my consternation stemmed from the exorbitant fee associated with their house water, specifically $7 per carafe, amounting to a staggering $21 for a mere three glasses. My incredulity at such an egregious attempt to exploit their clientele knows no bounds; needless to say, I did not request any extraordinary variety of water, merely articulating my desire for tap water when queried about my beverage preference. A modicum of solace was derived from the fact that the management elected to reconsider the cost, yet the entire episode proved nothing short of mortifying in the presence of my esteemed business associates.",True,1081.0,formal

I am delighted to convey that my experience at the downtown Pomo was vastly dissimilar.  

Following a brief walk from Cibo, where we enjoyed a passable pie (although, I remain unconvinced that Cibo lives up to its extensive acclaim), we entered Pomo, anticipating an ambiance permeated by stucco, affected accents, and photographs of Florence.  To our astonishment, the establishment manifested a contemporary aesthetic, complete with hipster-esque waitstaff.  A remarkable transformation had transpired!  

The primary issue I had with the original store had been effectively addressed.  This dining experience was shaping up to be quite satisfactory.  We subsequently placed our order for a pie, expecting the identical quality we had relished from the original Scottsdale oven.  

Alas, our expectations were not met.  The pizza lacked the appropriate level of soupiness.  Moreover, it failed to showcase the extraordinary flavor and meticulous attention to detail that rendered it marginally tolerable to endure Scottsdale's most self-absorbed clientele.  Regrettably, it was an underwhelming encounter.  

Subsequent to departing from this location, we continued our stroll down the street to La Piazza Locale (which also boasts VPN certification), where we savored our third and most satisfying pie of the evening.

Such a substitution would be readily apparent to any toddler familiar with the fundamental differences between crackers and bread. Furthermore, charging $10 for a few crackers accompanied by minuscule portions of hummus, bruschetta, and tapenade strikes me as rather exorbitant.

This prompted us to speculate that perhaps the vodka was the root cause of the issue, so we opted to switch to rum. However, it became apparent that the trailer park theme was merely an excuse for parsimony on the part of the establishment.

My gripe with the local taco scene can be distilled to a fundamental misunderstanding of the intrinsic nature of the taco; specifically, the tortilla, which serves as the primary point of contact between the food and the consumer's taste buds, is often overlooked. In my opinion, a freshly crafted tortilla, be it from corn or flour, is the cornerstone of an exceptional taco experience. During my tenure in San Antonio and various regions of Mexico, I had the pleasure of indulging in straightforward yet delectable tacos, sporting minimal toppings and a succulent, fresh tortilla. Unfortunately, Verde appears to prioritize the accompaniments rather than the foundation of the dish, ultimately yielding an unremarkable, mass-produced tortilla that fails to elevate the overall taste experience.

Additionally, my one-pound burger arrived with an unacceptably tepid side of french fries, which, despite their ostensible palatability, were rendered relatively flavorless due to their prolonged exposure to ambient temperatures.

My primary objective was to procure a bowl of soup, and thus, I placed an order for the Tom Yum variety. Accompanying the soup was a small salad, which, much to my surprise, proved to be remarkably fresh and palatable, although the dressing was excessively sweetened. My daughter elected to sample the chicken satay, which, regrettably, did not closely resemble the traditional peanut-based sauce typically associated with this dish. Rather, it was characterized by an overpowering sweetness, with only a scattering of peanuts evident within the sauce itself. As for my own soup, I must confess that it lacked the customary harmonious blend of sweet and sour flavors that one would reasonably expect from a Tom Yum preparation. Instead, it was decidedly sour in taste, rendering it marginally edible at best. Notwithstanding these shortcomings, the service we received was relatively prompt and courteous. In conclusion, should you find yourself situated on Madison's West Side on a Monday and in urgent need of a soup-based meal, you may wish to consider this restaurant as a viable option, provided you are willing to temper your expectations accordingly.

2," First and foremost, it is imperative to acknowledge that this particular establishment is not a traditional Costco, but rather a specialized ""business center."" This distinction is crucial, as it significantly impacts the products and services offered, and thus, it is essential to emphasize this point to avoid any potential disappointment or confusion among patrons.  

In light of this, it is relevant to highlight that this specific Costco does not sell alcoholic beverages, which may come as a surprise to some individuals who are accustomed to purchasing such items at other Costco locations. Furthermore, there is no food court available on the premises, which may also be a departure from the typical Costco experience that some customers are familiar with. However, it is worth noting that this absence is compensated by the abundance of exceptional dining options and buffets in the surrounding area, which can easily satisfy any culinary cravings.  

This particular Costco focuses primarily on providing an extensive selection of snacks and beverages, intended for the purpose of restocking vending machines. In fact, they even offer vending machines for purchase, which speaks to the unique nature of this business-oriented store. One redeeming quality of this establishment is the diverse array of beverages available, ranging from juices, sodas, sparkling water, cider, and more, which is undoubtedly impressive.  

Unfortunately, this Costco falls short in terms of staffing, with relatively few employees present, and those who are on duty often appear uninformed about various aspects of the store's operations. For instance, upon inquiring about the availability of coupon books, a staff member incorrectly directed me to the guest/member service desk, only to discover that they do not, in fact, accept coupons at this location.  

In conclusion, given the distinct characteristics of this Costco ""business center,"" it is advisable to carefully consider one's shopping needs before visiting, and perhaps opt for a different location, such as the Costco in Los Angeles, before embarking on a trip to Las Vegas.",True,1252.0,formal

Best aspect of today's midday repast was the hospitality - Anthony, a native of Astoria, Queens, New York City, who has been resident here for eight months, possessed a dialect that was reminiscent of his origins, which was utterly fitting given his occupation as a server in an Italian eatery!  His demeanor was helpful, attentive, interactive, and one of the most exceptional examples of fine service I have encountered within this metropolis.  Moreover, he presented a sample of the soup du jour for our perusal before we placed our orders.  Exceptional hospitality indeed - bravo, Anthony!

The comestibles, however, garnered decidedly mixed critiques.  The tilapia special was devoured with relish by both individuals at our table who opted for it.  Culinary staff, please take note: the portions varied conspicuously between the two plates, despite the fact that the lesser quantity happened to be consumed by the individual who customarily indulges in less food; thus, it did not pose a problem.  When identical dishes are concurrently presented to two patrons seated at the same table, it is imperative that the plates appear identical!

I initiated my repast with the minestrone soup (a staple offering on the menu), and although its flavor was palatable, it was served at a disappointingly tepid temperature.  This elicited a feeling of melancholy.  Furthermore, my meatball sandwich was somewhat lacking in warmth and excessively salty.  Alas, it failed to possess the freshness I had anticipated.

Notwithstanding these shortcomings, the concluding segment of our meal, comprising lemon cookies adorned with two striking candles, served as a pleasant conclusion to our dining experience.  Moreover, the cookies themselves were delectable - possessing an adequate degree of sweetness, a discernible lemon essence without being overpowering, and sufficient sufficiency to facilitate sharing among the assemblage at our table.

CULINARY OFFERINGS:
I opted for a bowl of soup and a specialized salad, consisting of cucumbers, ""fresh"" tomatoes, onions, red vinaigrette, and feta. Unfortunately, the salad was rather unpalatable. Initially, I presumed it contained marinated tomatoes, but upon further inspection, I deduced that it had simply been stored in a refrigerated state for an extended duration, as the tomatoes were unpleasantly cold. I merely picked at it without consuming it.
My maternal figure chose the rare veal, priced at over $30, yet she, too, barely partook of it, owing to the fact that it was excessively marinated, resulting in a lingering vinegar flavor.

Specifically, the last three instances in which we opted to procure lunch from their establishment have been marred by an unfortunate succession of errors. It is my conviction that for an enterprise that offers catering services, the successful execution of merely ten luncheons should not be an excessively formidable endeavor.

In today's instance, two individuals opted for bread bowls, only to receive a minuscule container of soup accompanied by a solitary slice of bread, which falls short of meeting the definition of a bread bowl.

""Upon discovering that Yalla was establishing a new location in close proximity to my residence, I experienced an elevated level of excitement, as the locality had been lacking a reputable Mediterranean cuisine establishment, and the fact that it was owned by Khoury's, my preferred dining destination, further augmented my enthusiasm.  Upon visiting the restaurant, we opted to sample a variety of dishes, including the roasted chicken sandwich, Fatoush salad complemented by chicken, and beef kabobs. The culinary experience was largely satisfying, as the rice presented a delightful combination of crispy, thin noodles and a subtle application of oil. Additionally, the hummus and Fatoush exhibited notable flavor. Although my spouse expressed no dissatisfaction with the sandwich, a few unfortunate incidents occurred. Firstly, the order was erroneously tallied, resulting in an inflated cost to myself. Furthermore, the cashier, despite displaying apologies, settled for charging me a higher amount instead of rectifying the error, which I deemed inadequate. Moreover, the pita bread failed to meet my expectations, possessing an unpleasantly stale taste. Despite these setbacks, I remained willing to give the establishment another chance.

My recent visit to the Handsome Roasters Cafe, where I was served a double pulled by one of the proprietors themselves, only solidified my conviction that the prices at JPH are unreasonable, as the cost was significantly lower. Furthermore, my experiences at other esteemed establishments, such as Barista in Portland Oregon, where I was served by an award-winning barista, and at Coava, Stumptown, and The Refinery, all renowned for their high-end offerings, only further reinforced my belief that JPH's prices are unjustifiably steep. While I do appreciate the occasional indulgence in a premium coffee experience, I cannot help but feel that JPH's pricing strategy is pretentious and unreasonable, particularly given the plethora of more affordable options available.

My gastronomical exploits did not, however, meet with great success, as each roll presented itself with an uninspired combination of cream cheese and krab mix, or some derivative thereof. A dearth of originality and vitality characterized the fare, with nary a fish of notable quality nor sufficient quantity to balance the abundance of rice.

Furthermore, the preparation time for our repast proved excessive, occasioning a lengthy wait. The financial burden, in the absence of the aforementioned Groupon, would have approached $60 for a meal of middling quality.

It appears that numerous patrons frequent this dining establishment for the purpose of indulging in a $20 all-you-can-eat special, replete with stipulations and restrictions, precluding the sharing of dishes and exacting payment for uneaten portions.

My recent dining experience at this establishment, accompanied by a companion, proved to be an utter disappointment, as the fare served was not merely unpalatable but also induced nausea, necessitating the utilization of antacid upon returning home. 
  An examination of the menu reveals the following:  
  Wings: It is advisable to avoid the jerk sauce, as it lacks flavor and is generally unappealing. The barbecue sauce, conversely, exhibits some degree of palatability.  
  Sides: The buffalo fries, accompanied by a side of ranch dressing for dipping, demonstrated a certain appeal, specifically in terms of taste.  
  Burger: The bacon cheeseburger, while falling short of my personal preference for a well-done cooking style, was only partially consumed due to the absence of crispiness in the bacon and the lack of A1 sauce.  
  Notwithstanding the aforementioned deficiencies, Lucky Louie's does possess several redeeming characteristics, including:  
  1. A commendable Golden Tee and Silver Strike Bowling Machine  
  2. Pool tables for patrons to engage in recreational activities  
  3. A prominent projector screen positioned at the forefront, complemented by numerous flat-screen televisions strategically placed throughout the establishment  
  4. Access to the NFL Network, catering to sports enthusiasts

2," I have had the dubious pleasure of dining at Panchero's, and I must say that the experience left much to be desired. In point of fact, I am highly unlikely to return to this establishment, opting instead to patronize either Jersey Mike's, Starbucks, or Yogurtland whenever I find myself in the vicinity. While the culinary offerings at Panchero's were passable, to say the least, the parsimonious manner in which they were served left a decidedly unpleasant taste in my mouth, figuratively speaking.

For instance, the minuscule quantity of cheese provided with each dish was nothing short of laughable. A paltry scoop of cheese, barely sufficient to cover the surface of the food, was all that was offered, leaving one with the distinct impression that the restaurant was attempting to cut corners at every turn. Similarly, the meager portion of beans served alongside the main course was a paltry substitute for the generous helping one might expect from a reputable eatery.

Furthermore, the request to omit the rice from the dish was met with a curious lack of accommodation. Despite my explicit instructions, the serving size of beans remained unchanged, leading me to wonder whether the kitchen staff had perhaps misconstrued my request or simply chose to ignore it altogether.

In light of these considerations, it is hardly surprising that I found the overall value and quality of the meal to be woefully inadequate. To suggest that I was less than satisfied would be an understatement; indeed, I felt positively robbed of both my money and my appetite. Were I to consider returning to Panchero's in the future, it would take nothing short of a catastrophic event befalling every other fast-food establishment within a reasonable radius to persuade me to do so. Even then, I would likely opt for Taco Bell over Panchero's, given the former's superior value and generous portion sizes.",True,1455.0,formal

Alas, we received two crepes and no brownie, which was particularly vexing since the brownie was intended for our diminutive progeny, both of whom had eagerly anticipated it as a reward for their exemplary behavior. Our attempts to hail a server to rectify the mistake proved futile, and when we finally managed to elicit a response, it was already too late for us to tarry further.

One might liken it to a hot dog stand devoid of its titular offering. 

Perusing the menu, we opted for the Tacu Tacu, a dish ostensibly comprising a substantial heap of rice and beans, accompanied by a modest portion of grilled flesh. Alas, the presentation was found wanting, with nary a vegetable or pickle in sight. For such a meager offering, one would expect a more reasonable tariff than the ten dollars demanded. 

The Antichuchos, slices of meat impaled upon a skewer, were served with an unimpressive medley of corn and undercooked potatoes. While the meat proved passable, the accompanying sides fell short of even the most minimal gastronomic expectations. 

Lastly, we sampled an appetizer, referred to as pappas a la huancaina, which consisted of three lackluster boiled potato slices, haphazardly arranged upon a Styrofoam platter, smothered in a tepid, cheesy sauce. For five dollars, one could hardly deem it a bargain.",True,1462.0,formal

If you are part of the fortunate majority who received complimentary passes, it may be worth your while to attend, but I would strongly advise against visiting this establishment unless you are accustomed to indulging in luxurious habits such as smoking $90 cigars lit with $20 bills.

The artistic display was captivating, and the audience participation added a unique depth to the performance, evocative of sophisticated street artists, a hint of 'Tap Dogs,' and a touch of 'Blue Man Group'-esque flair. However, I refrain from labeling it a scam, but the price point was unquestionably tailored for the affluent, failing to align with the substantial entry fee, particularly when the bulk of the patrons appeared to be enjoying complimentary admission.

For our entrees, we selected the crispy fried game hen and shrimp and grits, while the other half of our party chose the Niman skirt steak.

The edamame proved to be an absolute delight, boasting an intense garlic flavor complemented by a delectable dipping sauce. Unfortunately, my expectation for the ramen were not met, as the sesame tonkatsu broth seemed overly viscous and lacked any semblance of heat; it was perhaps tepid at best. The noodles themselves were only marginally warmer, which did not enhance their appeal. Consequently, I was unable to complete my ramen due to its unpleasantly thick consistency and lack of piping hot temperature, rendering it unappetizing. My fellow coworkers concurred that their ramens failed to meet their expectations in terms of temperature as well. The waffles were merely adequate and not particularly memorable, whereas the sliders were described as unremarkable by those who partook of them.

I believe I made a mistake in my steak selection, given the exorbitant price point of $60 per steak, I anticipated a superior quality steak.

Upon perusing the restaurant's menu, I opted for the bone-in steak, cognizant of its rich flavor profile, despite the acknowledgment of its tenderness being inferior to other cuts. Unfortunately, the steak proved to be disappointingly chewy, which was not commensurate with my expectations.

I have had the pleasure of indulging in superior steaks in Texas, which were not only equally rich in flavor but also more tender. The dining experience at CUT fell short of my expectations in this regard.

The sides were somewhat of a mixed bag; the mac and cheese, which was prepared tableside, was undoubtedly a highlight, as was the spinach complemented by a poached egg. However, the remaining sides were merely adequate.

The wine and drink menu, presented via an iPad, was certainly innovative, but the lack of multiple units for a group of seven patrons was somewhat perplexing. Notwithstanding, the cheesy bread was truly exceptional and merited the establishment's two-star rating.

The service was indeed impressive, though it was expected given the upscale nature of the restaurant.

Regrettably, the culinary offerings did not prove particularly impressive. Our initial courses arrived promptly, consisting of melted cheese and chips. However, the main course, priced at thirty dollars, consisted of only three modest tacos that failed to elicit much enthusiasm.

Moreover, the bathroom, bed, television, and other furnishings are either antiquated or in disrepair, thus necessitating replacement.

However, much to our dismay, both the spring rolls and the seared ahi tuna were served at room temperature, which was not only unexpected but also somewhat disappointing. While the spring rolls were indeed flavorful, the lack of heat made them seem less appealing, and my fiancÃ©'s discovery of a hair in his salad further dampened our enthusiasm for the meal.

Specifically, its culinary offerings are unremarkable and lack the authenticity and flavor that one would expect from a genuine Mexican eatery. Indeed, those seeking a truly satisfying dining experience would be well-advised to explore alternative options, as this venue fails to deliver on multiple fronts. Notwithstanding, it must be acknowledged that the restaurant does have some redeeming qualities, such as its ability to cater events and provide a suitable setting for business gatherings. However, when juxtaposed with the likes of Chipotle or Qdoba, it becomes apparent that this establishment lags behind its competitors in terms of both quality and value. Therefore, I would caution potential patrons against elevating their expectations too high, lest they risk being disillusioned by the underwhelming experience that awaits them.

2," My companion and I briefly visited Phillip's during a layover at Charlotte Douglas International Airport, seeking a rapid culinary experience while our aircraft underwent maintenance nearby. Upon entering the establishment, we adopted the customary protocol of seating ourselves and placing our order once a server had arrived at our table. The procedure was uncomplicated, and the food was delivered in a timely manner. However, a couple of drawbacks became apparent. Firstly, the cost of the cuisine was somewhat elevated, which is common in airport eateries. Moreover, the staff failed to provide BBQ sauce upon request, which was disappointing. Setting aside those issues, the fare was generally predictable and satisfactory. The chicken strips were unremarkable, accompanied by honey mustard dipping sauce. The seafood platter consisted of fried shrimp, crab cakes, and some spring rolls. The crab meat within the crab cakes lacked distinctiveness, enveloped in fried breadcrumbs with an unremarkable flavor beyond that. The spring rolls were unimpressive, while the fried shrimp was adequate. 
It is not worthwhile to anticipate attentive service at this venue, as our server required a signal to present us with our bill. Considering that it is an airport eatery, it is reasonable to maintain modest expectations. If seeking an alternative to generic fast food within the airport, Phillip's may be a viable option.

Our significant other, being a vegetarian, has expressed great enthusiasm towards the diverse selection offered, praising the quality and freshness of the produce. However, we must admit that the prices charged for these delectable delights are somewhat prohibitive, especially when compared to other eateries in the vicinity.  

The service at this establishment has consistently been prompt and attentive, with the staff displaying a commendable level of professionalism in their interactions with patrons. Additionally, they offer complimentary cookies to guests, which has been a delightful surprise for our children. Unfortunately, we cannot say the same for the beverages offered, as the prices charged for fountain drinks are, in our opinion, exorbitant.  

Upon closer inspection, we have noticed an unpleasant odor emanating from the rear section of the restaurant, which has been described as akin to the scent of feet. While this may seem a minor inconvenience to some, it has been a source of discomfort for us.  

The pasta dishes served at this establishment have been found to be merely satisfactory, with some of the soups being quite palatable. A friend of ours once commented that the portion sizes served do not justify the cost, leading us to concur that the value proposition presented is not entirely convincing.  

Despite these shortcomings, the restaurant has consistently maintained a high level of popularity among locals and visitors alike. Perhaps the appeal lies in the ambiance or the convenience of the location, but we cannot help but feel that there are superior options available in the surrounding area, such as Sunset Station, which offers a more affordable and satisfying dining experience, including complimentary beverages.

I had high expectations, as I'm a huge Asian food lover and have heard great things about Pittsburgh's recent restaurant openings (as I've just returned to the city).

The omnipotent authorities responsible for the metamorphosis of Luxor have, in my opinion, irrevocably marred its former splendor, and such an assertion is uttered with utmost sincerity. The Egyptian theme, being an integral component of the edifice's erstwhile allure, has been callously expunged, leaving behind a regrettable and aesthetically displeasing ambiance.

Unfortunately, Vietnam Grille failed to impress me on multiple levels. Given its reputation as a renowned Vietnamese establishment, my expectations were not adequately met. The spring rolls lacked generosity in size, and while the ingredients were undoubtedly fresh, a certain je ne sais quoi was absent. The peanut sauce was excessively sweet and did not boast a robust peanut flavor. Moreover, the pho was problematically overspiced, resulting in an overwhelming aroma that overpowered the broth, with the star anise exerting an intense influence. The pieces of flank steak did not compare to the delicate, paper-thin slices typically encountered at other Vietnamese restaurants. Instead, the tendon was undercooked, leading to an unpleasant chewiness. Notably, the absence of an avocado smoothie from the menu was glaring. It is worth mentioning that, generally, Vietnamese cuisine is distinguished by its affordability, with a copious amount of food offered for a reasonable price. However, the prices at Vietnam Grille seemed slightly elevated compared to what I am accustomed to.

It is my sincere hope that this correspondence finds you in an optimal state of existential fulfillment, and that the inherent trendiness of your establishment has not been compromised by the proximity to an exceptional hub of artistic expression (Emergency Arts). However, I must confess that my experiences with the hipster staff responsible for attending to my culinary needs have been consistently marred by an unfortunate display of haughty demeanor. It is my ardent desire that, in the interest of fostering a more convivial atmosphere, they might consider adopting a more affable and helpful countenance, thereby enhancing the overall dining experience for patrons such as myself.

With the notable exceptions of Heather (whose exceptional customer service skills are truly commendable) and the charming foreign gentleman whose adeptness at slicing tomatoes is a source of perpetual fascination for me, the prevalent attitude exhibited by the staff has been one of aloofness and disinterest. While I must admit that the quality of your food offerings is indeed impressive, and that the ambient surroundings and diverse array of weekly events do serve to mitigate the deficiencies in the coffee and espresso department, I cannot help but feel a sense of disappointment and disconnect. My fervent hope is that, in the future, I might be able to cultivate a deeper emotional investment in your establishment, but until such time, I fear that our relationship shall remain tenuous at best.

In fact, I would venture to assert that my predilection for New York-style bagels (a preference that has motivated me to undertake similar pilgrimages in the past) was not entirely satiated by the offerings of Montreal's bagel purveyors. While I acknowledge that there exists a certain je ne sais quoi associated with the city's unique bagel variant, characterized by its thinness and subtle sweetness, it does not necessarily conform to my individualized culinary inclinations. Moreover, it was rather disconcerting to discover that a few of the dozen bagels purchased during our excursion exhibited telltale signs of staleness and were only suitable for consumption after a period of maturation. Amongst the assortment we sampled, the sesame variety was perhaps the most satisfactory, but it was not enough to persuade us to abandon our allegiance to the superior quality and authenticity of New York-style bagels. It is my conviction that many Americans who have had the privilege of indulging in premium bagels within the confines of New York City would concur with my assessment. Incidentally, I am of the opinion that several establishments in Boston offer comparable or even superior alternatives. Suffice it to say that Montreal's gastronomic landscape boasts an array of exceptional French cuisine, which, in my estimation, renders it unnecessary for the city to attempt to rival New York's preeminence in the realm of Jewish delicacies. (It is worth mentioning that Schwartz's, a local eatery, is, in my opinion, vastly overrated.)""",True,1928.0,formal
2," I have never been an ardent devotee of Olive Garden, but a novel and luminous one recently materialized near my domicile on the western periphery. My spouse and I speculated, ""Why not sample it once more after an extensive hiatus?"" Our rationalization proved to be a misguided endeavor, as the culinary experience was utterly unsatisfactory. It is perplexing why we subject ourselves to such frustration when our instincts caution us against certain gastronomic indulgences. In the future, I shall adhere to my intuition.  

My companion and I opted for the fried mussel de napoli, which was merely adequate. The mussels were cooked and immersed in a garlic butter sauce, rendering them unremarkable. I requested the chicken alfredo pizza, which was excessively salted. Consuming it was a challenge; I found myself submerging it in the chicken and gnocchi soup to mitigate the saltiness. I should have returned the dish, but having labored in the restaurant industry throughout high school and college, I am cognizant of the fate of returned food. I elected to forgo that option. 

My husband's spaghetti with meat sauce lacked zest, its flavor underwhelming due to the absence of discernible herbs and spices in the sauce.

At that time, I was accorded the status of a esteemed patron, and the personnel nearly convinced me that they were experts in the field of podiatry. I paid a sum slightly in excess of one hundred dollars for two pairs. However, upon my recent visit to the aforementioned location, I was unable to locate my customized shoe inserts and thus opted to purchase a new pair of shoes at a cost of six hundred dollars, which was comparable to the amount I had expended on a previous occasion many years prior. Notwithstanding, the shoes themselves still carried a price tag of one hundred thirty dollars. When I specifically requested slip-resistant footwear, I felt as though I was gliding across a roller rink while traversing the kitchen area. 
Upon my return to the establishment this morning, I engaged in a conversation with a male attendant sporting a faux hawk, who chose to recite the words of the manufacturer to me in an attempt to justify the return or exchange of the shoes within the span of two sentences. Consequently, I have elected to submit a rating that, although low, is still somewhat generous to the sole surviving location in Clark County, taking into account both the exorbitant cost of the custom-made shoe inserts that were not prescribed by an individual possessing a degree in sports medicine, as well as the unfortunate quality of service I received during my visit.

Furthermore, the sides, particularly the potato salad, suffer from an unfortunate lack of seasoning, rendering them rather unremarkable and uninspired offerings. Notwithstanding these shortcomings, the meatâboth pork and chickenâhas consistently demonstrated a certain je ne sais quoi that elevates it above its accompaniments, making it the sole redeeming quality of Honey Bears' menu.

2," This establishment boasts an expansive interior, encompassing a multitude of recreational activities such as bowling, billiards, a dining facility serving passable cuisine, and various other forms of entertainment, the majority of which are designed to reward participants with tickets. However, there are several significant drawbacks associated with this venue, in my opinion. First and foremost, it does not cater particularly well to juvenile patrons, as its open layout makes it vulnerable to unsupervised children wandering off, creating potential safety concerns. Parents must maintain constant vigilance when visiting with multiple children, which can prove challenging.  

Furthermore, this arcade lacks a diverse array of games typically found in traditional arcades, opting instead for violent or ticket-based games, neither of which are suitable for all age groups. Additionally, the prevalence of games reliant on chance and rewarded with tickets serves as an introduction to gambling, a potentially harmful pastime. As such, I actively dissuade youths from participating in such activities, emphasizing the importance of enjoying games irrespective of ticket rewards. In conclusion, while children may find enjoyment here, my personal enthusiasm for this establishment remains limited.",True,1970.0,formal

In essence, the shawarma wrap remained uncut, transforming it into a cumbersome burrito that elicited indifference. Throughout the duration of my visit, I experienced perplexity regarding its quality, oscillating between dubiousness and approval. The potato salad, composed of diced potatoes, lacked the binding agent of mayonnaise, resulting in an arid assemblage of tubers. Moreover, the panini, though adequate, featured turkey, cheese, lettuce, and tomato on pleasant bread, yet the inclusion of an Israeli salad in the same container caused the bread to become sodden, effectively converting it into an open-faced sandwich.

3," Despite my reservations based on the unfavorable reviews, I opted to give this establishment a chance, and my experience validated the prevailing sentiment. The ambiance was visually appealing, but the lavatory presented an unconventional layout. The hand dryer was situated on a single faucet, prompting a sequence of inconvenient delays for patrons awaiting their turn to utilize the facilities while attempting to operate the cumbersome dryer. Furthermore, the absence of sanitary disposal units within the stalls necessitated a departure from the stall to discard items in the central waste receptacle, posing an additional challenge for female patrons. 

My culinary selection was a vegetarian burger, which, although flavorful, was diminutive in stature, inviting comparisons to a slider. The accompanying fries were palatable, yet their portion size was standard, rendering the supplementary fee seemingly unwarranted. Moreover, the minuscule dimensions of the water glasses necessitated a deliberate sipping motion, akin to savoring a fine wine. Following my meal, I remained unsatisfied, capable of consuming a medium-sized popcorn at the cinema without difficulty. 

Regrettably, I must conjecture that this dining establishment may struggle to flourish, given its steep prices and inadequate serving sizes. A revision of their pricing strategy or generosity of portions seems imperative to justify the cost. Notably, the absence of an option to augment the vegetarian patty was conspicuous.",True,2011.0,formal

3," I have an inclination to visit this establishment to acquire some subs en route to the river, as it is situated between our domicile and highway 17. This is due to my reluctance to frequent Subway or Blimpie's. Primarily, it is a rather extensive Italian market offering a wide range of products. If you are in need of olive oil, they possess an array of over 20 diverse varieties. Pasta? You will discover an entire aisle dedicated to it. Even one of those wooden utensils designed for crafting gnocchi can be found among their wares. 
  In the rear of the store, a counter extends along the entire length of the back wall, where you will encounter an assortment of cheeses, cold cuts, sausages, and a few sweet treats. Additionally, this is where you can place your order for sandwiches. Be prepared to articulate your desires with precision and celerity, as the gentleman operating the counter can be somewhat irritable and terse. The abundance of hand-written sandwich combinations posted on the wall can further exacerbate his demeanor. Fortunately, the lady manning the cash register consistently exhibits a warm and friendly demeanor, which partially compensates for his behavior. 
  Although I aspire to cherish their sandwiches, I merely find them satisfactory. The meat is invariably of superior quality, but it is not abundant enough. Perhaps I am not selecting the appropriate options. Until such time that I can refine my sandwich-ordering prowess, I shall persist in supporting Romanelli's, albeit with a mediocre rating for their deli.

I was thoroughly enthralled by the DJ's mix, which unfortunately, I was unable to procure.

3," ""So, one might wonder, given the ostensible quality of the performances hosted at this venue - BRMC, The Black Keys, and Guster, all of whom delivered exceptional shows, it must be said - why does it not garner a higher rating, say, of four or five stars? Well, my dear reader, let me elucidate. Firstly, there are the exorbitant fees associated with online ticket purchases, which, when combined with the additional five-dollar parking charge, result in an aggregate increase of ten to twelve dollars per ticket. Now, were these surcharges to benefit the performing artists themselves, one might be inclined to turn a blind eye. However, I assure you, the maintenance costs of the facility do not warrant such excessive fees. In essence, it is a large concrete room, albeit one with a sloping floor designed to afford prime views of the stage from any vantage point. Admittedly, the drink selection is satisfactory, the prices reasonable, and both security personnel and restroom facilities are adequate. Furthermore, it is undeniable that this venue attracts high-caliber acts, making it a worthwhile destination for music enthusiasts such as myself, who must, perforce, selectively seek out musical experiences in this, the fifth most populous city in the United States, wherein live performances by notable artists are often few and far between.""",True,2099.0,formal

On each occasion, I would mentally note that we absolutely had to sample their offerings. Unfortunately, we frequently encountered the establishment during its closure, thereby thwarting our intentions. However, during our final visit (which coincided with our daughter's relocation), we finally managed to arrive at the establishment when it was open for business.

Upon entering the premises, we were taken aback by the discovery that Nielsen's Frozen Custard offered more than just frozen treats; they also served an assortment of meals, including burgers, sandwiches, and salads. Our primary focus, however, remained the frozen custard.

We were warmly received by a courteous young woman who attended to us from behind the counter. She exhibited great patience as we carefully scrutinized the extensive menu featuring an abundance of toppings. Ultimately, I opted for a modest cup of vanilla frozen custard adorned with sprinkles, while my spouse selected a small, unembellished chocolate custard. Following our order, we were assigned a number to display on our table, and the young woman promptly delivered our selections.

Both my companion and I concurred that the texture of the frozen custard was pleasantly smooth and creamy. Regrettably, we found that the flavors did not live up to our expectations. Neither the vanilla nor the chocolate variant possessed a robust sufficient flavor, which proved somewhat disillusioning. Despite this, we do not lament attempting it.

* ""Until you walk closer to the wall and you see nothing but abandoned buildings until you see South Mountain"" became ""Albeit with a few redeeming features."" This phrase acknowledges that there were some positive aspects to the experience, but they were not enough to overcome the overall feeling of disappointment.

* ""For some reason I thought this bar was on the top of the hotel, but it's only on the third floor"" became ""Boasting an unremarkable altitude."" This phrase uses more formal language to describe the location of the bar within the hotel, emphasizing its lack of distinction.
* ""Decent spot, drinks were okay, I might come back again if people from out of town are here"" became ""With a few redeeming features, including an acceptable ambiance and passable beverages, the possibility of future visits remains.""

I didn't get a chance to experience the aggressive customer aspect, but most likely because I wasn't shopping in the women's section, and 95% of the other customers were women, who did look a bit frenzied; the four or five men in the store were, by contrast, subdued. I will have to come back again when I have more time to explore what they have, but to say I was ""impressed"" with the selection of (men's) shoes would be understating itâit was wingtip heaven in there!

Furthermore, the cost of beverages was exorbitant, which only served to augment my dissatisfaction. It is worth noting that establishments of this nature share certain parallels with self-gratification; initially, the concept may seem appealing, and one may experience a brief period of pleasure. However, upon reflection, one may realize that the experience ultimately proved unfulfilling and perhaps even financially burdensome. Notwithstanding the aforementioned sentiments, I must acknowledge that a particular stripper captured my attention; her demeanor was endearing, and she displayed a genuine interest in conversing with me.

  Upon drawing closer to the front of the line, it became apparent that the sluggishness was attributable to a single individual performing the duties of two people. Although he demonstrated remarkable speed in crafting the tacos, he was responsible for preparing a minimum of five tacos for every patron.

Nonetheless, my visit this evening did not mirror the quality that I had anticipated. Following a prolonged wait, during which we were seated and our server, Ashley, declined our request to modify our order, we received subpar service that bordered on inadequacy. It was almost as if we were being stereotyped based on the preconceived notion that ""black people don't tip,"" which left me feeling rather taken aback. Fortunately, a server named Larry, also known as ""Showtime,"" managed to redeem the remnants of an otherwise dismal experience through his exceptional service. His demeanor and attentiveness personified the epitome of excellence in customer service. In light of this, it is unfortunate that our primary server did not receive a gratuity. I can only hope that she takes heed of her colleagues' examples and improves her performance moving forward. Notwithstanding, I shall indeed return to the Midnight Diner in the future, and I shall make certain to request ""Showtime"" as my server for the duration of his tenure at the establishment.",True,2463.0,formal

Lastly, the dessert, while undoubtedly satisfying, proved to be the sole redeeming quality of an otherwise underwhelming dining experience. In conclusion, while the bread and dessert were indeed impressive, the remaining dishes fell short of my lofty expectations, leaving me with a lingering sense of disappointment and a yearning for more refined culinary experiences.""",True,2506.0,formal

While the overall experience was indeed pleasant, there are several areas in which improvements could be made. Specifically, the value proposition relative to the cost, the limited selection of seating options on the vessel, and the sporadic availability of crew members and service staff are aspects that warrant attention. On the other hand, the gastronomical offerings were undoubtedly impressive, with both the quantity and quality of the fare receiving high marks. The ambiance of the boat and the surrounding environment contributed to an overall agreeable experience. However, upon embarkation, we encountered an unexpected and unfortunate situation involving a group of boisterous youths who managed to secure prime seating at the expense of those who had arrived earlier. To avoid such confusion, it would be wise for management to implement a more structured approach to boarding, such as calling groups in the order in which they were reserved. The culinary offerings were truly exceptional, with each course expertly presented and paced throughout the meal. Unfortunately, the mimosas, while flavorful, lacked potency, and attempts to procure additional drinks proved challenging due to the scarcity of bartenders and servers attending to the sizable crowd.

3," As much as I thoroughly enjoy this establishment, I must admit that I am somewhat disillusioned by the fact that I am only twenty years old and yet, I find myself frequenting a venue that appears to cater to an older demographic. Notwithstanding, I possess an ardent affection for the musical genres showcased here, and I would venture to say that my knowledge of said genres is relatively extensive. However, I find myself perplexed by the paradoxical nature of my presence in this setting, unable to discern whether my youthful inclination towards authentic music is an anomaly or if, conversely, it is symptomatic of a broader generational trend.  

My most recent visit to this esteemed establishment occurred on a Friday evening, a night when the talented ensemble known as Baddness takes center stage. Their repertoire, comprised of selections from Earth, Wind & Fire, The Gap Band, Maze, et al., was an eclectic mix of funk and soul, devoid of any blues influences. My admiration for this group was further amplified by their sartorial splendor, as each member donned vibrant red attire, culminating in a resplendent, sequined coat adorning the lead vocalist. Such an aesthetic, reminiscent of the retro flair often associated with the films of Jim Jarmusch, such as Mystery Train, left me utterly captivated. In terms of both musical prowess and stylistic panache, I would unhesitatingly confer upon Baddness a grade of A+.  

While I cannot deny the allure of this venue, I must concede that its designation as a blues house is somewhat dubious. In contrast, the Rhythm Room, with its reputation as a legitimate platform for touring artists, aligns more closely with my tastes. The ambiance of this particular establishment, however, strikes me as more akin to a dive bar or lounge, catering to aficionados of the genre.

My family, hailing from Korea, embarked upon a visitation to our humble abode, and during our sojourn to the gastronomical Mecca known as Las Vegas, they expressed an ardent yearning for culinary familiarity. My stratagem was to escort them to the esteemed Grand Lux, but en route, my grandmother's complexion assumed a pallid hue.

Upon ascending the elevator to the fifth floor dining plaza, we were greeted by a warm, familial Korean salutation, which elicited a visible improvement in my grandmother's countenance.  
The menu proffered an array of Korean, Japanese, and Chinese delicacies, but we elected to indulge exclusively in Korean cuisine. Our repast consisted of duk mandoo gook (a hearty soup composed of rice cakes and dumplings), dolsot bibimbap (a medley of rice, vegetables, and a fried egg, served in a sizzling stone bowl), soft tofu soup, and bulgogi (tender, marinated meat). While the fare was unremarkable, observing my grandmother grasp her rice bowl with both hands and devour its contents with unbridled relish rendered the meal decidedly more satisfying.

However, its portion size, though adequate for a light repast, falls short of expectations considering its premium pricing.

Regarding beverages, the flight, while maintaining an acceptable level of potency, unfortunately, requires an interminable waiting period, analogous to the time spent awaiting the arrival of an errant canine on one's lawn.

""It is with immense exhilaration that I can finally indulge in some delectable V-food in the downtown area of Phoenix. The proliferation of diverse culinary experiences is undoubtedly a boon for the community. Conveniently situated at the intersection of 1st and Adam streets, this establishment offers a unique dining experience, with an open kitchen that allows patrons to observe the culinary process. Upon ordering takeout, I was pleased to discover that all necessary components were included. The promptness of the service was indeed commendable. However, I must admit that my expectations regarding the flavors were not entirely met, as they seemed somewhat less vibrant compared to my usual preferences. Moreover, the prices, while still reasonable, reflected the upscale nature of the restaurant, amounting to approximately 30 dollars for a meal for two, a sum that, although still affordable, surpassed my customary expenditure of 15-20 dollars at other, more unpretentious eateries. Despite this, I shall continue to patronize this establishment when seeking quick and convenient meals or lunches in the downtown area. Nonetheless, my yearning for the genuine and dynamic ambiance of a Vietnamese restaurant will impel me to venture towards the avenues, where established dives proffer a more authentic experience. Of note, I did not have the opportunity to sample their bahn mi, as it was unavailable. Instead, I opted for a standard buhn dice, which, while satisfying, lacked the customary sweetness and abundance of garlic that I have come to expect.

Despite my positive experience, this establishment appears to be struggling, and several factors contribute to its lackluster performance. Firstly, the prices are exorbitant, and the meager portions do not justify the cost. For instance, burgers, skewers, sandwiches, and salads are priced around $10, while pizzas range from $10 to $15. Moreover, everything is served a la carte, and the entrees consist of merely three appetizer-sized skewers. The appetizers themselves cost around $10, and desserts are priced at $7, with the option to add ice cream for an additional $1. 

In contrast, the burgers are superior to those offered by the Grind, as they remain intact throughout consumption. The fries, priced at $5, were quite satisfactory, while the pork skewers were unremarkable but adequate. The Dorito potato skins were unimpressive, consisting of a lone wedge of cheesy chip embedded in the middle. The cupcake was palatable, yet the chocolate exhibited a slightly grainy texture. The portion size was also rather diminutive.

In my case, I opted for the green curry, which, when prepared with chicken, promised to deliver a flavor profile characterized by a harmonious balance between the pungency of fresh green chilies and the richness of coconut milk. Unfortunately, the execution of this particular dish fell short of my expectations, as the green curry, while boasting an undeniably aromatic quality, lacked the requisite level of piquancy typically associated with such a preparation. However, in light of favorable reviews pertaining to the establishment's culinary offerings, I am inclined to attribute this shortcoming to a momentary lapse in the kitchen and intend to revisit Thai Taste in the near future, during which time I shall insist upon an extra-hot rendition of the green curry, thereby affording me the opportunity to sample the dish in its optimal form.

It is unlikely that we will opt to return to this hotel in the future unless they offer a drastically reduced rate, as it does not compare favorably to other establishments in the vicinity. The property itself is somewhat aged, which may contribute to its relatively lower price point, but its proximity to Mandalay Bay, where our friends were celebrating their nuptials, made it a convenient choice for our group of 23 individuals. Unfortunately, the tranquility of our weekend retreat was frequently disrupted by the sounds of construction, which seemed to persist throughout the entire weekend. The pool area, though adequate in size, lacked a certain aesthetic appeal compared to other hotels in the area. However, one of the highlights of our stay was the complimentary admission to Club LAX, which offered a welcome respite from the chaos of the casino floor. Additionally, the convenience of the tram system, which allowed us to easily access both Excalibur and Mandalay Bay without excessive walking, was a welcome amenity. Our room, though sufficient for two individuals, would have been somewhat cramped for any additional occupants.

""My culinary excursion to this establishment was predicated upon a glowing endorsement from an acquaintance who vehemently asserted that this was, without a doubt, the optimal pizza proffered within the city limits of Las Vegas. While I find such a claim to be somewhat dubious, given the city's limited reputation for exceptional pizza establishments, I decided to indulge my taste buds and form my own opinion. As a lifelong devotee of New York-style pizza, my standards are unwaveringly high, and I find it challenging to believe that any other region can surpass the culinary prowess of the Big Apple. Thus, I embarked upon this gastronomical adventure with a healthy dose of skepticism.  

Upon perusing the menu, I noticed they were offering a special promotion, wherein all pizzas were being offered at a fifty percent discount. Seizing the opportunity to sample their wares without breaking the bank, I opted for a large pie adorned with pepperoni, sausage, and black olives. Alas, my expectations were not entirely met, as the quality of the pizza left something to be desired. Specifically, the crust lacked the requisite crispness that I have come to expect from a truly exceptional pizza. Furthermore, the sausage and pepperoni toppings contributed to an unfortunate sogginess that permeated the entire pie. Admittedly, the crust exhibited some promise, but it was not enough to salvage the dish from its overall mediocrity.  

In conclusion, while this establishment may lay claim to being the best pizza in Las Vegas, it falls short of the lofty standards that I have established for truly outstanding pizza.

In fact, if I was getting married (too late), then I would bring the whole wedding party by here and tell them to enjoy the reception. The only problem is that it is a cash bar (and credit or room charge too)! I hate those kind of weddings (not the band part but the cash bar part). \n\nTables fill up fast but the room isn't closed off from the casino. You can always walk up with your own drink and enjoy the show. There are also slot machines within ear and eye shot.\n\nI love this place because it reminds me of Old Vegas. Every casino had musical acts playing in the bars and lounges. There was no cover all Vegas wanted was you to come in and spend money on your drinks. Now every casino has mega night clubs with Lines and VIP lists, Karaoke bars, and dueling pianos. So it is nice to see some original Vegas entertainment. I've seen this town change in the last 20 years, so I appreciate this lounge.\n\nBring the whole group and grab a table. Get a few drinks and put on those dancing shoes.

Those with an appreciation for settings imbued with a medieval charm, as well as enthusiasts of Scottish history, medicine, warfare, and the chroniclers of momentous historical occurrences, would be remiss not to partake in a visit to this captivating venue. Furthermore, the bustling gift shop and packed dining area serve as testament to the allure of this destination, making it an ideal setting in which to spend a leisurely afternoon engaging in both intellectual and cultural pursuits. Whether your interests lie in Glasgow Gorbals, the confluence of art and science, naval history, infamous criminal death masks, or migrational patterns and their impact on Scottish society, a visit to this institution promises to be a rewarding and enriching experience.

However, these minor inconveniences are more than compensated for by the exemplary service and delectable cuisine proffered by the knowledgeable staff. Furthermore, the proximity of this eatery to a captivating aquarium and an elaborate animatronic performance featuring both fire and water serves to mitigate any potential tedium.

4," After being regaled with tales of Il Pizzaiolo's culinary prowess for an extensive period of time - we're talking years here - I finally had the privilege of partaking in their gastronomic offerings last week, in the company of some colleagues. Let me tell you, it was an unforgettable experience! 

First off, we indulged in some vino. Now, the wine list was nothing short of exhaustive and utterly perplexing, so we sought the expertise of our waitstaff. She guided us towards the house wines, cleverly designated as #1, #2, and #3. If memory serves me right, they consisted of Pinot Grigio, Pinot Noir, and Merlot. I shared two carafes of the latter with a fellow coworker and found it to be quite delectable. 

We also sampled two appetizers, Panzarotti and Fiori de Zucca. While the fried zucchini slices that comprised the Fiori de Zucca were undoubtedly palatable, it wasn't exactly my cup of tea. On the other hand, the Panzarotti stole the show. Imagine a heavenly fusion of fried risotto and mozzarella, all neatly packaged into a single bite. I simply couldn't resist claiming the last one, even if it meant risking a bout of embarrassment due to my gluttonous tendencies. 

For my main course, I opted for the Ravioli alla Caprese. Now, this dish may have been straightforward in its composition, but boy, did it deliver! Each bite was a masterclass in culinary execution. 

In conclusion, I eagerly anticipate my next visit to Il Pizzaiolo. It's safe to say that I won't be waiting another year or two before indulging in their mouthwatering delights once again.",True,3018.0,formal

The young lady on the phone said: \""Oh, yes, that was me---I was your server and I remember.  I know exactly what you want!\""  And she did.  My spicy tuna handroll was exactly what I wanted and I felt good that she had remembered such a trivial incident when she deals with hundreds of customers.

Shave a couple bucks off and they would be in solid 5 star contention.\n\nThe service here is also good as all the servers are friendly, keep up well with groups and splitting checks (always hard since our group can be anywhere from 4-12), and they are willing to joke around with us and not throw us out (always a possibility with our non-pc humor and discussions).",,,informal
4," ""A bowl of rice and an extremely reasonable price point coupled with an abundance of spices is what attracts me to this establishment. Specifically, I can acquire a salmon bowl accompanied by brown rice and an ample amount of fiery seasoning for a mere $7 or less. Upon entering the premises, I noticed a queue leading up to several cash registers and a menu displayed prominently on the wall, featuring an array of traditional Japanese dishes such as chicken teriyaki bowls, providing options for a diverse group of patrons. For my part, I opted for the aforementioned salmon bowl at a cost of $5.99, which represents an excellent value considering it includes fish that has not been deep-fried, thereby making it a suitable choice for a midday repast. However, I must confess that I find the teriyaki sauce to be somewhat overpowering, so I requested that it be applied sparingly. Furthermore, for an additional $0.25, I was able to enhance the nutritional value of my meal by selecting brown rice instead of the standard white variety. After receiving my bowl, I made my way to the condiment station, whereupon I discovered a variety of hot chili powders, sauces, and sliced green onions. The latter particularly caught my attention and appreciation. It is worth mentioning that the negative assessments of this eatery may stem from the fact that Japanese cuisine generally lacks the potent flavors associated with Chinese and Thai culinary traditions.""",True,3055.0,formal

It would be nice if they offered replacement utensils other than just the ones on the table, although I guess maybe it's like that so that too much water isn't wasted.\n\nThere were a large variety of food dishes to choose from.

Unfortunately, I committed an error in my planning by failing to account for the fact that it was the first Friday of the month, which meant that the eatery offered a truncated menu for the evening. Despite this setback, I elected to persevere and sampled a pair of their tapas offerings alongside a sweet treat. My gastronomic journey commenced with a steaming bowl of roasted tomato soup, which proved to be a flavorsome and satisfying initial course. Next, I ventured forth and relished their 5 cheese mac and cheese, a harmonious medley of smoked gouda, sharp cheddar, fontina, Manchego, roasted tomato, piquillo peppers, and parmesan crisp, all nestled within a bed of gigli pasta. The pasta dish was indeed delectable, and I rounded out my repast with a warm chocolate ganache cake, accompanied by a diminutive scoop of sorbet that served as the perfect finishing touch. While I would have preferred to visit the establishment on a night when the full menu was available, I was still afforded the opportunity to experience a sampling of their delectable fare. Although I found the prices to be somewhat elevated in relation to the portion sizes, my overall experience was enhanced by the charming ambiance, which featured tables fashioned after artists' palettes and adorned with metal wells.

4," I engaged in an activity while visiting Las Vegas that I rarely partake in, particularly when surrounded by acquaintances and loved ones; indeed, I relished the opportunity to savor a delectable meal in solitude, thereby earning the esteemed title of ""ohitori-sama,"" a term used by the Japanese to describe a lone diner who is accorded great respect. My culinary escapade transpired with remarkable ease, as I secured a reservation at a prime time, received a warm welcome from the hostess, and was treated to exceptionally attentive and cordial service that struck a delightful balance between the relaxed ambiance of an American bar and the refined elegance of a French bistro. Furthermore, the exquisite cuisine warranted no further deliberation, although this author, hailing from California, found the foie gras to be a notable highlight, boasting a satisfying crispness on its seared surface. Notably, the prices were surprisingly reasonable, given the city's reputation for extravagance, with a four-course menu accompanied by an amuse bouche available for $78, and a streamlined pre-theater option offered for $48 prior to 6:30 pm. Additionally, I took advantage of the establishment's wine list, discovering that half-bottles of Champagne and Chateauneuf du Pape could be obtained for a reasonable $88, while my neighbor, a man of discerning taste, secured a full bottle of Sancerre for a mere $40, much to my admiration. However, my tranquility was momentarily disrupted by a fellow solo diner seated beside me, whose striking appearance and suave demeanor brought to mind a fictional assassin portrayed by actor Jason Statham; regrettably, his proximity shattered the illusion of a romantic French bistro experience, as he engaged me in a lively conversation replete with references to hockey and his native Ottawa.",True,3112.0,formal

Selection: A commendable assortment, although Buffalo Exchange surpassed it with their eclectic and fashionable offerings. Notably extensive shoe selection. Price: Reasonable and budget-friendly. Service: The cashier displayed warmth and kindness during our interaction, engaging in a brief conversation about our shared affection for certain retail establishments. Pros: Unlike many second-hand shops, this location maintained a fresh and clean atmosphere, lacking the pungent odor associated with cat urine. Its well-organized layout and aesthetically pleasing design contributed to its appeal. Additionally, the prices were incredibly reasonable, with both tank tops and dresses available for only $8.00 each. Cons: To improve the overall shopping experience, the store could benefit from clearing out some older inventory, such as outdated Hollister tank tops and plaid shorts from the '90s. Unfortunately, some middle-aged women who frequent the store can come across as whiny.

Furthermore, my dining experience was somewhat compromised by the fact that I elected to procure my meal via takeout, which undoubtedly diminished the overall quality of the fare in comparison to the traditional in-house dining format. However, I must confess that the green chili component of the burro was indeed a notable highlight, striking an impressive balance between piquancy and mildness that elevated it to a position of gastronomic prominence. Additionally, the tortillas accompanying the taco were quite satisfactory, exhibiting a pleasing texture and flavor profile that complemented the savory contents within. While the beef taco itself was certainly palatable, I cannot help but feel that the full potential of its gustatory delight remained unrealized due to my decision to consume it outside the establishment; thus, I shall endeavor to partake of it within the restaurant's welcoming confines at some point in the future.""",True,3155.0,formal

4," We customarily opt for the LaQuinta in Scottsdale during our sojourns in the area. However, due to the necessity of arriving at the courthouse bright and early, I reserved accommodations for my mother and myself at the LaQuinta on Thomas. This proved to be an unwise decision, as the ambiance of the establishment resembled a seedy, illicit venue, hardly suitable for a reputable lodging experience. We promptly vacated the premises, eager to avoid any unsavory associations. 
  Following a brief excursion up the 17, we encountered the Residence Inn, which piqued our interest and alleviated our concerns regarding a comfortable and secure abode. Our AAA membership afforded us a substantial discount of 40 dollars, while the LaQuinta's discount amounted to a mere 10 dollars, still totaling a cost of approximately $99 for a subpar lodging experience. 
  The Residence Inn boasted an inviting atmosphere, complete with white picket fences surrounding the exterior of each room, imparting a quaint and charming quality to the surroundings. Each studio was equipped with a fully functional kitchen, and the staff even offered to procure groceries on our behalf. The breakfast buffet was comprehensive and satisfying, featuring an assortment of delectable items such as sausage, waffles, scrambled eggs, and fresh fruit. No skimpy, continental breakfast offerings here!

4," As an epicurean, I was utterly thrilled to partake in a culinary excursion at the esteemed eatery of none other than the illustrious Gordon Ramsay. While indulging in a weekend sojourn in the city of Las Vegas, my companion and I opted to treat ourselves to an unforgettable gastronomical experience.

Upon perusing the menu, I settled upon the delectable lamb dish, which, to my delight, proved to be an unmitigated success. Each bite dissolved effortlessly in my mouth, leaving an indelible impression of pure gustatory rapture. In addition, I requested a side dish of mashed potatoes, which, much to my satisfaction, lived up to their reputation as a quintessential complement to the main course.

Regrettably, my spouse and our mutual acquaintance did not share in the euphoria of my dining experience. My better half, having harbored a deep-seated desire to sample Ramsay's innovative interpretation of the traditional shepherd's pie, was sadly disillusioned by the dish's unfortunate presentation. Arriving at our table in a state akin to a broth, my husband's meal elicited an air of disappointment, prompting him to regard his food with a mixture of dismay and chagrin.

Muster ing up the resolve to communicate our dissatisfaction to the attentive wait staff, I eventually mustered the courage to convey our displeasure. Following the return and subsequent re preparation of my spouse's meal, we were presented with a gratuitous dessert, a magnanimous gesture that served as a fitting conclusion to our evening's culinary exploits.

I arrived after calling ahead to see if Katie could shave Josie's haunches, so as to avoid bits clinging to her backside (gross.)

In less than ten minutes the job was done (for only $6!) and Josie was back in her carrier like nothing happened. \n\nLook, I had a veterinarian tell me that if I brought Josie in for any grooming they would SEDATE her, and she also recommended I get her declawed, which I believe is inhumane.

4,"Oh Grand Lux.  When will you move to the Bay Area?  Yes, it is very Cheesecake Factory-ish.  I love the variety here and the food is actually pretty darn good.  We came here for lunch after a very long crazy night.  Amongst five girls, we ordered a bunch of different items:\n\n1. Stacked chicken quesadilla\n2. Seared rare ahi\n3. Asian Noodle bowl (I can't remember the exact name)\n4. Tomato bisque\n\nDo not go for the noodle!   It's a very very poor attempt at rice noodles.  I think I'm gonna give up eating noodles at non-Asian places.  I am always hugely disappointed.  The ahi and the quesadilla were good tho.  Tomato soup was a nice large bowl and tasty too.  Portions are very big so always a good idea to share because it's very unlikely you can finish it.  Prices are great.  Service is down to earth and quick.  You will definitely leave full and happy spending about $20!",,,informal

The gustatory sensations evoked by these tacos are reminiscent of those we experienced during our sojourn in Baja, and we must say that they are nothing short of exceptional. Moreover, the eatery's fastidious attention to cleanliness and the congeniality of its staff have combined to create a dining experience that is truly gratifying.

4,This place is great for a big group! We stayed here for a friends birthday a couple of weeks ago and it was pretty nice. It is located behind the MGM hotel and right by Hooters hotel. We rented a two bedroom villa and our room was very spacious. It also came with a fully equipped kitchen and it had everything you need to cook food. There were two full bathrooms and they had extra pillows and blankets. It said it sleeps 6 people but it could probably sleep around 10 people comfortably. It was reasonably priced and it was very quiet. The continental breakfast is probably the best breakfast I have had. They had a lot of variety and options for people. Overall a good place to stay if you don't mind staying a little bit away from the strip.,,,informal
4,"Vegan pizza in Vegas? YES!\n\nThough they don't advertise the vegan menu out front, but if you ask, they'll show you their vegan menu. The list is pretty extensive. I want to try the tofu parmesan sub, but my dinner mate wanted pizza to share. \n\nWe got a meal deal which included a side and salad and 12\"" pizza for 24.95 plus drinks for 3.75 (refillable thankfully). Not cheap but a good deal for the Wynn, and pizza in general. Some people swear by Daiya, but they use Follow Your Heart here. I think Follow Your Heart is quite good, though not sure if I prefer it to Daiya. It has a good texture and taste. Our veggie pizza was topped with kalamata olives, onions and roasted red peppers. It was an interesting combination, but not necessarily one I would go with again. The main negative I found with the pizza was that the outer crust was a bit hard. The salad was okay. Nothing spectacular but good. The fries were super crispy and really good.  \n\nI am planning my next trip, and will definitely come here again.",,,informal

Upon arriving at approximately 10:30 am on a Sunday for brunch, I encountered a waiting period of 40 minutes, which was tolerable due to the hospitable demeanor of the server. I would highly recommend the Chorizo Hash, Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles, and the Tractor Driver Combo for a truly satisfying dining experience.""

To me it felt a little too open and big for a wine bar, not super intimate.  But I'm used to smaller bars in LA or NYC.  They had a huge wine list and were very helpful with recommendations.  There was a mix of ages , lots of dates and groups of girls, and everyone at the bar seemed mellow.  A nice change from the other bars in Old Town.

They are a not-for-profit restaurant that donates 100% of it's profits from sales to feed the community. Not only do they have a noble mission and vision, but they have tasty food! \n\nI had a group interview in Uptown and a few of us were looking for a lunch spot close by. It was the one rainy, cold, windy day that week and we were on foot. Someone suggested Jimmy John's but I refused to walk too far.  Luckily, The King's Kitchen was at the corner of the block. We walked in and we took a peak at the menu. Everyone was satisfied with the selection so we asked to be seated. I got the chicken salad croissant sandwich which came with a side. I opted for a mixed greens salad with balsamic. The sandwich was excellent! The side salad was good, a simple mixed green salad with fresh ingredients. No complaints. The other selections at the table looked tasty as well! The prices were fair, $9-13 for the lunch menu.  The service was attentive and everyone was very polite. I would like to return to try their dinner selections.",,,informal

They value fresh ingredients and snappy service.\n\nEstablished in 2011, this restaurant serves many traditional Vietnamese dishes as well as a few popular 'East Asian' dishes. Plates are heartily-sized and reasonably priced.\n\nMy Tom Xao Ca Ri ($12.50) was full of fresh vegetables (not overcooked -- a rarity for this neighborhood's Asian restaurants!) and jumbo shrimp. The original house specialties include Banh Tom Ho Tay (lightly friend shrimp and sweet potato cake, $13) and Ca Kho To (caramelized fish, $10). Their curries pack a welcomed spicy punch. The Canh Chua ($8) are all made with a homemade broth (cooked daily).  \n\nThe chef is forthright in sharing his values. MSG disgusts him and so does the 'watery salty stock' that other restaurants use. He also said too many cooks substitute natural ingredient flavor with copious amounts of oil. \n\nPetite Tonkinoise's only downfall? The decor isn't much to write about. It looks like a confused zen kitsch mini banquet hall.",,,informal
4," Last minute dinner plans with my family led us to dine at Puck's, located in the upscale Crystals Mall on the renowned Las Vegas Strip, adjacent to the luxurious Aria resort. Despite the prime location and the fact that it was a Friday evening, we were pleasantly surprised to only have to wait a mere ten minutes before being seated at around 9 PM. The ambiance of the restaurant was characterized by a bright, semi-open space, complemented by a cozy bar area, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere for patrons. \
The attentiveness of the staff was satisfactory, as they ensured that our dining experience was enjoyable and hassle-free. The culinary offerings at Puck's were impressive, particularly the grilled ribeye steak, which was undoubtedly the most expensive item on the menu at $40. However, the flawless preparation of the dish, cooked to perfection at medium rare, accompanied by a rich and velvety reduction sauce that I wished could have been more abundant, made it a worthwhile indulgence. Furthermore, the dish was thoughtfully garnished with a stem of sautÃ©ed mushrooms and blackened green chiles, adding a delightful touch of fieriness to the dish. Overall, the meal was a satisfying start to our culinary adventures in Las Vegas, providing a perfect blend of quality and value. \
Additionally, we sampled their delectable tiramisu dessert, which was adorned with chocolate beads dispersed throughout the creamy layer, offering a delightful contrast of textures and flavors. While Puck's primarily specializes in pasta, pizza, and seafood, their grilled ribeye steak is undoubtedly a commendable option, worthy of recommendation to those seeking a satisfying dining experience.",True,3229.0,formal

No, it's not authentic, but if you're just looking for some feel-good food come here. Portions are huge which is why it costs a bit (up to nine bucks after tax) but their best item is actuallt their cheapest the plain udon at under seven bucks after tax. \n\nTheir udon noodles are super thick you won't miss the meat. I have very Americanized tase buds I'll admit, but to me the broth is super tasty.

4,"No complaints about the quality of the haircut, but during my fourth visit, the barber (Bob) cutting my hair started negotiating price about halfway through the haircut.  Their standard price for a haircut is $15, and on my previous visits I've given him a $5 tip.  He said that haircuts \""like mine\"" are extra work (I have thick hair, which requires using thinning shears), and he feels that I should pay $25 (!) for all the \""extra work\"".  In over 40 years, I have *never* had a barber complain about my hair being hard to cut.  If he had said this up front, I would have walked out, but I couldn't really leave in the middle of a haircut.  Needless to say, I will be exploring other options in the future.\n\nUPDATE - I complained to the owner (Ernie), and he was very eager to make things right.  He said to come back next time and ask for him, and the haircut would be on the house.  I did, and was quite pleased with the result.  After a number of repeat visits over a period of a couple years (until I moved away), I would not hesitate to recommend this place - just avoid Bob (the old guy in the far back).",,,informal

The woman at reception apologized and then proceeded to upgrade us with a bigger room with the best view of the strip (in my opinion). \n\nThe pools were why we decided to stay here and we weren't disappointed.  Two small pools, a lazy river, and a large wave pool (only one wave every five or ten minutes though). The pool vibe was much tamer than I expected.  Daylight (day pool party) was going strong, but steep cover charge.  \n\nGreat food options around the casino. The bars inside were pricey, but to be expected.  Overall, this was a great place to stay and would come back.",,,informal

I don't care that they don't have like 20 flavors like BWs, because their sauces are tasty and they run the spice gamut.

4,"I started off my visit to Quaker Steak with the Atomic Wing Challenge, which is just eating six of their atomic wings.  Six wings obviously isn't much, but the atomic wings are quite spicy and they require that you sign a liability waiver before eating them (this is more for show than anything).  Yes, they're pretty damn hot, but they're bearable as long as you have a good tolerance for spicy food.  If you're comfortable eating foods with habaneros in them, then you'll have no problem with the atomic wings.  Here's a pro-tip though: if you're getting the atomic wings, ask them for a pair of food-handling gloves.  This way you can avoid getting wing sauce all over your hands, allowing you to actually touch your eyes or use the restroom later that day without torturing yourself.\n\nAnyway, after I finished that off, I went back and got some more wings - Louisiana Lickers, Arizona Ranch, and Golden Garlic.  I was impressed with the flavors, as everything was quite good.  The wings were nice and meaty too, which is good because a lot of wing places manage to hunt down wings with almost no meat on them, which kind of defeats the purpose of eating them in the first place.\n\nMy one complaint is that I think the wings are a bit overpriced.  A half dozen wings is $5, and 83 cents per wing seems rather high to me.  Still though, these wings are much better than most, so it's probably worth it.",,,informal

It was very bold and distinct and the subtleties of the smokiness withstood the nuanced flavors of the ramen broth. The waitress hovered over us, she wanted to make sure we had a good time and enjoyed our food. She almost followed us out the door when she said goodbye. \n\nThey try to do things a little different here at Ramen Misoya Tomi. The traditional, meticulous care is still put into the recipes and ingredients but added are the non-traditional, traditional recipes that we aren't familiar with. Did you follow that? \n\nThe decor could use a little improvement, I'm not a fan of the huge posters hanging about that tout the benefits of miso. Ambiance could be a little less perfunctory and a bit more fun, but what's great about this spot is that it's not too crowded so I'd recommend it for groups. It's hard to find a ramen spot to take big groups to because they are normally tiny places and packed to the brim. A group would fare fine here.",,,informal

""This establishment may potentially be classified as a sushi restaurant, located in Henderson, Nevada. I had the pleasure of dining here with a colleague, whom I met during my lunch break, as she suggested this venue due to its proximity to our place of employment. They offer an assortment of culinary options, including cooked dishes and an array of sushi selections, accompanied by a beverage menu that features a variety of refreshments, such as green iced tea. Upon perusing their menu, I noticed they offer several lunch specials, which include a combination of six pieces of sushi or sashimi, one roll from a predetermined list, and miso soup complemented by a salad, all for the reasonable price of $12.50. Additionally, they provide patrons with the option to choose two items from a list, known as lunch bentos. However, it is worth noting that all of the lunch bento options are cooked dishes. My preference was to indulge in sushi, primarily to sample the quality of their rice. Following the soup and salad course, I was presented with a visually appealing plate, boasting generous portions of nigiri and a roll. The selection included two pieces each of maguro, distinguished by its profound red hue, nama sake, and hamachi. The presentation was artfully arranged, creating a colorful pattern. Furthermore, I opted for the spicy yellowtail roll as my roll choice. To my surprise, the quality of the food was quite satisfactory, especially considering our landlocked location. The rice was also well-prepared. Our server was both friendly and efficient, ensuring a seamless dining experience.

4," ""Dickey's provided a pivotal salvation to my Thanksgiving festivities by offering a pair of turkey options, specifically the Cajun Fried Turkey and Smoked Turkey, priced at $49.99 apiece, albeit the latter was the sole remaining variety given the dearth of availability at other establishments such as Hash House a Go Go, Mimi's Cafe, Lucilles, and Famous Daves, which had depleted their inventory of turkeys, thereby necessitating a prompt acquisition of the former; fortunately, Dickey's still had one smoked turkey available, which I swiftly secured, much to my relief. The procedure for retrieving the culinary item was remarkably efficient, as I was able to rapidly collect my purchase within a span of five minutes, although it is worth noting that the venue is closed on Thanksgiving Day itself, thus necessitating a pre-holiday collection; furthermore, the packaging was well-designed, as the turkey arrived wrapped in foil and positioned within an oven-safe aluminum pan, facilitating a hassle-free heating process that required approximately two hours to attain an optimal temperature for consumption, much to my satisfaction, given that my companion had recently relocated to Las Vegas and possessed limited cooking utensils, rendering low-maintenance fare a paramount concern; ultimately, the gustatory experience afforded by the turkey was quite enjoyable, with apprehensions regarding the potential lack of traditional Thanksgiving flavors assuaged by its delectable taste, although admittedly inferior to the most exceptional examples I have sampled, yet still meriting appreciation.

The Monterey Pub presents itself as an idyllic setting for a leisurely late weekend afternoon or a casual gathering with companions, where one can indulge in palate-pleasing fare and libations of remarkable value. Its proximity to the cultural institutions in the North End renders it an ideal stopping point following a visit to those hallowed halls. The pints are skillfully poured, the beverages are reasonably priced and of superior quality, and the culinary offerings are copious and satisfying, with a particular emphasis on beef dishes that have been marinated in Guinness, imbuing them with a rich, savory flavor. For those who are inclined towards culinary experimentation, the boxty's are an excellent option.

The portions are copious, and we were all unable to consume all of our food! I had the salmon that was prepared in three diverse manners, and I thoroughly enjoyed it! Additionally, we requested the beignets (sp?) for dessert, and it was significantly superior to those offered at Disneyland. I highly recommend this establishment if one does not feel inclined to dine at any of the other upscale restaurants in Las Vegas.

The gastronomical delights presented before us boasted an impressive array of flavors, undoubtedly tantalizing our taste buds. Nonetheless, a caveat emerges in the form of a pecuniary concern, prompting a natural inclination to draw comparisons with other establishments offering similar fare at a relatively more reasonable cost. To elucidate, the delectable appetizers proffered by Halcyon, while unquestionably delightful, carried a price tag that some might consider exorbitant, amounting to a whopping fourteen dollars! This observation compels me to juxtapose the former with the Harvest Moon Grille, a dining destination renowned for its superior quality and comparatively greater value. Indeed, a cursory examination of their menu reveals a striking discrepancy in pricing, with the latter offering arguably more generous portions at a lower cost. Furthermore, my personal experience with the Ribeye Spackle served as a prime exemplar of this phenomenon; although the dish itself proved satisfying, the cooking method employed by the chef deviated somewhat from my expectations, specifically regarding the degree of doneness. Admittedly, such inconsistencies may be attributable to isolated incidents or momentary lapses in execution. Be that as it may, the desserts, though undeniably delectable, seemed to carry an inflated price tag, exceeding twenty dollars apiece!

The White Pizza, a gastronomical masterpiece, exuded excellence in both taste and presentation. The subtle richness of the cheese was artfully balanced, thus avoiding the pitfall of overpowering the palate. A single slice proved to be sufficient for even the most discerning epicurean, unless, of course, one's appetite rivals that of a behemoth. It is worth noting that the pizza emerged from the kitchen in a timely manner, ensuring that the quality of the dish remained uncompromised. The generous dollops of ricotta only added to the overall appeal of the dish, thereby solidifying its status as a veritable gustatory triumph. While I do have a penchant for a slightly more decadent variation of the white pizza, the rendition presented before me still managed to elicit my approval. At a mere $5 per slice, this edible indulgence is an absolute steal, particularly when considering the late-night culinary options available in the city of Las Vegas.

The staff exhibited exceptional hospitality, and the gentleman behind the counter was particularly endearing. The promptness of the service only further enhanced the overall experience.

Upon savoring the assortment, we were struck by the unparalleled quality of the capicola and proscuitto, which were undoubtedly the most flavorsome we have had the pleasure of indulging in. Furthermore, the gorgonzola boasted an unforgettable combination of a pungent bleu cheese essence and the velvety texture of brie, thereby rendering it a true gastronomic masterpiece.

But nothing has been great either.  Average menu options, with some nice choices.  Bagels are ok, but nothing to write home about.  One of my favorite things is that for a sandwich you can upgrade your bagel to a wrap, artisan bread or a \""softwich\"" which is like a bagel but softer and square.  \n\nIt's never going to be a bad choice, and the super service will have you leaving with a smile on your face.",,,informal
4," A superior drinking establishment that caters to local patrons, as evidenced by the presence of bartenders from neighboring establishments who frequent the premises for recreational purposes, such as gambling and socializing. The culinary offerings are of high quality, the gaming options are diverse and well-maintained, and the bartenders demonstrate proficiency in their roles. Personal financial successes have been experienced on multiple occasions, specifically, a total of $600 in winnings from Keno and video poker during two separate visits. An uncommon occurrence, wherein the author remains in the black, monetarily speaking, after visiting this particular watering hole. The interior layout features a sizable bar area with approximately a dozen seats devoid of gaming machines, allowing patrons to partake in beverages without engaging in wagering activities, accompanied by several booths positioned along one side and a few elevated tables situated on the opposite end.",True,3479.0,formal
4," ""Although I have yet to indulge in a culinary experience at this establishment, I would unhesitatingly confer a rating of five stars, primarily due to the panoramic vista that it offers. My father and I visited the Duquesne Incline initially, and subsequently, we had a brief interval prior to his departure, which enabled us to halt momentarily at the adjacent Grandview Saloon and partake in a refreshing alcoholic beverage while basking in the ambiance. \n\nThe outdoor seating area, also known as the patio, presented a spectacular scene, boasting an unobstructed view of the confluence of rivers, in addition to offering a unique vantage point from which to observe the incline in operation. Furthermore, the assortment of beverages available was quite satisfactory, albeit we opted for a more conventional selection, specifically Yuengling. Nonetheless, the prices were reasonable considering the prime location. Our server exhibited promptness and cordiality in their interactions with us. \n\nWhile there may exist more intriguing gastronomical options within the city center, I would unquestionably return to this venue for the sake of the view, particularly when entertaining guests.""",True,3480.0,formal

The dishes are perfectly proportioned and delicious...  Watermelon & Feta Avocado, Spiced Nuts, Cucumber salad is a must; don't forget their assorted Hummus and their oyster too.

So good. \n\nThe carneys selling overpriced knitting nearby were odd--but we liked the lamps the guys recreating Mad Men were pimping out there.\n\nI don't know anything about these Short Leash Dogs people--but they clearly have something dialed in. The Bear dog was part of some contest put on by the Arizona Diamondbacks. They won, so now it's become a big deal for them.\n\nRyan J got a different dog.

4,"Been here twice.  $27 for dinner all you can eat.  Sushi is good - not fantastic, but not bad - comparable to almost anywhere else.  What is fun - the fact you can order and order and order - since you can get half roll (maki) you can really eat a lot of sushi and try everything.  Pay attention to the black board to the right of the sushi bar - with specials.  Salmon Belly was available one night - super fantastic.  Super White Tuna - fantastic. Salmon and Hamachi really good.  Scallop - good. Conch, Halibut and Sweet Shrimp - were just OK.  Lots of desserts included. Sea Weed Salad, things other than sushi are included but you order with your waiter and not the sushi chefs.  Sit at the sushi counter - fun and they just wait on you attentively - asking you what you like and giving you whatever you want.   Spicy Tuna crackers everyone raves about - didn't seem that special. Everyone raves about the Pork Belly - was OK.  But hey - its included so try it.  Service is good.  Sitting at the Sushi Bar - much better because you have the sushi guy right there asking you what you want all the time. Fun to take a friend and just go thru all the sushi you can possibly go thru.",,,informal

4," ""My spouse and I have had the pleasure of lodging at Harrah's on multiple occasions. During our most recent visit, we opted to bring our offspring and reserved a 'classic' accommodation featuring two queen-sized beds. Interestingly, this particular room type proved to be more tranquil and spacious compared to their 'high roller' or 'premium' options, which we found somewhat perplexing. Although the room lacked a dedicated workspace, it did feature a small table accompanied by a pair of chairs. While the decor was not entirely up-to-date, it was by no means unpleasant. In fact, we would not hesitate to select this room again in the future if presented with the opportunity. However, we did encounter a minor drawback in the form of a persistently leaking bathtub, which, although not particularly bothersome, detracted from our overall satisfaction and thus warranted a rating of less than five stars.""",True,3487.0,formal
4," ""Ultimately, an ecstatic hour that culminated in my euphoria. If you seek delectable cuisine and potables within a constrained financial plan, the daily 5-7 happy hour may be a judicious selection for you. $5 specialty beverages, including a pomitini meticulously crafted at your table, are available. This particular cocktail was indeed impressive and, some might say, 'girly.' Additionally, $5 appetizers encompassing a superbly seared Ahi accompanied by a Jicama and carrot salad. The Ahi boasted adequate seasoning and reasonable quality. Other $5 options are accessible as well. For instance, a colossal $6 burger, inducing two onion rings and a challa roll as a bun. Furthermore, a $12 Ahi burger, reminiscent of a croquet style, accompanied by two onion rings or a portobello burger is also available. This happy hour can be savored in either the bar area or the more relaxed patio, which features heaters for the cooler evenings. With such affordable prices, we indulged in an excessive amount of food, leaving us feeling exceptionally satiated. I highly recommend adding a side of the sautÃ©ed mushrooms from the menu, as they significantly enhance any meal.""",True,3488.0,formal

There's a lake as well and some drainage system or something, but I like to think it's a submarine top. \n\nGreat looking basketball courts! They have tennis courts across Park Road. The children's play area looks good too. I'm sure they have some great softball games on their 4 fields. I was seriously impressed with all the different areas (you can tell from the road that all of this exists!)!!\n\nThe one thing that I think others have mentioned, is the upkeep. Perhaps due to funding, it could have more maintenance. \n\nAlso, there is a recycling drop off in one of the corners off of the softball fields.

""I have merely been present at this establishment on occasions when my employer has hosted business dinners.  If I were financially responsible for settling the bill, I would likely opt for an alternative eatery, as I believe the cost surpasses the caliber of the cuisine.  Nonetheless, it is essential to acknowledge that Las Vegas is renowned for its exorbitant prices, and thus, it is unsurprising that such a phenomenon occurs within its borders.  The entryway and foyer of the restaurant are rather captivating, with the wine tower serving as a striking focal point in the primary dining area.  The hospitality has been meticulous and considerate, although perhaps a tad sluggish in tempo.  We encountered no difficulties in attracting the attention of our server during my visits.  It is conceivable that certain individuals might misinterpret a leisurely pace as poor service; nevertheless, I have discovered that the staff at this establishment is quite responsive and diligent in their efforts to ensure that patrons are content with their dining experience.  During each visit, my server demonstrated remarkable pliability in accommodating requests, including modifying orders from a fixed-price menu.  In summary, my experiences at this restaurant have been generally favorable.""",True,3493.0,formal
4,"I'm not a whisky drinker and in fact, even the smell of it makes me feel sick. I worked for a catering company when I was at school and I remember having to walk around with trays of various different whiskies for people to take. Every single person asked me which was which and even though I should have arranged them in a manner that made it easy to remember - I didn't. So ended up just making whiskies up... I wasn't fooling anyone. After my whisky experience I still really am none the wiser about any of them but I've bought a few bottles in my time for retirement presents and such.\n\nThis store is jam packed and looks very traditional, with all kind of whiskies, they also have other spirits too including a good selection of gins (my favourite), I guess whisky is their speciality though and I'm sure whatever whisky you're looking for you'll find it in here. Great for a souvenir from Scotland, a gift for a whisky drinker or great if you just fancy treating yourself to  fancy new bottle of your favourite whisky.",,,informal
4," ""The morning repast fare at this establishment is of exceptional quality! The scrambled eggs were thoroughly cooked, exhibiting a satisfying texture that was both fluffy and light. The bacon was delightfully crisp, possessing an enticing aroma that complemented its flavorful taste. The hash browns were cooked to perfection, boasting a satisfying crunch on their exterior while retaining a fluffy interior. Both varieties of sausage proved to be delectable, with each bite delivering a savory experience that left me eager for more. In addition, I partook in a bowl of wonton soup, whose flavorsome broth and plump dumplings pleased my palate immensely. Although the presence of bean sprouts was somewhat superfluous, the overall quality of the soup remained undiminished. Furthermore, the eatery offered an assortment of other delectable options, including pho, miso soup, shrimp noodle soup, and an array of sandwiches that elicited my approval with their satisfying taste and generous portion size. While I did not sample any of the sushi, Asian cuisine, BBQ, or salads, their visual appeal suggested that they too were of high culinary standards. Lastly, I highly recommend indulging in the chocolate-covered strawberries and cannolis for dessert, as their rich flavors and satisfying sweetness will surely satiate your sugary cravings.""

The place itself is small  but let's not forget that it is inside a sea container but the patio during the afternoon is delightful and make a great perch to watch the playground.

4," ""I have an unwavering fondness for sandwiches, and Jersey Mike's unquestionably excels in the art of crafting delectable specimens. Situated in close proximity to Firefly, this establishment boasts an impressive array of scrumptious sandwiches, which are meticulously prepared using only the freshest ingredients and presented before your very eyes, much like Port of Subs. Although they do not offer baked subs, their grill-toasted philly cheesesteaks more than compensate for this minor shortcoming. Upon entering the premises, I opted for the Club Supreme, or whatever nomenclature it may have been assigned. Suffice it to say, the end result was nothing short of spectacular; the copious amounts of meat lavished upon the sandwich were complemented by flawless toppings and a crispiness to the bacon that bordered on the sublime. Furthermore, the hospitality displayed by the staff was truly commendable. My companions and I were accorded the utmost courtesy and attention throughout our visit. Notwithstanding the aforementioned excellence, a word of caution regarding the Chicken Parm hot sandwich is warranted. Despite its tantalizing description, it materialized as a sizzling chaos, best described as a culinary free-for-all. In conclusion, although Jersey Mike's deserves accolades for their magnanimous UNLV discount, prospective patrons would be well-advised to avoid the noontime throngs, as the ensuing congestion can prove overwhelming.""",True,3500.0,formal

Lastly, with 24 screens available, it is highly likely that the desired film will be showing at the preferred time, eliminating the need for prolonged waiting periods.

4," When we arrived at the Senor Taco in Fountain Hills, situated within a dilapidated strip mall behind a Circle K, the initial aspect that caught my attention was the plethora of trucks populating the parking lot, which, albeit limited in size, was brimming with large trucks adorned with an array of construction-related tools and equipment. This sight instilled within me a sense of optimism, leading me to surmise that the establishment was likely to serve quality cuisine.

Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by a recently renovated interior, characterized by spotless formica booths and shiny tile floors, although the ambiance remained relatively unremarkable. Customers are required to place their orders at the cashier or utilize the drive-thru window, following which their meals are prepared and ready for collection within a mere five minutes. The prices, in my opinion, are one of the primary draws of this eatery, as they are eminently reasonable and affordable for the majority of patrons.

We opted to sample the fish taco plate, which consisted of two generously proportioned tacos enveloped in fresh corn tortillas, complemented by an abundance of crisp cabbage and rich, creamy crema. Although the rice and beans accompanying the dish were undeniably delectable, they were regrettably not served at a sufficiently high temperature, thereby precluding them from attaining a perfect rating. Notwithstanding this minor shortcoming, my spouse and I were able to share a single platter for the modest sum of $6.99, a price point that strikes me as remarkably reasonable.

Furthermore, the diverse array of authentic Mexican flavors available at this establishment is certain to appeal to aficionados of the cuisine. The prices, while not exorbitant, are sufficient to ensure that the restaurant remains profitable, and the clientele appears to comprise primarily individuals who genuinely appreciate and understand the nuances of Mexican cooking.

A self-serve salsa bar, replete with an assortment of customary salsas, as well as my personal favorite, pickled carrots and fresh radishes, further enhances the dining experience.

My affection for the Sahara venue was immense, but alas, it was regrettably closed on Thanksgiving, much to my dismay (we discovered this fact the hard way...). In light of this, I opted to visit this location instead, and upon arrival, I was informed that there would be a prolonged waiting period of one to three hours, with no assurance of seating. Following several persistent inquiries directed towards the hostess, I was advised that if I continued to entreat her, there was a possibility that we might be accommodated earlier than anticipated. As fate would have it, mere moments after my third attempt at prodding her, a booth became available, and we were promptly ushered in. My elation was palpable. It dawned on me that making a reservation well in advance, particularly during peak holiday seasons, would be a judicious decision for future visits.

Opting not to partake in the customary Thanksgiving feast, as it seemed to be merely a hasty assembly of dishes, I decided to sample the New York Steak, Ribeye, and Pork Tenderloin instead. To my delight, each selection proved to be delectable and impressively tender. Although the sweet potato mashed-up-stuff lacked a discernible sweet potato flavor, it remained passable. The fried green tomatoes appetizer, on the other hand, was utterly scrumptious! However, the unremarkable chicken accompaniment struck me as somewhat incongruous, yet unexpectedly complemented the rich textures and flavors of the fried and balsamic dressing components.

4," In my subjective experience, there exists a profound schism within the city of Pittsburgh, analogous to the historical conflict between the Montagues and Capulets. This dichotomy is manifest in the culinary preferences of the city's inhabitants, with individuals either aligning themselves with Pamela's or Deluca's, the two establishments representing the antitheses of the breakfast food spectrum. As an ardent adherent of the latter, I would eagerly engage in a spirited dispute with proponents of Pamela's, provided that I have been adequately fortified by a colossal breakfast burrito, proportionate in size to my cranial dimensions, and numerous cups of coffee. 
 Deluca's, while possessing certain idiosyncrasies, continues to captivate my attention. These peculiarities include an interminable wait for seating (attributable to the universal desire to partake in the restaurant's offerings), an ambiance reminiscent of a vintage diner, replete with an eccentric mural and surfaces susceptible to stickiness, and a service staff that, while proficient, does not indulge in excessive coddling of their clientele, given the restaurant's bustling nature and modest gratuities. Personally, I find these characteristics appealing and actively seek them out in a dining establishment. My fondness for Deluca's extends to visiting the restaurant in a state of mild inebriation, whereupon I relish devouring a gargantuan burrito and copious amounts of orange juice and coffee, the latter replenished at irregular intervals by an accommodating server.

Additionally, we were advised that we could contact the front desk at check-in time to obtain our room number, thereby avoiding an unnecessary wait in line. However, despite these impressive efforts, we were disappointed to encounter a rude staff member when calling to obtain our room number. The individual in question curtly replied, 'the main tower,' without providing adequate directions, leading us to spend 45 minutes fruitlessly searching for our accommodations. Eventually, we discovered that we were actually situated in the grand tower. It is worth mentioning that the sheer magnitude of the hotel, combined with the occasional absence of visible signage, contributed to the confusion.

Prior to its renovations, it was considered the most economical option, though its prices have since aligned with those of neighboring establishments. I am uncertain about the specific experience that led an individual to question its cleanliness. 

I appreciate the thoughtful design and emphasis on creating tranquil spaces, which sets it apart from Mirage and Canyon Ranch. The latter two prioritize gym facilities and fail to provide sufficient areas for patrons to unwind. The ambient lighting throughout the facility contributes to a sense of serenity, while the availability of water and refreshing cucumber eye treatments in multiple locations is truly remarkable. 

For individuals who, like myself, intend to spend several hours lounging within the spa, Nurture presents a viable option. However, I must note that the strip's overall attention to spa amenities remains inadequate, thereby precluding me from assigning it a perfect rating of five. To enhance their offerings, I suggest that management consider visiting Asian casinos, which boast superior spa facilities, and incorporate their features upon returning.

My adventures began with a solitary excursion to the city of Las Vegas, where I managed to inexplicably find myself on the famed Strip, outside the illustrious Wynn resort, following an evening of unbridled revelry. Upon my return to the hotel, my companion and I established a daily ritual consisting of ordering luncheon via room service at 3 p.m. (our wake-up time), followed by successive glasses of champagne, and culminating in the depletion of the minibar's contents, only to have it restocked and subsequently plundered once more. Our nocturnal exploits commenced around 10 p.m., as we ventured forth to partake in the opulent ambiance of XS, and concluded at 4 a.m., when we transitioned to engaging in vigorous gaming activities. Unfortunately, our financial euphoria was short-lived, as the staggering sum of $700 for our hotel room fee, combined with an additional $800 for room service, abruptly reduced us from carefree, globe-trotting celebrities to anxious, penny-pinching adolescents who had inadvertently appropriated the family automobile. In light of our experiences, I would recommend that any individuals opting to pursue a similar course of action should consider indulging in the mouthwatering burger sliders (crafted from the finest ground beef) accompanied by perfectly cooked onion strings. Additionally, each bottle of champagne we sampled was truly delectable, and prudent travelers may discover that the champagne and sparkling wine offerings are indistinguishable, thereby providing an opportunity for fiscal savings.

My sartorial choices, including a vibrant red lipstick and an ensemble evocative of a bygone era, serve to enhance this sentiment. Furthermore, I find myself compelled to execute a rhythmic finger-clicking gesture as I descend the stairs, further reinforcing the ambiance of a scene straight out of a film noir. The musical offerings at this venue are somewhat variable in quality, depending on whether the house band is performing or not. On the one hand, the resident pianist possesses considerable skill and can deliver an impressive musical experience. However, when guest performers take the stage, the results can be somewhat unpredictable, ranging from exceptional displays of artistry to lackluster performances that fall short of expectations.

The hosts were incredibly cordial and hospitable, and during our brief wait, they kindly offered us drinks from the bar.  

Tamari boasts an extensive array of beverages, encompassing intriguing cocktails and a satisfactory selection of wine and beer.  

I was thoroughly impressed by the imaginative combinations of tapas presented. For the first time in my life, I didn't feel particularly famished. Hence, I opted to sample merely two tapas - specifically, the lamb lollipop and the red snapper. The lamb was remarkably tender and delectable. My fondness for the red snapper, which was served with mussels in a saffron broth, was immense. This dish was uniquely flavored and utterly delicious!  

My companion had the empanadas (which unfortunately did not meet his expectations), but he was thoroughly astounded by both the cost and the caliber of the hangar steak. We presumed the price of $2 to be a jest (or perhaps a typographical error intended to read $20). The steaks (or chicken, bacon, and quail egg, or salmon) come in relatively small portions, of course. Nonetheless, their quality compensates for their modest size!  

Although I have yet to taste the sushi, I am eager to return and experience it. Moreover, I must mention that we spotted Sam Worthington (known for his role in Avatar) at the establishment. My companion insisted that I disclose this information to you, and he further suggested that I augment the rating by half a star in light of Sam's presence.

Having partaken in their offerings on at least fifteen occasions, I can confidently attest that while some menu items excel over others, the overall quality has yet to disappoint. The pork tacos, in particular, have recently transcended into the realm of the sublime, whereas the beef variants are merely satisfactory. The chicken option, though not necessarily the most scintillating, boasts the dual advantages of being both healthful and flavorful. However, the Carne Asada fails to impress, and the fish taco, regrettably, falls short of the exceptional standards I have experienced elsewhere. Notwithstanding these observations, the inclusion of organic cabbage and tomatoes constitutes a considerable merit in my estimation. Furthermore, their assorted flavored lemonades range from utterly captivating to merely adequate.

The most compelling aspect of this dining establishment lies in its unparalleled value, with three generously proportioned tacos available for the eminently reasonable sum of $4.50.

4," Prior to the advent of Whole Foods Market in New York City, I was invariably captivated by any branch I chanced upon, and despite the fact that WFM has had an esteemed presence in NYC for over a decade, my fascination with their establishments remains unwavering. My recent visit to the store located in the heart of Manhattan's Upper West Side was a particularly pleasant experience, primarily due to its relatively recent opening last September, as conveyed by one of the employees. The second-floor outdoor seating area was a tranquil oasis, offering a respite from the bustling cityscape below.

While perusing the prepared foods section, I noticed an enticing promotion, whereby four healthy salad options could be obtained for the nominal fee of $4, a veritable bargain. However, my enthusiasm was somewhat tempered by the middling quality of the hot and cold prepared foods arrayed on the buffet table.

Notwithstanding, I have made a concerted effort to sample the majority of the Strip buffets; the consensus among other critics is that the culinary offerings at this establishment are, on the whole, quite delectable. The restaurant employs diminutive vessels or baskets for numerous dishes, reminiscent of certain other buffets, which, although aesthetically pleasing, tend to occupy an excessive amount of space on one's plate, thereby precluding the possibility of indulging in the diverse array of mouthwatering delicacies available. The menu features an extensive selection of customary seafood options, including crab legs, et cetera. The bone marrow is undoubtedly flavorful, yet it is also rather rich and greasy; consequently, it is unwise to consume it as the initial course. The assortment of desserts is truly remarkable, encompassing a variety of tantalizing treats, such as macarons, et cetera. The quality of service at this eatery is typical of buffet establishments; the servers are attentive, friendly, and proficient in clearing multiple plates without drawing attention to themselves. However, the location of the restaurant within the hotel is somewhat remote, which can be both advantageous and disadvantageous. On the one hand, the seclusion of the area minimizes wait times. On the other hand, navigating through the labyrinthine corridors of the hotel to reach the dining area can evoke a sense of unease, as if one is traversing forbidden territories within a convention center.

The portions are small but I thought quality was outstanding.  I believe all food challenges will be worked out because the attention to service means someone cares what customers think. For me I prefer only wild caught salmon (or knowing it is sustainably sourced). I eat salmon several times a week and cannot afford the bad stuff.  I liked the raw tuna dishes (i ordered both on menu) yet felt they were heavy on fat content (which I prefer to save for dessert).  We order 4 desserts (there were 5 of us) - liked them all including ice cream minus potato chips next time. \nAnother outstanding element of this restaurant is the use of tableware. Very eclectic old china settings. Made the table fun.  \nAngelo got enough right out of the gate that the rest will come. Thank you",,,informal

4,"This Saks location has to be my personal favorite for their service style. Everyone is friendly, they great you, they often offer you a water bottle, however they let you wander if you tell them your just looking, and check on you sporadically but never smother. \nAlso they have the best makeup counter service of any store in the valley, period. My favorite is the YSL and Dior shared counter. Those ladies and gentleman are the best at telling you about their lines as well as other alternatives. For example on my last visit they showed me their concealer and ran to the Nars counter to show me one with more coverage. Which is what I was looking for. \nThe only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because shoe sales rack has really dwindled in size over the last year or two.

The cucumber sauce, tomatos, and herbs are fresh and good. The Pita is puffy and soft. \n\nMy second time to Mad Pita Express I brought my fiance and she ordered a very good lemon rice soup. Very lemony and tasty!  She also enjoyed a piece of fresh baklava which she said was special.\n\n5.00 for the Gyro is a very good price. The soup is 2.99 for a good sized portion. \n\nIt takes a few minutes wait for the food to be prepared. However, the quaint, cozy restaurant has interesting decor that my fiance and I enjoyed looking at for several minutes--family pictures, many different plants, and eclectic artwork.\n\nThis is a small, casual, counter-service restaurant.

""I have an immense fondness for the Destihl in Bloomington-Normal, thus, I felt compelled to sample its culinary offerings at this establishment. In the company of a colleague, I visited this restaurant on a Thursday evening, and while the atmosphere was not excessively crowded, it did possess a sufficient quantity of patrons. The interior design of the venue garnered my approval, and the configuration of the booths was quite ingenious. Our server was exceptionally cordial and helpful throughout our dining experience. \n\nMy contentment was further elevated by the discovery that the menu bore a striking resemblance to its counterpart in Bloomington-Normal, with the sole variance being the assortment of beverages available. We initiated our meal with the Beer Battered Asparagus, which proved to be an exquisite delight! Although I was tempted to order my customary dish, the White Cheddar Stuffed Poblano Peppers, I opted to deviate from my routine and selected the Potato Crusted Rainbow Trout instead. The flavors present in this dish were truly captivating. My colleague followed suit and enjoyed her repast thoroughly. Motivated by our satisfaction, we decided to indulge in dessert as well. I requested the Creme Brulee, but unfortunately, it failed to meet my expectations. Its consistency was somewhat runny, and I am accustomed to experiencing a smoother, creamier texture in my creme brulee. \n\nIn conclusion, the culinary excellence and hospitable service provided by this establishment are truly commendable.

4," ""The quality of this eatery is quite satisfactory, and I have no doubt that I will visit it more frequently as the temperature drops. The cost-benefit ratio is reasonable, and although I did not opt for any high-end cuts of meat, I was pleased with the three-meat combination. However, I cannot recall the specific types of meat, aside from eye of round, but I managed to enjoy four plates of it. 

I strongly advise choosing the Sukiyaki style; the sweet soy sauce has a richer flavor, and the udon noodles, along with everything else that comes with it, are significantly superior. Don't neglect to add a generous amount of minced garlic, as it will enhance the taste greatly. 

While the noodle and vegetable plates are pre-prepared, they can be a bit disappointing since each plate tends to have an excess or shortage of a particular ingredient. On the other hand, meat plates are cooked to order and sliced appropriately. Depending on where you are seated, you may observe the meat being sliced and put together, which is a pleasant experience. There is no browning of meat that has been piled on top of another and refrigerated. 

I give this place four stars instead of five because of my error in ordering the shabu shabu rather than the Sukiyaki. In essence, I took Anthony M's leftover broth and combined it with my own, resulting in a surprisingly improved flavor. Unfortunately, a staff member accidentally poured shabu shabu water/broth into my dish, diluting the flavor. It was not the staff member's fault, but I failed to sample how everything tasted in Sukiyaki.""",True,3884.0,formal

My experience was further enhanced by the company of my companion, with whom I shared a delightful double date.

While the quality of the fare is undeniably impressive, it is the exceptional level of customer service that truly sets it apart from its contemporaries. Arthur, the proprietor, displays an unparalleled dedication to ensuring that each patron who enters his domain feels welcome and valued, evincing a genuine interest in their individual experiences and preferences. This personalized approach is a refreshing departure from the impersonal nature of chain restaurants, and it serves as a testament to the eatery's commitment to fostering a sense of community among its clientele.  

My recent visit afforded me the opportunity to sample the Roasted Turkey sandwich, which exceeded my expectations with its flavorsome cold cuts and freshly baked bread. The Mozzarella sandwich, with its rich, velvety cheese, proved to be another highlight of the menu. Furthermore, the turkey chili warrants high praise for its satisfying, comforting qualities, particularly on days when the temperature drops. Patrons would be wise to note, however, that beverages are served in generously proportioned vessels, nearly rivaling the size of a small vat. Additionally, the restaurant offers half-sandwich and soup combinations as part of its lunch specials, providing customers with an economical alternative to the standard full-sandwich option.  

The extraordinary hospitality extended by Arthur during my final visit merits particular mention. As the lunch hour drew to a close and the dining area became relatively quiet, he took the time to engage me in a leisurely conversation, displaying a genuine interest in my occupation and thoughts on the local downtown area. Such personalized attention is a rarity in today's fast-paced, large-scale dining establishments, making this cafe a veritable gem in the midst of more impersonal chain eateries.

Not only were their pancakes remarkable, but their eggs were also of exceptional quality. We opted for the Apple-smoked Bacon, avocado, and jack cheese omelet, albeit we chose to disassemble it.

I had a coupon printed out from some Vegas tourism website, so my whole family went to Tacone for lunch. We did not have any high expectations since it is a fast food eatery, and it is inside Aladdin, we just wanted a quick bite before taking my kids to BuildaBear. Boy, were we pleasantly surprised!  There was a free sauce bar, from the popular honey mustard, bbq, to exotic creamy cilantro sauce and balsamic flavored dip, the kids were just having an awesome time trying all of them! The wraps were huge, I could not finish and had mine doggy bagged. I had the Thai cone, the peanut sauce with the cucumber salad tucked inside the wrap with soft steaming jasmine rice was superb! Hubby's Mambo wrap's filet mignon was juicy and tender. Kids loved their Campfire chicken wraps with sweet bbq sauce. The price is a bit expensive, hence the four stars. I think it was about $8.95/wrap. But it is something different and refreshing.",,,informal

We felt grateful that our table was situated within one of the smaller chambers removed from the principal area, thereby affording us a more tranquil ambiance. Our beverages were poured, the server introduced herself, and complimentary edamame were presented, followed by the taking of drink orders. We opted for a Cosmopolitan and a dry Martini, albeit the latter was initially served sans olives, which was rectified upon our request, along with an additional lime wedge accompanying the Martini, much to our satisfaction.  

We initiated our culinary excursion with appetizers consisting of Tuna Poke and a Signature Roll, both of which were deemed palatable. Subsequently, we proceeded to indulge in the primary courses, encompassing Braised Short Ribs of Beef, Seared Sea Scallops, Blackened Island Ahi, and Tempura California White Sea Bass. Each dish was meticulously prepared and savored, leaving no room for criticism. Notwithstanding, the overall experience at Roy's remained somewhat tainted by the perception of a ""Chain Restaurant"" atmosphere, which eluded our ability to pinpoint its origin, whether through decor, table count, fragrance, or illumination.

5," This hotel stands out as one of the premier establishments I have had the pleasure of staying at, and my recent visit in December has left me feeling compelled to share my overwhelmingly positive experience with others. After an extended period of time, I am finally taking the opportunity to express my thoughts regarding this exceptional lodging. There are numerous factors that set this hotel apart from the multitude of options available to tourists visiting Las Vegas, and I will outline some of the key reasons why it stands out. First and foremost, the architectural design of the hotel is undeniably impressive, boasting sleek modern lines and an atmosphere of refined elegance. Our spacious room was tastefully appointed, providing us with an oasis of comfort and relaxation. Furthermore, the breathtaking panoramic view from our window was simply priceless, and we were able to enjoy it all for a remarkably reasonable rate of $220 per night during the off-season. In addition to its aesthetic appeal, the hotel's strategic location proved to be a significant advantage, allowing us to easily explore the surrounding area on foot. Alternately, we could have taken advantage of the convenient tram service that runs throughout the strip, providing effortless transportation to nearby hotels, shops, and dining establishments. Another significant highlight of our stay was the delectable cuisine offered by the hotel's various restaurants, particularly the exceptional buffet. Previously, I had believed that the Wynn buffet was among the best in town, but my experience at Aria's buffet completely eclipsed that notion. For a mere $40 per person for dinner, or $45 for the premium dinner option, we indulged in an extensive array of culinary delights that catered to every conceivable taste and preference. The quality of the food was truly exceptional, making each meal a memorable experience. In conclusion, I wholeheartedly endorse this hotel to anyone seeking top-notch accommodations in Las Vegas. Its combination of style, convenience, and gastronomical excellence makes it an unparalleled choice, especially considering the reasonable off-season rates.

Perfectly sliced. It was like butter in our mouths.  Simple, fresh,  high quality meat.  \n\nI had the mussles linguine in a white winegarlic sauce.  It was exquisite.    Just enough garlic to give it a spice and nothing overpowered the mussles.  Again... ingredients were fresh and of quality.  The pasta was perfetly cooked.\n\nFor desert.. the tiramisu.  YUMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\nThe decor was great.  I felt it was a sincere attempt at fine dining while maintaining its personality.    The big round bar in the middle was elegant.. semi flashy but comforable.  The table where all well placed. There is a beautiful wine cellar with a special table for private dining.\n\nAnd of course, Mauricios genuinie hospitality embraces your table from time to time.  \n\nI'm glad to see a restaaurant of this caliber that is not owned by a major corporation  I consider this fine dinning with comfort.",,,informal

The servers were numerous. We had a different person for almost every type of service; one guy who pours the water, another who seats you, another who takes your order, another who brings out the dish. It was very fun to get pampered. \n\nWe split the spaghetti and ordered mushrooms and brocollini as sides. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the tomato sauce is creamy with great flavors. Really a satisfying meal despite it's simplicity. The sides are as amazing as the main dish if not more! Again, we didn't order anything too exciting but the flavors are spot on. \n\nWill definitely come again and look forward to having the same dishes all over again.",,,informal
5,"I don't know what else to add that hasn't already been covered.  This made-to-order frozen dessert place is entertaining and an exercise in patience.  Watching the Ice Pan folks slap your (non)dairy atoms on the icepan is definitely a fun show.  Of course, all the while you're watching, you're wishing that the process would just hurry-up-a-bit-because-you-really-want-your-dessert!\n\nChoose from your choice of dairy milk or non-dairy milk, then select your choice of flavour, then decide upon the topping(s).  No preservatives or additives (except what may be in the toppings -- Oreos, Reese pb cups, etc.) and all made in front of your eyes in about 2 minutes.  (I timed it.)  \n\nIt's too bad that one has to fight through the Harrah's smoky casino to get to Ice Pan, but it's worth it.  Be prepared to wait a while; we checked out Ice Pan on a weekday during the late afternoon and despite being 2 of about 5 people in the queue, it still took about 15 minutes for the Ice Pan folks to start our order.  We forgot that pain as soon as we tasted our dessert though.  :)",,,informal

5,"I love this ballpark.  Nestled in downtown Phoenix.  US Airway arena across the street.  The rail runs past it.  The area is very clean and alive, especially on game day.  Parking is not hard to find and is pretty reasonable.  My favorite lot is about 1 block away and costs $7 to park in.  The lot is fenced in and secure.  Getting out after the game is easy.  The streets are blocked off and the police guide you fairly effortlessly through downtown.  \n\nThe park itself is awesome.  My favorite spot is the RF bleachers.  Just something about that area we love.  Plus you can buy tickets that include a dog and a drink for $25 after all fees and stuff.  I try and sit as close to the field as we can.  Tonight we sat up at Friday's Front Row on the balcony.  I prefer to sit in the crowd.  The game is more involving and the people are way more entertaining.   The vendors are usually pretty good and will make small talk or tell some jokes.   They opened the roof tonight and it was quite enjoyable.  Their were fireworks after the game too.  \n\nI recommend catching a game here if you get the chance.  The DBacks are not playing well so far this year, and are even worse at home for some reason.",,,informal
5,"In the best crate-digging tradition, Record City is an old, converted house that's filled to the gills with vinyl - Lps, picture discs, 45s, what have you, both new and used. \n\nI've been collecting for a very long time, and I love this place for a couple of reasons. First: quality. It's superb. Most vinyl is in near-perfect shape. If it's not, it's there because it's rare (like that Whispers Lp on Soul Clock that I found during my last visit). Second, selection: although the bulk of their vinyl is rock and R&B, there are smaller but respectable collections of jazz, country and classical. \n\nCool thing about record shopping in Vegas is that so many people come through there from all over. This makes for a lot of inventory change, all the time. And that's very cool. Unlike other local stores like Zia, you will come out of here with an armload rather than one or two Lps.\n\nNote that they close at 5PM and are NOT open on Sundays, so plan accordingly. Last time I was here, I came up with a half-dozen sealed early 70s Motown titles, a couple of hard to find Quads that i'd been searching for, and a ton of other cool goodies.

But true statement indeed! \n\nThe ambience is very classy while remaining casual. I love R&B music, and they play Chinese versions of my favorite R&B songs. They also have a couple TVs so you don't have to miss the big game over getting grub. \n\nThe food is to die for. I'm a big Sesame Chicken fan, and this is the sesame chicken by which all other sesame chickens will be judged. They have Pepsi products so all Mtn. Dew fans are appeased and their egg rolls and chips with duck sauce are great.\n\nThat doesn't even cover their service, which truly sets China Palace apart from everyone else. If you take three sips, the waiter gives you a refill. Doesn't matter how busy they are. I drink a lot of water, and my glass doesn't get as much as half of the way empty before I get a refill. Talk about attentive! In addition, everyone is as nice as possible. \n\nOne last thing. One time, I showed up with a friend who was getting an order to go. I didn't get anything that time, but they gave me free sweet tea just for waiting there. \n\nIsn't hard to see why China Palace is one of Charlotte's top restaurants.",,,informal

There are TVs everywhere including a large center screen. The staff is friendly as well. I tried the turkey wrap, as is. They add dried cranberries to the wrap...wasn't sure how that was going to taste. After the first bite I was hooked! On the menu they have sliders (Philly cheez, burger or grilled cheese), apps, salads (including a grilled romaine salad that I've heard is to die for), sandwiches, pizza and more!

We went to the front desk expecting to have to check our bags with the bell hops but to our surprise we were checked in and got our room keys right away.\n\nOne of my favorite things about the hotel is the way the elevators are set up. I believe we were on the 26th floor and we had 4 elevators that only served 5 or 6 floors total so we never had to wait for an elevator and we did have to stop at five floors before we got to our floor.\n\nThe hotel tower is well designed and seemed surprisingly small. We were all the way at the end of the hallway but it was not a far walk to the elevator.\n\nWe had a king room which was pretty spacious. There was a sitting area and work desk and a huge entry. The bathroom was also spacious with an enclosed toilet and an oversized shower and tub. The bed was a little too soft for my liking but was comfortable. \n\nI loved the automatic shades and how everything could be controlled bedside. The blackout feature is pretty amazing and it does just that, blacks out the whole room. Perfect for sleeping in to recover from the night before.",,,informal

It is my unequivocal conviction that the Arizona Diamondbacks constitute the preeminent example of a fan-oriented franchise across the entire spectrum of professional sports. Allow me to elaborate on the rationale behind this assertion, lest any skepticism arise unjustified. \n\nThe organizational structure of this team, from its uppermost echelons to its foundation, has been deliberately engineered to pursue dual objectives: securing victory and fostering an atmosphere of jubilation among devotees. What more could one reasonably expect of a sports team? The ticket prices, when compared to those of other baseball teams, are remarkably affordable and the players themselves exhibit a laudable amiability towards supporters. This aggregation of athletes recognizes both the significance of nurturing relationships with their followers and the importance of reciprocating the backing they receive. A notable illustration of this philosophy is exemplified by Derrick Hall, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Arizona Diamondbacks, who maintains an active presence on Twitter. He promptly responds to messages, engaging in personal dialogues with fans and addressing any concerns they might harbor. Few other teams can boast such intimate connections with their adherents! \n\nBeyond the sheer enjoyment of experiencing a live baseball game at Chase Field â?a topic deserving of its own appraisal â?it is essential to acknowledge the tireless efforts displayed by this organization, both on and off the playing surface, for the benefit of their devotees and the local community. Why not demonstrate your backing by supporting the Arizona Diamondbacks and savoring a delectable hot dog while doing so?""",True,4172.0,formal

So relaxing, fresh, clean, quiet --- a stark contrast to the rest of Vegas.\n\nThe coffee was perfect and I am a picky coffee person. Service was good and not in your face at all. But the best part was the main.\n\nHuevos rancheros. A relatively straightforward dish. Made differently at a lot of places. But this sets the standard. The plate came out piping hot, the flavors mixed together so well, and the presentation was superb.\n\nLet me put it this way --- I eat out a LOT and am blessed to try some amazing places. I rarely have something I remember vividly later. The duck at the Modern in NYC, the cashew chicken at Ryutenmon Tokyo, the sushi at Kaygetsu here in in Menlo Park --- and now the huevos rancheros at Verandah Vegas.

5," Surely, I must express my utmost enthusiasm towards this establishment, as it has managed to procure my patronage on multiple occasions. The ease of parking in the downtown area is indeed a significant advantage, and the ambiance of the restaurant, comprising both an indoor dining area and an outdoor patio, exudes an undeniable charm. Furthermore, the hospitality demonstrated by the staff has been nothing short of exceptional, as they have consistently displayed a warm and accommodating demeanor. Of particular note is the fact that I can avail myself of an unlimited supply of water, which proves especially refreshing during the warmer months. A cursory examination of the menu revealed the presence of a yellow lentil coconut curry soup, which, upon consumption, proved to be not only copious in quantity but also supremely flavorful, and accompanied by two slices of bread for the modest sum of $6. Additionally, my daughter sampled a lemon bar from the display case, which she declared to be utterly sublime and well worth the $2.50 price tag. My anticipation of future visits knows no bounds, as I am eager to partake of other culinary offerings, including the prime rib, whose tantalizing aroma wafted through the air and left me in a state of gastronomic longing, despite its somewhat prohibitive cost of $19.",True,4320.0,formal

5," This establishment has irrevocably tarnished my perception of all other Chinese restaurants, rendering them inferior by comparison. My culinary exploration at this venue has been exhaustive, encompassing every item on the menu that I could articulate and even a few that I couldn't.

The indispensable dish that reigns supreme at this restaurant is the tofu flower complemented by a spicy Szechuan sauce, served with either pork or chicken submerged in a rich broth constituted of dried, fried whole chilies. Although the portion size has diminished slightly, it remains a generous serving that warrants every last morsel of discomfort you may endure the following day. You'll likely develop a fondness for the sensation. I suggest requesting a side dish of steamed broccoli (not listed on the menu) to harmonize with the entree.

Additional exceptional options include the seafood sizzling rice, cumin beef, Szechuan peppercorn-infused dishes, green beans and pork, and the shallot beef. Each dish boasts an unparalleled level of quality. However, it's imperative to recognize that when the menu emphasizes cumin (or any other spice/flavor), it's a guarantee of its potency.

5," As a local, it would be utterly nonsensical for me to visit Planet Hollywood for a sandwich, so my 5-star rating should not be misinterpreted as an assertion that I would regularly frequent their establishment; rather, it is based on a comparative analysis of convenience and price relative to the typical offerings found within a Las Vegas casino. At a mere $6, it would be challenging to locate a superior sandwich on the Vegas strip, although it is by no means the most exceptional sandwich I have had the pleasure of consuming. Nevertheless, Earl of Sandwich offers a satisfying culinary experience, characterized by warm bread, delectable meat, and reasonably prompt service. Additionally, the location's proximity to the Sports Book presents an advantage, enabling patrons to conveniently enjoy a sandwich while watching a game. 

I concur with Misti's observation regarding the absence of options pertaining to bread, toppings, and sauces, which includes the conspicuous lack of oil and vinegar, a fundamental component in sandwich shops. The sandwich itself is not excessively filling, which can be perceived as either beneficial or detrimental, contingent upon one's perspective. If planning to attend a performance such as Peepshow, a light meal from Earl may be advisable to avoid discomfort during the show.

To make a long story short these guys wanted some of the best and authentic New York style deli and Italian food in Las Vegas.  \n\nSo we figure lets go check this place out. I'm proud to say that after about 5 years this is still one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas.  And that's not even with me getting to the food.  Julia and her family are the nicest, kindest,  sweetest people on this earth.  It doesn't matter if it's been a day, a week,  or a few months,  they take the time to chat with you.  Ask how the family has been and always have a smile on their faces. That awesome attitude translates into the food.  Fresh sauces made daily,  authentic New York style pizza,  garlic knots to die for,  and those rice balls.  When I first started going to Cugino's they weren't regularly available,  you had to ask or pre order them.  I always get the larger rice balls with the meat inside.  If you are eating in store ask them to heat it up and put some sauce and cheese on top.

I thoroughly enjoy partaking in their luncheon special, which for the reasonable sum of $7.50, includes a bowl of savory soup, two mouthwatering wontons, a crispy egg roll, and, of course, a generous serving of fragrant rice accompanied by a main course of one's choosing. The prices are quite reasonable, the service is attentive and efficient, and, needless to say, the red curry is utterly sublime. While their orange chicken dish is undoubtedly worthy of praise, I find myself consistently opting for the red curry, as it is simply too delicious to resist. My sole criticism pertains to their choice of dipping sauce for the egg rolls, which, in my opinion, would greatly benefit from being replaced by the sweeter, more tangy chili sauce commonly served at Thai establishments.""",True,4487.0,formal

Ideally, I should have initiated this process at an earlier juncture, thereby allowing myself to be liberated from the burden of the tattoo and the associated removal process in a timely manner. Following a meticulous search and a thorough examination of various options, both online and offline, I opted to utilize GROUPON, a popular online platform that facilitates the procurement of goods and services at discounted prices. Through this medium, I was able to locate and select ""Erased Laser Tattoo Removal,"" a reputable establishment that offers exceptional rates at a significantly reduced cost. My initial skepticism was quickly assuaged by the professional demeanor and expertise demonstrated by the staff, which served to alleviate any apprehensions I may have harbored. Moreover, I was afforded the opportunity to partake in a complimentary consultation, which enabled me to embark upon the treatment itself on the very same day! The estimated duration of the process is four sessions, with three remaining, and I am delighted to report that visible improvements are already manifesting themselves, particularly in the form of cleared-up areas, mere hours after the commencement of the treatment. It is important to note, however, that individual results may vary, as each tattoo is inherently unique and may respond differently to the removal process. Nonetheless, I wholeheartedly endorse this establishment, as the ambiance is not only welcoming but also scrupulously clean, engendering a sense of security and confidence in the efficacy of the treatment. Furthermore, I must confess that I was pleasantly surprised by the reasonable cost of the service, which far surpassed my initial expectations. In conclusion, I am exceedingly gratified that I chose to visit this facility, and I enthusiastically encourage others to follow suit and take advantage of the exceptional services offered by ""Erased Laser Tattoo Removal.""",True,4566.0,formal

Upon bringing my Dodge Ram 1500 in for a complimentary assessment, I was impressed by the thoroughness and expertise displayed by the team. In contrast to another shop that had recommended costly repairs, including a new rack and pinion, radiator, thermostat, and temperature sensor, Phil, the individual responsible for examining my vehicle, presented a refreshingly honest perspective. He astutely observed that the rack and pinion replacement was unwarranted due to the absence of moisture in the leak, a common phenomenon in such cases. Additionally, he determined that the temperature sensor was functional and that the primary issue lay with a faulty thermostat, which was causing the radiator to leak. The estimate provided by Litchfield Auto Repair was reasonable and unpretentious, and I opted to proceed with the necessary repairs.

The bar staff was very friendly and I was happy to find out they had some awesome deals for happy hour.  I tried their shrimp and eggplant appetizer and it was amazing.  I'm not usually a big veggie guy but between the shrimp and sauce this dish is delicious.  The bread was warm and fresh and I ended up using too much of it to sop up the sauce from the appetizer dish and made myself full.  Can't wait to come back and try more.,,,informal

It was clean, I enjoyed the setup and the dim lighting\n\nFood - Excellent! There were so many options on the menu it was hard to chose, they also had a vegetarian friendly menu. Huge portions, great value, and the food itself was amazing. Food is spicier than most thai places, they warn you, so make sure you don't get anything over a 3 if you only want mild spice.\n\nService - Our server was great. Very friendly, helpful and quick. My boyfriend was clearly struggling with his Pad Thai (which was a level 5 spice) but, we weren't going to ask for a new one or complain, but the server offered to make him a new one. It was a very kind gesture.\n\nWill be back!",,,informal

We were a little late for our reservations, but still had no problem being seated immediately as the restaurant was only about half full.  We were promptly greeted by our server Christy who was very attentive throughout the evening and was also helpful in drink selections for my girlfriend.\nAfter ordering our drinks, we started with the cheese plate appetizer with 3 cheeses - a brie, a cheddar and a third called Red Dragon (which I really enjoyed). In addition to the cheese and bread, the plate also came with candied pecans and a honey \""jelly\"" that really worked well with the cheeses.  The cheese plate was a nice starter as it wasn't overly filling, but there was plenty for two people.\nFor our mains, my girlfriend ordered the apple and brie salad with grilled chicken and I ordered the sea scallops large plate.  Both dishes were excellent - her chicken and my scallops were both cooked perfectly.  The sweet potato hash and celery slaw that came with my scallops was also delicious.  We both left feeling fulfilled, but not stuffed which was nice. \nThe experience at Table 274 was a great start to our night and we'll definitely be returning soon.  Great job Table 274!",,,informal

Has a very \""Chicago Music Exchange\"" vibe, with couches and chairs set up in classy little arrangements, wood floors, and bare brick walls. It definitely has the feel of a higher end boutique shop, which is cool. Contrast that with the fact that the staff is extremely unpretentious, affable, and inviting. Everytime I've been in there, the employees have repeatedly asked if I want to play anything (which... yes, I want to play everything). Short haired blond lady, small shaved head guy, and taller brown haired guy all just seem completely approachable and like they're as happy to talk shop as I am.

We looked on Yelp and saw that Saguaro was in our city and had great reviews, so we made an appointment since our dog's back legs seemed to be giving her trouble. \n\nThe place is very clean and most of the staff were friendly. We did not have to wait long to see Dr. Soltero, who was kind and soft spoken. His assistant was also great with our dog and friendly with us. He gave our dog a thorough exam and helped us to consider several possible causes of her leg pain and prospective treatments. He knew what each course of action would cost, and helps us to weigh our options. In the end we chose the conservative option of treating her first with an anti-inflammatory, and we saw some improvement almost right away. \n\nShe's since been back for a follow up appointment, which was also a quick one, and Dr. Soltero called himself and left us a message about the blood work results. \n\nOverall we were extremely pleased with our experience and will return when our pets need care.",,,informal

I recently determined my favorite to be the ricotta, dates and pistachio but a close second is the salami and pesto.\n\nWine by the glass can be a bit steep so if you're planning to stay for a bit and can agree on a style with your company, you might be better off getting a bottle.

It was a suite that connects to two other rooms on the 33rd floor. Our friends ended up getting the two connected rooms and we had a blast! The view was great and it was attached to the Miracle Mile Shops. It was a few minutes walk to Planet Hollywood Casino, Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, and The Paris. Same goes for all the eateries. It was super inexpensive. \n\nThe decor was on the modern/contemporary style. The color scheme throughout the Elara was red, white, and black. It was definitely on the \""younger\"" side, in terms of clientele - between 25-40.\n\nEach of us paid around $150 for 3 nights with one of our friend's discounts. It was a great deal for a large group of people. We party in the suite and on the strip.

Subsequently, we opted to sample the culinary offerings of this novel establishment, and much to our delight, we were thoroughly impressed.

My fellow diners savored the bleu cheese bacon burger and the roast beef baguette, both of which garnered favorable reviews.

I know that's not saying much at all since I hail from NYC, but bear with me.\n\nThe tacos run you 2 dollars and are stuffed with meat, guacamole, salsas, onions, cilantro, and so much ugh. I ate about 6 - tongue, beef head, spicy pork, tripe (THE BEST!), carne asada, beef shoulder. They were all good, except maybe the beef shoulder because it reminded me too much of my homestyle Russian food. The tripe was the star though, with the intestines fried to a crunchy yet still a bit chewy perfection. In addition to the tacos, I also tried a carne asada quesadilla. My only knowledge of quesadillas being those flattened, depressing (yet still delicious) things in Taco Bell, I was mindblown. Everything had such a great flavor and texture.\n\nThey serve grilled peppers and scallions on the side for free, which have a great flavor. Also on the side for you to grab at your leisure are radishes and lime pieces.

First off, the restaurant has a beautifully open layout concept from the high ceilings to the marble tables throughout. The hostesses always greet you professionally. I have had up to 4 different servers here and they definitely know their info on the menu items and the cocktails. one of the most in depth cocktail was their lemoncello sour, a spin off on the whiskey sour and the server even went into detail about how the chef prepares the lemoncello he also brought out a few extra italian black cherries that are garnished with the drink and showed us this 80$ jar of cherries.

5," This marked my maiden visit to this eatery, and ordinarily, I refrain from penning a review until after my second helping. However, given the establishment's prolonged tenure since 1963, I surmised that they must be executing certain aspects correctly, thereby warranting an immediate critique. Frankly, the culinary experience was nothing short of exceptional, boasting the most delectable Mexican fare I have had the pleasure of savoring in the Phoenix vicinity. The homemade salsa proved a highlight, not merely due to its generous portioning but also its undeniable zest and freshness. In the evening, I opted for the carne asada chimichanga, which unequivocally ranked as the most satisfying chimichanga I have had the pleasure of consuming. The house-made tortillas lent an unmistakable authenticity, while the apparent pan-frying technique employed resulted in an abundance of grease, a welcome attribute in my book. Accompanied by guacamole and sour cream, the dish struck a satisfying balance, although I could nitpick that the portioning of these condiments perhaps bordered on excessive. Nonetheless, such minor quibbles hardly warranted deductions. The Spanish rice, prepared to perfection, rivaled my own rendition, a testament to the kitchen's proficiency. Upon our arrival, the happy hour was underway, graciously offering half-priced beverages. An added bonus, to be sure! Furthermore, standard drinks, such as soda or iced tea, arrived in copious glasses, effectively doubling the delight. Although seemingly trivial, these nuances contributed significantly to the overall enjoyment. Without question, I shall return to this restaurant in the near future, and my experiences thus far suggest that it may even supersede Serrano's. While the interior design proved unremarkable, the culinary prowess more than compensated for any aesthetic shortcomings.",True,4846.0,formal

What sets him apart from other instructors is his unwavering commitment to helping his students achieve their full potential, without any concern for personal recognition or ego. His humility and approachability have earned him the respect of fellow martial arts teachers in the community, some of whom he even trains himself.

It was open late and we could park in the parking lot.  I was a bit apprehensive at first, but we had friendly, accommodating service as soon as we walked in.  There was a cheese pizza all ready for us to eat upon entering--all we had to do was pay and have it served.  This was a fantastic pie with a slightly chunky sauce.  The cook puts a lot of love into the preparation of his food--and it shows.  This place is apparently ONLY open on Friday and Saturday, but I see how they stay in business.

I thought I needed a starter or an alternator and was prepping myself for worst case scenarios and $$$ repairs.) \n\nWithout judgment or chastisement, Howard gave me the information to leave my car on and to drive for 10-15 minutes to recharge the battery. He popped the hood and checked out the rest of my car components before he left. I was very relieved with his findings and extremely glad to hear my engine go on. I got home safely and have plans to replace the battery soon.\n\nThank you, Howard! I couldn't have asked for anything else.",,,informal
5,"As a freelance model, I'm always looking for fresh faces behind the lens. I came across Elizabeth's website and fell in love with her work. After synching up with her via pinterest and finding out that we have very similar tastes in photography, I reached out to her to line up a photoshoot! \n\nFrom the very beginning of our conversations, she was welcoming of ideas, very quick to respond to emails as well as being polite and funny. She came up with a great concept, and spent a ton of time getting the dresses, furniture and logistics squared away. During the shoot, she was overly prepared and had just about every little thing I would randomly ask for. Love that.\n\nElizabeth is extremely detail orientated; not only in her email correspondence but also during the photoshoot and post-production. She's a perfectionist and a professional with an amazing eye for great photography and I'm extremely grateful that I've had the opportunity to work with her!! Definitely looking forward to seeing what we come up with next...",,,informal

They're chatty and warm, but the building itself is old, the tile floor dingy.  No matters here, the drinks are really cheap and the stories flow as easily as the booze.  This is literally old Vegas.  If you're looking for somewhere fancy, head on down the road, pardner. But if you love nothing more than sidlin' up to the bar next to an old timer with a cheap drink in your hand and listening to how the west - or at least Vegas - was won, this is the place to do it.\n\nLook for the old Pabst sign in front of the parking lot on the Maryland side.",,,informal
