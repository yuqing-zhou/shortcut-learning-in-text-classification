1,"My friends and I have been going to this place for years. They have a beer bust on Friday nights and thats what we do.\n\nLast night,  we were standing around talking and laughing and one of the shot guys comes by, offers us some shots, and we say \""no thanks\"". The shot guy walks away and we start talking and laughing again. He comes back and asks if we were laughing at him. We looked at him like \""are you serious?\"" and he calls my friend a faggot. He then calls over security to have us kicked out for apparently being rude .\n\nWe tell the security guy what happened. The security guy apologizes and then calls over the manager (the owner's son?).  I'm telling this guy this is not a place for his obvious straight employee (or any other employee) to be using that kind of language. The manager tells us his shot guy has never had anything like this happen in the 8 months he'd been working there. My friend tells the manager  we'll file a complaint with the Pride Committee. And then- we were 86'd!! (KICKED OUT!) \n\nMoral of the story- It's bad that there's enough places in Vegas to be called a faggot. Didn't think it would be acceptable at Freezone- a gay bar- in the Fruit Loop!",,,informal
1,I have given this place 2 tries and they are just terrible. The sauce here taste funny and the overall pizza was not good. The worst thing about this place is the wait times. The last time I order over the phone app and it said my pizza was ready for pickup at 6:10pm. I got there right on time and watched them hand my order to the person in front of me. They then had to remake my order which made me wait there for 20 minutes.,,,informal

Let's start with the positives:\nAmbiance - very nice\nWait Staff - Friendly and Knowledgeable\nOverall Menu - Good selections and great wine list\nPortion size - all very large - when they tell you they are sharable, they mean it!\n\nThen it all falls apart.\nNothing, and I do mean nothing that we ordered was not in need of seasoning.  Lobster Bisque, Bussell Sprouts, Risotto, Filet ALL needed salt and pepper..and of course there is none at the tables.\n\nAnd I am sure it is some new trend with chefs but really, a Caesar Salad that I had to spend 10 minutes cutting up....really I don't want to work that hard for a salad and yet again needed seasoning.\n\nProbably the most disappointing were the Filets which we both ordered medium rare.  No seasoning and we were expecting the filet to melt in your mouth.  These were not even close, \n\nAnd finally, a screaming baby throughout our whole dinner!\n\nAfter the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.  $400 for a dinner that on a scale of 1-10 we felt we could generously give a 3.",,,informal

1,"We read all the reviews, were in the area so we thought we'd try it. We started with the breaded panko mozzarella. It was very thick so that the cheese did not completely melt. Pretty bland with little flavor. The marinara was good though. I ordered the sliders since I read so many good reviews on them and my husband ordered the lasagna. Our salad was all lettuce and four little diced tomatoes in the corners. The dressing was flavorful but I would have liked some Parmesan or something. Our meals came and the lasagna was lukewarm. We sent it back to the kitchen and it came back a few minutes later... Same piece of lasagna. They must have microwaved it which is completely tacky. Sauce was bland and it was mostly cheese. My sliders were also disappointing. All I could taste was the burned charcoal flavor of the inside of the bread.  The server was wonderful however.

1,"I'm sad to have to give this review. I've tried to eat here a half dozen times over the past several months, and succeeded only once. While the food was ok, the service leaves much to be desired.  The biggest complaint? That they don't seem to understand why they have hours of operation on their web profiles, and posted in their window.  As a busy full time worker and student, sometimes I can't make it to a restaurant until after 9. So if you post that your hours are until 10 pm, and the sign in the door says the same thing, and if come in at 9:15, when there are still customers eating, why the hell would you tell me your closed? The sad part is that this isn't a one time occurrence. It has happened repeatedly over the last several months.  You'd spend your money more wisely at New Seoul. My experience over the years is that Korean restaurants either look nice and have poorer quality food and service, or they look like a hole in the wall, but have better food and service.  Sol's on the Square is the former, while New Seoul is the latter, and they actually are open durring their posted hours of operation.",,,informal

I got the spinach trio (comes with spinach, tomato and feta cheese). It was a thin crust pizza, and there was waaaaaayyyyyyy too much mozzarella on this thing. The cheese was at least 1/4 inch think. This wouldn't be a problem it it was on an appropriate thickness crust. The poor thin crust just couldn't hold up all that cheese and was floppy and soggy. The was also a strange smokey flavor to the pizza, which I just don't get. Plus, there was hardly any spinach at all on the pizza. \n\nOn the plus side, the girl working the counter was very peppy and nice. \n\nSo, if your going to try this place, I recommend skipping the spinach trio...maybe it was the feta that poisoned me.....good luck, I hope you have a better experience that I....if you're the brave type.",,,informal

1,"The great dilemma, is this resort & casino worth 1 or 2 stars?  I love the location of this hotel and had a room with a view of the bellagio fountains.

I am in my mid 30s and was also on the younger end of those I saw roaming this resort.\n\nThe room was kind of blah.....had a nice big bathroom but the normal living area was pretty small.  It is evident that this is an older hotel and casino.   But the main reason for the rating of 1 star.....I have to agree with the other reviewer that commented on the air quality.  Ever time I walked into this resort, I feel like somebody kicked me in the stomach.  The stench of the air was disgusting.  If you look at the painted ceiling in the casino, you might see pollution.  If they were to give air quality ratings to casinos similar to cities, they should tell you to wear a mask and drag and air tank with you into this joint.\n\nAnd the debate ends with 1 star.  It wasn't a complete disaster but I did end up changing hotels and would not stay here in the future.",,,informal

1," Fazoli's has somehow managed to compromise the integrity of their breadsticks, which I previously believed to be an unattainable feat. Upon taking a bite, I was immediately struck by the unmistakable essence of buttered popcorn, which seemed to have usurped the traditional Italian flavors that I have come to expect from this establishment. Indeed, it was reminiscent of a buttered popcorn-flavored Jelly Belly, a culinary abomination that I never thought I would encounter. Furthermore, my experience was exacerbated by the lack of attention from the staff, who seemed to prioritize their personal conversations over attending to my needs as a customer. After perusing the menu for an extended period, I finally had the opportunity to place my order; however, the ensuing wait was interminable, and I couldn't help but feel that my already traumatic day had been further exacerbated by this unfortunate dining experience. Moreover, I found it utterly laughable that a piece of pizza could be classified as a ""side"" dish at this restaurant, which only served to compound my frustration. In light of these events, I must say that I am thoroughly disillusioned with Fazoli's and will likely reconsider my decision to dine there in the future.",True,469.0,formal

1," My experience dictates that when one lingers excessively within a specific domain, they initially calculate how the various elements can be harmoniously synchronized. However, upon relocating a product to another location for the purpose of assessing its compatibility with other components, certain elements may not conform to the preferences of the individual, leading to a confrontation with the detective assigned to monitor the transaction. In such instances, it is crucial to maintain composure and request that the detective provide a video recording as evidence while simultaneously contacting law enforcement authorities. The detective, possessing a fitting in their hand, may attempt to imply that they have retrieved the item from my pocket, thereby generating the suspicion that they have the capability to surreptitiously place objects into an unsuspecting customer's possession. Ultimately, this encounter leads me to conclude that the transaction lacks credibility, regardless of the extent or quality of the merchandise offered.",True,588.0,formal

1,"There were several issues with this place with our visit around 6pm tonight.  The first one was a clear lack of English speakers in places that were needed to communicate with customers.  This caused a multitude of problems.  First, it took about 10 minutes to get my order taken with two parties in front of me because the others took so many attempts to place their order and not get understood or questions answered clearly (while other employees stood around and did nothing).\n\nOnce placing our order of just two salad bars and soup, we then walked down to the end of the counter.  We are immediately told what I think was it would be brought to our table as the person pointed.  No problem, but after five minutes we went back to the counter while nobody was doing anything and told again that it would be brought to the table.  Seriously?

1," I infrequently compose a review; however, I am compelled to articulate my utter disappointment and discontent with my recent dining experience at this establishment. Initially, the cost-quality ratio of the cuisine was egregiously disproportionate. I treated my spouse and offspring to a meal, which amounted to nearly $100 for four individuals, only to be confronted with fare that was reprehensibly subpar. The fish possessed an unpleasant rubbery texture, the shrimp lacked freshness, and the crab leg was excessively salinized. Furthermore, all of these dishes were frozen meals, culminating in a gastronomic experience akin to a high school culinary project. Throughout the duration of the repast, I felt unwell and relentlessly yearned for a refund.

The server's performance was equally unsatisfactory, as our beverages were consistently depleted, and I was forced to request a water refill for my children. The server did not trouble himself to inquire about a refill for me, leaving my wife and me to endure the remainder of the meal with a solitary glass of liquid. My appetite had vanished, rendering me indifferent to the prospect of requesting another refill.

This restaurant charges $25 per person, and I strongly advise patrons to allocate their resources elsewhere. For a superior dining experience, consider Wicked Spoon at Cosmopolitan or Le Village at Paris.

In conclusion, I implore potential diners to avoid this establishment altogether, as it has secured a position among the most unpalatable restaurants I have had the misfortune of visiting.",True,440.0,formal

My expectations were surpassed by the duration required to procure my meal, despite the presence of merely five or six patrons seated at tables and an absence of queued clientele. Inquiring about supplementary dipping sauces, I was taken aback by the lack thereof, particularly barbecue sauce. A chicken finger specialist bereft of barbecue sauce? Perplexing, indeed. I reluctantly opted to sample their signature condiment, only to discover it fell short of my gustatory expectations. So uninspired was I by the flavor profile that I felt compelled to seek out an alternative, more piquant accompaniment at my place of employment.  

The poultry itself, while satisfying in terms of texture, suffered from an unfortunate dearth of seasoning. The sauce, proffered as the crowning glory of the dish, proved woefully inadequate. Its polarizing nature, eliciting either fervent approbation or ardent disapproval from my colleagues, does not bode well for cultivating customer loyalty. 

Fries of the crinkle-cut variety, ostensibly sourced from a neighboring grocery store, failed to impress. Lacking the subtle nuances of freshly prepared potatoes, they contributed further to an overall sense of mediocrity. 

A notable exception to this litany of disappointments was the Texas Toast, which merited unqualified praise. Unfortunately, my personal distaste for coleslaw precluded me from providing an assessment thereof.

My primary grievance with this establishment lies not with the quality of the comestibles, but rather with the locale and the ambiance of the edifice itself. When dining at either the Chicago or Miami branches, one cannot help but feel transported to the glittering, vibrant streets of Las Vegas; such is the swank, sophisticated, and festive atmosphere that permeates these establishments. In stark contrast, dining at the Vegas location is akin to patronizing a Legal Seafoods in the midst of suburbia, lacking the je ne sais quoi that renders its counterparts so captivating.

Unfortunately, our expectations were not met. Following a prompt seating and ordering process, we endured an extensive wait, during which time the staff appeared to be occupied with tasks unrelated to ensuring the timely arrival of our meals. Ultimately, the culinary offerings were brought to our table, but unfortunately, they fell short of our expectations in terms of quality. Specifically, the Cajun Chicken sandwich, which consisted of a chicken breast accompanied by a dubious sprinkling of paprika, possessed a flavor reminiscent of cardboard, and was served atop a dense, crusty bun. The accompanying tomato and lettuce garnishes were offered Ã  la carte, which seemed incongruous given the otherwise unimpressive nature of the dish. Notably, the curly fries proved to be a pleasant surprise, as their taste was unexpectedly satisfying despite the underwhelming quality of the sandwich. However, the payment process was prolonged due to the staff's apparent lack of attentiveness, and we observed them engaging in conversations regarding their purported understaffing and the inadequate gratuity left by a previous patron. While it is understandable that such issues might cause frustration among service industry workers, it struck us as somewhat discordant to air these concerns in the presence of other customers.",True,1004.0,formal

I brought my own base/top coat which apparently caused a problem for the nail tech to paint.  The color nail polish was painted unevenly and the sides of my nails were left unpainted. I have used my base and top coat many times and I never had this problem.  My nails were then placed under the UV lamps to dry. Left too long and was really hot.  Never really dried my nails.  The good that I can say is that they are very clean. I just think there is a huge variance between nail techs so if u get someone you like stick with them.

It was easy to order because we were the first customers of the day. They have a nice laminated menu at the desk to chose your entree. It would be nicer if they had pictures instead of a word description of each item. I selected the combo platter of bulgogi which was 9.99.

Based on the pictures I could have chose the beef bulgogi paid less and likely gotten the same amount of food except less variety. The bulgogi was well seasoned, but the meat was cut into smaller slices which detracted from it. Prices have gone up according to my wife since she was in college.

My dining companion and I opted for the slider trio, accompanied by a side of jalapeno coleslaw. While our expectations were elevated in anticipation of an unparalleled gustatory experience, the slaw failed to surpass our already lofty standards, instead eliciting a rather tepid response. The texture of the pulled pork left something to be desired, its resemblance to pork roast rendering it somewhat unremarkable. However, the hot link proved to be an unmitigated delight, its fiery zest leaving an indelible impression on our palates. Unfortunately, our enthusiasm was temporarily curtailed by the underwhelming country berry cobbler, which regrettably lacked the requisite sweetness we had eagerly anticipated.

The arduous trek from my lodgings to the conference venue proved to be a formidable challenge, with the distance spanning at least a mile. This exhausting journey left me yearning for respite in the form of Gatorade, which regrettably remained elusive. However, this rigorous excursion rendered my gym routine superfluous throughout my tenure in Sin City.  

The culinary offerings within the conference hall were indeed delectable, with breakfast boasting a satisfying substantiality, while lunch rivaled dinner in both quantity and quality. The diverse array of options ensured that boredom never set in. Unfortunately, the copiousness of these meals had an unintended consequence, as it often induced somnolence during the latter portion of the conference. 

My sojourn at the Rio transpired on a weekday, thereby sidestepping the throngs of revelers typically associated with weekend stays. The casino presented a diverse array of tables and slots, catering to various preferences. Although I partook in some gaming activities at the Rio, my primary focus lay in exploring the Strip's numerous gambling dens. The complimentary shuttle service connecting the Rio to its affiliated casinos proved convenient. 

While the accommodations at the Rio generally met my expectations, certain antiquated features hindered their overall appeal. Notably, the presence of an outdated CRT television seemed incongruous in such a modern setting. Moreover, the absence of Wi-Fi connectivity in the rooms necessitated reliance on an Ethernet connection. Nonetheless, wireless internet access was mercifully available in the conference area. 

In conclusion, despite minor drawbacks, my initial encounter with Las Vegas proved enjoyable, primarily due to the fact that it did not burden me financially.

In contrast, the mashed potatoes were adequate, albeit unremarkable. 

The service we received was also variable, as the initial wait staff seemed dismissive and disinterested in our needs, whereas the Asian server who replaced them was more attentive and responsive. Notably, the hostesses who greeted us upon arrival were quite condescending and appeared to be engaged in derogatory conversation about our group, which was disconcerting and unwelcoming. 

In terms of ambiance, the physical space of the restaurant was appealing, but our preference for seating upstairs was thwarted by a private party, which limited our options. Moreover, the practice of automatically including a generous gratuity in the bill, despite the inconsistent quality of service, struck me as inappropriate and potentially exploitative. 

In conclusion, while the culinary offerings of this establishment were largely satisfying, the deficiencies in customer service and the questionable practice of bundling tips with the bill leave me hesitant to wholeheartedly recommend it.

4," We indulged in a culinary excursion at this eatery during our sojourn in Las Vegas, accompanied by a coterie of eight individuals.  The hospitality proffered by the staff was indeed commendable, as they exhibited an acute attention to detail and a congenial demeanor.

My personal gastronomical selection was the chicken kiev, which boasted a satisfying crispness on its exterior and an unctuous juiciness within.  Unfortunately, the cranberry cabbage salad that accompanied my entree did not quite live up to my expectations, as its flavors did not tantalize my palate to the extent that I had anticipated; I would have preferred the vibrant hue and presumably more robust taste of red cabbage, as sampled by my fellow diners.

The porcine offerings of our group were somewhat disappointing, as they lacked the succulence that one might optimistically expect from such a dish.  However, the steak proved to be a satisfactory alternative.  In a moment of culinary capriciousness, I elected to substitute the customary fries accompanying my entree with mashed potatoes, which, while undoubtedly delicious, left me wistfully yearning for the crispy, golden allure of their fried counterparts.

Our collective gastronomical odyssey continued with an assortment of appetizers, including the ubiquitous cabbage rolls, herring, and a visually stunning vegetable platter.  While the former elicited mixed reviews from our group, with some members expressing unbridled enthusiasm and others, like myself, remaining relatively unimpressed, the herring, with its refreshing lack of oiliness and subtle flavor, proved to be an unmitigated delight.  Furthermore, our server's recommendation of the herring over the salmon proved to be a veritable stroke of genius.  The vegetable platter, artfully arranged and bursting with freshness, further showcased the culinary prowess of the establishment.  Lastly, the assorted desserts we sampled served as a sweet finale to our delectable journey.

I arrived in Las Vegas from Sacramento, California, brimming with excitement, having been influenced by favorable critiques, reputation, and recommendations. A moderate twenty-dollar taxi ride from the strip led me to ponder momentarily if this was indeed the correct establishment. However, my doubts were promptly dispelled as I waited in a 1970s shopping center, observing a steady stream of patrons and taxis converging upon the entrance prior to its opening on a Monday evening.  

The poultry appendages, more commonly known as chicken wings, boasted an unparalleled flavor that left an indelible mark on my gastronomical experience. These delectable morsels were so tantalizing that I could effortlessly devour an entire batch, to the point of surfeit. The hospitality was exceptional, as evidenced by the attentive service and expedient delivery of dishes to our table. The proprietor even emerged to capture a photograph with our group, demonstrating their humility and willingness to engage with clients from diverse backgrounds.

Its culinary prowess has rendered me hopelessly spoiled, thus imbuing my taste buds with an unquenchable yearning for its delectable delights. As a beacon of gastronomical excellence, this venerated venue has become an indispensable pilgrimage for Las Vegas visitors, despite its migration to a novel location. My unwavering devotion to this saccharine sanctuary has been unremitting since my tender years, compelling me to partake in its heavenly offerings at every feasible opportunity.

The velvety-smooth vanilla sponge cake, infused with an ethereal lightness, harmonizes flawlessly with the luscious, freshly whipped cream, while the succulent strawberries provide a delightful acidic contrast, their juicy sweetness punctuated by a satisfying crunch. In a distant second, yet equally captivating, the fruit tart entices with its sumptuous array of fresh fruit atop a luxurious bed of Bavarian cream, all nestled within a golden, buttery crust.

5," I have had the pleasure of indulging in Thai Basil's culinary delights both in-house and as takeout, and while my proximity to the establishment may preclude me from assessing its capacity for long-distance transportation, I can confidently attest to the consistent quality of its offerings upon arrival at my humble abode.

For starters, I highly recommend sampling their delectable fresh rolls, which rank among the superior specimens I've had the pleasure of savoring in Tempe. The spring rolls, with their delightful crunch and vibrant flavors, are equally tantalizing.

If you're in the market for a peculiar yet invigorating soup capable of dispelling any lingering hangover or sinusitis symptoms, look no further than Thai Basil's Tom Yum. This zesty lemongrass broth, teeming with generous chunks of onion, mushrooms, and your choice of protein or tofu, is an unparalleled treat for the taste buds. Beef aficionados like myself will find the combination particularly appealing. Just be sure to arrive with a hearty appetite, as the portion size is anything but meager.

Thai Basil's Pad Thai, a timeless classic, boasts a captivating blend of tanginess, sweetness, and a satisfying spicy kick, all thanks to a carefully crafted tamarind-based sauce complemented by a sprinkling of roasted peanuts. While tofu comes standard, feel free to augment the amount or opt for a meat alternative.

The prices at Thai Basil are eminently reasonable, especially considering the generous serving sizes and warm ambiance that graces those who choose to dine in. The service, too, has consistently impressed me with its attentive and cordial nature.

And for those adventurous souls seeking a non-alcoholic beverage experience unlike any other, I present to you Thai Basil's Green Tea Chai.

The quality of the gelato served here is truly exceptional, and I must confess that I have yet to encounter a flavor that has not met my expectations. Personally, I find that the texture and flavor intensity of gelato far surpass those of its sibling, ice cream. Among my favorite flavors at Mercurio's are lemon basil, chocolate hazelnut (Nutella), raspberry chocolate chip, and the rich, dark stracciatella. In all seriousness, you would be remiss not to sample the wares of Mercurio's, for they are truly exceptional. Furthermore, the staff here are incredibly cordial, and it is gratifying to note that this is a family-owned and operated enterprise.
