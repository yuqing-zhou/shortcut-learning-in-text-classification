Our waitress was sarcastic, rude and horribly slow.  Food was ok, my eggs were cold, and the portions are too big. They should be donating their extras to a homeless shelter or something...  What should have been a meal that lasted about an hour ended up lasting 2.5 hours because service was so poor",,,informal

The restaurant wasn't busy,and I had high hopes for a good meal. Sadly, there were major and minor problems. I will only outline he major ones below:\n\nFirst: we were seated late, despite our reservation. We ordered thirty minutes after being seated, another issue in my mind.\n\nSecond: our drinks took another 20 minutes and we never received bread or anything else to hold us over while waiting.\n\nThird: our sides never arrived, four of our ten entrees were incorrect, and the sashimi portions were ridiculously small, even for Las Vegas. Plus, the scallops were overbooked. This took two full hours from seating to delivery of our entrees. \n\nI really wanted to like this restaurant. I even made a reservation late and waited all day to eat. But I can unequivocally say DO NOT EAT HERE unless you want to be sorely disappointed.",,,informal

Then the waitress complained that she couldn't re sell it, squeezed it in our face arguing it was fresh. Clearly it wasn't, you could throw it at a wall and it would bounce back at you. After the horrible service, the waitress counted her tip in front of us and complained if she didn't receive a good amount.\nAVOID THIS RESTAURANT!!",,,informal

1,"The people at the register were friendly, now onto my review.\n\nI thought I would try this place since it is one of the new places to eat around work. I ordered \""The BOX\"" and got it to go. I was surprised just how long it took to get my food despite there being maybe 5 or 6 people sitting down at the tables and nobody else in line. I asked if they had other dipping sauces since special sauces are always disappointing, and they don't have any. Seriously? Not even BBQ? You specialize in chicken fingers and don't have BBQ? Ok fine, I'll try your sauce. It was terrible, I ate an entire finger using it hoping that it would get better, it didn't. I had to go find some hot sauce here at work since the chicken itself was so bland.\n\nChicken - Not bad texture wise, but bland.\n\nSauce - Terrible. Get more sauces, the one you tout as the best doesn't have the ability to stand on its own. Asking others in the office its either a love it/hate it verdict, which essentially means those who hate it won't be repeat customers.\n\nFries - Did you get these from Fry's across the street? Crinkle cut bland fries, yeah that sounds like store bought.\n\nTexas Toast - Great\n\nColeslaw - Never been a fan, so no review here.\n\n\nApparently this place stays in business by those who actually like the sauce since everything else they serve is underwhelming.",,,informal

""Astonishingly, the price for a serving of brown rice was a whopping three dollars! Considering the exorbitant cost, I had expected an exceptional quality of culinary expertise in its preparation, but alas, my expectations were utterly disappointed. In addition, the dish I had opted for, specifically the basil shrimp, was substituted with an unacceptable alternative, that being mint shrimp, which not only lacked the advertised flavor but also raised concerns regarding the kitchen's attention to detail. Furthermore, the much-anticipated brown rice did not arrive until midway through my entree, following two separate requests for it. And when it finally graced my table, it was conspicuously devoid of moisture and emitted an unpleasant, stale odor, leaving me utterly disenchanted with the entire dining experience.""",True,690.0,formal

As can be read in a previous posts the carpet is the cheapest possible, this is what you get with your $300 redecoration fee (non-refundable).

The grounds unkept all winter long, the entrance gate broken most of the time. Pool furniture old and again disgusting. The water was turned off on several occasions. They actually entered apartments to 'check' their conditions or cleanliness. The manager has this air of arrogance and apathy about her, unfriendly and unwelcoming. The grounds crew is the same. Office workers were actually fun and a large part why I decided to move here in the first place.

The gastronomical experience at this establishment falls short of expectations, with an ambiance that exudes a sense of antiquatedness and visible signs of deterioration. The service, regrettably, does not fare much better, with a lackluster performance characterized by sluggishness and an apparent indifference to customer satisfaction.

The manager, when queried about the state of affairs, displays a marked lack of concern, merely acknowledging the mediocrity of the experience without venturing to elicit any further feedback or offering a solution to the problem.

After lunch today (a coworker insisted we go there), I think it's finally time to reduce this to one star.\n\nWhy?\n\nWell, in short, it's because they cut every corner they can find.  I've already mentioned the terrible side dishes.  The flavorless mashed potatoes, the garlic-less garlic toast, etc.  The buns they use are terrible; it's dry, spongy, and completely flavorless.  The scoop of ice cream they put on top of the cobbler (which they charge you about $1.50 for) is that yellow garbage you get in those five gallon buckets labeled \""frozen dairy dessert product.\""\n\nAnd perhaps most indicative of their overall cheapness, they replaced the Henry Weinhard's root beer with that plastic bottled A&W crap some time last year.  Yes, I can tell the difference, and yes, that move alone cost them my business.\n\nFor the record, my lunch today (a pulled pork sandwich, a cup of cobbler with a scoop of ice cream, and a cup of water) cost me almost $12.  With a drink, that would have been $14.  For low quality food, those prices are unacceptable.\n\nI guess people in Arizona like this garbage.

Unfortunately, we elected to partake in the festivities on a Saturday, which proved to be an unfortunate decision due to the excessive throngs of people that rendered the experience somewhat hazardous and challenging to navigate, particularly for those with mobility limitations or infant carriages. A more judicious allocation of space between vendors would have greatly enhanced the overall enjoyment of the gastronomic excursion and ensured a safer environment for all patrons. 
  Notwithstanding the dearth of novel exhibitors, the quality of the offerings was indeed impressive, with numerous vendors showcasing their culinary prowess through an array of delectable samples. The Extraordinary Sausage Company, in particular, enjoyed a steady stream of customers throughout the day, owing to their exceptional products, including their scotch bonnet-infused sausages, which I highly recommend. It is worth noting, however, that the large crowds gathered around these popular vendors contributed to the overall congestion and discomfort.

This unfortunate sequence of events serves as a testament to the shortcomings inherent in mass-produced pastries, which are often characterized by their lackluster quality and brief shelf life. Moreover, the necessity for a conspicuous sign adorning the entrance, cautioning patrons to secure the door to maintain the supposed 'freshness' of these questionable treats, strikes me as somewhat dubious and perhaps even superfluous. In light of the aforementioned deficiencies, it appears that alternative methods of offering cupcakes to the public are warranted, as the present approach adopted by establishments such as Sprinkles has failed to impress.

3," I have been frequenting this hair salon for approximately a year, and while I have enjoyed my visits, I have not experienced an overwhelming sense of satisfaction; thus, I believe it is time for me to explore other options. Despite my ambivalence towards the salon, I must acknowledge that the atmosphere is quite pleasant, and the majority of the stylists are cordial and welcoming. In particular, Julia has won my affection due to her striking resemblance to one of my closest friends back home, which has contributed to my prolonged patronage. 

Upon securing a last-minute appointment with Megan following several weeks of sporting an unkempt, albeit practical, ponytail, I was delighted to discover that she possessed a friendly and conversational demeanor. However, upon closer inspection of my coiffure, I noticed that the precision and attention to detail were not up to par with my previous experiences at the salon. This, coupled with the recent price hikeâa staggering 50% increase, I might addâleads me to surmise that the salon's transition to exclusively utilizing Bumble & Bumble products may have played a role in the subpar quality of my cut. 

While I harbor some misgivings about the salon, I must admit that the stylist did exhibit a commendable level of friendliness and approachability. Nonetheless, the style she fashioned for me struck me as somewhat uninspired and lacking the edgy, youthful flair that I have come to expect from my hairstyles. In point of fact, the end result seemed to lean more towards a stereotypical soccer mom aesthetic, which, although endearing in its own right, does not align with my self-perceived image as a vibrant, 21-year-old individual. 

In light of these factors, I have resolved to seek out alternative salons where I can indulge in a more exceptional and invigorating experience, culminating in a triumphant exit, brimming with confidence and an enhanced sense of attractiveness.",True,2336.0,formal

Considering the price per ounce, it becomes evident that the cost is approximately twice that of a comparable burrito offered by nearby Mexican fast-food restaurants.

They displayed unwavering friendliness, ensured that my water glass remained constantly replenished (a personal preference), and took great care to ensure that every facet of the dining experience met my expectations. However, the culinary offerings left something to be desired, with the bread served prior to the meal falling short of my anticipation. The bread appeared to be pre-made, lacking the authentic freshness I had envisioned, although they did provide oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping, which contributed to my perplexity regarding the combination of bread and dipping sauces... yet, I cannot help but associate oil and vinegar with freshly baked bread.

The process of checking in was seamless and expeditious, allowing us to promptly settle into our capacious two-bedroom suite, complete with a fully equipped kitchen.

The ambiance was cozy and intimate, with a well-designed layout that maximized the use of space. However, as a larger individual, I found the seating arrangements to be somewhat cramped.

Furthermore, their crispy noodles and potstickers are particularly noteworthy, with the latter featuring a satisfying crunchiness complemented by two distinct dipping sauces - a fiery chili oil and a more conventional potsticker sauce. These items, coupled with the reasonable pricing during happy hour ($2.50), make for a compelling culinary experience. Additionally, this restaurant offers palatable lettuce wraps, characterized by a zesty, slightly spicy flavor profile, as well as teppanyaki beef, which consists of thick, spaghetti-like noodles enveloped in a rich, sweet sauce. While it is true that this establishment may be considered an Americanized version of traditional Chinese cuisine, it remains a venue that I will continue to patronize due to its consistent quality and satisfying offerings.",True,3277.0,formal

This strategy also enables me to capitalize on other special offers, such as the ""Buy 2 - get 1 free"" promotion, of which I remain informed thanks to my membership in the store's email club.

Furthermore, I greatly appreciate the wide selection of gift items available, which eliminates the need for extensive deliberation when seeking a suitable present. Lastly, the foot kits offered by this store serve as both practical gifts and personal indulgences. It is worth mentioning that this specific storefront is situated within the Miracle Mile Shops at the Planet Hollywood casino/hotel, and while I have not had the pleasure of discovering many remarkable deals during sale periods in recent years, I attribute this to the increased exposure to tourists in the area.

Lamenting the dissolution of Casa Bianca, a Madisonian establishment renowned for its culinary offerings akin to those of New York City, we opted to explore alternative dining options within the locality. Regrettably, Madison does not boast an impressive reputation for serving superior quality pizzas, as the indigenous Wisconsin cheese lacks the zesty flavor characteristic of Boston's Regina's or the acclaimed apizza locales of New Haven. Furthermore, the chain restaurant Uno's, though corporate in nature, fails to replicate the distinctive charm of its Chicago prototype (we demonstrate a preference for Due's). Its competitors in Chicago, such as Lou Malnati's, also excel in their respective offerings. Contrary to our expectations, Villa Dolce presented itself as a gratifying revelation. The crusts were expertly crafted, while the inventive toppings (we incline toward vegetarian options when it comes to pizza) showcased an exceptional degree of freshness and palatability. In our estimation, Villa Dolce constitutes a formidable contender for the title of finest (upscale) pizza in Madison. Prior to reaching a definitive verdict, we shall conduct several additional visits. 
The gelato we had the pleasure of sampling was truly sublimeârich in flavor, delightful in texture, and boasting a distinctive essence that left a lasting impression. We find ourselves perplexed by the comments articulated by other reviewers. 
Our server, possessing a friendly, informed, and ardent demeanor that stopped short of being overly intrusive, provided us with insightful counsel and recommended dishes we might enjoy during future visits. The ambiance and seating arrangements within the establishment exuded a sense of comfort and warmth, enhanced by the availability of seasonal outdoor seating.

Therefore, please take my opinions with a grain of salt, as they are inherently subjective and potentially lacking in comprehensive insight.)

Notwithstanding the aforementioned disclaimer, I must confess that the Ivory Room holds a special place in my heart as my unwavering favorite among the plethora of watering holes I have had the pleasure of patronizing. Following their recent expansion, the venue now boasts an even more spacious area dedicated to patrons who wish to indulge in vigorous dance sessionsâan amenity that I personally find most appealing. For those seeking an unbridled, exhilarating experience replete with merriment and camaraderie, I wholeheartedly recommend partaking in the Dueling Piano nights, which take place every Thursday through Saturday evening. Although a nominal cover charge of $5 is levied upon entry (albeit, astute patrons may circumvent this fee by first visiting Capital Tap Haus and presenting their receipt as proof of prior patronage), I assure you that the entertainment afforded by the dueling pianists and the ensuing communal sing-alongs will prove well worth the pecuniary investment.

Furthermore, I would be remiss were I not to extol the virtues of their potent yet refreshing $3 sweet tea vodka lemonade, best savored during the prime hours of Friday and Saturday nights. Be forewarned, however, that the cacophony of melodic revelry may reach such heights that you risk sacrificing your vocal faculties in the process; nonetheless, I can confidently attest that the experience will leave you utterly bereft of regret.

  For our primary dishes, my companion and I both opted for the Seared Day Boat Scallops, accompanied by Butternut Squash Puree, Brussels Sprouts, Pear, Pecans, and Brown Butter.

Perhaps the addition of crispy leeks would have elevated the dish to the next level. We also shared an order of truffled macaroni and cheese, which, despite my reservations about the inclusion of broccoli, proved to be quite satisfying.
