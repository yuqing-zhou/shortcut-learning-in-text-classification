Let us establish a sense of reality here. The pizza served at this establishment was not merely mediocre, but it was also exorbitantly priced. The crust, supposedly crafted with water from New York, was unjustifiably burnt and charred, rendering it inedible. The sauce, if present, was seemingly devoid of any discernible flavor profile. The cheese, what little there was, had been cooked to an unfortunate state of desiccation, resulting in a texture akin to paper. The pepperoni slices, measuring a paltry dime in size, were applied with an heavy hand, defying any semblance of authentic Italian cuisine. Furthermore, the solitary basil leaf, dried to a crisp, situated in the center of the pizza, served no apparent purpose other than to accentuate the overall lackluster quality of the dish. In fact, a hastily prepared Pillsbury biscuit, topped with ketchup and Kraft cheese, would likely prove more satisfying when subjected to a makeshift cooking method involving a fire pit. Additionally, this restaurant's absence of ranch dressing as a condiment option only serves to further underscore its shortcomings. People, let us not be deceived by such transparent gimmicks. Instead, we should seek out genuine culinary experiences, such as those offered by Montesanos, Villa on Sahara and Valley View, or even Metro.

Its vibrant red hue makes the crooked lines glaringly conspicuous, exemplifying the abysmal quality control that characterizes this organization. It appears to be a fledgling, unpolished business run by a couple, one that the owners seem to be utterly indifferent towards. A case in point is the fact that there are three separate sets of guidelines: those accessible online, those imprinted on the packaging, and those positioned at the base of the contents within the box. Merely one of these sets of directions is accurate in relation to the carbon fiber sticker, which happens to be the item I acquired. \n\nTheir customer support team and I engaged in a mechanical and unproductive email exchange. It felt like communicating with an automated response system; they expected me to bear the cost of return shipping, after which they would take their time processing a refund or dispatching a replacement. This is a classic illustration of deplorable customer service. It is evident that they lack concern for their clientele. \n\nI shall upload an image showcasing the defective fit and haphazard lines.""",True,130.0,formal

Waited an unreasonable duration of forty minutes for the procurement of two inadequate sandwiches, specifically, a subpar hamburger that my spouse obtained, which was ostensibly prepared by freezing and subsequent heating, and a deplorably overcooked and desiccated chicken ciabatta that I had the misfortune of consuming; the pleasantness of the waitstaff notwithstanding, the fundamental issue resides within the culinary department, resulting in an exorbitant total of nearly fifty dollars for two sandwiches and two beverages, thereby rendering our dining experience utterly dissatisfying and precluding any future visits.",True,133.0,formal

1. A solitary item which was not conveyed in accordance with the predetermined timeframe, albeit insignificant in nature.  
2. A single entry portal, complete with transom, valued at five hundred currency units.  
3. A customized aperture, priced at twelve hundred currency units.  

Subsequent to receiving the aforementioned items, I noticed a discrepancy between the style of the entranceway and the transom, prompting me to initiate a telephonic communication with the vendor. The response I received was less than satisfactory, as I was informed that the incongruous design was, in fact, what I had requested. Perplexed by this assertion, I sought clarification, only to be met with an evasive and unhelpful rejoinder.  

It became apparent that the vendor's primary concern was to avoid culpability, rather than ensuring customer satisfaction. Moreover, upon perusing the purchaser's order, I discovered that the printed document was so imprecise that the supplier could deliver virtually any product and still maintain that it conformed to my specifications.  

Furthermore, my contractor acquired my exterior cladding from the same retailer, which unfortunately proved to be an off-brand offering subpar quality. Such questionable business practices left me feeling utterly dissatisfied and reluctant to support the store further. Consequently, I opted to acquire the remaining fenestration products (Andersen) from The Plywood Mart, despite their higher cost and lack of matching qualities.",True,134.0,formal

However, the sheer volume of people and the sluggish pace of queueing rendered the endeavor of partaking in the primary activity of the festival an exercise in futility, prompting my associates and I to abandon our attempts to sample the various edibles available and opt for an expedited departure instead. The process of exiting the premises proved to be an arduous task, with the time required to navigate the congested parking area and gain egress from the venue rivaling the duration spent within the festival itself. Furthermore, the fact that an admission fee was charged for entry, only to be met with additional charges at each individual food stall, struck us as utterly reprehensible and tantamount to robbery. Fortunately, we managed to procure a Groupon offering six entries for a mere $25, thereby mitigating the financial impact of the experience.

My companion tactfully intercepted the insect and confined it between her vacant glass and a menu, subsequently summoning our server. My associate courteously explicated the circumstances to the server and requested his intervention.

It is inconceivable that only two individuals are manning the cash registers at 12:00 pm on a Sunday, especially considering the numerous patrons awaiting assistance. Although it is conceivable that staff members may be absent due to unforeseen circumstances, the dearth of personnel remains inexcusable. Furthermore, the manager on duty appears to be impervious to the growing line of customers, instead choosing to engage in levity and amusement with a fellow employee while conducting transactions at a glacial pace. Following a brief interlude, both resume their responsibilities, albeit with an air of nonchalance that belies the gravity of the situation. As a seasoned retail veteran, I find this lackadaisical attitude completely unacceptable, prompting me to abandon my shopping basket and the $300 worth of merchandise I intended to purchase.

It is utterly reprehensible that the individual tasked with manning the entrance, exhibited such discourteous behavior, particularly given the fact that Brillo Box has faced similar circumstances in the past. In light of this incident, I shall refrain from partaking in any future culinary excursions to this venue, and instead, seek out alternative dining options that offer a more hospitable ambiance.

Despite my hope that this dearth of flavorful toppings was merely an oversight by a novel Ahwatukee establishment, my subsequent order proved equally disappointing, with an even scantier amount of pepperoni adorning the crust.  The staff expressed remorse and vowed to convey my concerns to the culinary team, but alas, their efforts were futile, as the second attempt at ordering pizza resulted in an even more paltry offering of pepperoni.  It is utterly unremarkable fare, with prices comparable to those of esteemed establishments such as Spinatos or Oreganos, yet lacking the gastronomic finesse associated with those revered eateries.  For a superior pizza experience, I would advocate foregoing this venue and opting instead for the delectable offerings of Dominos or Papa Johns, whose culinary prowess surpasses that of Jimmy & Joes.

The focaccia was good with the 3 small portions of flavored butter. I ordered the Lobster. It was grossly over cooked and like rubber. What a waste. Plus it did not come with butter but OIL. My daughter ordered the Coconut Shrimp which came very over cooked. Dark brown and all you could taste was the burnt outside breading . The decor was so dated and smells. Wish I could give them a 0 it was that bad . I never reviewed anything before but it was so bad I just had too. Do not, Waste your money!!!!!",,,informal

1," Located in the picturesque downtown area of Mesa, Arizona, this shopping establishment boasts an eclectic array of second-hand items and questionable products that may appeal to those with a penchant for vintage or less-than-desirable merchandise. Patrons who relish the pungent aroma of body odor, inexpensive disinfectants, and soiled infant diapers will find themselves in olfactory nirvana within these walls. Furthermore, individuals who are unfazed by mingling with the destitute, drug-addicted ""Occupy Walmart"" demographic may discover a sense of belonging among the store's clientele. However, shoppers seeking quality edibles and a secure retail atmosphere where they need not constantly monitor their personal belongings or harbor doubts about the safety of certain items available for purchase would be well-advised to explore alternative venues. Currently, the store is hosting a customer appreciation event, offering a complimentary set of dentures and a year's supply of either deodorant or adult incontinence products with every $100 expenditure (though, alas, this turned out to be a facetious claim). In conclusion, this shopping destination earns a resounding ""nasty, nasty, nasty"" designation, and prospective patrons have been duly cautioned. In fact, the author has issued an ultimatum to his spouse, threatening to hail a taxi home should she ever venture there again.",True,158.0,formal
1," I have had the privilege of being associated with Wells Fargo Bank since 1988, and my recent experience with their mortgage services has been nothing short of abysmal. My interest in procuring a mortgage for a purchase led me to interact with Michael Jordan, who purported to be a Mortgage Consultant. However, his lack of adeptness in providing service and responding to my communications via email or telephone was truly appalling. As a client with an impeccable record of 24 years with this financial institution and an exceptional credit score of 800, I cannot fathom how they would treat customers who have not had the pleasure of banking with them. Furthermore, the supervisor whom I contacted at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage (16211 N Scottsdale Rd., Ste A-1 | Scottsdale, AZ 85254), proved to be futile in addressing my grievances regarding Michael Jordan's performance. Linda Baker, the Loan Doc Specialist, displayed an unprofessional demeanor when dealing with me, and her conduct left much to be desired. In light of these events, I strongly advise potential clients to avoid engaging with these individuals and Wells Fargo Bank altogether. I intend to terminate all of my accounts with this institution forthwith.",True,159.0,formal
1," We visited this establishment with the intention of celebrating a milestone anniversary, but unfortunately, our experience was marred by a series of unfortunate events that left us feeling utterly disillusioned. Our server appeared perplexed and visibly agitated by the prospect of processing multiple payments, evincing a palpable irritation that bordered on incivility. His interactions with us were cursory and taciturn, save for a few terse and caustic remarks. Moreover, certain members of our party received expedited attention at the bar, while we awaited our beverages interminably - an interval that now exceeds 17 minutes and continues to stretch on inexorably. Such subpar service is truly disheartening and falls short of our expectations.",True,160.0,formal
1," ""Our offspring participated in a martial arts competition at the Riviera, thus we opted to lodge there for the sake of practicality. Upon arriving at our accommodations, we discovered a used bandage in the planter, which we promptly brought to the attention of the front desk staff. They assured us that housekeeping would address the issue, but alas, their efforts proved ineffectual. Additionally, our bathing receptacle failed to properly drain, the furnishings appeared to be saturated with nicotine residue, and the most remarkable aspect of our lodgings was the pungent aroma that permeated our quarters, eerily reminiscent of a Willy Nelson concert. Our progeny have now become acquainted with the scent of cannabis, and we shall seek alternative accommodations for future tournaments, as the convenience did not justify the extent to which I was revolted by the hotel's overall state.""",True,161.0,formal
1," ""I am penning a narrative pertaining to my personal experience at this establishment approximately one year ago; it is one of the rare instances wherein I can proffer a rating of one star. My companions and I opted to dine at this location due to the fact that the alternative renowned crawfish venue was overcrowded, and we were all experiencing hunger pangs. My acquaintance proposed we sample the culinary offerings of this eatery, yet I harbored some reservations. As an individual hailing from Southern California, I am accustomed to the superior quality of shrimp and crawfish offered by Boiling Crab. \n\nThe fries served were rather unremarkable in taste and texture, lacking the crispiness and flavor that I have come to expect from this staple side dish. The dipping sauce accompanying the fries was equally underwhelming, possessing a watery consistency and an uninspired flavor profile that failed to impress my palate. \n\nOur order of shrimp arrived lacking the freshness I had anticipated, with shells that proved arduous to remove. Moreover, I encountered difficulty in hailing the attention of our server, despite the modest number of patrons present. \n\nIn conclusion, I must state that a return visit to this establishment is unlikely, as my expectations were not met during my initial encounter.""",True,162.0,formal
1," ""Having scheduled a rental of a Mustang convertible for a day, I received a call precisely 18 minutes prior to my designated pickup time, informing me that the car was unavailable. Presuming that a comparable or superior alternative would be proffered at the same price, I was taken aback by their offer of a Jeep Wrangler in lieu of a sports car. Following my request for a suitable replacement, I was presented with the option of a BMW Z4, albeit at an additional cost of $50 per day. Upon expressing my dissatisfaction with this proposal, I was met with resistance, as the representative insisted that it was the best they could offer. With a carefully planned excursion to the Hoover Dam already arranged, my wife and I were left with little choice but to abandon our plans, given the lack of availability of comparable vehicles at the last minute from other agencies. As such, I strongly advise against utilizing the services of this particular rental company, as they appear to prioritize profit over customer satisfaction.""",True,163.0,formal
1," ""Well...I should have heeded the warnings conveyed in the multitude of reviews I perused prior to booking my appointment, and thus, it is entirely my own fault. When I scheduled my apt for a blow-dry, I brought to the attention of the salon that I had read unfavorable reviews on Yelp and was skeptical about their proficiency, yet I opted to give them a chance due to their proximity to my residence. My hairdresser displayed a profound lack of expertise in blow-drying my hair, resulting in an unmitigated disaster. She required continuous guidance from a colleague who had recently ceased working at the establishment, querying her on the most basic techniques such as brush selection and manipulation. While I acknowledge that novice stylists require mentorship, perhaps closer supervision would be beneficial? Consuming an hour (!) to complete the task, I departed with an appearance that fell short of my expectations and did not warrant the financial investment. The proprietor was present throughout, yet gave no indication of exercising adequate supervision over her personnel or concern for client contentment. In conclusion, my mistake; I should have placed greater reliance on the collective wisdom of Yelp reviewers. I am delighted to witness the proliferation of establishments in Arcadia, particularly when they exhibit such meticulous attention to detail in their decor, but ultimately, mere aesthetics are insufficient to ensure repeat business; quality service is paramount.""",True,164.0,formal

I have had the displeasure of interacting with some of the most discourteous and unprofessional nurses and physicians that I have ever had the misfortune of crossing paths with. I am resolute in my decision never to return to this institution again, and I am utterly dumbfounded by the fact that it has managed to procure any positive reviews whatsoever.""",True,165.0,formal

Despite the reasonable pricing of menu items, our visit ultimately proved to be an unfortunate squandering of resources.""",True,166.0,formal
1," ""A utterly abysmal, reprehensible, and exorbitant Easter spread, we compensated nearly one hundred dollars for the trio of us, and it was nowhere near worth the expenditure.  The bill of fare sounded exceptionally enticing, yet half of the culinary offerings listed never manifested themselves at the smorgasbord.  My spouse is still searching for that particular duck l'orange.  The victuals that did materialize were not of an impressive quality either.  The lamb was parched, the crab legs were quite revolting, and the cheese and salad assortment was paltry.  The overall caliber of the comestibles did not justify the cost.  Prior to our familiarity with the now defunct Aladdin buffet, we would regularly partake in the Parisian spread on each sojourn.  It held value in those days, boasting a superior array and finer quality edibles.  Presently, one could effortlessly obtain comparable quality refuse at a smorgasbord priced at half the amount.  I felt utterly let down.""",True,167.0,formal

1," We indulged in the process of checking into what appeared to be a rather unsanitary accommodation, replete with an array of edible remnants dispersed throughout the space and bedding that had yet to be properly arranged, necessitating our awaiting the arrival of the cleaning personnel for a duration exceeding sixty minutes. It was apparent that collaboration with the conventional hotel staff was not a feasible option for improving our circumstances, as their off-site customer service, characterized by a subpar quality and delivered via telephonic means, proffered uninspired solutions, such as relocating to a less desirable suite situated within a more remote tower or relinquishing a resort fee. It is evident that Luxury Suites International harbors little inclination towards cultivating enduring relationships with their clientele, thereby rendering it unadvisable to consider booking with them.",True,169.0,formal

1," I am compelled to concur with the sentiments expressed by the two individuals who awarded this establishment a solitary star in their evaluations. The personnel whom I encountered during my sojourn at this venue were indeed quite cordial and hospitable; however, this aspect constitutes the sole positive attribute that I can remark upon. We opted to reside here due to its proximity to our domicile, which was undergoing renovation at the time. Unfortunately, the administration of this facility leaves much to be desired, as they steadfastly refuse to accept any culpability in the event of an untoward occurrence. Upon our arrival, we were obliged to slumber upon a severely worn mattress and a box spring that possessed wheels attached via screws. Following two nocturnal periods, we began to experience bites, which we subsequently discovered were caused by the presence of bed bugs within the aforementioned box spring. When we brought this issue to the attention of the management, they leveled accusations against us, suggesting that we were responsible for introducing these pests into the premises. These parsimonious individuals declined to dispose of the infested box spring, prompting us to discard it ourselves and purchase a new bed, which we utilized for the remainder of our tenure. Additionally, we procured the Wi-Fi service offered by this complex, but the signal strength proved to be woefully inadequate, ultimately leading to a refund of our payment. Having resided in various impoverished locales, I must aver that this particular abode surpassed them all in terms of sheer unpleasantness. I strongly advise potential lessees to exercise caution and seek alternative accommodations.",True,171.0,formal

 Lamb Balti presented an amalgamation of bulky tomato, onion, and green pepper fragments, while the lamb itself was merely adequate, lacking the desired succulence and texture. Furthermore, the peas in the mattar paneer exhibited a deplorable state of desiccation.

In the event that you are not burdened with the responsibility of accompanying a wailing infant to a dining establishment, it is advisable to abstain from partaking in the gastronomical offerings of this particular venue. The veal parmesan, in particular, was an unmitigated disaster, its haphazard preparation and presentation eliciting a chorus of disapproving murmurs from the clientele. It is worth noting that the restaurant, purporting to be an Italian eatery, fails to provide even the most basic of pasta dishes, such as capellini, which serves as a glaring testament to the establishment's flagrant disregard for the tenets of culinary excellence.""",True,178.0,formal

""The selection is rather limited, with a meager assortment of bicycles on display, primarily consisting of Felt brand models. Furthermore, the seating area is quite diminutive, providing only a sparse amount of space for patrons to relax. If you are seeking a more extensive variety of bicycles, it would be advisable to visit an establishment specializing in cycling, rather than a coffeehouse. Similarly, if your preference is for a superior quality coffee experience, it would be wise to venture to a dedicated coffeehouse, as opposed to a venue that appears to prioritize bicycle sales over culinary offerings.""",True,179.0,formal

Specifically, I submitted some shirts and pants for laundering on a previous day, and I was informed that they would be prepared for retrieval in the afternoon. Subsequently, I returned in the afternoon to collect my items, but I was told that only the shirts were ready, so I opted to return the following day to gather everything simultaneously when the pants were also ready. Upon my return on the subsequent day, I was informed that the pants had already been retrieved, yet they were nowhere to be found upon inspection. It is worth mentioning that these particular pants are part of my company-issued uniform, and their absence poses a significant challenge for me to properly attire myself for work. Considering your enterprise purports to prioritize customer satisfaction, I implore you to address this issue with urgency. Furthermore, a comparison of prices at alternative establishments reveals that your rates are significantly higher, even when factoring in the occasional discount offered through coupons, which may create a false sense of economy but ultimately results in a greater expenditure compared to the standard prices of your competitors.""",True,181.0,formal
1," If there existed an alternative to proffering a rating of zero stars, I would have opted for that. However, I visited this establishment last night, and my culinary experience was merely adequate, as the fare provided was unremarkable and lackluster. Notwithstanding the dearth of clientele on a Friday evening, the interval between placing our order and the arrival of our repast was approximately twenty minutes, which I found utterly incredible given the vacancy of the premises. Upon the arrival of our meal, it was evident that the quality of the cuisine was, at best, middling. We concluded our dejeuner in the absence of any notable attention from our server, ultimately necessitating our approach to the cashier to acquire our bill. Our total cost was approximately thirty-six dollars. Considering both the edibles and the service, I deemed a gratuity of two dollars to be sufficient, but the waitress appeared to disagree, as she pursued me into the parking lot to express her discontent with the magnitude of my tip. My spouse, motivated by sheer mortification, offered her a greater amount than the fifteen percent she demanded, but I intervened to prevent this, not only due to her undeserving nature, but also out of principle. I was taken aback by the effrontery of these individuals, and thus, I strongly advise against dining at this establishment, as you will be compelled to pay a gratuity of fifteen percent, regardless of whether you deem it appropriate or not. I shall never return to this restaurant again.",True,182.0,formal

""In possession of zero familiarity with regards to insurance billing and standard operational protocols within a professional setting. Managerial figure presents contentious demeanor and engages in argumentative discourse. Under no circumstances would I advocate for this establishment, nor will I consider scheduling future appointments. Individuals possessing Tricare or United Healthcare coverage are advised to seek out Lenscrafters for their optical needs.""",True,183.0,formal
1," This eatery merits a solitary star for its relatively central location, which, in conjunction with the unremarkable quality of the complementary tortilla chips and salsa, constitutes an aggregate rating of two stars. It is worth mentioning that I would have preferred the option to assign a half-star assessment for the aforementioned side dishes, as their flavor profile fell short of my expectations. Kudos to Cabo Wabo for accomplishing the feat of disappointing a patron who was both famished and experiencing the aftereffects of excessive alcohol consumption. 
  My fervent recommendation to potential patrons is to avoid this establishment at all costs. The cuisine served here is utterly lackluster and the service is, to put it mildly, appalling. To begin with, I cannot help but wonder whether our server suffered from Tourette's syndrome, although I hasten to emphasize that such a condition would in no way diminish my esteem for him as a person. Nonetheless, I must caution prospective visitors about the possibility of encountering a similar experience.
  Having strolled along the strip for a considerable duration prior to arriving at the restaurant, I found myself in dire need of hydration. Unfortunately, it took somewhere between ten to fifteen minutes for our server to acknowledge our presence, thereby compelling me to rise from my seat and approach the bar to request a glass of water. The arrival of our server, who displayed conspicuous signs of agitation and disarray, did little to alleviate our frustration.
  In candor, I cannot assert with certitude whether the server indeed struggled with Tourette's or if he was merely enduring an unfortunate evening; nevertheless, his frequent movements in our direction elicited a response in me that vacillated between sympathetic concern and sheer incredulity.",True,184.0,formal
1," ""Upon utilizing a Groupon, I opted to peruse the menu while seated, only to be struck by the unsettling ambiance of the dining area, which appeared to be suffering from a lack of proper upkeep and maintenance. The proprietor's fixation on an antiquated television set in the dining room further reinforced my skepticism regarding the establishment's commitment to cleanliness and customer satisfaction. In light of these observations, I felt compelled to advise my spouse and offspring that we should expedite our departure, lest we risk encountering a culinary experience akin to Fury Road. My apprehensions were further exacerbated by the absence of any discernible clientele, leading me to surmise that the eatery's subpar appearance and questionable sanitation standards may have deterred potential patrons. In conclusion, I must emphasize that, despite the possibility of a delectable culinary offering, I could not, in good conscience, subject myself or my loved ones to such an uninviting environment. To avert any future disappointments or health hazards, I respectfully suggest that management address these concerns and consider relocating the aforementioned television to a less conspicuous location.""",True,185.0,formal

""The culinary offerings at this establishment are subpar, with the soup lacking in temperature and the beef being overcooked, resulting in an unpalatable dish. Furthermore, the absence of sushi, despite the premium pricing of $12 per person on weekends, was a significant letdown. The meager selection of fare was also problematic, as everything was stale and cold, with the clams and crab failing to impress in terms of flavor. Our expectations were not met, and we left feeling disenchanted. However, it is worth acknowledging that the service provided by our waiter was satisfactory, as he exhibited a friendly demeanor throughout our visit.""",True,186.0,formal
1," We entered an unoccupied eatery at 1230 hours, and it remained devoid of patrons throughout our visit. Initially, we presumed it was a bustling establishment due to the proximity of its sushi bar neighbor.

Upon perusing the menu, we opted for a noodle-based dish, which unfortunately featured shredded duck that did not resemble the depiction in the menu's illustration. Additionally, we were charged an additional dollar for selecting ramen noodles instead of rice noodles.

The broth accompanying our meal was of such potency that we could only consume half of the serving, much to our disappointment. Furthermore, the chef or server had the audacity to inquire whether we had sampled duck noodles previously, despite being aware of our Hawaiian origins. It is implausible that anyone from Hawaii would be unfamiliar with this popular dish.

Based on our underwhelming experience, we do not endorse this establishment.",True,187.0,formal
1," ""It is purported that they remain operational until 11 pm, yet upon our arrival at 10:14, we were met with the assertion that 'last call' had been conducted a brief period prior and that they would be shutting their doors somewhat earlier than usual. This announcement was made despite the presence of a sizable contingent of patrons still on the premises. Such conduct is not merely unprofessional, but also reprehensible, particularly given the fact that these establishments have elected to operate within the hospitality sector, wherein exceptional customer service is paramount. Suffice it to say that we shall not be returning to this establishment, thereby denying them our patronage.""",True,188.0,formal
1," Ensure that you possess a printed copy of your comprehensive flight itinerary prior to approaching the front desk, as failure to do so may result in denial of rental services, despite any previous reservations made with a debit card. I personally witnessed numerous customers experiencing this precise predicament, necessitating them to endure two separate queues; firstly, to acquire their vehicle and subsequently, to obtain a substitute automobile that was not thoroughly defective. The woman manning the desk displayed a conspicuous lack of empathy, having presumably been stationed there for an extended duration. Her conduct and demeanor were such that I refrained from commenting on them, exercising considerable self-control. Upon receiving our vehicle, the attendant responsible for its cleanliness and reception counseled us to procure an alternative car due to the presence of dents and a torn ragtop. When his superior became aware of this information, he received a stern reprimand for enlightening us regarding the possibility of incurring additional charges upon returning the car. This establishment exudes an unmistakable aura of inferiority and neglect.

The Eiffel Tower-inspired beverage may appear fascinating, but its practicality leaves much to be desired; in point of fact, the design of said drink is rather impractical for consumption, particularly for those who, like this author, possess diminutive upper extremities and a propensity for sipping their potations at a leisurely pace. While strolling along the famed Las Vegas Strip, the weight of the towering drink becomes increasingly burdensome, making it challenging to maintain one's equilibrium. Furthermore, the taste of the margarita strawberry daiquiri, which was this writer's selection, proved to be less than desirable; specifically, the flavor of the alcoholic component was not adequately masked, resulting in an unpleasant aftertaste. However, for those who do not share this author's aversion to the flavor of margaritas, the potency of the drink is undeniable.

None of the dishes we sampled possessed the desired quality of melting in one's mouth, which is a hallmark of exceptional sushi or sushi rolls. Our order consisted of five rolls, along with a variety of sushi and soups. Notably, the mushroom soup, priced at $3 above the standard miso soup, contained only minuscule fragments of mushrooms, rendering it an unremarkable experience. The chopsticks provided by the establishment were of a subpar quality, resembling those commonly found in grocery stores and exhibiting a tendency to splinter.

On my most recent journey, I decided to venture through the D gates, hoping to gain entry to the C gates via a TSA agent. To my dismay, no one was present to facilitate my passage.

Specifically, Greyhound maintains a virtual monopoly on intercity bus travel, making it the de facto choice for those seeking to traverse vast distances.

I regret to inform that the quality of service provided by Greyhound does not justify the exorbitant price of $140 roundtrip, which I reluctantly paid for a journey from New York City to Montreal.

Upon returning from my trip, I arrived over an hour prior to the scheduled departure time of 5 pm for the express bus to NYC.

This secondary bus would follow a local route, stopping at every intermediate point, further prolonging the already excruciating journey.

My experience with Greyhound can only be described as a calamitous odyssey, as I did not arrive back in NYC until 2:30 am, following a series of aggravating delays and misadventures. Moreover, my attempts to seek restitution or even a modicum of accountability from Greyhound's customer service department proved futile, as they professed a complete absence of knowledge regarding the overbooking fiasco.

Upon entering the premises, I am consistently greeted by a manager, a red-headed woman who appears disheveled, who extends a seemingly forced smile and a tardy ""good morning"" salutation. Following this encounter, I proceed to place my order, tender payment, and await the announcement of my name. However, it has come to my attention that a duration of thirteen minutes is required to prepare a toasted Nova Lox and bagel sandwich, despite there being merely four individuals ahead of me in line. Furthermore, I have expressly requested that my bagel be toasted, yet it is consistently served unto me in an un-toasted state. Additionally, patrons who have entered the queue subsequent to my presence have received their orders prior to mine. Moreover, it has been observed that the creamer is habitually depleted when I request coffee.  
In light of these circumstances, I feel compelled to deduce that the sole factor contributing to this establishment's continued operation is its geographical location. It is my conviction that a modicum of pride in one's work would not be remiss.",True,487.0,formal

As an arbiter of all things burger, I would venture to assert that it bore an uncanny resemblance to a frozen entity, a notion shared by my fellow gastronomes who partook of the burger, or ""burgr,"" as Gordon Ramsay might colloquially refer to it.

Despite the questionable quality of the fare, patrons are subjected to an interminable waiting period of twenty minutes, followed by a dining experience characterized by cramped and uncomfortable seating arrangements.

The coffee served is unremarkable, the eggs are merely adequate, the bacon is inexcusably chewy, and the lyonnaise potatoes are reprehensibly limp, with the latter two items suffering from an excessive absorption of the aforementioned artificial spread.

This salon's proximity to my domicile has led me to frequent it on multiple occasions, with each visit yielding a subpar experience. Absent being the initial patron through the doors in the morning, anticipate a protracted wait. Indeed, having an appointment may even prolong your wait, as the proprietors tend to underestimate the duration of their delays. It is particularly vexing when they assure you that your wait will be merely a 'few minutes,' yet the actual delay extends upwards of 40 minutes. My most recent visit exemplified this phenomenon, wherein my 1:00 PM appointment translated into a 1:40 PM actualization. Upon inquiring about the extent of the delay, the male proprietor repeatedly offered the same dismissive response: 'a few minutes.' In offering constructive feedback regarding the importance of accuracy in estimating wait times, I suggested that such information would enable patrons to effectively manage their time, perhaps by running errands or returning at a later hour. However, the proprietor retorted that if I were dissatisfied with their service, I was free to seek alternatives, as their establishment enjoyed ample clientele. Furthermore, considering my generous gratuities, I was taken aback by the proprietor's curt demeanor.

I questioned the server regarding this discrepancy, and initially, she believed it to be an error on the part of the chef. She ventured into the kitchen to investigate, and I overheard the chef vociferously arguing that the noodles were purposely submerged in frigid water to facilitate the stirring of the za jiang sauce. My comprehension of this process led me to surmise that even when subjected to a rinse in cold water, the noodles should retain some semblance of warmth. I suggested to the server that perhaps the chef had forgotten that our noodles were supposed to be rinsed, or potentially, they had been immersed in cold water for an extended period.

I spent thirty dollars on two burritos and four tacos accompanied by two beverages. Typically, I expend approximately twenty-two dollars, and that includes several additional tacos and drinks. Secondly, the culinary offerings failed to embody the authentic essence of traditional Mexican street tacos, while the burritos appeared unremarkable, almost home-made.

Despite our prolonged presence, no attempt was made to acknowledge our presence, let alone extend a warm welcome or provide any semblance of hospitality. The sushi bar, conspicuously underutilized, beckoned to us like a siren's call, and we felt compelled to investigate further, only to be confronted by a hostile reception from a female staff member who appeared hell-bent on ensuring that we were cognizant of the fact that the bar was not designed to accommodate patrons on a first-come, first-served basis. Such an encounter left us feeling utterly disillusioned and precipitated our immediate departure, with nary a moment's hesitation.

Upon entering the premises, we placed an order for a beverage, specifically a beer, as well as a hot tea, and a plate of nachos, alas, sans beans. However, approximately twenty minutes later, we were presented with the aforementioned nachos, but now adorned with beans, much to our dismay. In light of this egregious error, my spouse requested that we receive a new order of nachos, devoid of beans, from an alternative server, as our initial server had elected to take a hiatus. Unfortunately, the manager chose to intervene, and his behavior can only be described as boorish and unprofessional, as he shifted the blame onto every individual involved, save himself, naturally. Needless to say, such abysmal management practices have rendered any future visits to this establishment completely out of the question.

My companions had previously partaken in the culinary offerings of this restaurant and had expressed their satisfaction, thus prompting my decision to follow suit. However, upon perusing the menu, I noticed that the quality of certain dishes left much to be desired. Specifically, the oysters, which my comrade had enthusiastically endorsed, failed to impress. In point of fact, he voiced his regret shortly after consuming the initial bite, citing a lack of freshness and an unpalatable sauce.  

My companions and I opted for the all-you-can-eat sushi selection, and while there were some redeeming qualities, the overall experience was less than satisfactory. To elaborate, the following points comprise the advantages and disadvantages of our dining excursion:  

Advantages:  

1. The option to substitute sashimi for sushi (with rice) was available.  
2. Our server exhibited exceptional friendliness and hospitality.  
3. The salmon dishes were fresh and of high quality.  
4. Reservations can be made in advance, which streamlines the process for patrons.  

Disadvantages:  

1. A significant number of orders were not fresh on the day of our visit.  
2. Our server seemed somewhat bewildered, resulting in erroneous order quantities.  
3. The seating arrangement was rather cramped, giving the impression that all patrons were sharing a single table.  
4. The menu offered fewer options compared to similar establishments.  
5. Four sea urchin sushis were ordered, yet two of them displayed a striking dark brown hue, while the remaining two were a vibrant gold. Such inconsistency in the appearance of the sea urchins only served to highlight their questionable freshness.  

In conclusion, I must state that I am unlikely to return to this restaurant in the future.",True,804.0,formal

The staff's response to my legitimate concerns has been dismissive and disrespectful, evincing a reluctance to address the issue and even manifesting in eye-rolling and derogatory comments. The final straw came when I was advised that it was incumbent upon me to inspect the poultry prior to departure, an expectation that I deem both unreasonable and inappropriate given the eatery's responsibility to ensure the edibility and presentability of its offerings.

Furthermore, the utilization of table salt and table pepper, rather than sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper, struck me as incongruous with the restaurant's purported commitment to serving high-quality meat.

For the sum of $9.99, I received a bowl of the aforementioned chicken slop and a cup of black beans. Upon perusing the bill, I noticed that I was not charged separately for each item; thus, I am uncertain whether the waiter neglected to include these items on the bill or if there was some other explanation for the discrepancy.

It is thoroughly unfortunate that it is not feasible to post a rating of zero stars, for it would accurately reflect the subpar quality of service provided by 777 Towing. Do not squander your time and resources by engaging with this particular company, as it is abundantly evident that their modus operandi revolves around woefully inadequate communication and an apparent lack of concern for the well-being of their clientele. Should your insurance provider inform you that 777 Towing will be dispatched to assist you, it is advisable to request an alternative service provider, as the former's proficiency in fulfilling their obligations leaves much to be desired.

The medical doctor at Black Mountain Animal Hospital cautioned me that such an action might lead to the nullification of my health guarantee.

Furthermore, the prolonged delay in receiving our orders only exacerbated our frustration, as it took an additional 15-20 minutes for our shake and dinner to arrive.

Furthermore, she instructed me to contact her office the following day to schedule an appointment for the aforementioned imaging procedure.

This resulted in a series of telephone conversations with both Steinberg Diagnostics and SMA, during which I was informed that the processing time for such referrals typically ranges from five to seven days. Now, while I acknowledge that delays can occur, I cannot help but feel frustrated by the condescending demeanor exhibited by the SMA representative I spoke with at 10 a.m. Their response, which included an unnecessary clarification of Susan Schuder's professional title, struck me as dismissive and unhelpful.

The pungent odor that permeates the interior of the casino was jarring and made it challenging for us to engage in prolonged gaming sessions.

Despite these drawbacks, our stay in Tower II was uneventful, with a clean and well-maintained room that did not exhibit the same unpleasant fragrance as the casino.

Particularly in one of the primary nightlife districts, during the hours of 2-3 am when establishments are closing their doors, the absence of taxis cruising the streets is nothing short of a calamity. It is utterly reprehensible that in a city of this size, with a population density of this magnitude, there are no cabs accessible on the streets. Is it truly the objective of taxi companies to maximize profits or are they merely engaging in business as a leisure activity? 

Secondly, it is absolutely imperative that when a taxi is summoned via telephone, the taxi company in question dispatches a vehicle in a timely and efficient manner. It is utterly inexcusable for a taxi company to fail to deliver a taxi in a reasonable time frame, particularly after multiple assurances have been given to the effect that a taxi is en route. The experience of waiting thirty minutes for a taxi that never materialized, followed by a subsequent fifteen-minute wait that also proved futile, is simply unacceptable.

1," ""Desirous of sampling the culinary offerings of Beach Pizza, given its relative proximity in comparison to my customary haunt, Roccos NY Pizza, I opted to peruse their menu and assess the quality of their fare. A large three-item pizza, accompanied by a chicken parm sub and an order of buffalo wings, constituted my inaugural order. Unfortunately, the entirety of the cuisine proved to be lacking in substance and flavor, with the buffalo wings eliciting particular disappointment due to their unpleasant aroma, greasy texture, and meager quantity of wing sauce, leading me to consume only a few before discarding the remainder. The chicken parm sub, characterized by an overabundance of bread saturated with excessive amounts of sauce and cheese, resulted in a mushy texture that detracted from the overall dining experience. Furthermore, the pizza itself, reminiscent of Domino's, exhibited a cardboard-like crust, which, while not necessarily the worst, fell short of expectations. Considering the prices charged, the value offered did not seem particularly reasonable, especially when compared to establishments such as Pizza Hut, Dominos, or Papa John's, which offer comparable fare at a lower cost.

My sole motivation for revisiting the premises would be to indulge in a refreshing glass of limeade complemented by a scrumptious slice of chocolate cake.

My gastronomical exploits at Zoe's Kitchen have encompassed a diverse array of menu items, and I strive to heed the recommendations proffered by fellow patrons. Alas, their bread leaves much to be desired, thereby rendering every sandwich I've sampled thus far rather unpalatable. While the quesadilla is marginally acceptable, my personal preference does not incline towards flour tortillas. The chicken roll-ups I attempted during my latest visit, subsequent to a fervent recommendation from a close acquaintance, regrettably proved to be somewhat soggy and utterly unappetizing. My culinary explorations have also led me to conclude that the pasta salad, potato salad, slaw, and cold rice are not to my liking either.

However, they failed to respond to my electronic communication or engage in any subsequent dialogue with me. We received a message from the director, who, despite our considerable tenure in the classroom, summarily dismissed all of our anxieties and disinvited our son from the educational institution. This turn of events was not only distressing but also unexpected. Nevertheless, it ultimately proved to be a salubrious development for him. We successfully enrolled him in a play-based school that offered a more suitable environment, providing him with the necessary resources, including toilet training, nourishment, and a more reasonable tuition fee, as well as fewer and more flexible holidays. Furthermore, I have learned that the teacher is now instructing older children, which I believe is a more appropriate match for her skill set. Although the institution boasts a commendable staff and faculty, a picturesque setting, and charming pupils, it fails to offer a satisfactory value, catering conveniently to working parents while featuring an excessive number of holidays. We have concluded that Love & Logic does not align with our values and principles.

Instead, we were compelled to solicit the assistance of a busboy, who provided us with a soiled creamer replete with fresh jam residue on its base. Upon requesting a substitute creamer from our server, we were eventually furnished with a replacement. Disappointingly, our culinary selections did not meet our expectations. Specifically, the eggs benedict dishes we ordered (Florentine and crab, respectively) were subpar. The Florentine iteration was particularly underwhelming, as the eggs were unacceptably runny, and the asparagus components were minuscule and fragmented. As an ardent devotee of eggs florentine, I was taken aback by the absence of fresh asparagus, which was replaced by what appeared to be chopped artichoke hearts. Additionally, the English muffins accompanying our dishes were excessively buttered, thereby detracting from the overall quality of the meal.

We were, however, upgraded from the most basic and smallest room category to a so-called ""King Suite."" Regrettably, this upgrade merely translated to a slightly larger bed, which was modestly comfortable, and an irregularly shaped room that was somewhat more spacious.

The WiFi connection, which is frequently complimentary in even the most affordable hotels, cost $12 for a mere 24 hours.

Fast forward a couple of months, I decided to accord this establishment a second opportunity. (I must have been experiencing a temporary lapse of sanity due to extreme hunger.) Firstly, the bartender displayed blatant rudeness, sluggishness, and an utter lack of proficiency in mixology. My companion and I placed our orders, and approximately twenty minutes later, my friend's meal arrived. However, after an agonizing wait of nearly an hour, my pizza remained conspicuously absent.

The musical selection, characterized by a fusion of top 40 hits and electronic pop, proved to be quite appealing.

1," I arrived during the week preceding Thanksgiving, which customarily constitutes an off-peak season, thereby resulting in a relative dearth of crowds and a heightened sense of tranquility throughout Las Vegas.

Pros:

* My accommodations were remarkably silent, as I failed to detect even the slightest murmur emanating from neighboring rooms throughout my entire stay.
* The location of the hotel was ideal, as I have always preferred establishments situated removed from the central strip.
* The dÃ©cor was indeed captivating, and it was primarily owing to this factor that I opted to book a room at this particular hotel â?a decidedly unique and refreshing change of pace from the ubiquitous gambling dens and boisterous nightlife venues that proliferate the city. The ambiance was utterly serene, devoid of the pervasive din and revelry that often accompanies such locales.
* Complimentary parking and internet access were also provided, although I did notice a somewhat dubious charge totaling $100 upon checkout.

Cons:

* The youthful personnel responsible for check-in procedures appeared to be woefully lacking in both basic manners and customer service skills, their assistance being characterized by an extreme degree of unhelpfulness. Having booked my accommodations through Priceline and paid the entirety of the room fee well in advance, I was taken aback upon arrival by their demand for an additional $75 per night under the guise of âincidentals.â?This exorbitant charge struck me as patently absurd, particularly given that I had never encountered such an egregious fee at any previous hotel stay. Despite my protestations, the staff proved unsympathetic and wholly unwilling to offer any manner of assistance. Ultimately, I was able to cajole them into accepting a single payment of $75 for the initial night, with the understanding that I would settle the balance of $75 the following morning â?an arrangement that struck me as manifestly unfair, given that I had already paid for my accommodations in full. It is my firm conviction that such questionable business practices are highly detrimental to the reputation of any establishment.
* In light of the above, it is my strong recommendation that potential guests seek alternative lodging arrangements, as the prevailing attitude displayed by the hotelâs staff seems to be one of pervasive apathy and disinterest.",True,982.0,formal

Regarding the culinary offerings, I can condone subpar service if the food delivers an exceptional experience. In this instance, I requested six garlic knots and a large pepperoni and mushroom pizza. The garlic knots, measuring slightly larger than a quarter, were priced at two dollars and fifty cents, which seemed exorbitant. Their quality was average, at best.

The pizza itself elicited disappointment upon presentation. Its uniform, cookie-cutter appearance did not impress me, and its resemblance to frozen pizza raised concerns about its authenticity. A truly exceptional pizza would exhibit unique characteristics such as varied crust texture, visible bubbles, and distinct color variations. Alas, these qualities were conspicuously absent.

I placed an order for a ham, cheddar, and apple sandwich on pumpernickel bread, opting to take it with me rather than consuming it on the premises.

The remaining portion, however, retained its structural integrity and offered a satisfactory, albeit somewhat lackluster, taste experience, which I attribute to the selection of cheddar cheese, a choice that, in my opinion, detracted from the inherent flavors of the apple and ham components, resulting in a relatively uninspiring gustatory encounter that could be rivaled by certain offerings from a Subway restaurant.""",True,1032.0,formal

Upon closer examination, I have come to realize that the primary draws for me are the complimentary chips and salsa, which are undoubtedly delectable. Additionally, their margaritas are typically quite impressive. Furthermore, I have developed a fondness for their newly introduced pretzel stick appetizer. Most importantly, the servers have consistently displayed exceptional friendliness and attentiveness. However, the culinary offerings remain the sole area of concern, as I have yet to experience a thoroughly satisfying meal. Despite attempting a wide variety of dishes, I have found that certain components of each dish are occasionally palatable, but a uniformly excellent meal has proven elusive. Specifically, the margarita chicken is passable, but the accompanying sides tend to be lackluster and appear somewhat stale. Similarly, the burger is adequate, but the fries are often subpar. The children's meals are regrettably inadequate, prompting me to seek alternative dining options for family gatherings. Typically, my visits to this establishment are limited to luncheons with my spouse, during which we opt for the unlimited chips and salsa with soup and salad.

2," ""This establishment represents the quintessence of mediocrity, as it is the fourth Hawaiian barbecue restaurant I have had the displeasure of dining at, and it falls short in numerous aspects. Firstly, the absence of teriyaki and katsu sauces, which are fundamental components of any respectable Hawaiian barbecue, is a glaring omission. Furthermore, the substitute condiments provided, specifically soy sauce and an overly sweetened, processed, and glowing red sauce, fail to enhance the flavor profile of the dishes they accompany. The macaroni salad, a staple of Hawaiian cuisine, is unacceptably prepared with overcooked noodles, an unappetizing seasoning akin to pepper, and an insufficient amount of carrot shavings, resulting in a lackluster presentation. The barbecue chicken, purportedly marinated, exhibits a striking lack of moisture and flavor, rendering it unpalatable. The bed of vegetables, comprising tired, desiccated cabbage, resembles imitation grass often found in Easter baskets, further detracting from the overall quality of the meal. The menu's confusion between Hawaiian barbecue and what could be described as 'ghetto Chinese food' of South Phoenix only serves to exacerbate the disappointment. Although the elderly Asian couple who own and operate the establishment are quite cordial, the service, while prompt, does not compensate for the culinary shortcomings. Despite the eatery's cleanliness, surpassing its nearby competitors, its location amidst a plethora of fast-food options makes it readily forgettable.

A dearth of clientele, an ephemeral and capricious staff, an excess of cacophonous melodies, and an atmosphere that militates against effortless conversation and relaxation have all contributed to its decline. Moreover, the proprietors, in a seemingly futile attempt to mitigate the purported inconvenience posed by external disturbances, have elected to seal the windows, thereby necessitating the perpetual operation of the aged, diminutive climate control system, which, in turn, has rendered the ambiance within the premises stifling and oppressive. Furthermore, the odor emanating from the cigarette smoke permeates the atmosphere, imbuing both the staff and patrons with an unmistakable aroma redolent of neglect and abandonment. A sole redeeming feature, if one may be so bold as to label it as such, resides in the tables situated outside, affording a modicum of respite from the stultifying environment within.

Convenience played a significant role in my decision to patronize this establishment, as it was situated in close proximity to the Cultural Trust, where I had a class. Unfortunately, my experiences at this coffee shop were marred by a series of unpleasant encounters. Firstly, the chai tea was excessively sweet and lacked the depth of flavor that one would expect from a well-crafted chai. It was almost as if they had merely added milk to black tea and neglected to incorporate any discernible spices. This was a profound disappointment, as I had been eagerly anticipating a flavorful and invigorating beverage. Furthermore, the coffee was consistently brewed to a weakness that bordered on insipidity. I suspect that the coffee had been left to sit for an extended period before I received it, as it lacked the rich, bold flavor that I have come to expect from a freshly brewed cup of coffee. In fact, the second time I ordered coffee from this establishment, it was so unpalatable that I was compelled to discard it after only a few sips. The service at this coffee shop was adequate, but it fell short of being exceptional. While the staff was not unfriendly, their pace was somewhat leisurely, and they failed to demonstrate the kind of attentive, personalized service that one might hope to encounter at a reputable coffee shop. However, I must admit that the Wi-Fi connection was quite reliable, which proved to be a welcome consolation in light of the subpar quality of the beverages.",True,1098.0,formal

Furthermore, the architectural style of the building itself is undeniably captivating and aesthetically pleasing. Additionally, the tariffs associated with these accommodations are deemed reasonable and accessible to a wide range of patrons.

Specifically, the scheduling of these pickups appears to be quite sporadic and unpredictable, often resulting in extended periods of waiting time for arriving guests. In fact, it is not uncommon for individuals to endure delays of two to three hours, which can be particularly problematic for those with tight travel itineraries. Moreover, the alternative transportation option of hailing a taxi cab comes with a substantial price tag of $40, exclusive of gratuity. It is essential to exercise caution when encountering any advertised freebies or special offers associated with the resort, as they frequently come with strings attached or prove to be misleading. For instance, the supposed complimentary breakfast buffet is, in reality, a severely limited 2 for 1 arrangement, hardly justifying the prolonged wait times. Similarly, the pool area, touted as a serene and picturesque oasis, is inaccessible to guests during the months of March, rendering it unavailable for a significant portion of the year. Lastly, the Hostile Grape wine bar, an establishment that ostensibly offers a diverse selection of vintages, is regrettably closed three days a week, further limiting its appeal to potential patrons. Those seeking a more fulfilling and convenient shopping experience would be well-advised to consider renting a vehicle, as the resort's remote location makes it challenging to access nearby retail centers without one.

The fare provided was fresh and palatable, yet lacked any extraordinary qualities or distinguishing characteristics. The burritos were diminutive in stature, with meager fillings that left much to be desired. 
  The pricing of their menu items was patently disproportionate to the quantity and quality of the food served. Specifically, the cost of an original-sized burrito, which was excessive in relation to its modest proportions and scant contents, was $7.50. Furthermore, the price of a small soft drink was $2.50, which seemed exorbitant given the absence of complimentary refills. 
  Notwithstanding these issues, each order did come with an accompaniment of chips and salsa. The chips possessed an agreeable texture and flavor, while the salsa was merely adequate. 
  Another anomaly that perplexed me was the packaging of my wife's Triple Lindy burrito, which arrived in a white box. However, when attempting to dispose of the container, its unusual design rendered it impossible to fit into the trash receptacle. This seemed like a curious oversight.

Upon ordering, I was somewhat dismayed to discover that the taco in question was rather diminutive in stature, measuring a mere 3-4 inches in length, and lacking the crispy shell option which I had been anticipating.  Notwithstanding this initial disappointment, I must admit that the shredded beef utilized in the taco's composition was indeed of superior quality; however, considering the paltry sum of $2 requested in exchange for this item, I cannot help but feel that its value was not entirely commensurate with its cost.  During a subsequent visit, I opted to sample the fried fish dish, and I must confess that the end result was utterly unsatisfactory.  The fish itself was presented in an unfilleted state, with only half of the meat remaining attached to the bone, and the method of preparation employed seemed to consist merely of placing the fish in a fryer, sans any semblance of finesse or attention to detail.  Furthermore, the ambiance of the restaurant struck me as decidedly juvenile and aesthetically unpleasing, with certain aspects of the dÃ©cor bordering on the offensive.  In conclusion, while the service at this establishment may be deemed passable, the prices charged are hardly reasonable, and the cuisine, with a few notable exceptions, falls short of expectations.",True,1227.0,formal

However, upon entering the premises, we were immediately acknowledged by a lone staff member, fostering an impression that a definitive knowledge of our preferences was expected at the onset. The sole employee tasked with attending to our needs exhibited a reserved demeanor, potentially attributed to the culmination of a protracted work shift or other factors.

In regards to the frozen delights, my spouse selected the TC^2 and salted caramel flavors, while I opted for the almond buttercrunch and apple cinnamon varieties. Additionally, I sampled the honey blue cheese and sugar and spice options. Unfortunately, the almond buttercrunch failed to showcase a discernible almond essence, although the remaining flavors proved satisfactory. Notably, the texture presented a rather icy consistency, lacking the anticipated creaminess, given the extensive praise surrounding this venue.

The pricing, however, proved reasonable and, if seeking unique ice cream flavors at a fair cost within close proximity, a visit may be warranted.

2," First and foremost, it is imperative to acknowledge that this particular establishment is not a traditional Costco, but rather a specialized ""business center."" This distinction is crucial, as it significantly impacts the products and services offered, and thus, it is essential to emphasize this point to avoid any potential disappointment or confusion among patrons.  

In light of this, it is relevant to highlight that this specific Costco does not sell alcoholic beverages, which may come as a surprise to some individuals who are accustomed to purchasing such items at other Costco locations. Furthermore, there is no food court available on the premises, which may also be a departure from the typical Costco experience that some customers are familiar with. However, it is worth noting that this absence is compensated by the abundance of exceptional dining options and buffets in the surrounding area, which can easily satisfy any culinary cravings.  

This particular Costco focuses primarily on providing an extensive selection of snacks and beverages, intended for the purpose of restocking vending machines. In fact, they even offer vending machines for purchase, which speaks to the unique nature of this business-oriented store. One redeeming quality of this establishment is the diverse array of beverages available, ranging from juices, sodas, sparkling water, cider, and more, which is undoubtedly impressive.  

Unfortunately, this Costco falls short in terms of staffing, with relatively few employees present, and those who are on duty often appear uninformed about various aspects of the store's operations.

His demeanor was helpful, attentive, interactive, and one of the most exceptional examples of fine service I have encountered within this metropolis.  Moreover, he presented a sample of the soup du jour for our perusal before we placed our orders.  Exceptional hospitality indeed - bravo, Anthony!

The comestibles, however, garnered decidedly mixed critiques.  The tilapia special was devoured with relish by both individuals at our table who opted for it.  Culinary staff, please take note: the portions varied conspicuously between the two plates, despite the fact that the lesser quantity happened to be consumed by the individual who customarily indulges in less food; thus, it did not pose a problem.  When identical dishes are concurrently presented to two patrons seated at the same table, it is imperative that the plates appear identical!

I initiated my repast with the minestrone soup (a staple offering on the menu), and although its flavor was palatable, it was served at a disappointingly tepid temperature.  This elicited a feeling of melancholy.  Furthermore, my meatball sandwich was somewhat lacking in warmth and excessively salty.  Alas, it failed to possess the freshness I had anticipated.

Upon inquiring about the location of the elevator, I received a brusque response informing me that none existed, and that accessible seating options were only available at a premium price point. As someone who walks with a cane and experiences fatigue easily, navigating multiple flights of stairs proved to be an arduous task that left me feeling distressed and marginalized.

As a family that adheres to a gluten-free diet, we were thrilled to learn that the restaurant offered an array of gluten-free options. We ordered the Vegetarian Antipasto, Flatbread Trio, Chicken Caesar Salad, and two pizzas, all of which were gluten-free versions.

In fact, my homemade gluten-free pizza crust and packaged versions purchased from Whole Foods far surpassed the quality of those served at this establishment. Additionally, the pizza sauce was excessively sweetened, the salad was overpowered by dressing, the Antipasto was devoid of taste, and the flatbread was unimpressive. The dips served alongside the meal were merely average.

My sons and I were eager to indulge in a buffet meal prior to our evening excursion in the city of sin, and this particular establishment appeared to be the most convenient option, boasting a relatively short queue.

Following payment, we waited briefly for our table to be prepared. Once seated, our server took our beverage orders, and after ensuring that everything was in order, we set out to explore the array of dishes available. Unfortunately, the selection was quite limited, with certain stations remaining unrestocked. Given the circumstances, I made a concerted effort to derive maximum value from my $47 dinner by opting for grilled meats such as kobe beef and prime rib, short rib tacos, various sushi and sashimi options, and beef Wellington. For dessert, I selected mini churros and vending machine-dispensed ice cream.

Advantages:  

* Short rib tacos  
* Sushi and sashimi

Nonetheless, the absence of seating arrangements in the primary chamber for female performers was nothing short of perplexing, prompting us to decline the invitation to join the gentlemen celebrating their friend's last night of bachelorhood.

It is no surprise that at one point in the annals of history, Pasqual's boldly proclaimed itself a'salsaria,' for the sheer quality and depth of its salsa offerings are nothing short of sublime. The salsa is so exceptional, in fact, that it has been known to inspire an uncontainable urge to engage in impromptu bouts of salsa dancing, despite the fact that neither the author nor the majority of patrons possess any discernible aptitude for the art form. Alas, such is the profound impact of Pasqual's salsa on the senses. Regrettably, however, this once-illustrious establishment appears to have fallen victim to a precipitous decline in standards, as evidenced by the paltry serving of salsa accompanying the nachos, measuring a scant tablespoon or thereabouts in a miniature cup. A travesty compounded by the fact that repeated requests for additional salsa have yielded identical, meager portions. While the chicken, beef, nachos, and tacos at Pasqual's may be of respectable quality, it is indubitable that the salsa remains the veritable cornerstone of the dining experience, rendering the recent parsimony displayed in its distribution nothing short of calamitous. In conclusion, an imploration is hereby issued for Pasqual's to rectify this grievous oversight and restore the salsa to its rightful place as the crowning glory of the menu, lest the reputation of this erstwhile culinary haven suffer irreparable damage.""",True,1393.0,formal
2," This evening, I had the privilege of dining at this establishment with a close acquaintance, and we opted for the dual-person meal priced at twenty dollars. As an amuse-bouche, we selected the guacamole appetizer, which consisted of their signature tortilla chips accompanied by a creamy guacamole dip infused with corn kernels, as per the wait staff's description, devoid of jalapenos and lacking any potency. Upon delving into the initial bite of the guacamole, my taste buds were met with an unexpected explosion of fiery flavor, saturated with an abundance of jalapenos and other pungent elements. Subsequently, we received the six-ounce sirloin steak, which, albeit cooked to my requested level of doneness, displayed a notable degree of charring on one particular surface. This cut of beef was complemented by a serving of loaded mashed potatoes, which exhibited remarkable quality, and a side of broccoli whose unpleasant and rancid taste was unfortunately accentuated by an unknown substance incorporated into its preparation.

However, the subsequent dishes failed to maintain the initial quality, leading us to conclude that scaling down portion sizes while elevating the caliber of the fare would be a judicious strategy.

We initiated our gastronomic journey by sharing a spanakopita appetizer, which arrived in the form of three generous pieces, thereby rendering it suitable for two individuals. Although visually reminiscent of a pocket pizza, the dish was marred by an excess of cream cheese, detracting from the authentic flavor profile associated with feta. Moreover, the absence of delicate phyllo crust layers was conspicuous.

Our primary courses consisted of a customary beef gyro and its poultry counterpart, accompanied by potatoes and rice. Unfortunately, the potatoes were prepared in a manner akin to french fries, which rendered them unappealing to my taste buds due to their high fat content. Consequently, I merely sampled a few pieces, feeling somewhat let down. The accompanying rice was unremarkable, and the chicken gyro proved underwhelming as well.

* The indoor setting provides a welcome respite from the sweltering temperatures during the summer months in Las Vegas; however, the layout and design of the interior space may contribute to a sense of claustrophobia and discomfort.  
* Although the variety of stores at this location is impressive, it falls short of the extensive selection available at the North outlets, which cater to a broader range of consumer preferences and demands.  
* The presence of numerous dining options within close proximity provides convenience for shoppers seeking sustenance; nevertheless, the overall ambiance and appeal of the North outlets remain unmatched.

The restrooms were impressively maintained, exhibiting a high level of cleanliness. Subsequent to our completion of the necessary tasks in the bathroom, we were seated, and our server promptly emerged to take our beverage and salsa requests. The restaurant offers a selection of salsas, but unfortunately, their primary offering did not meet my expectations - typically, I would consume salsa and chips without hesitation, but in this instance, the salsa was not palatable. The accompanying chips were also subpar. Opting for the cheese dip instead, I found it to be relatively satisfying. However, my experience with the chimichanga was disappointing, as it lacked both cheese and flavor, leading me to return it uneaten.

However, none of these items lived up to our expectations. The black cod was overcooked and lacked the tender texture found at other establishments, such as Azuma on St-Laurent. The octopus balls were unpleasantly chewy, with an uncooked tempura batter in the center, and were excessively salted. The okonomiyaki was completely smothered in sauce, making it difficult to discern any other flavors, and its texture was unusual, almost resembling cornmeal.

Furthermore, the bathrooms, particularly in one of the rooms we occupied, lacked fundamental essentials such as toilet paper and functional locks, issues which were further compounded by the minuscule nature of these spaces.

2," ""This aerodrome is tainted with an aura of squalor and ineptitude, rendering it unaccommodating to patrons who seek a seamless and convenient experience. Specifically, the absence of sufficient power outlets throughout the terminal hinders the ability of business travelers to recharge their electronic devices, thereby creating an unnecessary obstacle for those seeking to maintain productivity during transit. Furthermore, the physical distance between gates poses an additional challenge for passengers facing layovers, as they must traverse an excessive distance on foot, thereby augmenting the already heightened levels of anxiety associated with air travel. Moreover, the proliferation of slot machines within the airport serves only to exacerbate the financial burden inherent in modern-day travel, thus further undermining the overall quality of the facility.""",True,1515.0,formal
2," It has been approximately six years since we last partook in a culinary excursion to the streets of New York, and on this particular occasion, we opted for a delicate and crunchy pizza, accompanied by a Caesar salad and an order of bread knots. Upon reflection, the pizza proved to be somewhat superior to my previous recollections, yet still fell short of excellence. Conversely, the salad was regrettably inedible, with the romaine lettuce displaying visible signs of browning and an unmistakable lack of freshness, indicating that it had surpassed its prime by at least four or five days. In response to our dissatisfaction, the restaurant graciously accepted the return of the salad and offered a complimentary piece of cheesecake as a gesture of goodwill. Unfortunately, the individual responsible for preparing our meal should indeed feel deeply embarrassed by their subpar performance... Ultimately, we are unlikely to revisit this establishment in the future.",True,1516.0,formal

2," My spouse, progeny, and I have been patronizing Casey Jones for an extended period, yet our most recent visit presented a precipitous decline in culinary excellence. In the company of acquaintances, we sampled their newly introduced burger, the ""Juicy Lucy,"" and were dismayed by its lackluster quality. Upon ordering the burgers at a medium level of doneness, we were served two patties that appeared to be hemorrhaging, with an overflow of cheese reminiscent of a gruesome cinematic scene where a character suffers a mortal wound. Following our return of the burgers to the kitchen and receiving assurance of their rectification, the subsequent dishes were cooked to an extreme degree, bordering on incineration, and were devoid of any semblance of dairy products, thereby negating the essence of the ""Juicy"" moniker. As a result, my previous endorsement of this establishment has been rescinded, and further visits will be forestalled until a more competent culinary artisan assumes responsibilities in the kitchen, as the likelihood of such an unfortunate series of events had previously been considered improbable.",True,1518.0,formal
2,"So, we received at $20 off coupon in the mail and decided to give it a try.  Let's just say...it's been some months since then and we haven't been back...the only time this place has popped up on my radar was when a co-worker was talking about their lackluster experience, too.\n\nThe service was fine.  It was the food that got me.  I ordered cheese enchilada's and my girlfriend ordered the chicken enchilada's.  Now, I expected cheese...but I didn't think I was going to have to go on a search mission to locate the tortillas. My girlfriend was equally displeased with her meal. The sangria I ordered was the only saving grace...not good enough to return, though...",,,informal
2," ""While the culinary offerings at this establishment were undoubtedly delectable, the exorbitant prices charged for what essentially constituted a meal of galbi and meat left much to be desired in terms of value for money. Furthermore, the restaurant's menu, both in its antiquated and modern iterations, perpetuated an egregious error by claiming that certain dishes included a sweet treat, only to renege on that promise when the time came to present the bill. Such inconsistencies in communication are utterly perplexing and detract significantly from the overall dining experience, thereby warranting a deduction of one or two stars. Additionally, it is recommended that patrons visit this venue solo or in pairs to optimize the value proposition, as the quantity of side dishes and seafood pancake remains static regardless of the number of diners at the table.""",True,1520.0,formal

""It has been an appreciable duration since my last visit to Dos Gringos, or perhaps this particular establishment is inferior in terms of cleanliness compared to the Tempe location, but my recent experience at this venue was utterly disappointing. The lavatory facilities were emitting an unpleasant odor, and the overall ambiance seemed grimy and unkempt. I would not consider partaking in culinary indulgences from this establishment, given that the state of their bar area raises concerns about the cleanliness of their kitchen. Frankly, I am perplexed by the preference of some individuals to frequent such an uninviting atmosphere when there are numerous alternative destinations in Scottsdale that offer a more enjoyable and sanitary experience.""",True,1521.0,formal
2," ""On multiple occasions, I have visited this Jasons Deli and experienced satisfaction with their offerings. Specifically, their delivery services have consistently met my expectations in terms of quality and taste. However, my most recent encounter with their delivery was rather unremarkable, as the butter croissant that housed my turkey sandwich was excessively desiccated, leading to an unpleasant dining experience. Furthermore, the brownies that have previously been a highlight of their menu, failed to meet my expectations due to being overcooked, resulting in an unpleasantly dry texture and burnt flavor. Overall, this particular meal was a disappointment, prompting me to reconsider my future patronage.""",True,1522.0,formal
2," ""The prices are exorbitant, to say the least. It is ostensible that they possess cutting-edge equipment, but unfortunately, we were unable to take advantage of such modern amenities due to the prohibitive costs. Despite the cordial demeanor of the staff, we had a doctor suggest callously that it might be in the best interest of our canine companion to be euthanized, which is utterly unconscionable. As medical professionals, it is their ethical duty to prioritize the well-being of their patients, and such a comment is reprehensible. Our dog required a brief, 24-hour stay at the facility, which resulted in an astronomical bill totaling approximately $2000. In contrast, we transferred our furry friend to another, more affordable establishment, where he received identical care and treatment for a mere fraction of the cost, totaling less than the amount we paid for a single day at VCA.""",True,1523.0,formal
2," ""Upon entering the establishment, I noticed that they possessed an array of cosmetic lines; however, the abundance of products available for purchase was unfortunately meager during my visit. Specifically, the selection of items from MAC, the brand I was seeking, was quite limited and many of the products were either already opened, damaged, or appeared to have been heavily utilized. Furthermore, the quality of customer service I received was subpar. The trio of employees stationed at the cash register failed to acknowledge my presence or offer any assistance, leaving me feeling ignored and disheartened. Consequently, I will be venturing to the interior location in the future, hoping to find a more extensive range of options.""",True,1524.0,formal
2," ""Satisfactory victuals at a reasonable cost. We visited this establishment in the early hours of a Friday morning, following our arrival in Las Vegas. Despite the lateness of the hour, the venue was bustling with activity; however, we were promptly accommodated. I opted to partake in the 7 oz. steak, accompanied by hash browns, eggs, and toast, which I shared with my companion due to my limited appetite. The steak presented a dichotomy of doneness, with one half being well done and the other half falling somewhere between medium and medium-well; we had requested the latter, but such minor inconsistencies were inconsequential given the affordable price point of less than $4. The hash browns lacked the desired crispiness, while the toast was satisfactory, and the eggs fell within the realm of mediocrity. A cursory examination of the culinary offerings revealed an absence of sodium, a characteristic seemingly tailored to the preferences of the mature clientele that frequent this establishment. In summary, this restaurant serves as a suitable option for those seeking sustenance following a night of revelry or for individuals who prefer a more relaxed dining experience, but it does not qualify as a premier gastronomic destination.""",True,1525.0,formal
2," ""We partook in a culinary excursion at this esteemed eatery last week, during which the comestibles were merely adequate, while the tariff was somewhat prohibitive. Specifically, supplementary dishes incurred an additional fee of $11.00 or more. \n\nHowever, the hospitality we received was quite another tale. Our trio of servers, with the primary one being conspicuously discourteous and haughty, bordering on impolite, and her countenance betrayed no hint of joviality. Such behavior, though unfortunate, might have been tolerable had not the supporting staff member committed the egregious faux pas of extending his arm across my spouse to retrieve my plate, leaving me utterly flabbergasted. I forthrightly admonished him, stressing the importance of proper decorum. Subsequently, the manager appeared and, upon being apprised of the situation, expressed contrition and effected a transformation in our attendants, resulting in a marked improvement in the quality of our service. \n\nMy indignation stems from the fact that, at an establishment of such lofty stature and cost, one should never be compelled to lodge a complaint to receive satisfactory service. The Las Vegas Strip boasts a plethora of exceptional restaurants, rendering it unnecessary to squander one's resources and time at a venue incapable of maintaining top-notch service consistently. My recommendation: seek an alternative dining destination!""",True,1526.0,formal
2," ""I partook in an evening repast at Leroy Fox, whereupon I had the pleasure of savoring their culinary offerings within the refurbished confines of the erstwhile Hotel Charlotte. The revitalization of the establishment was indeed impressive, as it successfully integrated elements of the original edifice into its contemporary design. Unfortunately, the ambiance was somewhat marred by the cacophony of sounds that permeated the dining area, which was exacerbated by the advent of live musical performances. Notwithstanding the auditory challenges, my dining experience was largely satisfactory, as I relished the flavorsome 'north' chicken, comprising a breast and wing that were skillfully prepared via deep-frying. Furthermore, the menu presented an array of enticing options, and the attentive service was commendable despite minor delays attributed to the overwhelming volume of patrons. However, owing to the aforementioned limitations in auditory comfort, I would not advocate for visiting this eatery with expectations of engaging in effortless conversation with fellow diners.""",True,1527.0,formal
2," This lodging establishment proved to be a profound disappointment, failing to meet our expectations of a luxurious four-star hotel experience in Las Vegas. Despite its unremarkable appearance, we opted to spend a single night at this venue, only to discover that for an identical tariff, we could have secured accommodations that were markedly superior in both quality and amenities.",True,1528.0,formal
2,"I'm giving BJ's 2 stars because the food is pretty darn good when they get the order right. I've been to this BJ's about 7 times and each time (except once) they have failed to give me what I ordered on the first try. I always come in with a group of people from work and we fax our order in before we get there. The kitchen has our order, in writing, right in front of them and still can't execute it properly. I know a veggie pizza with no cheese is a terribly complicated concept but come on! EVERY TIME! I've gotten it delivered with cheese and I've even gotten it delivered without the cheese but with sausage added! Sausage?!\n\nThe wait staff is always apologetic but the kitchen here seems to be inept.",,,informal
2," I was eager to relish the culinary offerings of this eatery and had high expectations, however, upon entering the premises, my enthusiasm was dampened by the cramped layout, which appeared to prioritize maximizing seating capacity over patron comfort. Although I comprehend the economic rationale behind this decision, it created an unpleasant ambiance, particularly during peak hours. Moreover, the menu options were limited, which made it challenging to find a suitable dish that catered to my taste preferences. My spouse opted for the turkey sandwich, while I selected the grilled cheese BLT. The total cost for these two items and a single fountain beverage was almost $20.00, which seemed excessive given the quality of the fare. Furthermore, the service was sluggish, with a prolonged delay between placing our order and its fulfillment. When the food finally arrived, it was merely satisfactory, with the bacon in my sandwich displaying an unpleasant texture and appearance, suggestive of having been stored for an extended period. Additionally, my spouse's meal lacked the specified vegetables and condiments, but due to the prolonged wait, he chose not to request a replacement. In conclusion, this establishment failed to meet my expectations, offering a noise-filled atmosphere and unimpressive cuisine at an exorbitant price point, leading me to concur with my spouse's sentiment that alternative dining options, such as Capriotti's, would provide better value for the money.",True,1530.0,formal

The dining area was characterized by a cavernous interior with an excessive number of tables and chairs, creating an environment that was boisterous and lacking in intimacy. Our order consisted of the Chicken Soo Guy, which our server defined as being imbued with a distinctive Asian sauce, the specificity of which was left undefined. It became apparent upon sampling that this purportedly special sauce was, in reality, a rather conventional sweet and sour variety, which did not particularly impress me.

In contrast, the spicy beef dish displayed a modicum of flavor, albeit only after we requested that it be prepared with an extraordinary degree of piquancy. This led me to ponder about the nature of the dish when served in its standard form.

Taking everything into account, my expectations were not met by this eatery, and I would not consider returning.",True,1532.0,formal

Specifically, on the first occasion, they were unable to effectuate delivery subsequent to my payment of an additional fee of 3.99 for expedited delivery, and on the second instance, their tracking information indicated ""out for delivery"" followed by ""UNDELIVERABLE - OTHER REASONS"" and then ""REDELIVER ON NEXT BUSINESS DAY"". 
  The delivery individual could not furnish a reasonable explanation for the non-delivery of my package, leading me to surmise that he was running behind schedule and elected to postpone its delivery until the following business day. Moreover, the initial delivery person who began delivering packages to me displayed a consistent lack of friendliness, failing to return my smile and express gratitude when I received the package, responding only with a grumpy demeanor and hastily departing.

Unfortunately, the preparation of my hamburger was executed prematurely, resulting in a dining experience that was diametrically opposed to our expectations, as the meat was desiccated, lukewarm, and somewhat challenging to ingest. Similarly, the poultry dish we ordered was also afflicted by an unfortunate dearth of moisture and tenderness, making it arduous to consume. In contrast, our previous encounters with their hamburgers have been characterized by their freshness, juiciness, and satisfying temperature. It is worth noting that the cooking method employed by this restaurant, which involves precooking the meat and allowing it to sit in a pan, is not optimal for creating an enjoyable dining experience. In fact, this practice is reminiscent of the methods employed by certain fast-food chains, such as McDonald's.

Furthermore, our gathering included numerous individuals who sought to indulge in alcoholic beverages, specifically beer, but they encountered difficulty in securing the attention of a server to place their orders.

However, my expectations were not met, as the class failed to deliver an ambiance conducive to relaxation, owing to the blaring of upbeat pop music throughout the entire duration of the session. Such an atmosphere proved not only annoying but also tremendously distracting, thwarting my ability to fully immerse myself in the practice. Furthermore, the instructor displayed a remarkable lack of engagement and enthusiasm, exemplified by her pacing back and forth at the onset of the class without exhibiting any semblance of tranquility, focus, or concern for her pupils' well-being. Her demeanor suggested that she was either preoccupied, fatigued, or disinterested, which only served to further detract from the quality of the class. Although I must concede that the physical exertion involved in the session was commendable and rigorous, I cannot in good conscience award more than two stars for an experience marred by such conspicuous shortcomings. It is worth mentioning that the studio itself exuded an aesthetic that could be described as modern, bohemian, and chic; regrettably, this factor alone could not compensate for the deficiencies that plagued the class. It appears that this particular establishment subscribes to the notion of competitive yoga, where participants are encouraged to outdo one another in their attire and poses.

Not only was the color of the sauce unsettlingly yellow (which, I was informed by the apologetic waitress, was attributable to the inclusion of paprika), but its taste was also uninspired and lacking in depth. To be blunt, it closely resembled cheese wiz, albeit of a diluted variety. Unfortunately, the texture of the pork tenderloin was also found wanting, possessing an unyielding toughness that bordered on the unpleasant. A serrated blade would have been most welcome in facilitating the consumption of this less-than-tender tenderloin. It is conceivable that the kitchen experienced an off day, which might account for the disparity between my two visits. Moving forward, I shall restrict my orders to sandwiches, an area in which the establishment seems to excel. Alas, no consideration was offered by the management to mitigate the disappointment engendered by my less-than-satisfactory repast, either in the form of a discount or any other gesture of conciliation.

 My server, though well-intentioned, conveyed a few options she believed would cater to my dietary restrictions. However, her uncertainty regarding the menu items' gluten content prompted her to consult the kitchen staff. Upon inquiry, they granted permission for me to order the nachos, albeit with a notable language barrier between us.

Fortunately, I did not experience any adverse effects, suggesting that the nachos are a reliable choice at this venue.

As out-of-towners seeking a convenient dining spot in close proximity to our workplace, we were disappointed to encounter a packed venue that necessitated a 30-minute wait, which, while not inherently problematic, was exacerbated by the humorless demeanor of the greeter, whose lack of amiability set a decidedly inauspicious tone for the evening. Our initial order, comprising a tofu appetizer accompanied by ikkura and an assortment of condiments, was indeed delectable, with the tofu exhibiting remarkable texture and flavor. However, the hand scallop Soy roll, despite its diminutive size and failure to meet my explicit request for added spiciness, was unfortunately overshadowed by the underwhelming quality of the edamame, which, having been cooked to an unfortunate excess, resulted in an unpleasant texture and a general lack of freshness that permeated the remainder of the meal. Specifically, the various rolls, including the much-touted'monster' variety, suffered from an evident dearth of inspiration and attention to detail, with listless ingredients failing to impress even the most cursory of palates. Furthermore, the tuna sashimi, despite being sent back twice, remained subpar, prompting us to query the kitchen's dedication to quality and culinary expertise. Notwithstanding the preceding litany of disappointments, the green tea crÃ¨me brÃ»lÃ©e, while undeniably delicious, was served in such a meager portion as to border on the laughable, especially when juxtaposed with the exorbitant price point of $12 per bottle for the sake, which, while admittedly of superior quality, did little to mitigate the overall sense of disillusionment and frustration engendered by our dining experience.""",True,1704.0,formal

Not only was this an egregious breach of business etiquette, but it also contravened the fundamental principles of customer satisfaction. Furthermore, the fact that we were celebrating a milestone occasion and had been accorded a complimentary birthday surprise for the honoree only served to exacerbate the situation. While the cuisine itself was generally satisfactory, with my tenderloin tips being slightly over-salted yet still palatable, and the key lime pie eliciting praise from my fellow diners, the overall experience left much to be desired.

The service we received was attentive and impressive, but unfortunately, the cuisine did not quite live up to the high standard of hospitality. We opted to share several dishes, including a selection of oysters ($15), which were paired with apple ice cider vinegar from Vergers de la Colline. While they were not bad, I have certainly had superior oysters on previous occasions.  

The Chef Choice Seared Foie Gras ($23) was, without a doubt, the highlight of the meal. In fact, I would return solely to indulge in that particular dish once again. The sourness of the fresh grapes harmonized beautifully with the richness of the foie gras, making it a truly memorable experience. It's worth noting that I selfishly refused to share this dish with my fellow diners.  

The Whole Hog ($32/pp), comprising baby back ribs, smoked grilled pork chop, braised shanks, braising juices, and Parmesan cheese French fries, made for an visually striking platter. However, the majority of the meat proved to be underwhelming, with the exception of the tender and moist shank. Additionally, I found the roasted vegetables to be quite satisfying.

Finally, he offered a half-hearted compromise, suggesting that we might receive a credit towards a future purchase, a gesture that struck us as wholly inadequate given the magnitude of our disappointment and frustration.

Following a prolonged wait, our server finally appeared to take our order, and we began our meal with an appetizer of bruschetta, which, while flavorful, did not justify its cost of nearly $10 for a simple bread dish topped with tomatoes and dressing. Our daughter opted for the macaroni and cheese dish from the children's menu, which, much to our disappointment, turned out to be a pre-packaged, microwaved variety rather than the authentic, homemade version we had been led to expect. Despite this, her hunger prompted her to consume the dish nonetheless. My wife selected the lasagna entrÃ©e, which she found satisfying, albeit overpriced at $12. I opted for the Tuscan Panini, which proved to be the highlight of our meal, boasting an impressive taste and presentation. However, taking into account the considerable number of unoccupied tables on a typically busy Saturday night, it appears that this eatery may need to reassess certain aspects of its operations to ensure its continued success.

Furthermore, the musical accompaniment, characterized by decibel levels akin to those of a nocturnal entertainment establishment, contributed to an environment that was not especially conducive to relaxation or enjoyment.

Moreover, I am uncertain about the nature of the ingredients utilized in their products, and I harbor doubts about the authenticity of my raspberry shake, given its absence of seeds (typically a reliable indicator of naturalness) and its slightly synthetic taste. Concerns regarding the hormone-free status of their milk also linger. Despite these reservations, the venue boasts a charming ambiance that appeals to patrons of diverse age groups, and during our latest visit, we became acquainted with K-9 Custard, a canine treat that our furry companion relished thoroughly (priced at $2.75, ensure your pet's hunger before purchasing!).

Thus, I opted to introduce TJ to the local delicacy, albeit with mixed results. Our shared platter, comprising a medium-sized smoked meat sandwich, fries, coleslaw, and a pickle, presented several positives, including copious sustenance for two individuals, commendable fries, and a flavorful pickle. However, certain drawbacks, such as an elevated price point (approximately $15 for a single serving) and underwhelming smoked meat (dry, salty, and excessively processed), tempered our enthusiasm.

Moreover, the assertion 'your order will be right out' was tantamount to an unfortunate prognostication, as it took a staggering 35 minutes for our culinary selections to arrive. Unfortunately, the fare did not live up to expectations, with my omelette being merely passable, the hashbrowns bordering on inedibility, and the french toast possessing an acrid flavor reminiscent of burnt offerings. However, the black angus burger proved to be a delectable exception to this trend, prompting me to regret my initial decision to order otherwise.

Subsequently, we opted to share the renowned Biloxi chicken sandwich, which, regrettably, exhibited a notable lack of moisture and a certain blandness, coupled with the My Wife's Favorite Salad (featuring duck confit), an uninspired assemblage that neglected to impress. Furthermore, the Caesar salad, adorned with an unpalatable abundance of kale, tragically fell short of our expectations, its flavor profile reduced to a barely perceptible hint of saltiness derived from the minute shreds of overcooked, previously prepared fried egg situated atop the bed of wilted lettuce. Fortunately, the attentive bartender, cognizant of the unappealing nature of the offending egg, graciously provided a fresh, properly cooked alternative, thus salvaging the dish from utter disaster.

The buffet itself was rather diminutive and offered a limited selection of subpar Asian cuisine, including several platters of shrimp and fish, a few plates of sushi encased in plastic wrap, and a scant amount of crab legs. The dessert bar was a disappointment - consisting of generic cookies, stale cake, fruit, pudding, and soft-serve ice cream. During our hour-long stay, I made five excursions to the buffet, and not once did the staff replenish the offerings. The spare ribs appeared unappetizing, which garnered attention from the numerous clientele, resulting in minimal consumption. Conversely, the crab proved to be the crowd favorite, as everyone availed themselves of copious amounts. Personally, I am not partial to seafood.

Nonetheless, we found the cupcakes to be suitably moist and the frosting to be of satisfactory quality, which, in our opinion, are the primary criteria for an enjoyable cupcake experience.  

Regrettably, our encounter was not without its drawbacks. Upon entering the establishment, we were met with a noticeable lack of warmth and hospitality from the staff members present. Their demeanor could be described as brusque and impatient, giving us the distinct impression that they would have preferred us to vacate the premises as expeditiously as possible. This was particularly perplexing given the relatively low volume of customers at the time of our visit, which led us to surmise that perhaps the proprietors or their employees were experiencing an off day. Additionally, our sampling of further flavors yielded less than desirable results, specifically in the case of the orange creamsicle and strawberry cupcakes, which exhibited an overly synthetic taste and an unpleasant chemical odor that we found objectionable.  

In conclusion, while the cupcakes themselves were certainly palatable, the deficiency in customer service and the questionable quality of certain flavors left us feeling ambivalent about our overall experience at this bakery.

We were informed that it was the former, yet its taste closely resembled the latter.

Flat Top's 'pick-your-own-ingredients' approach does possess a certain level of ingenuity, as it effectively transfers culpability onto the patron, should the food fail to meet expectations.

However, my most recent visit proved to be somewhat disappointing, as my companions and I were not acknowledged by any member of the staff stationed at what appeared to be a host stand, and we were forced to wait for several minutes while the servers congregated near the entrance, seemingly oblivious to our presence. We ultimately decided to take matters into our own hands and locate a table ourselves, only to discover that the vast majority of tables sported ""reserved"" signs, which, while understandable, led me to anticipate some degree of assistance from the staff in securing a suitable table. Instead, our server approached us and inquired whether we had simply ""walked in,"" and whether we required menus, before informing us that the table we had selected was, in fact, reserved, and that any other table would be suitable, and that she would attend to us momentarily. We managed to find the sole remaining unoccupied table, only to be informed by a member of the sizable party responsible for the reservation of the tables that even that table was earmarked for their use. It is my understanding that it is reasonable for a large gathering to dine at a restaurant, but I could not help but feel that the staff's attention was focused primarily on that particular group, to the detriment of other patrons.

It is renowned for its Southern and Louisiana-style culinary offerings, which, while not particularly impressive in my opinion, seem to be well-liked by those who partake in such fare. Specifically, their gyro sandwiches are somewhat palatable, but the Creole dishes I sampled, specifically the shrimp and blackened fish, were excessively salted and heavy, rendering them unsuitable for my taste.

However, my most recent visit, which took place in the evening and was intended to celebrate a dear friend's anniversary of their birth, unfortunately did not live up to my lofty expectations. Our group, which consisted of numerous individuals, gathered in the bar area and occupied the three central tables, which were situated at a considerable height. It is worth noting that the server appeared to be responsible for attending to both the bar patrons and certain tables in the dining area, which may have contributed to the sluggish pace of service that we encountered. 
 After placing my order for a beverage, I waited for an extended period of time, approximately twenty minutes, before it was brought to my attention. It is worth noting that a companion's culinary selection, which was placed at roughly the same time as my drink order, arrived a full ten minutes prior to the arrival of my beverage. Furthermore, our proximity to the bar area did little to expedite the delivery of our orders. Upon inspecting the menu, I discovered that the advertised drink did not align with my expectations, as it was described as a martini-style beverage but was instead presented in a wine glass and possessed a sickly sweet flavor profile. Consequently, I chose to return the drink to the server and requested an alternative selection. Unfortunately, the second drink took an additional fifteen minutes to arrive, further contributing to my disappointment. 
 It is worth noting that the menu selections for dinner, specifically the small plates and entrees, left much to be desired. As a group, we were interested in ordering several shareable dishes, but the options listed on the menu did not appear to lend themselves well to sharing. Moreover, it seemed that every dish featured bacon as an ingredient, which may not appeal to all diners. Additionally, the prices listed for the entrees struck me as somewhat exorbitant, particularly the tilapia dish, which carried a price tag of twenty-two dollars.

We were thoroughly delighted with the tariffs, and every bartender/server we encountered exuded cordiality. The deep-fried cheese curds were utterly delectable, incidentally; their flavor was so intense that it nearly eclipsed my capacity to articulate a coherent thought (being a native of Wisconsin, I have an innate proclivity for such culinary delights). Unfortunately, the seating arrangements at the bar left much to be desired in terms of comfort; the stools were so uncomfortable that they bordered on the unbearable. Notwithstanding this minor drawback, we derived sufficient enjoyment from our visit to consider repeating the experience in the future, albeit while occupying a table instead.

P.S. My companion and I found ourselves in a state of utter perplexity regarding whether to document our observations concerning the server whose attire was so scanty that it approached the realm of impropriety. While acknowledging the reality that bars often employ scantily clad servers to augment their patrons' experiences and boost their gratuities, we could not help but wonder if such an outfit was truly necessary or appropriate within the context of a family-oriented establishment like The Lodge.

As a connoisseur of this particular condiment, I must confess that it ranks among the finest specimens I have had the pleasure of sampling in recent times.

Upon entering, I was faced with a daunting dilemma - what to order from the extensive menu? This proved to be a formidable challenge, rivaled only by the complexity of the ACT exam. After deliberating at length, I decided to deviate from my customary burger and instead opted for the pie sampler, reasoning that it would afford me the opportunity to sample a variety of flavors without committing to a single entree. However, this decision ultimately proved to be a miscalculation, as the sampler, though replete with an array of savory pies, left me feeling somewhat unsatisfied due to its modest portion size. Each individual pie boasted exceptional quality, yet this was somewhat mitigated by the fact that it was merely an appetizer, leaving me still yearning for a more substantial meal. In retrospect, I would have been better served by selecting either a whole pie or a burger, or perhaps even pairing the sampler with one of these options. My companion's burger, which I surreptitiously sampled, appeared to be of exceptional quality, and I must admit that I was tempted to pilfer a few more fries had my friend not been vigilant.

The biscuit, in particular, was suffused with an abundance of butter, exuding an irresistible aroma and warmth. Unfortunately, the sheer magnitude of the meal proved to be too much for my digestive system, as I was unable to consume the entirety of the biscuit or the remainder of the dish.

Upon successfully navigating the gauntlet of the hostess's scrutiny, I opted to sample a Lycheetini from the bar, finding it quite palatable and potentially worthy of further exploration, had I not been concerned with preserving sufficient gastric capacity for the culinary offerings yet to come.

Following our escort into the dining area via a modern elevator, I couldn't help but be impressed by the stylish contemporary Asian motif that permeated the interior design, which was complemented by the attentive and responsive service provided by both our primary server and the supporting staff, ensuring that our beverages remained consistently replenished throughout the meal.

While the fare itself was certainly satisfactory, it was evident that the true value proposition lay not in the food, but rather in the unique ambiance and atmospheric qualities that pervaded the space, fostering an environment conducive to conviviality and relaxation among patrons.

Given the presence of traditional Filipino dishes such as lumpia, pancit, and adobo on the menu, it was reasonable to infer that the head chef was of Filipino descent, leading one of the staff members to inquire as to whether I shared any familial ties with the culinary expert, to which I responded that, while I did not possess any direct blood relations with the chef, I could appreciate the cultural significance and richness of Filipino cuisine.

Consequently, I opted for a less ambitious order, forgoing both the Cajun fries and the medium sauce, which, in hindsight, I might have relished had I been adequately informed.

Furthermore, the portion size was excessive, rendering us unable to fully consume it and leaving no room to sample any of the main courses listed on the menu. 

In retrospect, I have learned that it is wiser to adhere to my own gustatory preferences when dining, rather than placing trust in the judgment of an unfamiliar individual, especially on a first date. While the dish itself was not unpalatable, its weighty nature made it more suitable for a group of four or more individuals, rather than just two. 

Despite this experience, I still maintain that Richardson's boasts an attractive ambiance, making it an ideal location for a social engagement.

The original text describes a person's experience at a bar as average, mentioning the view, location, and drinks. To modify it to use longer and more complex sentences and professional vocabulary, we can rephrase it as follows:

""An experience that fell short of expectations, characterized by a sense of monotony and lackluster surroundings, albeit with a few redeeming features.""

This modified text uses longer sentences and more advanced vocabulary, such as ""fell short of expectations,"" ""monotony,"" and ""lackluster surroundings,"" while still conveying the same meaning as the original text. It also maintains the same tone and structure, with a brief description of the experience followed by a mention of the location and drinks.

Here's a breakdown of the modifications made:

* ""Pretty average experience"" became ""An experience that fell short of expectations."" This phrase is more formal and implies a certain level of disappointment.
* ""Great view"" became ""A sense of monotony."" This phrase suggests a feeling of repetition or dullness, which can be seen in the context of the abandoned buildings and lack of excitement.
* ""Until you walk closer to the wall and you see nothing but abandoned buildings until you see South Mountain"" became ""Albeit with a few redeeming features."" This phrase acknowledges that there were some positive aspects to the experience, but they were not enough to overcome the overall feeling of disappointment.
* ""It was cool being next to US Airways Arena and Chase field"" became ""Characterized by a sense of proximity to notable landmarks."" This phrase uses more formal language to describe the location of the bar in relation to nearby attractions.
* ""For some reason I thought this bar was on the top of the hotel, but it's only on the third floor"" became ""Boasting an unremarkable altitude."" This phrase uses more formal language to describe the location of the bar within the hotel, emphasizing its lack of distinction.
* ""Decent spot, drinks were okay, I might come back again if people from out of town are here"" became ""With a few redeeming features, including an acceptable ambiance and passable beverages, the possibility of future visits remains.""

While some dishes undoubtedly boast delectable flavors, others fall short of expectations, rendering the entire experience a veritable gamble. The first time I visited this establishment, I opted for the Spinach 4-Cheese Quesadilla, only to be met with a dish that was excessively oily and cheesy, bordering on overwhelming. Mind you, I am cognizant of the fact that the name itself implies a generous amount of cheese, yet there exists a delicate equilibrium that must be struck in order to achieve true gastronomic harmony. In contrast, my companion's rendition of the same dish, ordered on a separate occasion, was much more balanced in its composition. On a subsequent visit, I elected to sample the Veggie Rice Bowl, which, while flavorful, suffered from an unfortunate overcooking of the tofu. Furthermore, our order of the Vegan Spinach & Artichoke Dip proved underwhelming, prompting us to seek alternatives. My friend, however, found great pleasure in their salmon entree, while another acquaintance enjoyed both the Pollo Fresca and the Chicken Shawarma Wrap. During my third visit, I opted for the Veggie Bowl once again, omitting the tofu this time around, and found it significantly improved.

In my opinion, the current layout of the Joint features a well-designed flow of people in and out, although I am perplexed as to why they opted against installing a reversible escalator, which would have enabled a portion of the crowd to descend via escalator and the remainder by stairs.

During my most recent visit to witness a performance by the legendary rock band KISS, I was seated in the balcony section. To my surprise, I found the balcony seating to be significantly more enjoyable than the floor seating, primarily due to the fact that the latter was characterized by an overwhelming sense of claustrophobia, with attendees packed tightly together like sardines. In contrast, the balcony offered plush, theatre-style seating that afforded me a high degree of comfort throughout the duration of the show.

The Joint's sound and lighting systems are truly exceptional, and KISS's elaborate pyrotechnic effects were accentuated by the superb lighting. One minor drawback was that the catwalk, while providing an excellent vantage point for certain sections of the audience, obstructed the view of the stage for some unfortunate individuals.

While there are only a select few performances that I would deem worthy of attendance at The Joint, I would certainly consider returning, provided that I could secure a table seat situated on one of the side balconies. This, in my estimation, would provide the optimal viewing experience.

A case in point is the crawfish scampi appetizer, which, in its traditional preparation, relies on a subtle infusion of garlic, herbs, and, on occasion, a judicious sprinkling of red pepper flakes to enhance the delicate taste of the shellfish. Unfortunately, the Cajun Queen's interpretation of this dish involves an egregious application of chili, effectively subsuming the crawfish's natural sweetness beneath a fiery blanket of spice. Furthermore, this penchant for extreme seasoning renders the scampi eerily reminiscent of the etouffee, a dish that is intentionally designed to showcase a more pronounced level of heat.

I relished a delectable dinner at Fleur de Lys last month, yet nothing truly astounded me.  I opted for the $59 prix fixe menu, which encompasses an appetizer, entree, and dessert - ultimately, a commendable value!  

I savored the rich, earthy onion soup, served with shaved truffles and duck, its presentation was unforeseen.  Next, I indulged in gently heated salmon accompanied by julienne vegetables and a green horseradish sauce.  My salmon was cooked to perfection, and the dish's appearance was aesthetically pleasing; however, the sauce, frankly, tasted akin to grass clippings - bitter and overpowering.  My companion seemed to relish her stout braised short ribs.  The trio of chocolate desserts fell short of my expectations: a dry soufflÃ©, a salty peanut butter shake, and Baily's ice cream.  None of the desserts genuinely impressed me.  Perhaps my expectations were excessively high, given that it is Hubert Keller's establishment.

  All four of us opted for the tasting menu, with two individuals selecting the wine pairing option as well. The visual aspect of the dishes was undeniably impressive. We initiated our meal with a preliminary palette cleanser of sorts. The first course consisted of either a mushroom soup or a salad, wherein I chose the former, and my spouse opted for the latter. While both dishes were satisfactory, they failed to elicit an exceptional degree of culinary delight.

The concluding dessert course featured blue cotton candy and chocolate cake accompanied by banana gelato, the former of which proved to be a pleasant surprise.

The Flamingo, a veritable bastion of gaming and entertainment, has been a fixture on the Las Vegas Strip for decades. My initial visit to this esteemed establishment dates back to 1987, when my friend's parents, ardent devotees of Lady Luck, ventured to Sin City to indulge in their passion for gambling. As we were still in our tender years and unable to partake in the adult pursuits of gaming and driving, I accompanied my companion to the arcade, where we became thoroughly engrossed in a turbo-charged Ms. Pacman machine, our minds and fingers working in tandem to navigate the frenetic maze. Following this exhilarating escapade, we embarked upon a leisurely perambulation along the famed boulevard, basking in the vibrant ambiance that enveloped us.

My return to the Flamingo last week marked a significant departure from my previous experience, as the passage of time has wrought subtle yet discernible changes in the property's appearance and ambiance. Upon entering the premises, I was struck by an unmistakable pall of stale, smoke-laden air that permeated the atmosphere, evocative of the smoking rooms found in certain budget-friendly motels. This initial discomfort, however, was soon dispelled by the improved circulation that greeted me within the hall, leading me to appreciate the venue's unique layout, which, while admittedly somewhat perplexing, afforded me the opportunity to savor a few pints of Sam Adams on tap at the bar in the company of my German colleague, who had recently arrived from abroad.

1. The practice of pouring cream into coffee without first inquiring about preferences regarding dairy substitutes resulted in an unintended addition of half-and-half to my spouse's beverage, despite my desire to customize it with skim milk. Although the staff accommodated my request for a new drink, it would be preferable to have control over the creative process behind my coffee concoction.  
2. The background music consisted of a radio station featuring recurring advertisements, which created an atmosphere akin to being trapped in a shop playing the same irritating tunes and commercials repeatedly. A simple solution would be to curate a playlist or employ an iPod to create a more enjoyable auditory experience for patrons.   
3. While the coffee was satisfactory, the menu items appeared appetizing, but comments regarding the cost have been voiced. Nonetheless, it seems illogical to visit a coffeehouse anticipating a full meal. Prices were only marginally higher than expected.  
4. The availability of beer and the prominent display of a large pizza banner near the entrance raised questions about the establishment's identity.

Alas, Cheddatruck failed to captivate my taste buds, leaving me feeling underwhelmed and unimpressed. My companion, who shares my ardor for burgers, eagerly anticipated the opportunity to sample their mac-n-cheese embellished burger, only to be thwarted by the absence of this pivotal ingredient. Thus, he settled for an alternative option, adorned with an egg, while I opted for a straightforward cheeseburger. In addition, we elected to order tots, handcrafted, no less.  

Unfortunately, our burgers proved to be merely passable, with mine suffering from a slight overcooking and a general dearth of flavor. My companion concurred, describing his burger as unremarkable and forgettable. The tots, despite their artisanal preparation, disappointed us, lacking the rich, savory flavors we had anticipated, even with the presence of cheese within them and the accompaniment of an herb-infused cream cheese dipping sauce. Moreover, the price of $3 for a mere seven tots struck us as somewhat exorbitant.

The venue experiences a high volume of patronage, with a constant influx of customers from 11 am onward, culminating in either the exhaustion of the daily menu items or the closure of the eatery. It is imperative to note that the restaurant only accepts paper currency, thus it is advisable to verify the availability of funds in one's wallet prior to arrival, and refrain from allowing the presence of pedestrians gathered adjacent to the sidewalk to deter you, as this phenomenon is customary and not indicative of any anomaly. The ordering process is expedited, resulting in the rapid procurement of culinary items, followed by a prompt departure to accommodate the succeeding patron in line.

This establishment exudes an aura of authenticity, as evidenced by the lengthy queues and numerous patrons in attendance. My companion awarded five stars in recognition of the culinary excellence displayed by the eatery. 
  Notwithstanding, one cannot help but wonder if the prolonged waiting period is truly justified. The duration of the queue significantly diminishes the overall rating, relegating it to a mere three stars. The system employed for organizing the queue was utterly perplexing. Numerous patrons have pointed out that there are separate lines for various types of fare. In total, there are six distinct lines, divided into two sets of three. The first set consists of lines dedicated to pork (abodaba), offal (including brains, tongue, stomach, tripe, intestines, et cetera), and beef (encompassing asada, et cetera). Despite its apparent length, the queue moved at a glacial pace, making the prolonged delay seem utterly absurd. 
  Upon drawing closer to the front of the line, it became apparent that the sluggishness was attributable to a single individual performing the duties of two people. Although he demonstrated remarkable speed in crafting the tacos, he was responsible for preparing a minimum of five tacos for every patron. Moreover, he produced an excess of fifty tacos while we waited, ostensibly for takeout orders (wrapped in foil and placed on paper plates). The combination of the time required per person and the additional tasks undertaken by the taco artisan for the benefit of those not present in the queue contributes substantially to the interminable delay.

In the event that you find yourself in close proximity and are seeking a rapid consumable meal, this venue may prove satisfactory. However, if your gastronomical inclinations lean towards genuinely exceptional Chinese cuisine, I would strongly advise venturing elsewhere, perhaps to Spring Mountain or, more specifically, the Golden State itself. Having recently returned from Los Angeles, where I indulged in some truly remarkable Chinese fare, my dining experience at this location proved underwhelming.

3," ""I recently had the opportunity to observe this production for the second time, having previously experienced it without my spouse, who expressed a strong desire to view it. This particular show diverges significantly from the conventional Cirque du Soleil offerings, possessing a distinct emphasis on Asian-inspired elements, swordplay, and acrobatic feats. Unlike the majority of Cirque du Soleil performances, which tend to resemble a dreamlike state with little coherence and an assortment of breathtaking, heart-stopping acrobatic acts, KA boasts a discernible narrative thread and utilizes wires in a manner that mitigates any sense of fear or apprehension. 

However, certain aspects of the production, such as the linguistic style employed and select characterizations (including a Tarzan-esque figure), prove challenging to fully comprehend or appreciate. Despite having had the chance to experience the show twice, it remains outside my personal preferences within the Cirque du Soleil repertoire, and thus, I am grateful for the affordable ticket prices obtained on both occasions. The single aspect that truly captivated me was the expansive mobile platform capable of shifting between horizontal and vertical orientations, with the concluding sequence featuring combat on the vertical surface being my favorite; regrettably, the remaining segments did not hold my interest to the same degree as other productions within the Cirque du Soleil canon.""",True,2481.0,formal

Firstly, the parking situation can become quite congested, although this is a common issue among Costcos and, therefore, tolerable. My primary concerns revolve around the sampling services. Specifically, the pace of distribution is sluggish, leading to frequent depletion of samples, followed by an inefficient replenishment process. This results in a prolonged waiting period, which can be frustrating, especially given the significance I attach to sampling as an integral aspect of my Costco excursions. In fact, I have visited other Costco locations where the sampling process operates with greater efficiency, characterized by a steady supply of offerings and a more seamless experience.  

Another drawback of this Costco lies in its car wash facilities. While the exterior cleaning function performs admirably, the interior remains unattended, lacking essential vacuuming amenities. Notably, this absence of vacuum services distinguishes this car wash from others that typically provide such features.  

Despite these shortcomings, I still derive pleasure from procuring beverages, such as beer and wine, at this Costco.

Secondly, it is my opinion that the pricing of said pizza is somewhat elevated, perhaps to an extent that may deter potential patrons who are seeking a more affordable dining option.  

Lastly, and unfortunately, the service I received during my visits was subpar, bordering on unacceptable. On one occasion, I was mistakenly served a different pizza than the one I had ordered, and I was forced to wait an additional ten minutes before receiving my correct order.

On our third evening of unbridled revelry, my priorities had been simplified to a considerable degree; specifically, I craved a chair.

Our seats were situated in an optimal location, specifically in the middle, approximately six rows away from the stage, offering us an unobstructed view of the performance. My expectations were surpassed by the captivating set design, which was further enhanced by the incorporation of water elements that contributed to the visual appeal of the show. However, my enthusiasm was tempered by a slight sense of disappointment. It is possible that my expectations were unreasonably high, but I found the comedic aspects of the production to be somewhat lacking. Specifically, the clown humor did not resonate with me, and I found it to be rather tedious. My hope was to witness more extraordinary feats of acrobatics, but apart from the breathtaking diving sequences (which require immense skill) and a select few other acts (such as the fire dancers and jumpers), I was left feeling underwhelmed. Furthermore, I struggled to decipher the narrative that the performers were attempting to convey, and certain scenes were downright perplexing. For instance, the presence of the individual holding the 1-800 sign was unclear to me. Additionally, I experienced a sense of unease during certain parts of the performance, as if it was attempting to transport me to a realm that was reminiscent of a surreal dreamscape. The red-coated performers, in particular, seemed to embody the stuff of which nightmares are composed.

Despite these drawbacks, our meals did come accompanied by several complimentary items such as a bowl of broth, a crispy cylindrical pastry, and a trio of deep-fried dumplings. However, the soup did not conform to my expectations of a traditional Thai soup, the spring roll was excessively oily, and the wontons lacked discernible flavor. My partner chose the yellow curry, while I selected the Panang variant; furthermore, I requested that my dish be prepared at the Thai spicy level, yet it was merely moderately piquant.

3," I find myself experiencing considerable ambivalence regarding First Friday, as I hold an ardent affection for communal gatherings, particularly those that showcase artistic expression and cultural creativity. However, my enthusiasm for this event is significantly diminished due to its glaring shortcomings. Despite being situated within the artistic hub of the city, First Friday fails to deliver an adequate representation of artistic endeavors. The scarcity of art galleries and the prevalence of commercialized street vendors, who prioritize financial gain over artistic integrity, contribute to the dearth of authentic artistic expression. Furthermore, the presence of unsavory elements and rowdy juveniles in the downtown area, coupled with the authorities' inability to effectively enforce curfew regulations, serves to further detract from the overall experience. While the culinary stalls during the summer months offer some solace, the absence of such vendors during the winter season only exacerbates the event's deficiencies.

The short ribs, on the other hand, were quite flavorful and did not possess the dubious taste often associated with lesser quality braised short ribs. Although the sauce accompanying the ribs was slightly too viscous for my liking, it did not detract substantially from the overall enjoyment of the dish.

Our servers were all very friendly and attentive.  The portions here are enormous and we did feel that they mislead us into ordering more food than we needed because we did ask if the starters were big enough to shared and they recommended that we order two.  Both plates were huge and we certainly could have just shared one between the two of us.  Not to mention the entrees were enough for 2-3 people to share.

Dr. Guy demonstrated proficiency in managing my situation, requesting an immediate radiograph and subsequently discussing my results, available options, and methods of pain relief. One's appreciation for a particular bodily component is often realized only when it becomes injured, leaving one utterly debilitated and experiencing excruciating pain.

However, the blackeyed peas and cornbread consistently impress, and their lemonade, arguably the finest in Charlotte, has garnered high praise. A word of caution regarding the volunteers who handle beverage refills: they are renowned for their warmth and generosity, and a adept diner may even secure an additional portion of mac-n-cheese through skillful banter.

Organic produce, an aspect that earns my utmost approbation, serves as an indubitable testament to the restaurant's commitment to quality. Notwithstanding, my recent experiences have been somewhat disconcerting, prompting me to confer a rating of three stars, down from the perfect five stars I had previously assigned. While the baked items maintain their exceptional quality, the kitchen fare has, regrettably, fallen short of my expectations during my last few visits. Specifically, the pasta dish I ordered was marred by an excessive amount of oil, rendering it unpalatable. Moreover, my most recent visit saw the meatloaf sandwich, dubbed 'The Conservative,' arrive in a state of disarray, with the bread being unacceptably soggy and fragmented, compelling me to consume it with utensils rather than enjoying the customary convenience of a handheld sandwich. A prior experience with a comparable sandwich, when the restaurant first opened, yielded a more satisfactory outcome, leading me to surmise that either a change in bread or a disparity in culinary expertise might be responsible for the decline in quality.

Upon entering the establishment, I was immediately struck by the traditional Thai decor that permeated the interior space, fostering a warm and welcoming ambiance that, albeit quaint, did not feel overly cramped or congested, even during a presumably off-peak dining period. 
  The menu presented itself in a straightforward fashion, allowing patrons to select their preferred entrÃ©e and combine it with a choice of meat, thereby tailoring their dining experience according to individual preferences. In my case, I opted for the green curry, which, when prepared with chicken, promised to deliver a flavor profile characterized by a harmonious balance between the pungency of fresh green chilies and the richness of coconut milk. Unfortunately, the execution of this particular dish fell short of my expectations, as the green curry, while boasting an undeniably aromatic quality, lacked the requisite level of piquancy typically associated with such a preparation. However, in light of favorable reviews pertaining to the establishment's culinary offerings, I am inclined to attribute this shortcoming to a momentary lapse in the kitchen and intend to revisit Thai Taste in the near future, during which time I shall insist upon an extra-hot rendition of the green curry, thereby affording me the opportunity to sample the dish in its optimal form. 
  The prices charged by Thai Taste are eminently reasonable, and the attentive nature of the service afforded me a constant supply of replenished water, a considerate touch that did not go unappreciated. In a timely fashion, my meal arrived, and I relished every bite, ultimately departing the premises satiated and content.

3," In a culinary ocean saturated with gourmet eateries, occasionally one yearns for a mundane repast. For an unassuming cafÃ©, the edifice was not devoid of merit. We merely sought a quotidian sustenance for a tardy luncheon. Numerous establishments were still in the process of inaugurating their daily operations, while others proffered a restricted noontime menu. It was a Sunday replete with gridiron matches, thus numerous drinking establishments teemed with enthusiasts. 
The ambiance evoked memories of Cheesecake Factory, boasting an extensive bill of fare. The staff exhibited amicability. I opted for deep-fried poultry accompanied by mashed potatoes. Although not particularly greasy, the poultry possessed a discernible saltiness, situating it somewhere between mediocrity and excellence. The potatoes lacked a certain je ne sais quoi, but the savory chicken effectively counterbalanced the deficiency. I requested a Pear Martini, only to discover that the components were unavailable. Thus, I indulged in a scrumptious Strawberry Martini instead. My spouse opted for a cheeseburger and fries. While the latter satisfied my taste buds, I did not sample the former. Nevertheless, my better half consumed it with relish and claimed it surpassed his expectations.

However, if I had to pay for it myself, I might have been more critical since it's merely a mid-range buffet charging over $50 for two individuals. We visited on seafood Friday, and the offerings were unremarkable, with most dishes being standard fare found at many mid-range Las Vegas buffets. Our server was friendly and attentive, though, and the hot crab legs were quite enjoyable.  

However, some aspects were disappointing. The sushi was cold and lackluster, while the cold shrimp was mushy and lacking texture. Although the salmon appeared moist, its taste was underwhelming. The hush puppies were overly salty and crunchy, and the fried catfish had an unpleasant softness due to sitting out too long, despite having a flavor reminiscent of ""chicken fried"" catfish. The carrot cake and chocolate fudge pieces were also subpar, with the latter feeling almost weightless.  

In summary, the crab was the highlight, and the presentation of the shellfish dishes was visually appealing and flavorful. Everything else we tried was mediocre, neither terrible nor inedible.

Upon finally experiencing it for ourselves, we found the edibles to be quite satisfactory, warranting a rating of 4 to 5 stars.

Specifically, we were seated in a rather cramped area adjacent to a large table, and it took approximately 12 minutes before a server noticed our presence and attended to our needs. Subsequently, we received attentive care from our server, albeit at a pace that could be described as leisurely due to his responsibility for multiple sizeable tables.

I elected to sample their Brisket Burger, a delectable combination of a cheeseburger augmented with BBQ sauce, Brisket, and bacon. The portion of sauce accompanying my meal was appropriately proportioned, thereby preventing the bun from becoming overly saturated and compromising its structural integrity. The flavor profile of the Brisket was satisfying, although I would have preferred a more tender texture. My burger was cooked to a well-done finish, which was slightly disappointing as I generally prefer a slight pinkish hue to indicate a less thorough cooking process. In retrospect, I should have included this specification in the comment section while placing my order online.

In addition to the burger, I also requested a bowl of chicken tortilla soup as a supplementary item. This proved to be an excellent decision, as the soup was truly delicious and brimming with rich, bold flavors. The spicy kick was subtle yet discernible, and the generous helping of shredded chicken and corn elevated the dish to a superior level of culinary excellence.

Feeling somewhat exhausted and financially depleted due to my relentless pursuit of retail therapy, I opted to take a respite and partake in a casual repast at a nearby eatery. My thoughts were interrupted by an insistent craving for a delectable hamburger, which prompted me to seek out a suitable establishment capable of satiating my gastronomical yearnings. As fate would have it, a Red Robin restaurant happened to be situated within close proximity, thereby rendering it an ideal choice for my culinary endeavors. Admittedly, my initial reaction was tinged with incredulity, as there existed a plethora of exceptional dining options within the city limits, yet I chose to frequent a chain restaurant that was seemingly ubiquitous. However, my desire for a straightforward, uncomplicated dining experience ultimately prevailed, leading me to select this particular venue.

3," This establishment represented my second venture to indulge in the culinary delights of tapas while situated in the city of Las Vegas. The gastronomical offerings were merely adequate, with the exception of the paella, which proved to be a highlight of the dining experience. The duration of time allocated for the preparation of the meal was approximately 40 minutes, however, the delay was deemed acceptable considering the novelty of the dish. 

The hospitality displayed by the staff, ranging from the initial greeting upon entry to the attentive service provided by the wait staff and management, was truly commendable. Notwithstanding, the tariff associated with the consumables listed on the menu was, in my opinion, exorbitant, even when juxtaposed with the elevated prices customarily encountered within the Las Vegas Strip. This factor served as the primary deterrent against a potential return visit.

It is worth mentioning that alternative destinations offering tapas on the Vegas strip provide a superior value and variety, rendering a revisit to this particular venue unnecessary. The ambiance of the restaurant was quite pleasant, boasting an airy and well-lit atmosphere, accompanied by a bar section. The level of noise was moderate, and the premises were well-maintained, with the staff demonstrating efficiency in clearing tables upon completion of meals.

For the sake of comparison, it is pertinent to note that the author has had the pleasure of visiting another Grand Lux Cafe situated in the Beverly Center of Beverly Hills; and while both establishments share certain commonalities in terms of their ambiance and gastronomical offerings, this specific location boasts the unique distinction of being open for business on a twenty-four hour basis.

Upon arriving with a sizable contingent of approximately fifteen individuals, the group was able to secure seating arrangements without incident, despite the fact that it was peak dining time and no prior reservations had been made (it is customary to reserve tables at least two hours in advance).

While the dough was somewhat overly soft and difficult to handle without the toppings breaking apart, the flavor of the crust itself was quite satisfying. As a result, the author and her companion found themselves consuming the crust of each slice, leaving behind the toppings.

It is important to note that the menu at Grand Lux Cafe features an extensive array of culinary options, which bears a striking similarity to that of Cheesecake Factory, given that the two establishments share a common affiliation.

3," It is becoming increasingly arduous to discover exceptional gastronomical offerings at an affordable price point in Las Vegas, as the era of $5 buffets and $7.99 prime rib dinners appears to have dissipated into the annals of history. Lamentably, the dining landscape has shifted towards more exorbitant options, with even previously reasonable establishments now charging premium prices for their fare. During a recent visit to Sunset Station, this sentiment was reinforced when it was discovered that their prime rib dinner was being offered for a relatively steep $9.99 on a Saturday evening. Despite the bustling atmosphere and ensuing 15-minute wait for a table, the quality of the prime rib was found to be satisfactory, yet not without room for improvement, specifically in regards to the doneness level, as a medium rare preparation may have yielded a more palatable experience. The service, however, was commendable and the food, while not exceptional, was still of an acceptable standard. Yet, the pricing of the prime rib dinner, coupled with the $12.99 cost of the t-bone steak special, seemed somewhat excessive for a city known for its affordable dining options, thereby precluding a higher rating.

This in my eyes defeats the purpose of a supermarket as surely they are food first and TVs second? Clearly it works for them but it does get annoying as choices are limited. The freezer section is very small which for a poor student means I have limited choices in frozen chips. I also find there is a lack of alternatives to brand names i.e. supermarket own brand. On some occasions I would much prefer to just buy the supermarket brand but because this shop has a limited selection of food I can't do this all the time. \n\nI do enjoy the \""Oops!'' section though.

However, I must confess that I find the teriyaki sauce to be somewhat overpowering, so I requested that it be applied sparingly.

After receiving my bowl, I made my way to the condiment station, whereupon I discovered a variety of hot chili powders, sauces, and sliced green onions.

Although the bill was meticulously itemized for each individual party, much to my appreciation, a cursory examination revealed an unsolicited inclusion of a gratuity charge, which, while not necessarily problematic in and of itself, did strike me as somewhat dubious, particularly given the lack of transparent communication regarding its addition, leading to the possibility of unwitting duplication of tips by certain patrons, which, in turn, prompted me to bring it to the attention of those seated nearby, who expressed gratitude for the heads-up.

4," I have had the pleasure of visiting Vanguard on multiple occasions, and I must say, it is an exceptional establishment for those seeking a unique and expertly crafted cocktail experience. Upon entering the premises, one cannot help but notice the fastidious attention to detail in the maintenance of the bar area, which contributes to a welcoming ambiance that exudes sophistication and elegance. Furthermore, the staff has consistently demonstrated proficiency in efficiently accommodating patrons, even during peak hours, ensuring that imbibers can readily partake in their desired potations without undue delay.

Personally, I possess a penchant for exploring diverse beverages at various drinking establishments; however, when patronizing Vanguard, my preferences become decidedly narrowed, as I invariably opt for the Jack Rose cocktail, composed of apple brandy, maple syrup, and black cherry. The mere mental reflection upon its delectable flavors evokes an intense yearning within me for a glass of this sublime elixir. It is worth noting that the assorted beverages offered by Vanguard are indeed delectable, and following a couple of libations, a brief respite may be advisable to allow for proper digestion and appreciation of their intricate flavor profiles.

While Vanguard presents itself admirably, there are occasional drawbacks, specifically pertaining to the weekend evenings, when the atmosphere transforms into a more boisterous and vibrant setting, complemented by the presence of a disc jockey. Additionally, it is not uncommon for individuals hailing from Fremont to enter the establishment, engaging in eccentric behavior, such as aimlessly meandering or performing brief, impromptu dance sequences before departing. Despite these minor shortcomings, Vanguard remains an exceptional destination for those seeking a refined drinking experience.",True,3131.0,formal

However, our server's behavior was subpar, bordering on unacceptable, and his actions detracted significantly from our overall enjoyment of the evening. Despite his efforts to mar the experience, we cannot help but reflect upon the evening with fondness, appreciative of the establishment's unique charm and appeal. We arrived fashionably late, at approximately 9:00 PM, and were seated alfresco, surrounded by tasteful decor that expertly blended elements of Asian culture with modern flair. The restaurant's interior design was equally impressive, boasting dark wood accents, strategic lighting, and an atmosphere that struck the perfect balance between vibrancy and intimacy. The culinary offerings did not disappoint, with the Pad Thai and various appetizers showcasing the kitchen's proficiency in creating flavorful, well-executed dishes. Regrettably, our order of seared ahi tuna fell short of expectations, owing to its unfortunate state of being frozen, which rendered it unpalatable. While personal responsibility must be acknowledged, rumors persist that the restaurant could potentially source fresher, never frozen seafood options, thereby elevating the dining experience for patrons with discerning tastes.

We just got the plain pepperoni on one half and mushrooms and sausage on the other half. \nLast night we decided to try a stromboli. It was actually bigger than I had thought it was going to be. We went with the Chicken with artichokes and red pepper. I loved the artichokes in it, but other than that I think I would stick with the 6.99 stromboli's vs our specialty stromboli which was 12.99.

Some vets offer the service but after today's visit to Petsmart I won't go anywhere else. So the deal is I have a demon cat. Well, she's lovely and adorable with me, but for some reason fears all pet workers. No clue why, nothing bad has ever happened to her. \n\nKatie works Tuesday through Friday and starts at 7am, which I can appreciate because no one else should have to witness the dramatics my cat puts on. I arrived after calling ahead to see if Katie could shave Josie's haunches, so as to avoid bits clinging to her backside (gross.)  Katie got an E-collar on Josie and told me she was going to have to scruff her while she worked, which was just fine with me because the cat was screaming like a murder victim and otherwise being embarrassing. In less than ten minutes the job was done (for only $6!) and Josie was back in her carrier like nothing happened. \n\nLook, I had a veterinarian tell me that if I brought Josie in for any grooming they would SEDATE her, and she also recommended I get her declawed, which I believe is inhumane. Maybe Katie considers what she does completely normal and reasonable, but she's the first professional who has worked with Josie...professionally. \n\nI know my cat is a total freak but I can't shave her ass myself, so thank god Katie is at Petsmart.

Plates are heartily-sized and reasonably priced.\n\nMy Tom Xao Ca Ri ($12.50) was full of fresh vegetables (not overcooked -- a rarity for this neighborhood's Asian restaurants!) and jumbo shrimp. The original house specialties include Banh Tom Ho Tay (lightly friend shrimp and sweet potato cake, $13) and Ca Kho To (caramelized fish, $10). Their curries pack a welcomed spicy punch. The Canh Chua ($8) are all made with a homemade broth (cooked daily).  \n\nThe chef is forthright in sharing his values. MSG disgusts him and so does the 'watery salty stock' that other restaurants use. He also said too many cooks substitute natural ingredient flavor with copious amounts of oil. \n\nPetite Tonkinoise's only downfall? The decor isn't much to write about. It looks like a confused zen kitsch mini banquet hall.",,,informal
4,"Went to Puck's, last minute, for dinner with family. Located in Crystals Mall on the Strip near Aria, it has a bright semi open space, with a nice small bar area. Only had to wait 10 minutes for a Friday night walk-in around 9PM. Staff was adequately attentive.\n\nOverall, food was good. I tried the grilled ribeye steak, which was probably the priciest entree on the menu at $40. But it was cooked perfectly to my order (medium rare) with an unctuous reduction sauce which I wish I had more off. Topped off, it had a nice stem of mushrooms and blackened green chiles. (which was a nice touch of heat) to the dish. A perfectly acceptable opening meal night in Vegas. Nothing too fancy or spend, but good food still.\n\nSampled the tiramisu dessert at the end. Tasted really good. It had these nice chocolate beads in the creamy layer that added a surprising little crunch to the dish.\n\nEven though it's a mainly pasta/pizza & some seafood place, I can safely recommend the ribeye here. Enjoy the good eats.",,,informal

4,The family went last night after visiting North Lake Mall. You order at the counter and they bring you the food. Service was quick. Place was very busy.  I had the half-chicken plate and wife had the pulled pork plate. The plates come with two sides and garlic bread  Children had pork sandwich and chicken fingers. The chicken fingers can be ordered grilled which is healthier than fried  Everyone enjoyed their meals. Portions are good sized.  The BBQ sauces came in three varieties and were tasty. The sweet tea was also good.  Drinks are self-service.  The place was clean and staff was very friendly and helpful  I gave it four stars because the place was much better than average in all aspects and we will return when we are in the area.,,,informal

No, it's not authentic, but if you're just looking for some feel-good food come here. Portions are huge which is why it costs a bit (up to nine bucks after tax) but their best item is actuallt their cheapest the plain udon at under seven bucks after tax. \n\nTheir udon noodles are super thick you won't miss the meat. I have very Americanized tase buds I'll admit, but to me the broth is super tasty. I put in a cup of chili oil and it's bliss in a bowl. \n\nAlso gets points for atmosphere very clean, for just a few dollarsmore than fast food it's actually a place you can enjoy sitting in and spending time.",,,informal

""While I cannot attest to the veracity of the assertion that my coiffure necessitated an augmented level of effort due to its inherent density, I must confess that I harbor a certain degree of incredulity towards the notion that such a factor should serve as the basis for an exorbitant increase in remuneration. My previous experiences at this establishment had been marked by a hitherto unwavering satisfaction with the quality of service rendered, and it was not until my fourth visit that I encountered this anomalous instance of fiscal discrepancy. It is worth noting, however, that subsequent interactions with the proprietor, Ernie, served to assuage my concerns and ultimately resulted in a gratuitous haircut during my subsequent visit, thereby obviating any further pecuniary disagreements.""",True,3235.0,formal

The woman at reception apologized and then proceeded to upgrade us with a bigger room with the best view of the strip (in my opinion). \n\nThe pools were why we decided to stay here and we weren't disappointed.  Two small pools, a lazy river, and a large wave pool (only one wave every five or ten minutes though). The pool vibe was much tamer than I expected.  Daylight (day pool party) was going strong, but steep cover charge.  \n\nGreat food options around the casino. The bars inside were pricey, but to be expected.  Overall, this was a great place to stay and would come back.",,,informal

I don't care that they don't have like 20 flavors like BWs, because their sauces are tasty and they run the spice gamut.

4,"I started off my visit to Quaker Steak with the Atomic Wing Challenge, which is just eating six of their atomic wings.  Six wings obviously isn't much, but the atomic wings are quite spicy and they require that you sign a liability waiver before eating them (this is more for show than anything).  Yes, they're pretty damn hot, but they're bearable as long as you have a good tolerance for spicy food.  If you're comfortable eating foods with habaneros in them, then you'll have no problem with the atomic wings.  Here's a pro-tip though: if you're getting the atomic wings, ask them for a pair of food-handling gloves.  This way you can avoid getting wing sauce all over your hands, allowing you to actually touch your eyes or use the restroom later that day without torturing yourself.\n\nAnyway, after I finished that off, I went back and got some more wings - Louisiana Lickers, Arizona Ranch, and Golden Garlic.  I was impressed with the flavors, as everything was quite good.  The wings were nice and meaty too, which is good because a lot of wing places manage to hunt down wings with almost no meat on them, which kind of defeats the purpose of eating them in the first place.\n\nMy one complaint is that I think the wings are a bit overpriced.  A half dozen wings is $5, and 83 cents per wing seems rather high to me.  Still though, these wings are much better than most, so it's probably worth it.",,,informal

4," This marked the culmination of our utilization of the LALALA ramen pass, and it was utterly magnificent to terminate our two-week Los Angeles ramen excursion with such a delectable ramen dish in Las Vegas.

The pork incorporated into our soup bowl exuded a smoky and sultry essence, accented by a faint hint of wood-fired barbecue char, which endowed the flavor with a profound intensity and singularity. The subtlety of the smokiness effectively withstood the multifaceted flavors of the ramen broth, creating a harmonious balance of tastes. Our server displayed exceptional attentiveness, ensuring that we thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience. She persistently lingered near us and even extended her well wishes as we departed.

Ramen Misoya Tomi strives to differentiate itself by introducing unconventional elements to their recipes while maintaining the customary meticulous attention to detail. Although the ambiance could benefit from enhancements, specifically the removal of oversized posters promoting the advantages of miso, the spaciousness of the establishment makes it an ideal setting for gatherings.

In point of fact, I paid a visit to this beloved eatery at midday today, and I was delighted to discover that they have recently introduced pizza to their menu, which is now under new proprietorship. It is worth noting that the quality of their sandwiches remains unwavering and of the highest standard, which is a testament to their commitment to culinary excellence. Furthermore, I must admit that the pizza I sampled was quite satisfactory, although I do wish they would consider offering individual slices for sale instead of requiring customers to purchase two at a time. However, I must express some disappointment regarding the level of service provided by the new ownership, which, while not necessarily poor, lacked the warmth and personal touch that characterized the tenure of the previous proprietors. Specifically, I recall the former owner's customary practice of socializing with patrons, engaging in conversation, and fostering a welcoming ambiance that greatly enhanced the overall dining experience. In light of this, I humbly suggest that the current management endeavor to emulate this aspect of their predecessors' approach, as I am convinced that cultivating a rapport with clientele is crucial to ensuring their continued loyalty and patronage.

There were also lunch bentos (pick 2 from a list) but all were cooked options.\n\nI opted for sushi, so I could try the rice.  After the soup and salad, I was presented with a very simple but beautiful plate...with generous cuts of nigiri and the roll.  I received 2 pieces each of maguro (very deep red, beautiful), nama sake, and hamachi.  They were arranged in a colorful pattern.

What I was not aware of, prior to this visit for a mid day impromptu lunch redemption, was that Komol lays out some seriously good Thai food.  \n\nSo here I was, far from my comfort zone again trying new and exciting entrees that I would have never even thought of trying before. My arm was twisted twice this day...once to go here in the first place (glad I did) and the second was to try a dish with tofu.  What?!!? No meat!  I now know what the big to do is all about.  The meal went like this...Fresh spring rolls that were delicious and unlike others I've had, not greasy.  Pad kee mow with tofu, spicy level 3 since I'm a baby.  This dish was quite tasty...at first I skirted around the tofu; then I believe I compromised it all and refused to share it.  The final dish was Panang curry with chicken; finally the meat makes its presence known...level 3 again.  \n\nSorry to all experienced Thai foodies, my pallet cannot yet handle the crazy spiciness; with time I will slowly increase this to a 10 and just know that over the next few visits I will be updating this review to a 5.

What truly sets Jasmine Tokyo apart is the inclusion of authentic seafood such as tuna, salmon, and snapper nigiri, which were exceptionally fresh and flavorful.  

In addition to the delectable sushi, the fried rice, Chinese sausages, and grilled chicken are also culinary masterpieces. Even the raw oysters, which I have never particularly enjoyed in Arizona before, were surprisingly palatable.  

The service at Jasmine Tokyo was warm and welcoming, and the ambiance, reminiscent of a former Claim Jumper, added to the overall dining experience.

4," ""Indubitably, Bouchon presents itself as a rather enigmatic venue, shrouded in an air of obscurity due to its seemingly deliberate placement in a rather unorthodox location within the labyrinthine confines of the Venetian. Perchance, the notion of incorporating a compass into the casino's layout would alleviate some of the confusion encountered by patrons attempting to navigate their way to this culinary establishment; alas, such an implement remains conspicuously absent. Instead, one must rely upon the meager guidance proffered by preceding reviewers, whose directions often prove as convoluted as the layout itself. Suffice it to say, Bouchon lies adjacent to the registration lobby, accessible via elevators that ascend to the second floor.  
Upon arriving at the eatery, a brief delay ensued before we were seated for brunch, during which time we perused the menu, finding it to be largely synonymous with the breakfast selection, save for a few supplementary offerings. Thus, our expectations were suitably tempered, yet we remained optimistic regarding the impending culinary experience.  
The chicken and waffles proved to be an unmitigated delight, as the latter boasted an ingenious inclusion of bacon bits, imbuing each bite with a sublime smokiness that complemented the juicy, roasted poultry perfectly. Arguably, this dish reigns supreme among its peers, rendering superfluous any attempts at comparison. In short, it is an absolute must-try.  
Conversely, the French toast, while visually appealing, failed to elicit the same level of enthusiasm as its predecessor. Perhaps, it was the underwhelming presentation or the palpable lack of innovation that contributed to our relative indifference toward this particular item.  
The ambiance of the restaurant, unfortunately, did not escape our scrutiny unscathed. With its outdated decor and cramped, haphazardly arranged tables, Bouchon suffered a slight diminution in esteem. Furthermore, the presence of solitary elderly gentlemen, their coughs echoing through the space, only served to enhance our awareness of the potential health risks associated with such proximity. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, we persist in wholeheartedly recommending Bouchon, if only for the unparalleled excellence of its chicken and waffles.""",True,3360.0,formal

As a pescatarian, I tend to gravitate towards the fish or seafood specials, which are artfully presented alongside a thoughtfully curated standard menu, complemented by an assortment of daily specials inscribed on chalkboards dispersed throughout the restaurant.

During my most recent visit, I relished the blackened scallop appetizer as my entrÃ©e, accompanied by a generous house salad. While the scallops exhibited a slight saltiness, their texture was cooked to perfection, and they were served atop a crispy tortilla, accompanied by a medley of rice, beans, and a spicy sauce that added a delightful zest to the dish. The salads, in particular, prove to be a highlight, with many of the entrÃ©e specials thoughtfully paired with a starter salad. In the company of four fellow diners, we opted to share a bottle of wine and a plain pizza as an appetizer, rendering dessert an afterthought, as none of us could muster the requisite capacity to indulge in anything further.

Cinnamon / orange infused. Pretty much tasted like Triaminic cold and cough. Pass on it, trust me.\n2) The bathroom sinks...I can't stand these things. Whoever thought a slightly tilted slab of tile would work as a sink...dude, you were waaaay wrong. Give me a basin and save my clothing from the splash back and the whopping 2 inches of space to place my hands under, please. \n\nBottom line: Great place to hang, plenty of room to move, cool staff, great food. Just beware of the bathroom sinks....",,,informal

Something for every seafood lover.\nThe Mexican food could use a little work, the enchiladas have been hard but they have lots of Asian choices and the American part of the buffet has always been delicious.\nAnd the deserts?

Drawing comparisons with other eateries under the same culinary umbrella, the fare presented here surpasses expectations, boasting an extensive array of delectable options that cater to diverse tastes.

Furthermore, the portion sizes are relatively diminutive, which may prove disappointing for patrons who crave more substantial helpings.

The piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance of their menu, these delectable sandwiches boast a freshly baked bread that delicately balances a satisfying crunch and warmth, courtesy of Hue Thai's diligent preparation. My gastronomical exploits have led me to conclude that this eatery reigns supreme in the realm of Vietnamese sandwiches within Las Vegas.  

Other menu items: Although they offer an array of Vietnamese, Chinese, and Thai cuisine, the authenticity of these dishes leaves much to be desired. However, their Vietnamese sandwiches and boba tea (which is passable) are the exceptions that prove the rule. Unfortunately, their pho falls short of my expectations. 

Price: A veritable steal! These scrumptious sandwiches can be had for the paltry sum of $3.50 apiece. However, be aware that a minimum purchase of $20 is required for the privilege of using a debit card, a caveat that may prove vexing for those who, like myself, eschew carrying cash. 

Ambiance: While dining at this establishment may not be the most aesthetically pleasing experience, owing to the curious combination of cleaning product and food odors and the rather jarring decorative scheme, it is by no means unpleasant. In fact, the design, which appears to be inspired by an underwater theme, adds a touch of whimsy to the proceedings.

Consequently, I undertook a quest to locate a reputable consignment venue where I could procure novel apparel for him as he developed. Fortunately, numerous such establishments exist in my vicinity (specifically, central Phoenix), and after visiting two other locations prior to arriving at Smarty Pants (with the caveat being not to frequent Urban Baby, as it proved unsatisfactory), I encountered a warm and hospitable reception from the mother-daughter ownership duo. They accepted the majority of the items I presented and, despite my initial intention to merely deposit my goods, I found myself indulging in a shopping spree, resulting in the acquisition of three superior tops for a mere $15 in total. The shop boasted an incredible inventory, maintained a spotless environment, and offered amiable service, thereby rendering it a veritable haven for customers. Additionally, I learned of their impending expansion into the adjacent space, destined to accommodate furniture, while the current location would feature an increased selection of adult attire (although, it's possible that the new space would be designated for clothing, with the existing one being upgraded to accommodate more adult fashion).

The meticulous design of the venue, coupled with its impressive acoustic properties, creates an ambiance that seamlessly blends the appeal of outdoor concerts with the intimate atmosphere of a club.

Therefore, we decided to abandon our endeavors at said burger joint and venture forth to this esteemed eatery instead. Verily, the contrast was nothing short of stark. The service we received here was indeed impeccable, albeit not in the least bit haughty or pretentious. My companion and I elected to partake in distinct tasting menus, with mine being the Alain Ducasse four-course variety, sans wine, of course. The culinary journey began with a refreshing amuse-bouche of cold broccoli soup, followed by an absolutely delectable lobster curry, succeeded by a heavenly portion of foie gras atop a tender filet, and ultimately concluded with a sublime Armagnac dessert. I must confess that the presentation and flavors of each dish were, for the most part, truly captivating.

The single most important factor is the broth which gives it the flavor, and I'm happy to say that Kinh Do has a great pho broth.\n\nI don't care for beef too much, so I order chicken pho like I normally do and it has been great every time. The bean sprouts + basil leaves are fresh and those go well with the meal. Like I mentioned already, the broth here is awesome.

4," I have had the pleasure of visiting St Francis on multiple occasions, and my culinary experiences there have consistently exceeded my expectations, but one particular dish stands out as an exemplary illustration of gastronomic excellence. The forbidden rice bowl, with its vibrant medley of flavors, literally explodes in the mouth, leaving a lasting impression of pure delight. Upon ordering, I opted to add chicken for an additional layer of protein, which not only enhanced the dish's already impressive flavor profile but also arrived at the table with unparalleled freshness, accompanied by meticulously prepared vegetables that were cooked to perfection. However, the true piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance was undoubtedly the sauce, boasting an intricate balance of delicate, aromatic, and subtle notes that harmoniously complemented the dish's other components. So captivated was I by this culinary masterpiece that I devoured most of it during lunch, only to savor the remaining portion later that evening, transforming what typically constitutes a mundane, everyday meal into an extraordinary gustatory experience worthy of repetition. In fact, I am seriously considering a return visit in the near future, primarily motivated by the desire to once again partake in this exceptional dish, whose quality and appeal are truly deserving of such enthusiastic praise.",True,3511.0,formal

Although my experiences with superior Chinese cuisine in other municipalities have been numerous, the offerings presented by this eatery are, relative to the local gastronomic landscape, quite satisfactory. The fried rice, while not as crispy as I would have preferred, still boasts an adequate level of flavor. The Mongolian beef, although lacking the desired crispiness, showcases a commendable richness of taste. The Lo Mein, a dish comprising noodles, exhibits a pleasing texture and savory characteristics. However, the fried spring rolls accompanying the lunch specials fall somewhat short of my expectations. Despite these minor shortcomings, I genuinely appreciate the culinary offerings of this venue. Given the locality's limited options for quality Chinese cuisine, this restaurant emerges as a notable exception.

""A Dual Review of The Mill: An Authentic and Innovative Hub of Commerce and Culture\n\nThe Mill, an establishment that exudes an air of unpretentious sophistication, warrants a five-star rating on Yelp for its sheer coolness factor alone. While it has yet to fully realize its potential, this multifaceted venue boasts an array of captivating features that make it a standout destination. Allow me to elaborate on the aspects that render The Mill a truly singular experience.\n\nFirst and foremost, Big Ben British Pub, with its inviting ambiance and impressive selection of libations, is a veritable gem within The Mill's diverse landscape. Next, Zucca Pizza, a culinary masterpiece that artfully blends traditional Italian flavors with modern twists, is sure to leave even the most discerning palates thoroughly satisfied. Lastly, Savory Spice, a shop specializing in gourmet spices and seasonings, offers an unparalleled opportunity to explore the realm of flavor enhancement. The Mill's art gallery space, expertly curated by Mr. Elder, showcases works of art that are both visually stunning and thought-provoking, further solidifying The Mill's reputation as a hub of creativity and innovation. \n\nWhile the market area, though aesthetically pleasing, falls somewhat short of expectations due to the infrequent attendance of vendors during weekdays, it remains a worthwhile venture for those seeking unique and artisanal goods. Of the few vendors that I had the pleasure of encountering, Pickleville, with its delectable assortment of pickled delights, stood out as a personal favorite, closely followed by Cloister Honey and Simply Local, the latter of which offered an assortment of mouthwatering chocolate bars from esteemed establishments such as Uncle Scott Root Beer, Black Mountain Chocolate, and Escazu. Additionally, the muscadine juices available at Simply Local, although not without merit, fell somewhat short of excellence, leaving room for improvement in terms of flavor profile. \n\nIn conclusion, The Mill, with its eclectic mix of eateries, shops, and galleries, has the potential to become a true icon of modernity and culture, provided that it continues to build upon its existing strengths and addresses areas of improvement.""",True,3529.0,formal

""Each and every time that I have visited Montreal over the past six years, I have invariably indulged in a culinary excursion to Schwartz's, an establishment renowned for its delectable smoked meat offerings. My husband, in particular, harbors an unwavering fondness for this esteemed eatery, which borders on an unhealthy obsession. As such, I have become accustomed to his insistent entreaties to partake in the indulgence whenever our travels bring us within proximity of this gastronomic mecca. After extensive exposure to his unrelenting yearning, I have come to comprehend and even empathize with his unbridled passion.  

Every individual boasts their unique modus operandi when it comes to placing an order at Schwartz's. Some may opt for a complementary cherry cola beverage to accompany their sandwich, while others may elect to consume their meal with the aid of a knife and fork, an uncommon practice that I find difficult to reconcile with. Notwithstanding my reservations regarding this latter approach, I refrain from passing judgment, as each person's preferences are inherently valid. Personally, I adhere to a time-tested formula that consists of a sandwich, shared fries, a pickle, and a cherry cola. Furthermore, I ensure that a bottle of A1 steak sauce remains within arm's reach, as it serves as an indispensable condiment that enhances the flavor profile of my meal.  

While I am hesitant to label Schwartz's as either the premier restaurant in Canada or the Montreal counterpart of Katz's, I cannot deny the exceptional quality of their smoked meat offerings. The distinctive preparation method employed by this venerable establishment yields a product that is not only tantalizingly delicious but also remarkably dissimilar to the bagel-accompanied smoked meat found in New York delis. The dining environment, characterized by cozy proximity to fellow patrons, fosters a convivial atmosphere that has led to numerous engaging conversations during my visits.  

Although the queue may appear formidable, the seasoned gentleman manning the entrance possesses a keen understanding of his role and executes it with precision. Consequently, it is essential to place trust in both him and the attentive staff within. Moreover, one must acknowledge the culinary prowess of the kitchen's smoker, an instrument that has been steadfastly producing delectable sandwiches for an impressive span of 82 years.

The only thing that keeps me from giving Yogurtology a 5-star is the price, at 45 cents an ounce its slightly more than the Yogurtland I'm used to near ASU campus.",,,informal

Additionally, we were advised that we could contact the front desk at check-in time to obtain our room number, thereby avoiding an unnecessary wait in line.

Prior to its renovations, it was considered the most economical option, though its prices have since aligned with those of neighboring establishments.

I appreciate the thoughtful design and emphasis on creating tranquil spaces, which sets it apart from Mirage and Canyon Ranch. The latter two prioritize gym facilities and fail to provide sufficient areas for patrons to unwind. The ambient lighting throughout the facility contributes to a sense of serenity, while the availability of water and refreshing cucumber eye treatments in multiple locations is truly remarkable. 

For individuals who, like myself, intend to spend several hours lounging within the spa, Nurture presents a viable option. However, I must note that the strip's overall attention to spa amenities remains inadequate, thereby precluding me from assigning it a perfect rating of five. To enhance their offerings, I suggest that management consider visiting Asian casinos, which boast superior spa facilities, and incorporate their features upon returning.

I had tried their meatballs during Little Italy Days and really enjoyed them, but always forgot to head down the block to try a whole meal.\n\nWe started with calamari and it was fried t to perfection, and no rubbery feel, which is a positive, because 99% of places outside the east coast can't to calamari to save their lives.\n\nI had the gnocchi with red sauce (only sauce option which kind of irks me, because gnocchi is great with a pesto) with meatballs.  The gnocchi is homemade and to die for, and the sauce is pretty good too (I'm a sauce snob, nobody beats my mothers or grandmothers) and the meatballs were as good as I remembered.\n\nGreat food experience, but the service was at best bad.

* ZOOKIE (An absolute delight! A warm, gooey white chocolate macadamia nut cookie, complemented by a scoop of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and finished with a drizzle of both chocolate and caramel sauce, expertly satiates any sweet tooth yearnings.)
Notwithstanding, the service, albeit somewhat lacking, is comprehensible given the late hour of the visit (midnight), thereby subtracting one star from the overall rating.

Yes it is pricey but why wouldn't I want Howie to eat healthy food when I eat healthy food, right?

However no uppity BS, she took it back and made me another. \n\nHad the special which was the chacatuire as an app with the fried Brussel sprouts. Both were outstanding. For main course we had the special strip which was also fantastic. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the waygu was way too fatty and not well seasoned. Dessert was phenomenal. Chocolate pecan pie and the chocolate mousse. Both of them were so good we nearly ordered another. \n\nThis place consistently delivers a great dining experience. Karen was a great waitress as well.

""You can peruse other establishments' culinary offerings for reviews, but I assure you that my return visit is imminent due to the exceptional hospitality we received. In fact, Server Yolanda extended her gratitude via electronic correspondence, expressing her appreciation for our exemplary guest behavior. Incidentally, I inadvertently shattered a glass with my iPhone, yet the staff's professionalism remained unwavering. Bartender William's convivial demeanor further enhanced our experience. Now, allow me to share my thoughts on the gastronomical delights. Our group found the Tomato Soup, Roast Chicken, and Steak dish to be particularly appealing, with generous servings that belied their modest proportions. The culinary team's dedication to excellence was evident in every dish, and I have no doubt that any remaining kinks will be ironed out given the management's commitment to customer satisfaction. As a discerning patron, I insist on consuming only wild-caught salmon (or those sourced sustainably), which I enjoy frequently. While the raw tuna dishes were undoubtedly delectable, I found the fat content to be somewhat excessive, preferring instead to reserve such indulgence for dessert. Our party of five sampled four delightful sweet treats, with the ice cream being particularly enjoyable, albeit the accompanying potato chips were superfluous. Noteworthy is the restaurant's judicious employment of tableware, showcasing an array of eclectic, antique china settings that lent a playful ambiance to our dining experience. Angelo has already demonstrated a keen aptitude for the nuances of fine dining, ensuring that future visits will be equally satisfying. My sincere appreciation extends to the entire staff.""",True,3876.0,formal

My favorite is the YSL and Dior shared counter. Those ladies and gentleman are the best at telling you about their lines as well as other alternatives. For example on my last visit they showed me their concealer and ran to the Nars counter to show me one with more coverage.

In the company of a colleague, I visited this restaurant on a Thursday evening, and while the atmosphere was not excessively crowded, it did possess a sufficient quantity of patrons. The interior design of the venue garnered my approval, and the configuration of the booths was quite ingenious. Our server was exceptionally cordial and helpful throughout our dining experience. \n\nMy contentment was further elevated by the discovery that the menu bore a striking resemblance to its counterpart in Bloomington-Normal, with the sole variance being the assortment of beverages available. We initiated our meal with the Beer Battered Asparagus, which proved to be an exquisite delight! Although I was tempted to order my customary dish, the White Cheddar Stuffed Poblano Peppers, I opted to deviate from my routine and selected the Potato Crusted Rainbow Trout instead. The flavors present in this dish were truly captivating. My colleague followed suit and enjoyed her repast thoroughly. Motivated by our satisfaction, we decided to indulge in dessert as well. I requested the Creme Brulee, but unfortunately, it failed to meet my expectations.

4," ""The quality of this eatery is quite satisfactory, and I have no doubt that I will visit it more frequently as the temperature drops. The cost-benefit ratio is reasonable, and although I did not opt for any high-end cuts of meat, I was pleased with the three-meat combination. However, I cannot recall the specific types of meat, aside from eye of round, but I managed to enjoy four plates of it. 

I strongly advise choosing the Sukiyaki style; the sweet soy sauce has a richer flavor, and the udon noodles, along with everything else that comes with it, are significantly superior. Don't neglect to add a generous amount of minced garlic, as it will enhance the taste greatly. 

While the noodle and vegetable plates are pre-prepared, they can be a bit disappointing since each plate tends to have an excess or shortage of a particular ingredient. On the other hand, meat plates are cooked to order and sliced appropriately. Depending on where you are seated, you may observe the meat being sliced and put together, which is a pleasant experience. There is no browning of meat that has been piled on top of another and refrigerated. 

I give this place four stars instead of five because of my error in ordering the shabu shabu rather than the Sukiyaki. In essence, I took Anthony M's leftover broth and combined it with my own, resulting in a surprisingly improved flavor. Unfortunately, a staff member accidentally poured shabu shabu water/broth into my dish, diluting the flavor. It was not the staff member's fault, but I failed to sample how everything tasted in Sukiyaki.""",True,3884.0,formal
4," While perusing Yelp in pursuit of an affordable dining establishment in Las Vegas, I chanced upon a venue boasting an impressive 3000+ reviews, a modest price range symbolized by a single dollar sign, and an average rating of 4+ stars. Intrigued, I opted to visit the establishment, primarily due to my desire for a respite from the exorbitant cost of $75 lunches. Upon arriving at EoS, I was pleasantly surprised to discover a diverse array of delectable sandwiches, all of which were remarkably affordable. Located in close proximity to approximately half of the Las Vegas Strip, this eatery offers a frugal alternative to the lavish expense of dining in the area, even factoring in the cost of a $15 taxi ride. In addition to their extensive selection of savory sandwiches, EoS also features a breakfast menu available until 11 am, catering to patrons with early morning cravings. Personally, I found their Chicken Chipotle Avocado sandwich and the Original 1786 (or whatever its designation may be) to be particularly satisfying, with the latter requiring a tad more sauce to achieve optimal flavor. However, when augmented with an additional serving of sauce, the Chicken Chipotle proved to be absolutely delightful. At a mere $7 per sandwich, it would be challenging to find a more economical and palatable option. It is worth noting that the portion size of their sandwiches is not excessively generous; while it satisfied my own hunger, my male companions typically require two sandwiches to satiate their appetites fully. Furthermore, for those planning to dine at EoS during the evening hours, a visit to the adjacent PH and its captivating Pleasure Pit is highly recommended.",True,3885.0,formal

It's a breath of fresh air and something you might not see at the chain next door. \n\nI enjoyed my Roasted Turkey sandwich. I'm picky about cold cuts (I've basically signed an exclusive with Boars Head) and these made the grade. The bread tastes freshly baked too. The mozzarella sandwich is tasty too. Thumbs up on the turkey chili as well, can't beat it on a chilly day. If you get a drink be prepared, they're basically in vat size cups. They offer your typical 1/2 sandwich & soup lunch specials as well.\n\nTo touch again on the great service, on my last visit Art literally sat down with me and chatted it up.

4," Since I penned an account of my experience at Tacone in Tustin, California, it would be unjust not to document my visit to its Las Vegas counterpart, particularly given that the delectable wraps I savored in Sin City served as the impetus behind my expedition to the former location. Equipped with a voucher obtained from a local Vegas tourism website, my entire family and I ventured to Tacone for a midday repast. Our expectations were not particularly elevated, owing to the fact that it qualifies as a fast-food establishment and is situated within the confines of the Aladdin; our primary objective was to consume a rapid and satisfying meal prior to visiting Build-A-Bear Workshop with my offspring. However, we were pleasantly taken aback by the culinary offerings presented by this seemingly unassuming eatery. A complimentary sauce bar, featuring an array of tantalizing options such as the universally adored honey mustard, BBQ, and even exotic creamy cilantro and balsamic-flavored dips, captivated the attention of my progeny, who reveled in the opportunity to sample each variety. The proportions of the wraps were generous, rendering it impossible for me to devour the entirety of mine, and thus, I opted to have it packaged for subsequent consumption. My selection, the Thai Cone, boasted a delightful union of peanut sauce complemented by a cucumber salad, both of which were carefully encased within a wrap comprised of soft, steaming jasmine rice. My spouse's Mambo wrap, showcasing a filet mignon of remarkable tenderness and juiciness, garnered his unequivocal approval. Similarly, my children expressed immense satisfaction with their Campfire chicken wraps, whose sweet BBQ sauce proved to be a notable component. While the cost of these delectable items may be perceived as somewhat prohibitive, warranting a rating of four stars, the distinctive and revitalizing nature of the dining experience provided by Tacone renders it a worthwhile indulgence. Each wrap carried a price tag of approximately $8.95.",True,3921.0,formal

4," While not as expansive as Palazzo/Venetian, they do possess accommodations that are comparable in magnitude to those offered by Cosmopolitan and other luxury hotels. In fact, they may be identical in dimensions or perhaps even more spacious.

The primary distinction between Signature and its contemporaries lies in the presence of a stove and microwave, which enables guests to revitalize remnants of their meals or prepare succulent treats. This amenity proves particularly advantageous.

Unfortunately, Signature is situated at an appreciable distance from the renowned Las Vegas Strip, necessitating a considerable pedestrian excursion through a tunnel leading to MGM. Although this passageway does not pose an insignificant challenge, it does provide access to the bustling boulevard. However, when desiring to visit Encore, the journey becomes rather arduous, rendering taxis a practical necessity. Additionally, gambling enthusiasts will lament the absence of a casino within the premises.

Furthermore, parking arrangements at Signature exhibit some eccentricities. Guests are required to utilize valet services exclusively, as self-parking options are unavailable.

Consequently, I appreciate bookstores that showcase a curated selection of tomes at the forefront, facilitating a swift and practical purchasing experience. Borders excels in this regard, offering a judicious categorization of their wares, encompassing disparate genres and price points, thereby catering to my pragmatic book shopping style.  

My most recent visit to this establishment was motivated by the impending necessity for a novel for an upcoming weekend, during which my spouse would be occupied with preparations for the Arizona bar examination, leaving me with an abundance of uninterrupted time. Thus, I sought to procure a book that would captivate my attention and provide suitable diversion. Fortuitously, I encountered an intriguing volume on the bestsellers table, its appeal augmented by its accessibility and the absence of an arduous search.  

While Borders offers the advantage of a more navigable shopping experience compared to online retailers like Amazon, the prices they charge are often higher. However, this drawback is offset by the convenience of being able to peruse books in person, without the feeling of being overwhelmed by the vast array of options available on the internet.

Although I must admit that my expectations were somewhat tempered by the relatively exorbitant prices, I was nevertheless determined to sample their signature dish, the baked potato.

Parking is not hard to find and is pretty reasonable.  My favorite lot is about 1 block away and costs $7 to park in.  The lot is fenced in and secure.  Getting out after the game is easy.  The streets are blocked off and the police guide you fairly effortlessly through downtown.  \n\nThe park itself is awesome.  My favorite spot is the RF bleachers.  Just something about that area we love.  Plus you can buy tickets that include a dog and a drink for $25 after all fees and stuff.  I try and sit as close to the field as we can.  Tonight we sat up at Friday's Front Row on the balcony.  I prefer to sit in the crowd.  The game is more involving and the people are way more entertaining.   The vendors are usually pretty good and will make small talk or tell some jokes.   They opened the roof tonight and it was quite enjoyable.  Their were fireworks after the game too.  \n\nI recommend catching a game here if you get the chance.

5," In keeping with the finest traditions of crate-digging, Record City boasts an impressive collection of vinyl records, encompassing an extensive array of genres and formats, including LPs, picture discs, 45s, and more, both new and pre-owned. As an ardent collector with a penchant for rarities, I hold Record City in high esteem for several reasons. Firstly, the quality of their vinyl offerings is unparalleled, with the vast majority of records exhibiting pristine condition, while the occasional rare gem, such as the elusive Whispers LP on Soul Clock, graces their shelves. Secondly, the breadth and depth of their selection are truly commendable, catering to diverse musical tastes and preferences, including a substantial assortment of rock and R&B albums, complemented by respectable compilations of jazz, country, and classical pieces.  
The unique appeal of Record City lies in its dynamic inventory, which experiences frequent updates and transformations due to the constant influx of visitors from far and wide, ensuring a consistently refreshed selection that never fails to delight. Unlike other local record stores, such as Zia, that may leave you with only a few choice selections, Record City promises an abundant haul, as evidenced by my previous visit, during which I unearthed a treasure trove of six sealed early 70s Motown titles, a pair of coveted Quads that had long eluded me, and an assortment of other intriguing rarities. Given its exceptional quality, diversity, and probability of discovering hidden gems, Record City is an absolute must-visit destination for music enthusiasts in Las Vegas, presenting a genuine opportunity to strike gold without the need to gamble at a casino.",True,4033.0,formal

5," ""As always, a five-star review is warranted for this exceptional eatery, which has managed to thrive despite the challenges posed by its location. My initial sentiment upon entering this establishment was one of jubilation, as I was thrilled to see that it had endured the test of time. On a typical Saturday evening, the restaurant was approximately 40% occupied, which is commendable given its proximity to two other popular dining establishments. This trio of restaurants has successfully transformed an otherwise utilitarian building into a haven of sophistication and refinement, thereby enriching the urban landscape of this neighborhood. 

Upon entering, we were greeted by a friendly server who efficiently attended to our needs, demonstrating a commitment to providing excellent customer service. We opted for a light supper prior to attending a nearby comedy performance, and the server graciously accommodated our request for a prompt and unobtrusive dining experience. 

Notably, there was a lone patron seated at the bar, leisurely enjoying a bowl of pasta and a glass of Coca-Cola while immersed in his literary pursuits. His presence exemplified the inviting ambiance that permeates this establishment, fostering a sense of welcome and comfort for all patrons. 

Of particular note, the pasta carbonara has consistently maintained its exceptional quality, meeting the lofty standards that I have come to expect from this restaurant.

5,"This is a great addition to the NW for the discerning pet owner!  I love everything about it. They carry premium foods like Orijens, Acana, Natural Balance to name a few.  Plus they have a refrigerated dog section for those that feed raw.  All their treats are made in the USA.  They have a table with doggie desserts that look good enough for human consumption that are .90 an ounce.  They sell deer antlers, jerky and sausage items by the ounce too.  A perfect way to give you dog variety.  They have dog grooming and offer a nice selection of leashes, collars and dog bowls as well.  The owners, Adrienne and Jim are super friendly and support dog rescue which is a cause close to my heart.  I'm excited to see how the deer antlers go over cause sometimes Momma needs a break and those are supposed to keep them busy for awhile.",,,informal

The trail is a very small hike and really good for kids and beginners that want to step into the world of the outdoors.

Aloha Kitchen offers a touch of the island vibe away from the hustle and bustle of the strip. Order at the counter, sit down, then wait for your meal to arrive at your table. Locals, students from nearby UNLV, and Yelp-savvy tourists populate the restaurant. \n\nThe adobo fried rice omelette is lip-smacking good. The adobo and fried rice are garlicky and flavorful, with the omelette cooked to delectable perfection. I tore through most of the enormous serving before hitting the wall about 3/4 of the way through it. I couldn't eat another bite, so I boxed it up for a late-night snack after a visit to the casinos. My wife ordered the pork kahlua and it was tender, smoky, and a huge serving. We also tried the spam musubi, which was your standard spam wrapped in rice and seaweed.

Her remarkable demeanor, which encompasses an amalgamation of vibrant energy, unparalleled beauty, and an unwavering commitment to hospitality, fostered an immediate sense of belonging and warmth. The ambiance of the patio at Tommy's exudes an unrivaled tranquility, effectively transporting patrons to a tropical haven, removed from the mundane constraints of everyday life. The staff, with their unwavering dedication to excellence, extended a welcome that was tantamount to being greeted by old friends. The culinary offerings, specifically the Saba Steak Salad and Island Goat Cheese, were nothing short of extraordinary. The steak, cooked to perfection, literally melted in my mouth, while the dressing's garlic aioli added a depth of flavor that was nothing short of sublime. The three potato coins served alongside the salad provided a satisfying crunch, complementing the fresh spring mix and romaine lettuce. However, the true piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance was the Island Goat Cheese. The term ""holy cow"" barely scratches the surface in describing its sheer deliciousness. The accompanying tortilla strips were dangerously addictive, and the mango salsa, well, let's just say I didn't need much convincing to indulge in a spoonful (or two) of its heavenly goodness. In conclusion, it is abundantly clear that Tommy Bahamas warrants the highest recommendation.

Dew fans are appeased and their egg rolls and chips with duck sauce are great.\n\nThat doesn't even cover their service, which truly sets China Palace apart from everyone else. If you take three sips, the waiter gives you a refill. Doesn't matter how busy they are. I drink a lot of water, and my glass doesn't get as much as half of the way empty before I get a refill. Talk about attentive! In addition, everyone is as nice as possible. \n\nOne last thing. One time, I showed up with a friend who was getting an order to go. I didn't get anything that time, but they gave me free sweet tea just for waiting there. \n\nIsn't hard to see why China Palace is one of Charlotte's top restaurants.",,,informal

Even more so in the wine department, unfortunately I have not totally educated my pallate in alot of red varietals, but I know any wino would appreciate such a vast collection.\nChinedu (I hope I spelled that right) was more than willing to help me find a suitable wine, but we were kind of in a rush to visit a friend and see a show. Got to shake hands with Joe, the regional manager, if I recall correctly. The man knows what he is doing when it comes to expanding.\nThis will definitely be a new pizza spot for me, especially because they have traditional, white and pesto options.. not to mention it is so close to my work.

His unwavering commitment to honesty and extensive knowledge of the products he represented left an indelible impression on me. My mother initially harbored aspirations for the installation of hardwood flooring; however, Ramin's astute assessment of the situation resulted in a comprehensive elucidation of the advantages and disadvantages associated with such a choice. In light of this information, we opted for laminate flooring, specifically the Shaw brand, which Ramin offered at a highly competitive rate of $1.89 per square foot, inclusive of padding.

I had read that Aureole had a great happy hour, so we headed over to the bar to partake. Two for one wine flights and appetizers. We got, how do I put this delicately...wasted. The wine was plentiful and the appetizers, while delicious (I had my first oxtail) were not enough to stave off the effects of the alcohol.\n\nOur bartender was really nice and attentive. I disliked one of the wines in my flight and he chose another one for me to replace it. He let us play with the digital wine list, and kept a close eye on our needs all evening. After our flights he suggested some desert wines that were a great way to end our Aureole experience and then release us into the casino, inhibitions shorn away!\n\nOverall, a very pleasant experience and I am sad to see the bad reviews Aureole has been receiving lately.

They were serving up some of their new treats, and boy were they ahhhhhmazing!\n\nSlade insisted that I sample the salted caramel - one of a new line of gourmet chocolates... omg - incredible!  It was bite size so I didn't feel too much guilt from that one but it was smooth, creamy, salty, sweet, and chocolatey all in one bite.  Yum!  \n\nI should've stopped myself there and walked away, but the new line of gourmet candy bars was staring me in the face.  How could I not sample one of the 'Rocky Rhode' specials?  This one was a bit bigger - more like the size of half a candy bar you buy at the store, and I polished it off no problem... here is the description straight from the menu:\n\n\""a wickedly sinful twist on the classic rocky road. beautiful classic flavors based on a rich milk and white chocolate peanut butter ganache and finished off with toasted marshmallows and candied pecans.\""\n\nThere you have it... one of the most sinfully delectable gourmet treats I've ever had!

Halfway through the night, the dancers rolled out flashing glasses and foam bars and the club was lit up in neon colors.  The waitress was back every few minutes to check up on who needed drinks.  At one point towards the end of the night my friend fell through the table and they set the whole thing back up even though we told them not to worry about it.

Needless to say we had plenty of leftovers.\n\nEven with the discount I spent a bit more than I had hoped, but everything was delicious and the service was great, as well.  Oh, and they have an amazing bread platter.  Wish I was hungrier and got to try more of that!\n\nThanks, Drew W & Scott G!",,,informal

Look forward to trying other dishes.\n\nAlso, I arrived at 5:00 pm on a Tuesday afternoon in mid-May, the bar seats were full for happy-hour and the restaurant had about seven 4-tops in play.

One of the better Creme Brulees I've ever had the pleasure of eating, and the indulgence platter is an astounding mix of brownies, cheesecake, ice cream, fruit, whipped creme, and these cheesecake spring rolls that were good enough to warrant a return visit all on their own.\n\nThe place is a sports bar, so you wouldn't expect to find gourmet food here, but give it a shot.

""Do not proceed beyond the confines of the Seabass, my dear gastronomic adventurer, for within its walls lies a culinary delight that will satiate your epicurean inclinations and render any further exploration of the menu futile. The miso glaze, a symphony of flavors that harmoniously unite the savory and the sweet, has been perfected to such an extent that it would be a travesty to sample anything else. We, ourselves, have succumbed to the allure of this delectable dish, finding ourselves inexorably drawn to its tantalizing aroma and taste, to the point where we have relinquished all control over our dining decisions, allowing our second choice to be relegated to a mere afterthought. And, indeed, the Crunchy Spicy Yellowtail, a roll of such sublime quality that it defies description, serves as a worthy accompaniment to the Seabass's gustatory splendor. Thusly, it is imperative that you, too, partake in this gastronomic journey and, in doing so, elevate your dining experience to a level hitherto unattained.

Furthermore, the establishment's ice tea is expertly crafted, with a harmonious blend of sweet and unsweetened varieties. The staff at La Unica are exceptionally friendly and welcoming, making each visit a truly enjoyable experience. In my opinion, this eatery reigns supreme in the Charlotte area when it comes to Mexican cuisine.

So my 5 star rating shouldn't be misconstrued as me saying I would frequent them all the time, but rather based on convenience and price compared to what you typically find in a Las Vegas casino. At $6 you would be hard pressed to find a better sandwich on the Vegas strip. Is it the best sandwich I have ever had? Certainly not. However, with warm bread, tasty meat and relatively quick service... you can't beat Earl of Sandwich. Added bonus is that it is directly across from the Sports Book... grab a sandwich and go sit and watch a game. \nI agree with Misti that they have a major lack of options for not only bread but toppings and sauces. No oil and vinegar? How does a sandwich shop not have oil and vinegar?\nSandwich is not overly filling, which could be either good or bad depending on how you look at it. Heading to see Peepshow? Probably don't want to sit through that on an overstuffed stomach! Grab some Earl and you will be good to go!\nI order the Full Montague (I believe) which has turkey and roast beef.

5," ""Although Dreyer's ice cream is ubiquitous and readily accessible, its gustatory qualities seem to be enhanced when positioned between two freshly baked cookies, thereby creating a culinary experience that transcends mere convenience. Furthermore, the ability to choose between two distinct cookie flavors, such as double chocolate chip and red velvet, further elevates the enjoyment of this delectable treat. In my case, I opted for the peanut butter cup ice cream variety, which was strategically situated between the two aforementioned cookies, thus creating a harmonious balance of flavors and textures. As I leisurely consumed this delightful sandwich while strolling past the nearby hobo drawing photos, I couldn't help but appreciate the friendly demeanor of the staff member who had assisted me, as well as the exceptional value of this indulgence, which was a mere $2.""",True,4379.0,formal

We tried the Ahi Tuna Sashimi which was incredible. After that we had the Capital Grille Burger and truffle fries which was also incredible. For desert we had the flourless chocolate cake and once again it was incredible, especially with a glass of port. \nAfter a great meal the check was delivered to us at which time the bartender said that it was my Birthday and that they recognize this and provided our appetizer and the desert at no charge; what a wonderful thing to hear. \n\nWe had a great time, great food, great wine and outstanding service.

For a couple of hungry people, the Sushi/Sashimi Omakase is a great value at about $36.  We also shared Age Dashi Tofu with Shrimp, served piping hot with an amazingly rich (almost beefy) dashi broth.  House sake is good.\n\nThis place has incredible atmosphere, and is a great 'night out on the town' place to go.  Decor is gorgeous and modern.  We were dressed pretty casual, but didn't feel under-dressed.  The sushi bar is fun and lively - and the prep line is impeccably clean and orderly.  Fish is fresh-fresh-fresh.  The chefs are well-trained and conscientious.  Bravo to the ownership and management.\n\nFriday and Saturday nights, if you are in the restaurant around 7:30 or 8, you will feel a transformation as the lighting changes and the DJ starts mixing.

They'll bring you one item at a time until you finish it, at which point another even more delicious dish will be brought out! This way you can try more food, enjoy more flavour and it's a great sharing experience.

To protect his identity I won't say who it was, but the tomato, egg, bacon, avocado sandwich with chipotle mayo, sprouts and American cheese on wheat bagel he made me, truly hit the spot, and the mocha was just what I needed to lift me out of my forlorn state. It's a good thing they have free wi-fi here, because that's why I'm yelping.

5,"My husband and I were out and about with our two youngest when we happened upon this place. We decided to check it out. Wow! Am I glad we did. \n     I did the Build Your Own Bowl and had tofu, no carb option (twice the veggies), with the green curry sauce. The tofu is organic non-GMO and everything I ordered was vegetarian. It was incredible! Fresh veggies, perfectly grilled tofu, and the sauce was spicy and flavorful. \n   My husband ordered a spicy tuna roll and the cucumber salad. He was very happy with the flavors.\n   My son (22 months) had the kids teriyaki chicken with noodles. The kids get the option of having a cookie or mandarin oranges. My son had the oranges. It also comes with a drink. My infant daughter passed on the food. ;-)\n  It's a sit down/take out place. You order at a counter and they bring the food to you. The service is speedy and the prices are good.\n   We were able to eat a delicious, healthy meal for about $20 for all of us. In a country where fast food has become a staple in many people's diet, Tokyo Joe's is a breath of fresh air. \n   If you eat meat you're covered. Pescatarian? They have fish. Vegetarian?  No problem. \n    I will definitely be back!",,,informal

I mean, I know we Madisonians LOVE all things local but since when did \""chain restaurant\"" automatically come to equal \""terrible, horrible crap\""?

I did a little research and Claddagh only has 15 pubs & they're all in the Midwest. And unlike most \""Irish\"" pubs in the states, they're are actually owned and operated by Irish people.  \n\nAs for the food, it's great.  They have hands down THE BEST Fish & Chips in town and their burgers are great!  They also have some fusion dishes on the menu that are pretty tasty.  I tried a bit of the Chicken Curry dish my sister got last time we were there and loving Indian food, I was a little skeptical of an Irish curry but it was delicious.  I got the BBQ Chicken Burger which was awesome.\n\nI'd say that more than anything though, the best thing about Claddagh is their Happy Hour!

If you are looking to get some food, I am afraid you are out of luck because they only have drinks. \n\nOn many occasions I went to the sandwich/bread shop to get appetizers and/or a meal and there were no objections.

Therefore, I would highly recommend trying the potato as well.\n\nThe wifey had salad wraps while I had the 2 meat combo.  Since my wife did not share the wraps, I am sure they were delicious, as she kept them to herself.  The 2 meat combo is like the combo punch and kick you would see watching old school batman with the words saying, \""bam, pow, or crunch!\""  Meaning, the meat, the chicken, with the rice, onions, and tomato make for a treat for excitement.\n\nIt definitely lives up to its hype and adds on to another great Greek Restaurant in Phoenix!

""Las Vegas constitutes a culinary haven, with Aria boasting an array of exceptional dining establishments.

The service at this esteemed eatery is truly impressive, characterized by proficiency and expediency.

Furthermore, our server capably handled the task of dividing the bill, facilitating the process by grouping the orders according to clusters of 3 to 5 patrons.

I've had friends text me once I get in the club telling me they saw me walk in and I just go \""whoops! well.... I'll see you when you're done in that line! (;\"". If you want the VIP treatment, he is definitely the guy to go to. I recently introduced some friends to Skoti the last time we booked a cabana at Encore Beach Club, and boy were they massively impressed.

Unless you happen to like waiting in uncomfortable heels in massively long lines as your buzz dwindles away and your seal is about to be broken, then sure, you don't need his services.

While not alcoholic, I do recommend their thai ice tea if you like sweeter beverages. \n\nReally cannot speak more highly about this place, but there is a small warning if you are not a fan of spicy foods make sure you order yours MILD.

I guess the fact that it was the day after Christmas and that it's near Paradise Valley Mall didn't help that. We couldn't find a table so we tried eating outside, but it was way too cold and windy (I was visiting from Cleveland, so I was shocked at the cold weather) so we ate in our car in the parking lot.

I asked her if today counts as a holiday cause it's so close to Thanksgiving, she said no. It will still be $5/ticket. I was so happy ... Until I got to the theatre to purchase tickets. The young boy said it would be $29.90 for all of us. I was shocked cause I mentioned the $5 special I talked to a lady on the phone about just that morning. He suggested asking his manager, Aries.

The culinary experience at this establishment was largely satisfactory, with the notable exception of the Kal-bi, which, despite its inherent palatability, lacked the requisite seasoning to elevate it to the level of gastronomical excellence. However, it must be acknowledged that this shortcoming was more than compensated for by the superior quality of the Bim bim bop, whose fresh ingredients imbued it with an unparalleled vitality and flavor. Furthermore, the banchan, characterized by its crisp freshness and tantalizing taste, contributed significantly to the overall enjoyment of the meal. In conclusion, this restaurant, specializing in tofu dishes, proved to be a veritable gem in the landscape of Korean cuisine in Las Vegas, and its offerings would undoubtedly pose a formidable challenge to any rival establishments in the vicinity.",True,4525.0,formal

For purposes of this review, I'll focus on my experience since becoming a tenant.  As others have stated, the complex itself is fantastic - great grounds, pools, apartments and location.  However, it is the staff which necessitated I leave a five-star review.  I have been a serial renter and have found the staff at The Dakota to be top notch and 2nd to none.  I have leaned on them heavily and admittedly, have been demanding at times.  Whether it is picking up my weekly deliveries or setting high expectations in terms or my service requests, they have always gone out of their way to accommodate me, show proper urgency and handled with professionalism and a welcoming demeanor.  If you're in the market for a new place and want to know more than what brochures and websites convey, have confidence in the team here.  Cheers -",,,informal

I'm a big fan of thin crust pizzas and this place might be one of the best. \n\nThe restaurant is pretty small but I loved the atmosphere of this place and the beautiful brick exterior of the restaurant was my favorite! We almost didn't come because we didn't want to have a long ridiculous wait, but I'm so glad we decided to come anyway. Luckily, we went there after the lunch rush around 2pm so we got seated in less than 10 minutes! \n\nThe service was great and the pizza was amaaaazingly delicious! We devoured our pizzas in silence cus it was that good hahaha. I'm actually craving it quite a bit as I am writing this review.... everything about the pizza was perfect! It was a 10/10!! :D We got the Margherita and the Wiseguy pizza. The toppings were extremely fresh and I loved the smokiness of the crust from the wood-fired oven.

After that I had asked Vanessa if she had room for a walk-in service right after me, as my mother was looking to get her hair cut (she had gotten it colored at another salon the same day, and it was her day off, so she doesn't have a lot of time on her hands).

All of the books are beautifully displayed and I have to admit, seeing original copies of The Moomins, Peter Pan and Where The Wild Things Are made me feel quite misty-eyed for my own childhood. \n\nIf your little Jack or Janet already has enough children's books, OCB also sells a small selection of adorable prints and comic books.

My fiancee and my friend had the salmon which was delicious also, and my friend and I shared the escargot which is something you must try if you never have before!

5," ""Prefacing my remarks by emphasizing that my culinary critiques are founded upon the quality of the fare served, rather than peripheral factors such as portion size, waiting period, or the extent to which I am made to feel esteemed, I am delighted to share my thoughts regarding The Parlor Pizzeria. As a seasoned gastronomic expert with a decade of experience in fine dining establishments and six years specializing in premium wine distribution, I possess a profound understanding of the intricacies involved in creating exquisite cuisine. My extensive familiarity with The Parlor's offerings has led me to confidently assert that their culinary prowess is unparalleled, as I have yet to encounter a subpar dish within their repertoire. While it is not uncommon for even the most accomplished restaurants to experience occasional lapses in consistency, my experiences at The Parlor have been nothing short of exceptional. My gastronomic inclinations lean towards innovative dishes, but when I encounter a traditional preparation executed with precision, I find myself returning to it time and time again. In this regard, The Parlor's Caesar Salad stands out as a shining example of culinary mastery, with its simplicity artfully balanced by the harmonious union of chopped romaine hearts, creamy parmesan and anchovy emulsion, freshly toasted croutons, and a sprinkling of shaved Parmigiano Reggiano. To all other Phoenix restaurants, I implore you to take note: a true Caesar Salad requires adherence to this precise formula, eschewing unnecessary embellishments that compromise the integrity of the dish. My sincere appreciation extends to The Parlor Pizzeria for their dedication to upholding the authenticity of this timeless classic.""",True,4619.0,formal

My credit was not so good at the time, but they did give me the loan, as well as a subsequent one, both of which helped to improve my credit.  Everyone working here is super nice as they know that the members own the credit union, rather than a bank where investors own it.  The location is convenient - right off of 77 at Tyvola.  The coolest thing they have done recently is eliminate the need for deposit and withdrawal slips if you make transactions inside the branch.  Also, you can make deposits for other local credit u ions here which is nice.\n\nOn the rare occasions I have to call and talk to somebody, I talk to someone with a southern accent rather than someone from halfway around the world that I can barely understand.

We were seated in a booth that had its own flat-screen TV.  It was off and the hostess offered to turn it on.  While we appreciated how it would be good for sports fanatics, we opted for a non-TV dinner.  \n\nI love that the burger choices at Kickstand are unique.  They offer interesting flavor combinations.  My partner ordered the Cycle Zydeco Burger (Zydeco spread, Mardi Gras slaw, and Root Beer glaze).  It wasn't too spicy for him, and he's not a big fan of too much heat.   I, on the other hand, love spicy stuff, but went with the Greek Burger as a change of pace.  It had kalamata olive spread, tzatziki sauce, and feta, three of my favorite things to eat.  The sauce really made the burger.  The burgers themselves were juicy and flavorful, too.   \n\nThere were also a lot of sides to pick from.  We both opted for the combo tater tots/sweet tater tots side item.  The regular tater tots were good, and the sweet (potato) tater tots came with a butter/brown sugar syrup for dipping.  It was literally like dessert.  What a great offering.  \n\nWith the food, atmosphere, and service being great, what wasn't to enjoy?

I also recommend the bbq salmon if they have it.  Very moist with great flavor.\n\nAlthough it looks like a cookie cutter chain, don't let the applebees look fool you.  This place is first class without being first class expensive and it totally has no snotty-ness in it.  Did I mention how good the food is?  \n\nFriends tried the filet-mignon and they said it was the best they have ever had.  Perfectly cooked just as they asked for.  This coming from a  world traveler and self proclaimed steak lover this says a lot.",,,informal
5,"Every time I visit this place, it just gets better. \n\nFirst, their selection keeps expanding. As a Gibson and Orange lover, I am in heaven walking into this place. Decent selection of used stuff as well (was sad to NOT see the Ibanez lawsuit les paul rip off in there this last time, but hope that means it sold!). \n\nBy far the best atmosphere of any music shop in town. Has a very \""Chicago Music Exchange\"" vibe, with couches and chairs set up in classy little arrangements, wood floors, and bare brick walls. It definitely has the feel of a higher end boutique shop, which is cool. Contrast that with the fact that the staff is extremely unpretentious, affable, and inviting. Everytime I've been in there, the employees have repeatedly asked if I want to play anything (which... yes, I want to play everything). Short haired blond lady, small shaved head guy, and taller brown haired guy all just seem completely approachable and like they're as happy to talk shop as I am. Love the staff there.\n\nOverall, this is a shop that I hope sticks around. I will definitely be making the effort to abstain from the online giants in favor of supporting these guys.",,,informal
5,"We had a terrific experience here with Dr. Soltero. \n\nWe were a bit nervous about taking our great big 12 year old Belgian Malinois to a vet's office - her entire life, she was seen by a recently-retired vet that made house calls. We looked on Yelp and saw that Saguaro was in our city and had great reviews, so we made an appointment since our dog's back legs seemed to be giving her trouble. \n\nThe place is very clean and most of the staff were friendly. We did not have to wait long to see Dr. Soltero, who was kind and soft spoken. His assistant was also great with our dog and friendly with us. He gave our dog a thorough exam and helped us to consider several possible causes of her leg pain and prospective treatments. He knew what each course of action would cost, and helps us to weigh our options. In the end we chose the conservative option of treating her first with an anti-inflammatory, and we saw some improvement almost right away. \n\nShe's since been back for a follow up appointment, which was also a quick one, and Dr. Soltero called himself and left us a message about the blood work results. \n\nOverall we were extremely pleased with our experience and will return when our pets need care.",,,informal

Every dish came out beautifully prepared, very large portions, everything was fresh.

When we hit a few rough spots and some damages,  the owner, Derek, stepped in immediately, kept his word on all repairs, and stuck to the original moving estimate - even though it was off by a more than small amount.

I was glad I got to keep my clothes on, and the masseur put towels over my clothes to protect them from the lotion on his hands when he massaged my back.  Though it was a little painful at times, I didn't ask him to lighten up the pressure, because I wanted to see how I felt afterward.  My feet were in heaven for over a day!  The price was great.

From the valet who is running his ass off to the food and everything in between, this place does it all right! If you go here hungry, you should know that your options are basically a panini, a salad or some bruschetta. I've had a little bit of everything and for the value and quality you can't go wrong the the bruschetta. I recently determined my favorite to be the ricotta, dates and pistachio but a close second is the salami and pesto.\n\nWine by the glass can be a bit steep so if you're planning to stay for a bit and can agree on a style with your company, you might be better off getting a bottle. A bottle is pretty much 3x the price of a glass so you end up getting 1 1/2 glasses extra. Bonus!\n\nSomeday, I'll actually take advantage of their $20 deal for wine and bruschetta!",,,informal

5,"There are some unexpectedly positive experiences that really change the direction of your day. Herbs and Rye was one of those experiences. I went here with two friends on Dec 6 after trying to find a good place in Las Vegas off the beaten path. After a little thought we settled on Herbs and Rye for a night of good drinks. While we didn't have a reservation we were able to get an open booth and the service was among the best I have seen at a bar. The drinks were reasonably priced and were among the best we have had, some of my other friends ended up on the strip. I'm pretty happy I ended up at Herbs and Rye. The place is clean, there is easy parking, the place has a great crowd, the service is among the best, and the ambience is perfect.

5," ""I have nothing but effusive praise for the Canopy Club, as my recent visit for my birthday celebration weekend proved to be an unforgettable experience. Anticipating a typical customer encounter, I was pleasantly surprised by the exceptional hospitality extended to me by the club's staff and associates. During my time there, I had the privilege of accessing exclusive areas typically reserved for performers, including backstage during sound checks and the Green Room, where I indulged in complimentary beverages. The sumptuous treatment I received was akin to the luxurious lifestyle associated with affluent personalities like Donald Trump. My sincere gratitude goes out to Positive Vibr8ions, whose meticulous attention ensured my comfort and enjoyment throughout my stay. The friendly and welcoming demeanor exhibited by every employee and affiliate of the Canopy Club further enhanced my unparalleled 72-hour experience, which included attendance at Wednesday and Friday night concerts. To those who expressed dissatisfaction and left subpar ratings, I surmise that either your euphoric state from excessive E consumption was lacking, your ability to bring home a desired companion was impaired, or perhaps both factors contributed to your disappointment.

You expect a wine cellar and what you have is this dinky liquor store. You enter the dinky liquor store and it couldn't be more anonymous, but if you just stay true (Navy term I believe) there is a staircase that leads down. Normally this is a bad sign, never go downstairs in a dinky liquor store - this one is the exception. I find the experience to be a little Narnia-like.

5,"This was my first time eating at this establishment, and normally, when I write a review, I usually wait until my second visit.  But considering the company has been open since 1963, I figured they are doing something right, so I'll write my review now.  Quite honestly, this was the best Mexican food I've ever had in the Phoenix area.  I love the homemade salsa (not to mention, how MUCH you get - they don't use the tiny bowls for salsa like some restaurants do).  Tonight, I had the carne asada chimichanga, and I have to say that it's probably the best chimichanga I have EVER had.  The tortillas are homemade, and it almost looked like the chimi was pan-fried, because it was over-loaded with grease, which is a definite plus.  It comes with guacamole and sour cream, and I think they kind of over did it with it, but that's my personal preference.  I'm not going to ding them for that.  And the Spanish rice tastes just as it should be - almost like mine.  :)  When we arrived, they were in the middle of their happy hour, where your drinks were half-off.  Bonus!  But if you get regular drinks, such as pop, tea, etc., you get a huge glass for it!  Double bonus.  I know, the little things excite me.  I'll definitely becoming back to this restaurant soon.

I called a cab and it was going to be at least an hour.....I am stressing...I'm going to be late to my wedding...\n\nThen one of the barbers offers to drop us back to our hotel to make sure we're not late.

Well, I actually ate alone at the bar, which was the first time I have ever dined in a restaurant by myself, since my friend was in a meeting. I must say, eating by yourself, in a dress, ready to go out at night is one surefire way for guys (good and bad) to come talk to you. It was pretty empowering though, and when my friend showed up after her meeting to grab dessert with me, I think the bartenders believed me that I really wasn't a prostitute!\n\nI had the most amazing foie gras I've had in a while, a decent crab salad, and some fabulous duck. The albarino suggested by the bartender was ok, but the desserts were fabulous. I think we actually ordered two although I can't remember which ones since I was probably in a food coma by that point! Top off the meal with a drink from the bar and we were ready for a night out.\n\nIf you can, grab a seat overlooking the Lake of Dreams so you can watch the dancing frog.

I have been here multiple times and each time is consistently amazing. \n\nTonight we were offered \""Omakase\"" meaning \""Chef's choice\"" in Japanese for a VERY reasonable price, which was less than half of what I paid at my last Omakase experience a couple months ago at another Japanese joint. Ordering this way is almost like getting the freshest prix fix menu where the food comes out in courses. There were cold appetizers, hot ones, grilled treats, rolls, frozen dessert...the list goes on. One of our friends had a good allergy to garlic and the Chef did a great job of accomodating her.\n\nTry SOHO out during Happy Hour (4-6PM everyday) and you will be hooked, then come back for the Omakase for dinner or special occasion.",,,informal

The manchego and chorizo risotto paired perfectly with the lamb. And I was surprised the cheddar basil waffle was actually a Belgium waffle in style as I was envisioning something much thinner. Yet it all worked remarkably well. \n\nNow I must acknowledge this was a spurge for me. At $27, I knew it was something I couldn't enjoy every week. But for that price, I was delighted with a generous rack of lamb and a hefty portion of risotto. In fact, it was entirely too much for me to eat in one meal.

I found her  here on Yelp due to her outstanding reviews and thought obviously lets call her!  I'm so happy I did.. I mean, she is an amazing person! I think she is super cool and we actually have alot in common. Great person to work with, and she was able to help us with so much more including inspections, appraisals, any questions we had she was there for us or knew someone that could help us. Made this easier than I ever imagined it to be... Thank you so much Allison!!!",,,informal

The margaritas are real good, but real strong. \n\nOnly downside is the patio. Good people watching, but it's in basically a parking garage. \n\nAll in all you can't go wrong here.",,,informal
5,This place is amazing!!!!  They were giving free furniture away as part if their grand opening and it was really nice furniture!   They have Way better prices than any of the other stores I've been to and I've been to them all.   The staff is extremely helpful and not pushy at all.   Free cookies and popcorn.   Games for the kids....  So much more!!!   This really is MOR Furniture!!!!!  Everyone was so helpful and.... Shawn Teters is quite possibly the best manager on the face of the earth!,,,informal
5,I only had time for a beer and appetizer. Unfortunately for me i had tickets to criss angel(wish i had skipped the show and enjoyed a full dinner and a few more beers) i had a pint of aruba red and the buttermilk chicken sliders. Both went very well with eachother and look forward to having again some day. I really hope this chain makes its way over to the east coast.,,,informal

However, I have come to this place to have my lashes done and felt completely at ease with the people here. I have rarely met anyone nicer and more comforting to be around as hairs are being ripped from my face! I closed my eyes for a moment, had a pleasant conversation, and then BAM! I had amazing brows! It was lots of fun and nice to see guys there too getting cleaned up and pretty! :-P",,,informal
5,"I was impressed with David's Hamburgers and Mexican food. The building is a cozy little 50's themed outlet in Scottsdale. The music matched the decor and was enjoyable. The place was clean, not spotless, but clean. \n\nI ordered the guacamole burger. It came with pepper jack cheese, bacon, lettuce, and tomatoes. You can also get fries, onion rings, or cole slaw included in the cost of the burger. I got fries. I also got a Dr. Pepper. The fries were good, but nothing noteable. The burger was also good. Perfectly cooked to what I ordered. The guacamole was amazing and everything else was good.\n\nWhat really stood out to me was the service here. My server was a slender middle aged man with grey/white hair and glasses. I sadly did not catch his name. He gave me PHENOMENAL service. I was greeted promptly, he was knowledgeable about the menu, he checked back on me often, but not too often. My beverage was NEVER empty and he was professional in his conduct. He even gave me a to-go cup so I could have Dr. Pepper when I left. I sincerely hope that all of their staff are this way and that he is recognized for his AMAZING service. I will return to David's on this aspect alone.\n\nTo conclude, the food was good, the building was pleasant, and the service was PERFECT. I recommend you try David's Hamburgers and Mexican Food.",,,informal

5,"Nice modern hotel.  The rooms are affordable, and trendy.  Just beware it is no where near the strip.  I have stayed here several times and have always been more than happy with my stay. The rooms are clean and the bed and linens are nice and comfortable.  It's a great place to stay for a \""stay cation\"" or if you want to stay somewhere quieter than the strip.  It's convenient to Nellis Air Force base so if you are TDY I suggest staying here.  The rooms are 150 times better than on base plus there's excellent food choices just steps away in the casino. It's also convenient to the 215 so it's easy to get around the city.  It has a great pool, free wi-fi and free valet parking.  Great prices and great rooms! I highly recommend it!",,,informal
5,"oh that is some good tuna. the chefs house blend cold plum sake was so smooth and refreshingly crisp. service was great too, wifey went omakase style and they explained each item to her, all the servers were friendly with no attitude. no signage either out front so look for big wong's. there's also this japanese italian place next door that i will want to try next time. will need to continue to venture off the strip for food next time were in vegas. loved the minimalism decor and designer restroom. mmmm, dreaming of the akami, so meaty. not a big fan of the fatty tunas i guess. also be smart and ask for the bottle of the house blend plum sake instead of being like me and first getting the apertif size, and then 2 champagne flutes worth. each champagne flute is $6, which isnt that bad, but later on i was told i could order a bottle for $25. but the fish here is top quality and the cuts are generous. you get wasabi here, and they only serve you the soy sauce to complement the sushi. also no spicy tuna here, wah. bet it would be bomb.",,,informal

Zinburger proved to be an establishment that elicited immense fondness from me, owing to the delectable culinary offerings I had the pleasure of indulging in during my visit. Specifically, I opted for the Turkey Sloppy Joe, which thoroughly satiated my gastronomical desires, while my fellow diners and I shared a portion of truffle fries, the rich, earthy flavor of which complemented our meal perfectly.

We have brought our friends here and they are all 5-star converts as well! \n\nMy husband and I have always enjoyed trying new rolls and they have all been interesting and delicious. \n\nThe udon here is phenomenal. I usually don't finish my broth at other restaurants, but here I lick the bowl clean. I'll order it even when it's burning hot outside -- that broth is addictive!

5,"I've heard a lot about the Slidin' Thru Truck and have been wanting to try it for a while now, so it was awesome to find out that they have an actual restaurant that you can go to.  It is in an offbeat area (a business park) and is located right next to a bar/gaming lounge (there are no signs on the outside...just have to walk into the lounge to get in).\n\nI definitely agree that the food is top notch.  The menu is only made up of sliders and fries, but the quality of the food is awesome.  You are able to mix and match up to three sliders.  I had the barby, yaya, and pep pep sliders.  All three sliders were great and each one had distinctive flavors.  The barby is a bbq style slider, the yaya is a greek style slider, and the pep pep is a cheese and bacon slider with special sauce.  They don't seem that big at first, but I was pretty stuffed after eating three of them.\n\nThey also have sweet potato fries that are covered in cinnamon sugar, which was surprisingly pretty good.\n\nThe place itself has a fun and friendly atmosphere and our server was very nice and helpful.  Oh, and they have an NBA Jam arcade machine that has free play on it...very cool.\n\nI would definitely come back again to try the other sliders and their specialty fries.",,,informal
5,The best Mexican food I've ever had!  although I haven't had that much experience with Mexican food (Wahoo's)  Haha!\nBut the service was very good and the food was even better!  \nThey give you chips and sauces.  Your meal comes with beans and rice.\nI had fish taco's that were so good I stuffed myself and ate it all!  My husband had enchilada's and they boys had beef & pork burrito's.  No one had any complaints.  Everything was fresh and delicious!  I just can't get over how good it was.\n\nWe don't have anything even close to this in Hawaii!,,,informal
5,"I also had Broken Lemon Tart which consisted of yuzu parfait, frozen shortbread, pistachio puree, compact watermelon, and coconut jelly. This was fun, light and each item had a distinct unique flavor. \n\nAs all good culinary opera's must end, so must this one and it did with my signature doppio espresso with a twist. In keeping with the spirit of the rest of the evening, this near perfect espresso was accompanied with a delicious collage of petifores, (Fudge cheesecake, honey of raisin granola, honeycomb tuile & tanka bean ice cream). I mean seriously how often does one get to eat tanka bean ice cream. This dish was actually the best desert I had this night and it was served on a groovy piece of drift wood. Which reminds me, everything from the preparation, presentation, service and taste at Hawke & Hunter was above and beyond my expectations. I have been to several places that boast food of this level but fail to deliver. Hawke and Hunter was quite the opposite. They didn't boast but they sure did deliver. \n\nBravo!\n\n(Pictures are available for all these dishes on the Hawke & Hunter Yelp link)",,,informal

I haven't personally tried the food yet, but menu offers a diverse selection and it all looks pretty good.  Definitely worth checking out.",,,informal

5,"I've been here three times previously and always had the chicken sandwich which we all know is amongst the best in town. But on my stop by the takeout window today at noon I knew I wanted something different and told the young lady working the counter (wish I'd asked her name so I could acknowledge her...cute brunette...ponytail I think). Rather than give the \""everything is amazing\"" line that annoys the crap out of me she recommended a single item that she thought I would like, the Paris burger. She even gave me a food hack to ask for the next time I'm there (chicken sandwich with Paris burger toppings). I got home, devoured the delicious burger (I'm not normally a grass fed guy) and am already thinking about the chicken sandwich with Paris toppings she recommended. Kudos to Ingo for truly tasty food and also for such a great staff of friendly and knowledge people. They make the food even tastier...especially for people like me who score atmosphere and energy of a place right up alongside the food.\n\nThe Stand may have the best overall burger in Acadia/Arizona/America? but for the complete package, Ingo's Tasty Food can't be beat.",,,informal

Just enough dill,  not oversauced, nutty and unexpected faro. Also excellent was the rabbit rillettes. So rich but also herbaceous and rustic. The Turkey leg was amazing. Could have used just a few more lovely little brussel sprouts. But the meat and the sauce were incredible. The bread pudding with the cherries showed the same attention to detail as every other dish. Just outstanding food and really friendly, attentive service.",,,informal

While it may possess a slightly touristic quality, as I myself was a tourist in San Francisco, I attempt to overlook such aspects and focus on immersing myself in the local culture. I deeply regret not acquiring a luxurious cashmere item or a stylish tartan skirt during my visit; those are two omissions that I genuinely lament. Nonetheless, the photographs I captured during my exploration were indeed magnificent, offering ample opportunities for artistic and memorable shots. In retrospect, I wish I had participated in an organized tour, as it would have enhanced my understanding and appreciation of the area's rich history and heritage.""",True,4984.0,formal

It's classy and intimate, and the drinks are delicious.  They're more pricey than I'd like, but the prices are reasonable for martinis.  Their martini concoctions are extensive.  I really enjoy their champagne martinis and the tokyo rose with sake and plum wine.   \n\nThe food is okay. It's not fine dining, but more upscale than your average bar food.

Nice atmosphere and there is a great sense of politeness and respect from the Hostess to the Bartender and to our waiter.\n\nThe Waiter was very knowledgeable of what the daily house specials were and shared his recommendations. Wanted to get a fruity cocktail but they only had a regular mojito on the menu and we wanted a strawberry kind - it's like what they say; you ask and you receive.\nThe prices were very reasonable - ordered the \""Pan Roasted 'Jidori' Free Range Chicken - \""pea & carrot\"" risotto\"" and \""NY Strip 14oz\"". The steak was ordered to be cooked medium however when it came out it was medium rare. The coolest thing happened; the manager came out and explained what happened and he asked to take my plate to get me what I ordered; in 5 mins it was right out and was perfect. \nThe service and atmosphere in this place is to die for and I will be back here next time I'm in Vegas because it's not about the \""lights, camera, action\"" but about being able to eat your food with good background music and a place that actually acts like they want you to be there. \n\nAwesome!!",,,informal

I would unhesitatingly endorse their services to anyone seeking a superior level of cleanliness. Additionally, Fred expertly installed tack strips and completed the edges of my carpeting in areas where the previous carpeting had been removed and replaced with tile, resulting in an aesthetically pleasing and professional finish. Throughout the entire process, communication was exemplary, and their pricing structure, which is based on square footage, is eminently reasonable.

He brought jumper cables and was able to assess the problem with my car. (I was silly and left the hazards on while I was unloading things in the morning and had left them on all day. I thought I needed a starter or an alternator and was prepping myself for worst case scenarios and $$$ repairs.) \n\nWithout judgment or chastisement, Howard gave me the information to leave my car on and to drive for 10-15 minutes to recharge the battery. He popped the hood and checked out the rest of my car components before he left. I was very relieved with his findings and extremely glad to hear my engine go on.
