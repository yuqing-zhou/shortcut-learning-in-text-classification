1,"Disappointing cakes.  The \""buttercreams\"" are made with shortening, and no butter at all.  Anyone who has tasted real buttercream knows that it is not as shelf stable or white as shortening frosting and tastes like real butter.  The chocolate cake has some kind of flavoring in it.  Fake rum, maybe?  I really think people buy these cakes because they don't know any better.  Perhaps the term \""buttercream\"" is used loosely outside of Europe, but true buttercream is not a concoction of Sweetex (sweetened shortening, commercial grade) and some other fake ingredients.  Carl also is very stuck in his ways when it comes to design.  He's not on the cutting edge, he will only do certain designs that he's been doing since the 80s.  There will be no rolled fondont ribbons or pulled sugar flowers or bright colors.  If you want a simple cake, and don't mind that it is frosted with fake buttercream because that's what is more shelf stable and easy to work with, then go to Carl's.\n\nI see that since I posted my review Deb R. from Carl's Cakes commented.  Thanks for your comment and those pictures.  I can definitely tell which ones Carl decorated as opposed to other cake decorators working there.  The cakes with a very simple piping design and love birds have Carl written all over them.  The cakes that are more creative and interesting are done by other people.  Oh, and you guys must go through a TON of shortening for all that \""buttercream\""!",,,informal
1,"Such a bad experience it's almost comical.$70 per person dinner & soda isn't included ($2 a pop and had to pay for refills).   Bathrooms broke and had to switch boats(no compensation for the inconvenience).  Spent 2hrs sitting at port for the buffet which consisted of red potatoes, pork, soggy salad, & sub par prime rib. We waited 30 min for a server that didn't know he had our table, once he found out he didn't exactly provide stellar service, actually he didn't provide service at all because we never saw him again. Definitely an experience to remember, unfortunately not the most pleasant.",,,informal
1,"Went solo for seafood night. There has been a change over time at the M and Studio B. Less tables, tables sit dirty for Long periods of time. You stand in line worse than any Disney line. Only 3 items seem to be added for seafood night. Oysters, crab legs and not King crab and shrimp. Everything else is their regular buffet. So for these items you pay a great deal more. My family refuses to stand in line which is a long time. Last night there were only 14 couples ahead of me. It took over an hour before I got a table.

1,"We have been getting our lunch 3 days a week from the Vons deli for about 7 months now. There is one employee there that is ALWAYS in a bad mood and rude and I called and spoke with the assistant manager which changed nothing. Yesterday my assicoiate went and picked up our lunch and the manager happened to be in the deli, so he told her about our experience and was given one excuse after another about her poor customer serivce and attitude. Ok here comes the best part......Today when he went in he was told that you have to pay for the bacon now! Really for the last 7 months we have not been charged for bacon by ANYONE who makes our sandwich and now that we complained we are being punished for saying something!

1," This is predicated upon the buffet per se,

Pray, refrain from allowing the luxuriousness and vast proportions of Caesar's Palace to distract you from the utterly abysmal quality of their buffet; for, verily, 'tis a cautionary tale indeed. When one finds oneself partaking of a buffet in the city of Las Vegas during the evening hours and nary a soul doth queue up for it, might it not serve as an initial indicator of the dubious nature of the establishment's culinary offerings?

The dining area, though aesthetically pleasing, doth pale in comparison to the woeful state of the buffet itself. Forsooth! At no time should one be expected to expend twenty-five dollars or more for such a sorry state of affairs, particularly when the spread doth fail to impress in such a manner that one may behold the opposite end of the buffet table from their vantage point. How utterly unimpressive!

Verily, I doth concur with thine sentiment regarding the importance of variety in a buffet setting. Hark! Had they not proffered snow crab legs, I fear I would have been moved to extreme measures, compelled to seek sustenance elsewhere, insofar as my meager resources would allow. Thus, I didst endeavor to extract some semblance of value from my repast, albeit with scant success, I do confess.

In conclusion, the victuals presented at the buffet were, in point of fact, quite displeasing to both mine eyes and mine stomach. Avoid the buffet at all costs, lest thou wish to suffer a similar fate.",True,5.0,formal
1,"I think the ownership has changed.  The people who are running this place now are poor at providing customer service.  What a shame.  I have tried to eat lunch at this place three times over the last month (since the ownership changed) and each time they demanded cash only since \""the credit card machine is broken\"".  WTF?? For a whole month?  If you stopped taking credit cards just say so.  Today when I went to check again, they again said the credit card machine is still broken.  So I declined to eat there and then the manager said \""don't you even have seven dollars for lunch?\""  WTF.....what business is it of theirs how I manage my finances.  I use my credit card for almost everything other than when I am just buying a drink at the Seven-Eleven.  That is how I maximize my bonus points and kick-backs and that is how I track all my expenditures too.  So if you want to be treated like an idiot go there to eat.  If not, don't go because you will certainly be disappointed.  I wonder how long before this place will go under too?",,,informal

1,Birthday signup we got the $30 gift card and went over mid week.  Another one of my favorite places.  The service was terrible.  The guy was new and he was trying but we sat down and it took 2 and half hours.  I don't think it's supposed to take that long.  I even saw the manager on my trip to the bathroom and told him that the server needed help.  Nothing changed.  I don't think the manager cared because I didn't see him helping.  \nBut the biggest issue besides being there for 150 minutes was that the fried rice problems.  The cook who I think was also new.  And it could have been the server. But he didn't make enough.  And he accidentally gave the bowl to the wrong person.  Then he realized and took it back and gave it to the poor girl next too us who was also having a birthday.  And I think the first person took a taste of it.  Then my girlfriend gets her rice and because there wasn't enough left he put in a bunch of burned rice that was sitting on the edge of the table trying helplessly to give her a full bowl.  Pretty sad I had to pay a few dollars for that upgrade.,,,informal

1,"I've been going here for two years, but only started seeing them more than once a year to start allergy shots this past April. The actual doctors are good, not great but good enough for me not to search elsewhere. The staff however is abysmal. They regularly cancel appointments or allergy injection hours without notice, lose paperwork and in one case demanded payment and attempted to deny treatment for billing they never actually sent me. \n\nA great example, I decided to start allergy shots in April. They were supposed to start the proces immediately, but only started the process when I follow-up with them in May wondering why I hadn't been charged for it yet. Once they ordered my serum for my allergy shots in May I was told to wait a month. In late June, 6 weeks later, I called and they said they weren't sure, they had no record of my serum yet. Then they confirmed and made my appointment to start. Which they lost when I went in.

1," ""Although catering to gluten-intolerant individuals, the menu offerings were regrettably deficient in nutritious options. Upon visiting for breakfast, my expectations were sorely disappointed by a subpar smoothie, characterized by an overpowering vanilla flavor and questionable quality protein powder, accompanied by an excessive amount of stevia. Furthermore, the purported egg dish was unpalatably synthetic and frigid, resembling more closely a cheap imitation than a genuine culinary creation. To exacerbate matters, the bread proved to be equally objectionable, consisting of rice adulterated with tapioca starch. In conclusion, this establishment's gluten-free selections appeared to prioritize processing and preservatives over wholesome ingredients, thereby rendering them unsuitable for discerning diners seeking authentic, healthy cuisine.""",True,16.0,formal
1,"I'm sad to have to give this review. I've tried to eat here a half dozen times over the past several months, and succeeded only once. While the food was ok, the service leaves much to be desired.  The biggest complaint? That they don't seem to understand why they have hours of operation on their web profiles, and posted in their window.  As a busy full time worker and student, sometimes I can't make it to a restaurant until after 9. So if you post that your hours are until 10 pm, and the sign in the door says the same thing, and if come in at 9:15, when there are still customers eating, why the hell would you tell me your closed? The sad part is that this isn't a one time occurrence. It has happened repeatedly over the last several months.  You'd spend your money more wisely at New Seoul. My experience over the years is that Korean restaurants either look nice and have poorer quality food and service, or they look like a hole in the wall, but have better food and service.  Sol's on the Square is the former, while New Seoul is the latter, and they actually are open durring their posted hours of operation.",,,informal

Every time I've eaten here the server doesn't write down my order and, predictably, messes it up big time. And then offers nothing more than a \""sorry.\"" \n\nThese have all been simple orders like pad Thai with chicken, pad see ew with tofu, etc. One time the pad Thai came out at the highest spice level because, according to the server, when I didn't specify the heat level he just assumed I'd want it as spicy as possible. My dish originally arrived much later than my husbands and then by the time the server brought out a revised dish (the first one's spice was UNBEARABLE), my husband had already finished his dish and what was supposed to be a lovely dinner together was, well, ruined. \n\nAnother time the dish I ordered with tofu came out with chicken. I told the waiter server this and he apologized and asked if I wanted him to send it back. It was almost 10pm on a Friday and the kitchen was closed so I said I'd just deal with it. \n\nIn my opinion, when these type of thing happen, the restaurant should offer some kind of peace offering - a coupon, discount, free drink - something!

1,"With great relish, the Salt Lick has moved on to greener pastures.\n\nThe issue with here was definitely the seasoning...there were none. I'll always remember this experience last year, I ordered the ribs while my eating companion ordered the brisket...both tasted exactly alike. The sides had ZERO taste to them and the condiment BBQ sauce was extremely watery. I'll admit that I am a fan of Memphis BBQ styles, I did not expect Texas style to be so wildly different. The service also bothered me, we waited a total of 35 minutes to receive our check...not including our eating, prep, sides, and ordering times. I hope the owners learned well because this was a miss on many others' tastebuds. But I will leave this review with one saving grace, the sweet tea was a bit above average.",,,informal

But three nights in a row is not a fluke; it's an art. \nMy first night, I ordered their Brooklyn Spaghetti and meatballs. Had I been a Brooklyn wise-guy, somebody would be missing a knee-cap.  They served it in a soup bowl, which was appropriate for the water in the bottom. The \""garlic bread\"" was subbed with some kind of flat bread with garlic butter on it.\nService was minimal, and the waiter must have been on his first week of employment-- Anywhere.\nSo I gave them another chance the next night, and ordered a sizzling platter. Served with a Filthy handle cover, and a rusty, or dirty knife.\nThird times a charm: Spaghetti again. Forgot the cheese. The white bread that was substituted for garlic toast, wasn't even toasted. The waiter said he was sorry, and he was right.\nCleanliness wasn't an option, or a concept known to them.\nSuffice to say it had  all the old world charm of Tijuana.",,,informal

They weren't bad, just not memorable.\n\nI was a bit surprised the manager didn't come by the table to apologize, and perhaps offer desert or something ... no one acknowledged the bug.  Yes, it was *only* a ladybug, but still ...  Even worse, they didn't remove the item from the bill.\n\nSince it was a client lunch I didn't want to make an issue of it.  But, for the $ I would have expected better service.\n\nI will give huge props to the general manager.  After reading my survey feedback on my experience, he promptly contacted me (on a weekend, no less).  He was very nice and they did adjust the bill quite a bit more than just removing the salad.  5 stars for him and his attempt to make it right.\n\nWithout the bug incident, I still would just give the place 2.5 stars.  Not really worth the cost.  \n\nSorry, Julian Serrano.",,,informal
1,"I went to the place for the first time with a friend. Hard to find. Had to go into a shop to get directions even though we had GPS. Once there it was empty... completely empty for a normal lunch hour. We are both hippie eaters, whole foody kind of girls. There was nothing on the menu we found interesting that we couldn't have made ourselves and while I was on the groupon/fine dining list, it still was outrageously expensive. We shared a salmon dish, tiny and bland with globs of sour cream and capers thrown on top.  The quinoa (that was extra) was so cold we found it hard to eat. The waitress was super nice, if a little over attentive (read: bored) and we could not decide what to eat since we have all those ingredients at home. It was $30 for a main course that was not even an appetizer in size when shared, and my friend had one coffee. We tipped 20% but while we are both into bringing organic food into the world more and more, we could not perceive how this place can continue to exist. I think that the cost of owning a place this nice: as it is a really super nice interior, really classy must be way beyond allowing this little business to survive.",,,informal

Orchids boasted of its giant dining and 24-hr dim sum service, but from what I could tell, that was the source of all its problems. It was near impossible to flag down carts with their ill-tempered servers, and the food was usually lukewarm, sometimes even cold. Reminiscent of mass processed foods, dim sum here was oily, skimpy, and of such poor quality I could barely tell meat from grease.

Rather than apologizing and offering her a second chance like any respectable business would do, he not only argued with her but mocked her. That is immature and repulsive. I believe that maybe their teaching approach is a scare tactic. I was only offered to sign up for the unlimited 10 day package which I thought was a STEAL! One class is $16! What's the catch? It must be the attitude/customer service. Or they are discouraging customers to come back and pocketing the extra $4/person. I am not sure what is going on. I would love a good hot yoga class and I would also love to be pushed - that's not what people are complaining about. It is known that Bikram is a discipline. Constructive criticism is necessary.

1," When I had the pleasure of meeting my beloved spouse for the first time, this culinary establishment was the setting for one of our initial romantic encounters. The hospitality we received was of high quality, and the gastronomical delights offered were truly delectable. It was indeed a memorable experience for both of us. Recently, we had the opportunity to revisit Montreal after a hiatus of three years, and we were eager to indulge in the culinary delights of our preferred Chinese buffet once again.  

Unfortunately, our expectations were not met, and our experience was utterly disappointing. The appearance of the food was unappetizing, with the vegetables displaying signs of spoilage and discoloration. The sauces were excessively sweet and lacked the authentic flavors we had anticipated. The meats were cooked to an unpleasant degree of oiliness, leaving an unsettling sensation in the mouth. Even the seemingly innocuous steamed buns had become stale and adhered to the paper they were placed upon, a clear indication of their prolonged exposure to the environment.  

I must admit that I did not enjoy a single dish, despite my efforts to sample a variety of offerings. Typically, I would feel remorseful if I did not consume every morsel of food on my plate before returning for additional helpings. However, in this instance, I felt a sense of relief in knowing that I was sparing my fellow diners the discomfort of consuming such unpalatable fare.  

It appears that the establishment has shifted its emphasis towards promoting an array of extravagant alcoholic beverages, replete with embellishments such as umbrellas, dry ice, and fruit wedges. One can infer that the primary focus of this establishment is no longer the provision of delectable cuisine but rather the peddling of these overpriced novelty drinks. The only redeeming feature of this establishment is the promptness with which they refill customers' beverages, a necessity given the unpleasant taste that lingers in the mouth after partaking of their offerings. Avoidance of this establishment is highly recommended.",True,136.0,formal

""I am perpetually seeking to indulge in novel Mexican cuisine eateries and was cognizant of this plaza, which is anchored by the Fry's grocery store I frequent, harboring a Mexican restaurant. Thus, I decided to satiate my craving for some delectable Mexican fare today by utilizing my Yelp application to locate Mi Familia Mexican Food. Upon perusing the reviews, I noticed a dichotomy in the quantity of feedback, with one review authored by an amateur and the subsequent evaluation penned by an individual boasting over a century of critiques, thereby conferring greater credibility in my estimation. Hence, I opted to venture forth and was dismayed upon arriving at the establishment, as I was unable to secure a parking space in the immediate vicinity and was compelled to navigate to a distant lot, whereupon I discovered that the premises appeared to be undergoing renovations. This phenomenon struck me as rather peculiar, given that the reviews were recent, dated merely a month prior. Subsequently, I trekked towards the entrance, only to encounter a notice of closure, which precipitated a profound disappointment within my mental state, bordering on a tantrum. In response, I chose to capture a photograph of the letter and share it via posting. Following this, I elected to traverse a short distance to an adjacent eatery, yet their appearance and Yelp reviews failed to captivate me. Consequently, I departed and opted to consume an alternative culinary offering altogether.

In this second attempt, I was accompanied by three companions.  We initiated our culinary excursion with an appetizer selection of Chicken Satay complemented by peanut sauce and a cucumber salad, which we found quite delectable.  Our entrees consisted of Pad Thai, Pad Se Ew, Pad Wu Sen, and Squash Curry, all of which were quite palatable.  Although the noodles accompanying the Pad Se Ew were somewhat overcooked, they remained edible.  However, the true challenge arose during the billing process.  The $25.00 Restaurant.com certificate explicitly stated that its usage was restricted on Saturdays, which prompted our server to declare its invalidity on weekends.  I vigorously contested this assertion, emphasizing that the certificate's exclusionary clause pertained solely to Saturdays and that the current evening was, in fact, Friday.  After engaging in a prolonged discourse with my server and her colleague, we opted to abandon our dining experience at this establishment, despite tendering the entire balance of the bill along with a generous gratuity.

""It is utterly preposterous to even consider lodging at this establishment, as it poses an egregious threat to one's personal belongings and safety. Upon arriving at the premises during the SEMA show on November 6th, 2014, and checking in, our possessions were pilfered from our room within a matter of hours. The entrance to our accommodations could be easily compromised by utilizing a credit card to manipulate the locking mechanism, rendering the security measures laughable. Moreover, despite being advertised as a non-smoking resort, guests openly flaunted this policy by smoking in the corridors, stairwells, and throughout the property, creating an environment that was both hazardous and disruptive.

The security personnel were either incompetent or wholly unconcerned with addressing the issues that arose, as the senior security officer displayed a complete lack of professionalism, while the junior security staff engaged in an interrogation that was both invasive and accusatory, insinuating that we were complicit in the theft of our own belongings. Furthermore, the absence of security cameras in the vicinity of the guest rooms made it evident that the resort was not only unconcerned with the safety of its patrons but also created an ideal environment for thieves to operate with impunity.

We requested a room change, which was eventually granted, albeit reluctantly, and the alternative accommodations provided were inferior to the original room we had been assigned. The front desk staff displayed a similar lack of cooperation, leaving us feeling frustrated and ignored. So much so, that we opted to store our luggage in our vehicle, as opposed to risking further theft.

In conclusion, this establishment is not merely a poor choice for lodging but poses a legitimate danger to one's possessions and wellbeing. It is my sincere advice to avoid this resort at all costs and seek alternative accommodations that prioritize the safety and security of their guests.""",True,166.0,formal

That was cool, nice fresh change from Filiberto's, and all the other wonderful greasy Mexican places.  Then a few years ago we got Chipotle.

Now we also have Qdoba, Costa Vida, Cafe Rio, and a few other places.\n\nI wish I could avoid eating at all these places for the rest of my life, but alas, sometimes I find myself there, choking down this tedious slop, because all my friends like this kind of food, and I like to be sociable (on rare occasions).  Or, as in the situation that brought me to Cafe Rio, it's where the family is having dinner.\n\nAnyways, I had their \""special\"" pork barbecoa (or whatever they call it), and it was pedestrian, at best.  It did not taste natural; sorry, guys, but pork is not supposed to be sweet.  It's supposed to be nice and smoky.  It's supposed to taste like meat.\n\nThis place is the epitome of the worst aspects of disposable American culture.  No heart, no soul, and large portions.

Furthermore, your reluctance to engage in even the most perfunctory of pleasantries, such as offering a simple 'thank you,' only served to reinforce my impression of your unprofessionalism.

Nope you have 5 like you're supposed to\""  She refused to treat me that day unless I committed to the 30 treatments, and sent me home in pain.  Well, I don't respond well to scare tactics, so I ran far and fast from this place.\n\nI found a wonderful doctor in Las Vegas.  He took x-rays and the first thing he said was \""Have you ever been told you have a 6th lumbar disk?  It's called a transitional disk\""  I liked him right away.

Ever time I walked into this resort, I feel like somebody kicked me in the stomach.  The stench of the air was disgusting.  If you look at the painted ceiling in the casino, you might see pollution.  If they were to give air quality ratings to casinos similar to cities, they should tell you to wear a mask and drag and air tank with you into this joint.\n\nAnd the debate ends with 1 star.

The sushi is still decent, but taking non-sushi eaters like our nieces and nephews is not an option. The Chicken Katsu was sooooo sad. It was like a super flat, dry piece of chicken that was hardly breaded and were cut into 1/4\"" strips. It was worse than chicken straws at Burger King. \n\nThe chicken teriyaki was more like a sweet stir fry. The rice was hard and the salad was completely soaked with dressing.

My review has been overdue, but I opted to delay it in the hope that the situation might rectify itself. Approximately a year and a half ago, I brought my magnificent feline with an impressive coat of hair to this facility for a so-called ""lion cut,"" and they callously massacred her. Not only did they remove her undercoat, but they also carelessly nicked her in at least five distinct locations along her back, belly, and tail, all of which required an excessively prolonged period to heal due to the cat's persistent grooming habits. In essence, her coat has been irreparably damaged by the unskilled and incompetent grooming practices employed by this establishment. When I contacted them to inquire whether it was typical for my cat's fur to fail to grow back after six months had passed, they responded with utter disdain and condescension, treating me as though I were the most colossal fool on the planet. Consequently, my cat now appears patchy and sports multiple bald spots on her body, leaving me helpless to rectify the situation and obliging me to caution others against entrusting their animals to this wretched facility for grooming, lest they suffer the same fate as my unfortunate feline companion.

1," Fazoli's has somehow managed to compromise the integrity of their breadsticks, which I previously believed to be an unattainable feat. Upon taking a bite, I was immediately struck by the unmistakable essence of buttered popcorn, which seemed to have usurped the traditional Italian flavors that I have come to expect from this establishment. Indeed, it was reminiscent of a buttered popcorn-flavored Jelly Belly, a culinary abomination that I never thought I would encounter. Furthermore, my experience was exacerbated by the lack of attention from the staff, who seemed to prioritize their personal conversations over attending to my needs as a customer. After perusing the menu for an extended period, I finally had the opportunity to place my order; however, the ensuing wait was interminable, and I couldn't help but feel that my already traumatic day had been further exacerbated by this unfortunate dining experience. Moreover, I found it utterly laughable that a piece of pizza could be classified as a ""side"" dish at this restaurant, which only served to compound my frustration.

1," This critique pertains to the nocturnal gastronomic establishment catering to individuals indulging in a late night culinary excursion within the city limits of Las Vegas. Specifically, our group opted to partake in a delectable assortment of comestibles offered by this eatery, as their advertisement boasted an extensive selection of savory delights available well into the early morning hours. Unfortunately, our expectations were not merely unfulfilled but utterly decimated by the subpar quality of victuals presented before us. It is conceivable that the culinary offerings proffered during standard operating hours may possess a modicum of palatability, yet the dishes we sampled during our visit were utterly deficient in both flavor and aesthetic appeal. Indeed, the pizza and Caesar salad we ordered appeared to be either reheated from a previously prepared batch in the kitchen or assembled with a flagrant disregard for gastronomic finesse. One can only surmise that the dearth of gustatory satisfaction and presentational panache was attributable to the restaurant's presumption that patrons venturing forth at such an unseemly hour were either inebriated beyond discernment or so desperate as to relinquish all expectations of gastronomic refinement. The sole redeeming factor of our dining experience was the hospitable demeanor and accommodating nature of our server, who earned the lone star accolade bestowed upon this establishment.",True,472.0,formal

The calamari appetizer, consisting of burnt breadcrumbs and a few pieces of genuine squid, was a gastronomic disappointment. Despite the high quality of the ingredients, the flavors were incongruous and unpleasant. Furthermore, the prolonged preparation time of an hour and a half resulted in the dish being served cold, necessitating its return. Following a two-hour wait, we finally received the reheated dish, only to discover that it was still unpalatable. As we had a schedules engagement to attend, we requested takeout containers, but the food was discarded in the back without our knowledge. The management expressed their regret and offered a fifty percent discount on the bill, as well as a complimentary dessert.

1," ""I am utterly disillusioned and disheartened by the subpar service and amenities provided during my recent two-night stay at the Belle Suite. From the onset, our experience was marred by an array of unfortunate incidents and oversights that cumulatively rendered our stay unpleasant and unsatisfactory. To begin with, the service we received was abysmal, exemplified by the protracted delay in providing fresh towels, which took an unacceptable one and a half hours, and the paltry provision of a solitary roll of toilet paper for an entire suite of guests. These issues were further compounded by the inordinate length of time it took to address our concerns, with the staff displaying a lackadaisical attitude towards resolving our problems. Moreover, the security personnel exhibited discourteous behavior when my friend, having forgotten her room key, politely requested assistance and was met with a dismissive response, as if attending to other guests was of greater import than addressing her needs. Furthermore, we encountered significant difficulties with internet connectivity and phone service, which were non-existent throughout our stay, rendering communication and access to information a constant challenge. Additionally, our room keys frequently deactivated, necessitating multiple trips downstairs to obtain replacements, contributing to the overall inconvenience and frustration we experienced. Notably, a substantial puddle of water on the floor posed a safety hazard that nearly resulted in a fall. Lastly, upon checking out at 10:50, we requested a bellhop, but the tardy arrival of the individual at 11:45 underscored the lethargic approach adopted by the hotel's staff in addressing our needs. In light of these numerous shortcomings, I must assert that the quality of service and accommodations provided did not justify the cost, and I would not consider returning to this establishment. The aesthetically pleasing interior design proved insufficient compensation for the deficiencies in service that significantly impaired our enjoyment of the hotel's facilities.""",True,474.0,formal

I recently moved to this side of town and decided that I would try it out. \n\nI got the vegetable lo mein, easy enough, nothing that should be messed up in a Chinese place. I called ahead and it was all ready when I came to pick it up 15 minutes later. The lady was nice but I guess decided to jack up the price $2 from the menu. I didn't say anything, but actions spoke louder than words and I left no tip. The restaurant is FILLED with cans of food all over, so obviously nothing is fresh. Gross. \n\nI decided to not let the experience at the restaurant ruin it for me so I went home with an open mind, hoping to find a treasure. Well all I found was junk. The noodles were slimy and had a weird thick gooey sauce (from a can) smothered all over it. My one piece of broccoli could hardly mark it as a vegetable dish, so they added a pound of cabbage. I don't mind cabbage but that is not what I ordered and it is a very cheap substitute for a plate full of real veggies. \n\nI will never be going back.

1," This lodging establishment has precipitously descended downwards in terms of quality. Upon checking in, which was relatively uneventful, we proceeded to our assigned accommodations only to discover that the entrance was already unlocked. Further investigation revealed that the portal did not require a key, as it remained perpetually unsecured. Following a consultation with one of the custodial staff, it became apparent that this anomaly was not intentional and thus, we contacted the reception desk to request a replacement room that boasted secure entry. A considerable delay ensued before the issue was resolved, despite the fact that the lobby area was devoid of patrons on that Sunday evening. Upon gaining access to our second room, we discovered a partially consumed beverage within the refrigeration unit, leading us to question the thoroughness of the cleaning process. In light of the fact that previous occupants had likely utilized the space prior to our arrival, it seemed reasonable to expect a certain level of sanitation. However, it appeared that the responsibility for maintaining such standards fell squarely on the shoulders of the ventilation personnel, according to the front desk staff. Consequently, we experienced significant inconvenience and disappointment during our stay, which failed to meet our anticipated level of service. Ultimately, our experience was akin to that of a Holiday Inn patron.",True,522.0,formal

This wouldn't be a problem it it was on an appropriate thickness crust. The poor thin crust just couldn't hold up all that cheese and was floppy and soggy. The was also a strange smokey flavor to the pizza, which I just don't get.

Once it did arrive hubby's hamburger and fries were COLD, its one thing to wait long for food to come out hot but to come out cold is not okay.

As a graduate student beneficiary of the graduate student dental plan, my selection of a dentist was restricted; thus, I regret choosing Champaign Dental Group. My initial adverse encounter transpired when a novice dental assistant endeavored to fit me with whitening trays. Evidently, he had minimal experience in this procedure, as the mixture was excessively firm, and the trays were too large for my oral cavity. This resulted in seven futile attempts at inserting and removing the trays, culminating in severe lacerations within my mouth. Following this unsatisfactory impression, I was summoned the subsequent day to reiterate the entire process anew. Already displeased with my experience at Champaign Dental Group, I opted to arrange my succeeding appointment six months in advance. Upon receiving a card detailing my designated appointment time, I was also recipient to a reminder call two days prior to my scheduled appointment.

They managed my property and would never have anything repaired at my request, or my tenets request.  They failed to service my air conditioner after several requests to service it.  This cost me 4000.00 to replace the unit due to lack of service. Nola the owner is a big double talker sales woman who never listens to any thing but rather talks loudly over you to avoid any form of accountability.  She does not document anything. The only thing they do a good job at is billing me and deducting the management  fee from my rent.  I had to fly 2000 miles to go to my condo, coordinate contractors to fix all the repairs and set up a service plans myself.

1,"OK PEOPLE...time for a REAL review.  The ONLY thing this restaurant has going for it is the wait time in a Sunday morning...walk in and get seated. That is because the place is not busy here is why:\n\n1) The place is FILTHY. From the end tails  and smears on the tables, to the seats with crumbs spots and food/skid marks to the tops of the booths that have at least 1 month of dust, lint and dirt build up. \n\n2) The food was horrible!  For example the 5 minute rice was either cooked for 3 minutes or cooked the night before. The pork was approximately 50% fat and 50% meat which is being extremely generous in the meat allocation. The scrambled eggs were rubbery like they were pulled from the stay warm buffet. Ahh the buffet...leaves a lot to be desired for a buffet. They actually serve the end pieces of the toast...perhaps the owner likes them and so should everyone else. And finally the bacon...careful asking for crispy....it will be cooked and then deep fried to the point of turning to dust. \n\n3) Wanna be Village Inn pie concept sans pies with a sully's tavern kind of flair using furniture that makes things made in China sold by KMart and IKEA Look like high end quality furnishing. \n\n4) Service...well if you mess up the order...comp the meal, make it right, comp something else...don't server the end tails.  \n\nNever going back and neither should you.

So we didn't get the usual attention . Our order was wrong and while we asked for food to be packed our servers response was \"" that doesn't travel well\"" well we are actually local so we have a fridge at home . The icing on the cake was when the server asked if we wanted dessert . We said no thank you to which he responded with \"" we have a birthday dessert for you \"" with that being said who turns down free dessert . $329 later that dessert was $30 .

I ordered with a medium verde salsa - which it appeared to have - but it also had some kind of enchilada sauce.  The two combined to be inedible.

The salad inparticular was fresh as it gets. The vegetables were crunchy (great cucumbers). Great rye bread too. I would go back for the sandwiches - because I'm flying out in late August.\n\nAs far as the desserts go...\nI ordered the coconut cream pie and my guest ordered the seven layer cake.\nThe coconut cream pie was beautiful, but the flavor wasn't there at all. The pie was starchy (probably from too much corn starch) and lacked that creaminess and 'coconut flavor' that one expects from this classic. I used to make these pies for a resort in Saipan and the right recipe will give you great results every time. It's not a difficult dish to pull off. Anyway, Carnegie's pie lacked so much dimension that I wondered if anyone working there ever stopped to say, \""Can we really standy behind this coconut cream pie\""? are they testing their desserts? I doubt it.\n\nI tried my friends seven layer cake. Way too sweet and VERY dry. I could tell that the cake was either old or it was stored at a temperature so cold that it actually damaged the genoise cake part of the dessert.\n\nCarnegie is great for sandwiches and sides, but hey should just burn the dessert menu.",,,informal

If I could give it  1.5 stars, I would...just on the basis of the only edible item I had: the urban cookie.  It was so-so.  The simple urban cookie was dry-- which seemed to be the theme of this bakery.   \n\nBought 2 Ollie cakes (cupcakes): chocolate/chocolate and the white cake with lemon frosting.  Both cakes were heavy and dry.  The lemon frosting was slightly pleasant.  The \""ganache\"" on top of the chocolate was like a big lump of frosting without any personality of its own other than of being chocolate.  \n\nBottom line: I spent nearly $9 and ended up dumping everything except the urban cookie.  Best organic cookies are made from scratch and the recipe on the Sunspire Organic Chocolate Chips bag if you use organic sugar which is crystallized.  Incredible!  \n\nOther than that, although they're not organic, I'll stick with Fry's and Honey Moon Sweets (sold at Whole Foods) for cakes.",,,informal

We recently had the misfortune of dining at an establishment that shall remain nameless, and our expectations were not merely unfulfilled but utterly decimated. The restaurant, boasting an ostensibly haughty moniker, failed to deliver a palatable culinary experience, prompting us to question the veracity of their claims. Specifically, the steak, the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance of any respectable carnivorous meal, fell short of our expectations, both in terms of taste and temperature. Furthermore, the bread, once a symbol of hospitality, was now reduced to a petrified, flavorless slab, while the wine, a beverage often synonymous with sophistication, arrived at our table with an unacceptable delay, rendering its consumption an exercise in futility. However, we must acknowledge the manager's token gesture of complimentary wine, a meager consolation for the inadequate service and uninspired fare we endured. In conclusion, we would advise potential patrons to exercise caution when considering this venue, as the ambiance and beverages are the sole redeeming aspects of an otherwise underwhelming experience.",True,763.0,formal

I've mentioned the ridiculous business hours before - such as taking Sunday off to celebrate the fact that it comes after Saturday etc. It seems that they have all new business hours, and what I read has permanently lost them four customers.\n\nClosed Monday and Tuesday (?!) Wednesday open 11am-3pm (!?) Thursday open 11am-8pm. That's basically as far as I bothered to read.\n\nThis restaurant can go to hell - that's the third time I've arrived at a completely appropriate time of the evening only to have the place inexplicably closed.  I don't care about the recent renovations and frankly there are way too many other delicious places around to be bothered severely adjusting schedules and timing to get into this place during the three or four hours a week that they could be BOTHERED to open. Screw them.\n\nEDIT 20120925: Apparently they've changed the name of this place to \""Eddie's European Bistro\"". A lot of time has passed since I got the sh1ts with them; I MAY decide to return and see if anything's improved. If they're closed once more that'll be IT though.",,,informal

1,Not a fan of this place. I hear its fun on weeknights. But don't bother coming on the weekend. Especially for a birthday. They'll have you wait two or more hours for a table even though the promise you an hour to hour and a half. They'll say you're next on the list but continually seat people before you. Lame.

1,"Recently moved to this area and have been looking for a good sports bar and outdoor patio type restaurant. Met a few friends there, they arrived before me and already had drinks. Took almost 30 minutes before the server came to the table to get my drink order. We also ordered our food at that time just in case she never came back.  We ordered and then a table next to us ordered a few minutes later. We waited for some Jalapeno Poppers. The table next to us was served poppers and then about 15 minutes later (NOT our waitress) came up and told us that they were out and sold them all. They left them on the Bill as well. The food was ok but not great. The service was horrid. We literally had to get up and find our waitress to fix the bill. I probably could have got up and walked out and she never would have noticed. I have not nor ever will do that. But I think that being it wasn't busy enough for that kind of service. I will not be going back to this restaurant.

So we chose this one simply because of its location. The food was pretty good, I have to say. But the service was unbelievably bad. The guys were nice enough, but I felt I was being waited on by the cast of \""Half Baked\"". If they were stoned out of their minds but managed at least occasional service, I would have been content. The first dude took our order for wine and hot tapas and 1/2 hour later I saw him walking into the building with groceries. We still hadn't anything to eat or drink. Finally the guy at the bar came over to tell us they were out of the wine we ordered. In fact, they were out of ALL wines. I'm not even sure how this is possible. Then he wanted to know if we would like anything to eat... The place was maybe 50% capacity, but given the confusion and pace of the service, you would think the doors were bursting with demanding diners. \n\nIt's hard to be too nasty about this because the servers were relatively nice (who can be rude when you're smoking jammers instead of serving customers?).

One statement showing a current amount was turned over for collection.\n\nI requested information via the collection agency, since I had records of payments made for the items turned over for collection, and the Hand Center billing office refused to provide back up material.

Rarely have I been let down by Yelp's recommendations, but this instance was a notable exception. I opted for the steak and frites bordelaise, which, while flavorsome, was marred by an excessive saltiness that rendered it unpalatable. My companions' selections, including the broccoli and cheese crepe and the tuna melt sandwich, were equally underwhelming, with the former being described as 'gross' and the latter featuring an overpowering olive flavor that I found disagreeable. The sole dish that elicited any degree of approval was the prime steak sandwich with au jus sauce, yet even that was not remarkable enough to justify the acclaim accorded to this eatery. Our server's sluggishness and lack of attentiveness further detracted from our dining experience, leading me to conclude that this restaurant's reputation is undeservedly inflated.""",True,825.0,formal

It was a weekend evening and the place was empty but it was late for dinner. The shrimp tempura roll was rubbery and the yakisoba had over cooked noodles, bad tasting chicken and a gloppy sauce that came right out of a jar.

Don't know who she is to Protech, but she is the rudest, most belligerent, unprofessional individual I have ever dealt with. \n\nSince day one, I had issues with her. We went round and round with trying to fit a scheduled visit to the house for the stove. We came to an agreement. The day before the appointment, Debbie called and canceled, saying the tech isn't available. We then went around and around AGAIN to figure out a new appointment time. Debbie suggested I take a day off of work to accommodate the tech. I told her absolutely not, that the two days off in the middle of the week (not Saturday or Sunday ) were sufficient. Oh no, those days don't work for the tech, it will have to fall on a day of which I work, requiring me to miss work. We finally agreed on a time. The tech came out and looked at the stove. Told me the parts will take 7-10 business days. Fast forward to today. I once again called Debbie to get an update. She says I'm being impatient and unreasonable. That it's only been 9 business days since the tech visited. She tells me to give it more time. What a rude person.",,,informal

1," ""I thoroughly relished the culinary offerings and atmospheric ambiance of the eatery, and initially, I held the server in high esteem for their proficient and hospitable demeanor. However, my satisfaction with the dining experience was short-lived, as a discrepancy in the billing process came to my attention five days subsequent to my visit. Upon scrutinizing my credit card statement, I noticed an unexplained augmentation of $10 in the total amount charged, despite having already tendered a sizeable gratuity of 25% in cash. I promptly brought this irregularity to the attention of the manager, who, after some deliberation, resolved the issue; nonetheless, he posited that the manner in which I inscribed the dollar sign and zero may have engendered confusion. My umbrage with this scenario stems from the fact that the total cost was plainly delineated, and the server, by inferring that their service warranted a 42% gratuity, demonstrated an unreasonable expectation. My counsel to potential patrons would be to either settle their tab with cash or preserve their receipts diligently.""",True,871.0,formal

My problem with the restaurant came five days later when I was reconciling my credit card statement. For the meal I charged my credit card, and left a very generous cash tip of 25%. On the credit card statement I left zero on the tip line, and the total of the meal was entered in the total line. When the charge came through on my credit card, mysteriously the bill had gone up $10. I immediately informed the manager of the error which he was able to resolve; however he stated that the way I wrote a dollar sign and zero may have been confusing. My problem with this is that the total was clearly written and with the cash tip the waiter \""mistakenly\"" thought his service was worth a 42% tip?!?! Are you kidding me?!

However, I must admit that the orange juice was quite refreshing, and the decaf coffee, while not exceptional, was still palatable. The service, on the other hand, was quite satisfactory, with the staff exhibiting a commendable level of friendliness and hospitality. The seating arrangements, while comfortable for lounging, proved less than ideal for dining, as they necessitated an uncomfortable posture when attempting to engage with the table.

Firstly, let us begin with the positive aspects of my visits. The potent potables served here are truly formidable, bordering on the excessive, yet somehow managing to maintain a delicate balance between strength and flavor. My initial order of cheese curds was a prime example of this precarious equilibrium, as the molten, golden goodness arrived at our table, exuding an aroma so pungent, it could have melted the snows of Kilimanjaro. Furthermore, the combination of cheese soup and chunky tomato soup created a symphony of savory sensations that would have made even the most discerning gourmand swoon with delight.

However, my dear sir or madam, allow me to caution you against the less desirable aspects of this dining experience. The pace of service, I must confess, left much to be desired. It was as though the staff had taken a vow of sloth, moving at a glacial pace, as if to test the limits of my patience. Moreover, my second order of cheese curds, curiously crafted from a divergent type of cheese, arrived at our table with an unfortunate chill, rendering them somewhat lackluster in comparison to their predecessors.

In light of these contradictory experiences, I cannot help but wonder what changes the new management might bring to this already intriguing eatery. Will they address the languid tempo of service? Will they refine their menu to eliminate the inconsistencies in quality that plagued my second order of cheese curds? Only time shall reveal the answers to these questions, my dear sir or madam.

I elected to secure General Admission seating, which consisted of a row of chairs devoid of tables or servers.

It is conceivable that some audience members may not recall or be familiar with Joey's character; however, his poor casting was glaringly evident to me.

While I acknowledge the opinions expressed by others regarding the audience's responsiveness, I attribute greater culpability to the Rio for the show's inability to surpass mediocrity. Had we been situated in a booth, indulging in martinis instead of being packed tightly together with fellow audience members, our enjoyment of the performance might have been significantly heightened.",True,1101.0,formal

I took my Dad, who saw Nat King Cole at the Sands in '62, and then watched Dean and Sammy play craps in the casino. \n\nI opted for the GA seats, which is a row of chairs with no tables or servers. That didn't help. The smart way to run this would be to give EVERYONE a table or booth, with servers dressed in 60s costumes, and immerse the audience in the era. As it was, it was impossible to believe you were watching the Rat Pack. You were watching some credible imitators, sure, but you NEVER forgot that. I thought Dean and Frank were really good, Sammy was fair, and Joey, although occasionally funny, looked NOTHING like the real guy. Maybe people don't remember (or never heard of) him, but it was strikingly bad casting to me.\n\nI understand what others have said about the audience, but I think the Rio deserves more blame for the fact that the show never transcends the mundane. If we had been sitting in a booth drinking martinis instead of elbow to elbow with somebody, we might have enjoyed it a LOT more.",,,informal

Furthermore, it would be remiss of me not to mention the existence of other, superior establishments within close proximity that offer comparable, if not vastly superior, fare.

Barely warm brie, some dry apples on top, don't know what was carmelized about them, some fruit on the side and some toast. I saw nothing that was bruleed. Dinner partner had the Escargot, which was good. Second course was petite filet mignon. Petite is right! I should have paid better attention to that word. I was pretty surprised at how little it was. It came with decent sauce, three warm tomato slices and maybe 5 small pieces of potato wedge. I've had better steak fries. Disappointed. Dinner partner had the sea bass, nice flavor but also tiny portion!! Other dinner partner had the pasta. That was good and thank goodness he let me have some or I would have stopped at Culver's on the way home. Their fries are better than what I got by the way. Last course was Hazelnut Tarte. Pretty boring chocolate in boring non-flakey pastry with a few pieces of nut on top. Not impressed. Had called previously to see if their portions were smaller for restaurant week. They told me I wouldn't go away hungry. Wrong. Service was lackluster, had to wait quite a while between courses, had to ask for drinks to be refilled.

My companion and I hesitated, contemplating whether to remain and wait for the cashier's return or to abandon our purchases altogether.

The ambiance was indeed captivating, but the fundamental purpose of a nightclub is to facilitate dancing. This objective becomes unattainable when one finds oneself immured within a throng of six hundred other individuals, whose inebriated state renders them uncoordinated and unpleasant. Although, I conjecture that if one is extremely inebriated, it may be a judicious strategy to force one's way into the center of the crowd, given that it is nearly impossible to fall due to the multitude of people supporting one. Furthermore, the young women positioned in the pool areas evoke melancholy sentiments. When amiable females extend greetings and inquire about one's welfare, and one responds by gazing blankly ahead and affecting a pose from a distance of a foot, it suggests that one has been coerced into such employment.

We started out our meal with the calamari appetizer. This was very good. No issues there.  Then with the meal, I ordered the margarita flat bread. I have ordered this before and loved it. Tonight was not the same. I think it had been sitting under the heat lamp for awhile before it was brought to the table. The last time I remember that it had more fresh basil on it, too. This time the basil didn't even cover the entire pizza and it was not very fresh. I couldn't even taste it. My daughter ordered the shrimp scampi. She asked for some grated Parmesan on it and they brought her some packets of Parmesan and told her they couldn't find the grater.  Really?

The sushi options presented were innovative and diverse, and the rolls my companion and I opted for (Crunchy Spicy Tuna, Leo, Eel Special, Spicy Tuna) were indeed delectable. Nonetheless, the attention accorded to us by our server left much to be desired.

I observed as our sushi languished at the bar, awaiting collection, for an approximate duration of ten minutes. During this time, our server appeared to be engaged in aimless loitering within the restaurant, displaying an evident lack of urgency in attending to our needs. Upon the eventual delivery of our fare, it transpired that our server had erroneously requested that tobiko be added to the incorrect roll. While this mishap was rectified upon my request for additional tobiko on the side, our server vanished without a trace, only to resurface at the conclusion of our repast. At this juncture, she proffered the side of tobiko with a smug remark, ""well, I suppose it's a bit tardy,"" which struck me as somewhat condescending.

In light of this experience, I shall refrain from patronizing this establishment again, particularly in the server's section whose name I managed to procure from the receipt.

Furthermore, the taste of the Murphy's Irish stout, while certainly uncommon in these parts, was slightly disappointing. Upon paying twenty-seven dollars (including gratuity, mind you) for three pints, my fleeting impression of being in a genuine British pub quickly dissipated. Personally, I would prefer to consume pints of locally brewed, fresher, and more affordable beer a mere few blocks away at Dieu Du Ciel. As for the culinary offerings, my dining companion reported that the homemade egg noodles and roasted eggplant ragout were quite flavorful. The menu itself featured several enticing options, although the Ploughman's Lunch priced at thirteen dollars deviated slightly from the customary fare found in traditional pubs.

The Wynn's Sugar & Ice, nestled within the opulent esplanade, presents an unfortunate paradox; its proximity to an array of high-end boutiques notwithstanding, this eatery falls short of its potential as an ideal refuge for those seeking a delectable respite prior to embarking upon the vibrant Las Vegas Strip. Lamentably, a multitude of drawbacks sullies the experience, beginning with an interminable wait for one's culinary selections to arrive at their table. Furthermore, the menu, though replete with gelato and cookie offerings, proves woefully inadequate for those craving a more substantial repast, such as a salad or sandwich; the selection, in this regard, borders on the anemic.

However, upon inquiring with my companion, I discovered that the options available within our immediate vicinity were limited due to the late hour.

To my delight, the combination of peaches and whiskey proved to be an inspired choice, earning my enthusiastic approval.

It is, without a doubt, a rather unpretentious and unassuming venue, which can either be a positive or negative attribute, depending on one's preferences. On certain occasions, the most exceptional culinary experiences can be had in such unremarkable settings. Unfortunately, my encounter with the hookah at this particular establishment did not live up to my expectations. The ambiance, while endearingly quaint, appeared somewhat kitschy and overly ornate, giving the impression that the waitstaff, who were visibly inexperienced and perhaps new to the industry, may have been struggling to maintain a sense of proficiency in their duties. Despite these shortcomings, I must concede that the restaurant does possess an undeniable authenticity, although my own experiences have led me to conclude that the quality of the food, while passable, fell short of excellence. Thus, I harbor some reservations regarding a potential return visit.",True,1516.0,formal

The hookah just was not very good. The decor seemed cheap and the waitresses were young and it was obviously their first time serving in the industry. I will say it is authentic, but i've definitely had better. The food was okay. Not great, just okay. I'm not sure if I would go back.",,,informal

The abundance of subpar frosting, which lacks a discernible gustatory essence, only serves to exacerbate the aridity of the cake. My personal encounter with the carrot cake variant served to reinforce these sentiments, as its desiccated texture necessitated the accompaniment of an unfermented dairy product or other liquid refreshment to facilitate ingestion. Moreover, the frosting, while not sharing the same degree of xerography as the cake, contributed an excessive saccharinity that further detracted from any semblance of gastronomic enjoyment. Disenchanted with my purchase, I elected to abandon the remaining cupcake.""",True,1518.0,formal

During my most recent experience, I observed a security officer diligently scrutinizing a particular piece of luggage via the X-ray machine, only to repeatedly pass it back and forth through the apparatus for a duration of approximately 10 minutes before summoning a colleague to join him in his endeavors. Following a brief interval of convivial conversation, they resumed their examination of the aforementioned luggage, expending an additional 10 minutes of their time and that of the queue of passengers awaiting their turn. It would appear that a more expedient approach might involve simply opening the item in question, thereby obviating the need for such an extended and laborious procedure. Furthermore, I must express my utter bewilderment at the absence of clear signage in Terminal B, which led to a great deal of confusion regarding the location of gates 1-21. Specifically, while the numerical designations proceed sequentially from 1 to 11 on one side of the corridor, they unexpectedly reverse direction and continue ascending on the opposite side, rendering it unnecessary to traverse the entire length of the passageway in order to reach gate 3. This airport has consistently deteriorated in terms of its overall quality and efficiency, and it is my sincere hope that efforts will be undertaken to address these issues in the interest of improving the experience for travelers.

The performance takes place every thirty minutes once the sun has set. According to the website, the show commences at eight o'clock in the evening; however, due to the lingering presence of sunlight in the sky, the start time was postponed until half past eight. This delay was quite disappointing.
We returned to the venue at half past eight, and the show lasted a mere three minutes. A colossal frog ascended to the summit of the artificial waterfall and performed a melodic rendition of ""What a Wonderful World."" Although the display was moderately captivating, I had anticipated a more extensive presentation.
Subsequently, we attended the second showing at nine o'clock that evening, only to be met with a technological malfunction. Throughout the exhibition, two spheres traversed the pond in circular motions (a relatively lackluster spectacle). In the midst of the performance, the illumination suddenly ceased, and the music halted abruptly.

This lackadaisical attitude towards customer care was particularly striking given the absence of any other patrons in the establishment at the time, rendering her behavior all the more inexcusable. Furthermore, the fact that she continued to compose and send messages without so much as acknowledging my presence or offering a cursory apology for the delay left me feeling disrespected and ignored.

We paid a sum of $79.99 for two individuals, and in retrospect, it would have been more judicious to allocate such funds towards dining at an upscale eatery instead.

The variety of comestibles available was rather limited, and as ardent devotees of seafood, we were dismayed by the absence of any notable aquatic delicacies. Moreover, the trio of sushi options did not entice us to indulge, as their visual appearance failed to convey a sense of freshness. The majority of the edibles we consumed were devoid of flavor, and the assortment of confectionaries did not prove to be particularly palatable either.

Of course that doesnt include any blow dry or style after.  The problem for me was that the store managers expect you to do 8 minute cuts.  There were so many stylist that did 8 min (or less) cuts but they had a ton of re-do's.  I never had re-do's but I refused to rush a haircut.  I got alot of crap for not rushing.  I hated the job.

Furthermore, the food itself was both overpriced and disappointingly prepared, as exemplified by the Thai chicken mushrooms with peanut sauce, which featured shredded chicken breast that was remarkably dry and a peanut sauce that failed to impress. Similarly, the beef and blue mushrooms dish suffered from the same issues of subpar preparation and presentation, with the added dimension of uninspired ingredient choice. Compounding these issues was the Reuben sandwich, which featured store-bought shaved corned beef and a stale pretzel roll, further contributing to an overall sense of dissatisfaction. Notably, an unexpected turn of events transpired when another customer inadvertently settled the bill, resulting in a curious scenario where the waitress compensated for the discrepancy by deducting the difference from her own gratuity.

I have been to a lot of authentic Korean BBQ/Restaurants, but this was nowhere close.  When you leave a Korean restaurant, you are supposed to leave with a full stomach, I was still hungry.  Rice was a separate order...wtf is that shit.  One of the main reasons I am upset at this place is because they didn't have most of the appetizers or much of anything else available.  They had only a couple of beers to choose from (Japanese), even though the menu has about 7 imported beers.  I like Japanese beer, don't get me wrong, but come the fuck on, if you are a Korean BBQ restaurant...I expect to at least drink my native beer.  They should change their name, this is not a real Korean BBQ place.  I was wondering why nobody else was in the restaurant.  I believe this place is run by a bunch of kids, their parents would be so disappointed or at the very least Koreans, so embarrassing.

I just wish they have a special sauce as dipping instead of just plain soy sauce. As entrees, we got the chicken and vegetables which came out cold, might have been that the chef forgot to put it first in the microwave. We returned it and the waiter said he will check with the chef. But what is there to check. So we told them to change it to grilled chicken instead. The manager (I guess) came to us and said the grilled chicken will take a while and said maybe because of the weather that's why it got cold. But the other entree Ma-la shrimp and chicken was steaming hot. Anyway, the grilled chicken came steaming hot and with barbeque sauce.

Moreover, I intended to order the BBQ pork bowl, but instead, I received a similar setup to the BBQ meatball dish, consisting of an ample amount of lettuce and herbs, accompanied by some BBQ pork and what appeared to be two miniature patties.

Judging from the numerous vacant parking spaces, it appears that the restaurant's popularity has declined precipitously.

It is worth noting that there are prominent displays of Guy Fieri's image throughout the premises, leading one to speculate that perhaps the restaurant's reputation was purchased rather than earned through culinary excellence.

In fact, my own homemade BBQ sauce proved superior in both taste and quality.  The remaining meats, including ribs, brisket, and pork, were merely adequate, with the latter two exhibiting notable deficiencies in texture and flavor.  Specifically, the ribs were tender but lacked any discernible flavor, while the brisket was excessively fatty and possessed an unpleasant texture.  Moreover, the pork had an unusual aftertaste that detracted from its overall enjoyment.  The sides, including coleslaw, BBQ beans, and potato salad, were equally underwhelming, with each dish suffering from an absence of proper seasoning.  Notably, the coleslaw lacked the necessary acidity, while the BBQ beans failed to impress, with my husband commenting that Bush's canned variety surpassed the restaurant's offering.  Similarly, the potato salad was uninspired and lacked any distinguishing characteristics.  However, the breaded pickles, though uneven in their coating, were moderately successful, with their paired ranch dipping sauce enhancing their flavor.  The ambiance of the restaurant itself was reminiscent of a Five and Diner, with a quaint, charming atmosphere that seemed incongruous with the subpar fare served.

It appears that an egregious culinary misstep has become customary within their kitchen, as the scathing reviews I perused prior to my arrival substantiated my fears. For the second consecutive occasion, my burger arrived in a state of extreme culinary neglect, with nary a hint of pinkness to be discerned. If indeed your gastronomical prowess is so limited that the attainment of a medium-cooked burger proves an insurmountable challenge, then perhaps candor would serve you better than this unmitigated charade. My order of a brisket burger, priced at twelve dollars, suffered a similar fate, emerging from the kitchen in a state of utter desiccation and devoid of any semblance of flavor. The onions accompanying the dish were likewise woefully undercooked, while the tater tots, though edible, failed to redeem the meal in any significant manner. Despite the commendable nature of the service and the agreeable ambiance afforded by the outdoor seating area, it cannot be overlooked that the consistent propensity towards such drastic overcooking of beef renders the establishment unworthy of future patronage.

My order of a brisket burger ($12), which I asked for medium, came out as well and dry.  Dry, tasteless.  The onions were undercooked.

Our companion's selection of pulled pork sliders also garnered her enthusiastic approval. While the edibles were undoubtedly satisfying, the same cannot be said for the pace of service, which left much to be desired.

The service we received during our visit was also subpar, as there were noticeable lapses in attention and responsiveness, resulting in prolonged waiting periods for both food and beverages, which proved frustrating and inconvenient.

The service, though, was quite satisfactory. As a novice customer, I sought guidance from the woman behind the counter regarding the most popular items on the menu. She was extremely helpful in elaborating on the various options, providing me with a comprehensive understanding of the dishes available.

However, upon our arrival at 9:45 A.M., we observed that the parking lot was already teeming with individuals who appeared to be deeply engrossed in their search for fresh produce. My concern was that I might have missed out on some exceptional specimens.

Upon entering the market, it became apparent that McClendons was responsible for providing the vast majority of the produce on offer. Their display presented a visually stunning array of vibrant colors, including deep purple red beets, lush green leeks, fingerling potatoes, shallots, farm-fresh broccoli, and an assortment of other delectable delights. Many of these items were certified organic and clearly labeled with their origins, which added an extra layer of appeal. Several of the products were sourced from Willcox, thereby ensuring their exceptional freshness.

Despite the presence of five operational registers, a considerable queue had formed, comprising primarily housewives who were zealously gathering and selecting vegetables with remarkable speed and determination. It was imperative to remain vigilant and agile to avoid being overwhelmed or trampled by the enthusiastic shoppers. Nonetheless, the quality of the produce made the experience well worth the effort.

Beyond the fresh produce, the market offered a limited selection of artisanal goods, such as handmade soap, blankets, jewelry, yarn crafts, and a solitary bread stand. While this variety was somewhat underwhelming, the prospect of acquiring fresh, high-quality produce remained the primary draw for me.

In conclusion, while I would certainly consider revisiting this market if I found myself in the vicinity, I would not go out of my way to do so, given my typically busy schedule and the fact that I am usually at work on Wednesday mornings.

Considering the fact that the seafood in LA is often fresher and not previously frozen due to the city's proximity to harbors, I entered Hiro's with tempered expectations to avoid potential disappointment. Generally speaking, the atmosphere and sushi quality are quite satisfactory for a venue situated in Arizona. Nonetheless, the prices are somewhat elevated, which is only natural given the restaurant's location in Scottsdale and the associated increased costs of procuring premium seafood in an inland area. Furthermore, I find it perplexing that the bento boxes, such as the Teriyaki Chicken and Mixed Tempura, carry such a hefty price tag.

I would comprehend if they were offering Kobe beef or something of similar caliber, but for chicken, it seems unjustified. To compound matters, the chicken I received during my visit was slightly dry.

""The consumption of falafel was analogous to ingesting granular particles of earth, genuinely resembling the sensation of devouring sand. Indeed, the exterior presented an excessive crispiness, evoking memories of seaside excursions where the fine grains of sand had an unfortunate propensity to insinuate themselves into my oral cavity. Furthermore, the falafel plate was accompanied by a serving of rice, a mixed greens salad, and a pita bread, yet lacked any substantial dipping sauce, such as hummus, to alleviate the aridity of the meal. A minuscule quantity of tahini was provided in a small plastic ramekin, which proved insufficient in offering respite from the pervasive dryness. In light of this, I implore my fellow Yelp reviewers to opt for either the falafel sandwich or alternative value meals, thereby avoiding the unpleasantness of parched oral cavities at a Greek pita eatery. Additionally, the prices charged for these meals were deemed excessive, with a falafel plate accompanied by a carbonated beverage amounting to nearly $12, while the inclusion of hummus as a means of addressing the aforementioned dryness issue would result in a total cost of approximately $16 to $17 for a single individual.""",True,2128.0,formal

However, my gastronomical journey was somewhat curtailed due to my personal aversion to seafood (which is flown in fresh from the Mediterranean daily), which I deemed excessively extravagant, albeit comprehensible given the arid climate's dearth of aquatic delicacies. Thus, I opted for a select few pasta dishes and a portion of pancetta. While the pancetta proved to be somewhat chewy and fatty, I anticipated such characteristics; nevertheless, it could have been more refined. In contrast, the sheep's milk ravioli delighted my taste buds, although the spaghetti accompanied by ragu could have been more flavorful. Ultimately, my satisfaction with Bartolotta's was limited, primarily due to the premium pricing; nevertheless, I acknowledge that dining alfresco might have enhanced my overall experience.

The gambling establishment within the hotel merited five stars due to the presence of skilled croupiers and an abundance of engaging activities. Unfortunately, the culinary options only garnered two stars, as there was no Starbucks within the premises of the hotel. Moreover, there was no eatery available around the clock, obliging me to venture to Bally's to acquire a slice of pizza or a sandwich from Subway at three o'clock in the morning when I yearned for sustenance. Concerning the sleeping quarters, I would rate them two and a half stars. The bed was uncomfortable, possessing a springy and economical quality that caused discomfort for my back. Notwithstanding my relatively youthful age of thirty-one, the bed's quality was subpar. For reasons unknown, the television was situated at a distance from the bed, rendering it impractical to view from a recumbent position. Although the room appeared tidy and luxurious, it was predictable given the hotel's location on the strip. Considering the entirety of the amenities offered, I would assign an average rating of three stars.

Alas, despite my eagerness to bestow upon this establishment the highest praise, I must confess that it fell short of my expectations, garnering a mere three stars from this fastidious critic.  

While the portion sizes at Republic Ramen Noodles are undoubtedly generous, and the flavors they proffer are indeed unique, their interpretation of ""spicy"" leaves much to be desired for those who crave a truly piquant experience.

3," These delectable, visually-appealing cupcakes possess an aesthetic quality reminiscent of those that are meticulously crafted and presented at upscale social gatherings, specifically weddings, evoking a sense of refined elegance and sophistication attributed to the renowned lifestyle icon, Martha Stewart; they would undoubtedly be the centerpiece of attention when displayed in abundance and diversity on a serving tray, exuding an air of lavishness and charm.

The culinary offerings within the conference hall were indeed delectable, with breakfast boasting a satisfying substantiality, while lunch rivaled dinner in both quantity and quality.

It is essential to emphasize that the cuisine was not of poor quality; however, the prices charged were incommensurate with the quantity and quality of the dishes served.

The cheese and charcuterie plate, offered at $18, was regrettably minuscule, appearing somewhat lackluster and questionably fresh. My companion and I opted for the lamb bolognese and cassoulet, both of which were palatable yet insufficiently substantial for the price of $24 per dish. Additionally, the portion sizes were relatively meager. We also sampled the Russian honey cake, which, while pleasant, would have benefited from being freshly prepared. Its slightly chilled temperature and faintly synthetic taste suggested that it had not been recently baked.

In light of the above, it is reasonable to assert that the cost of our dinner was disproportionate to the value received. Considering the modest scale of the enterprise and its recent inception, it would be more judicious for the restaurant to cultivate a devoted clientele by providing reasonably priced, refined comfort food, rather than overcompensating for expenses by inflating menu prices. This approach may potentially foster a loyal patronage and facilitate sustainable growth.

An additional observation reinforces this argument: the eatery's decor and tableware appear somewhat economical, employing inexpensive materials. While there is no inherent issue with frugality, the incongruity of consuming a $24 entree with low-cost utensils becomes apparent.

""Desiring a transformation from the customary ambiance of the Half Moon for a particular Sunday Night Football gathering, I pursued an alternative sports bar within the 85016 zip code.

""Poutine was a culinary experience we were eager to indulge in during our visit to Montreal. Cafe Poutine, situated in the historic and touristy district of Old Montreal, seemed like an ideal establishment to sample this quintessential Quebecois dish. Upon entering the cozy eatery, we were immediately struck by the bustling atmosphere and the tight spacing between tables, which made navigating the narrow aisles somewhat challenging.  

The menu offered an array of poutine options, each showcasing unique ingredient combinations that piqued our interest.

My fiancÃ© opted for the smoked meat poutine, while I decided on the chicken, apple, and brie sandwich, omitting the poutine component. We rationalized that sharing would be feasible since portion sizes appeared generous.  

Upon ordering, we encountered some misunderstandings. Despite requesting no fries, my plate arrived with an abundance of golden, crispy fries, which, although delicious, did not align with my expectations. The poutine itself was satisfactory but failed to meet the lofty standards we had built up in our minds. The flavors didn't meld together seamlessly, and the fries with cheese and gravy didn't live up to their touted reputation. Conversely, my sandwich delighted my taste buds, as the perfectly toasted baguette complemented the richness of the brie and the sweetness of the apples.  

Our server's attitude bordered on brusqueness, as they seemed rushed and slightly indifferent to our needs. Two minor requests - excluding cheese from my sandwich and omitting fries from my plate - went unfulfilled, leaving a trace of disappointment.  

The prices charged at Cafe Poutine were moderately steep, with a total of 35 Canadian dollars spent on two waters, a smoked meat poutine, and a chicken sandwich. Although understandable given the location, the cost didn't quite align with the quality of the meal.

The restaurant was small and crowded...it was tough  trying to get between the tables. \n\nThe menu was promising - tons of Poutine options as well as sandwiches with a side of poutine as an option. My fiance had the poutine with smoked meat and I had the chicken, apple and brie sandwich- no poutine (I figured I could share). The portions were huge - I had a pile of fries on my plate (even though I had asked for no fries). The poutine was okay, not as mind-blowing as fries with cheese and gravy promised to be. My sandwich was so delicious. The baguette was perfectly toasted and the brie and apples were a great compliment.\n\nThe service was hurried and not very accommodating. i asked for no cheese on the sandwich, which they said wasn't possible. They also missed the no fries request.\n\nThe prices were also high- 2 waters, smoked meat poutine and a chicken sandwich set us back 35 CA.

3," I cannot express an excessive amount of dissatisfaction with this establishment, primarily due to the fact that my stay was complimentary, courtesy of my platinum player status. Although the hotel's age and lack of modernity may have contributed to its relatively low level of appeal, I did not find it particularly bothersome during my brief period of occupancy. However, I must admit that certain aspects of the service left much to be desired, specifically the housekeeping staff's tendency to disregard our explicit requests for privacy by entering our room unannounced, even when the 'do not disturb' sign was prominently displayed. This particular incident occurred in the early afternoon, when my companion and I were attempting to take a brief nap, and the sudden intrusion left me feeling understandably uneasy. Furthermore, I must caution potential guests against the inconvenience caused by the live music performances that take place on the strip side of the hotel, which can be heard throughout the day and late into the night. Specifically, the band responsible for these musical offerings possesses a questionable level of talent, and their prolonged sets can prove to be particularly grating on the nerves, especially for those seeking a peaceful rest. In light of these factors, I would advise future visitors to exercise vigilance when booking their accommodations, particularly regarding the chapel hours, as my acquaintance discovered that the third-floor chapel was already closed by the time he attempted to utilize its services.

3," ""It is utterly perplexing that individuals who have ostensibly partaken in a culinary excursion to Las Vegas would lavish such effusive praise upon a buffet that patently fails to deliver an adequate gastronomical experience, leading one to wonder whether said individuals have indeed sampled the myriad of other superior buffets available in the city. The allocation of a mere quarter of the buffet's offerings to bread, a staple that is hardly worthy of such prominence, is particularly vexing, especially considering the exorbitant cost of $40 per person. Furthermore, the quality of the fare is not commensurate with the price, as the standout dish, a California roll, relies solely on the utilization of authentic crab meat to salvage its flavor. The service, while satisfactory, is rendered inconsequential by the fact that it is only accessible to those seated at the bar. One must ponder what distinguishing characteristics this buffet possesses that warrant such lofty acclaim, as prime rib, cold shrimp, and crab are ubiquitous items offered by every buffet in Las Vegas, and certainly not at such an extortionate price. In contrast, the Rio Carnival World Buffet, Rio Seafood Buffet, and Wynn Buffet are infinitely superior options.""",True,2508.0,formal

Good aspects include:

* The culinary offerings (once procured) were undoubtedly impressive, particularly the lobster and corn, which elicited a profoundly enthusiastic response. Additionally, the beverage named in honor of nobility, although forgotten, was indeed commendable.

* The menu boasted an array of diverse options, providing ample opportunities for exploration and discovery.

* The beverages, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, were meticulously crafted and presented in abundance, complemented by an assortment of innovative weekly specials.

Conversely, the following drawbacks were observed:

* The quality of service was subpar, characterized by an excessive number of personnel clad in black attire, alongside two hostesses, which seemed disproportionate to the needs of the establishment. Moreover, the bartender demonstrated remarkable dedication to their duties, reminiscent of the cinematic portrayal of someone possessing exceptional skill or aptitude. However, management would benefit from addressing this discrepancy within the staff.

Notwithstanding the fact that the hotel management had hired a driver with questionable mental stability, I cannot express excessive dissatisfaction with The Mirage, as rooms are offered at a reasonable tariff, albeit slightly higher than in previous years.

The exterior areas of the property were well-maintained; however, the guest rooms required some refurbishment. Specifically, the bathroom tiles and shower curtain needed replacement, and an empty cabinet beneath the television appeared to have been previously occupied by a refrigerator, evidenced by scratches and dents. Furthermore, the televisions functioned intermittently. My interactions with the staff were limited to check-in and check-out, and they were adequate during those brief encounters. The resort offered various recreational activities, including two swimming pools, outdoor movie screenings, marshmallow roasting, live music, miniature golf, and a playground for children. Additionally, guests could rent paddleboards and kayaks to explore Lake Las Vegas for a fee of $30 per hour. Observing other patrons with their canine companions, I inferred that the resort accommodated pets. Perhaps, my own furry companion will join me on a future visit.

3," Red Ridge Park constitutes a mere ten-minute pedestrian excursion from my present domicile, which I shall be vacating in the near future, thus rendering my erstwhile frequent visits to this picturesque park a distant memory. During my days of unyielding physical fitness regimentation, I would endeavor to circumnavigate the park's perimeter, whose distance approximates a mile, albeit with slight variations in elevation, owing to the park's topographical configuration, comprising of two inclined sides and two flat expanses, thereby facilitating an unencumbered running experience. Moreover, I have always appreciated the park's nocturnal illumination, which engenders a sense of security, particularly when traversing the premises singularly. 

The park's amenities include a diminutive water-themed recreational area for juveniles, an extensive playground for older children, a smaller play area designated for younger offspring (refer to visual depictions), basketball courts, and a baseball diamond (visual representation provided). Despite its constant throng of patrons, I have yet to experience a sensation of overcrowding within the park's confines. Observations have revealed that visitors indulge in various activities such as ambulating, interacting with canine companions, or simply luxuriating in the sun's radiant warmth while partaking in gastronomical delights. 

Of late, residential dwellings have begun to materialize directly opposite the park, specifically, the Dunhill abodes, whose prices range from approximately 200,000 units of the local currency as a starting point, and the neighborhood is undergoing rapid development. These habitats merit consideration, especially for those who harbor an affinity for the southwestern sector. Furthermore, the proximity of these residences to the park grants the benefit of verdant vistas, whereas alternative perspectives may encompass views of neighboring structures. Additionally, the recently established Wet n Wild Water Park lies in close proximity. Notwithstanding, a certain feature that I ardently desire to witness within this park's precincts is the presence of an enclosed canine recreational area, akin to those encountered during my peregrinations to other parks.",True,2609.0,formal

Our desire was to discover a setting where we could partake in a refreshing beverage and observe the passersby. This particular venue fulfilled our requirements admirably.

Fortuitously, we possessed a pair of complimentary beverage vouchers, thereby eliminating the necessity for financial expenditure.

Thus, I elected to sample a chocolate-orange blend, augmented by whisked soy milk and agave, at a total cost of $4.50.

Notwithstanding these misgivings, I must admit that the tea was quite palatable.

""I find myself in a state of ambivalence regarding this critique, as our dining experience at the establishment was marked by both exceptional service and delectable cuisine, yet unfortunately marred by an unfortunate incident involving two members of our party who suffered from food poisoning, which we suspect was caused by the mussels. Despite this setback, we opted to sample a variety of dishes, including their signature jumbo lump crab cake, braised short ribs pierogies, arancinis, potato gnocchi & lobster, and the aforementioned mussels. During the meal, I thoroughly enjoyed all of the dishes, with my particular favorites being the lobster gnocchi and the arancinis, although the latter were slightly tainted by the bitterness of the port wine. In addition, we also indulged in a selection of their beverages, ranging from the Braddock's smash to the Moscow mule and Prohibition pear martini, as well as the option to create one's own Manhattan cocktail.

We typically frequent the establishment located at the intersection of Bell and 7th Streets or 27th Avenue and 101st Street. The culinary offerings, for the most part, are at least average to slightly above average in quality. The complimentary chips and salsa are a remarkable value, and the green chile and enchilada soups are particularly delectable. The consistency of the fare across all Chili's locations we visit is quite gratifying. However, there appears to be a persistent issue with the service at the North Valley Parkway branch. During their initial opening phase, we attempted to dine there twice due to its proximity to our domicile. Unfortunately, both experiences were marred by botched orders and friendly yet menu-ignorant servers. The prolonged delay in receiving our cuisine was further exacerbated by the absence of any contrite sentiments. Following a brief hiatus, we opted to give them another chance, presuming that the novelty had worn off and any glitches would have been ironed out. Alas, our expectations were not met, as the wait time for our edibles was extraordinary, and securing a replenishment of our beverages proved to be a futile endeavor. Fast forward over a year, and our most recent visit transpired last Saturday. Our server was quite pleasant, and the hostesses were cordial, yet the duration between ordering and consuming our soup and salad, accompanied by water as our beverage, spanned an unacceptable ninety minutes. It is reasonable to surmise that four instances of subpar service are unlikely to be mere happenstance. In stark contrast, the Chili's situated on 7th Street consistently delivers exceptional hospitality and customary waiting periods. It is my ardent hope that this anomaly shall be rectified, as Chili's poses a respectable dining option.",True,2753.0,formal

Accompanying this dish were paper-thin frites, expertly cooked and seasoned with precision, as well as a raw vegetable salad, finely sliced and dressed with a vinaigrette.

It would be nicer if they had pictures instead of a word description of each item. I selected the combo platter of bulgogi which was 9.99. Afterwards it was a long wait of approximately 25 minutes before we got our food. The dish itself came with a large amount of rice and 2 ban chae along with a bean soup. Based on the pictures I could have chose the beef bulgogi paid less and likely gotten the same amount of food except less variety. The bulgogi was well seasoned, but the meat was cut into smaller slices which detracted from it. Prices have gone up according to my wife since she was in college.

3," I have had the pleasure of visiting Aunt Chilada's on multiple occasions during my time in Arizona, and while each experience has been relatively uneventful, there was one particular visit that stands out as particularly memorable. It was an evening when one of my companions and I decided to engage in a playful activity, inspired by the iconic Disney character, Ariel, from The Little Mermaid, where we used plastic forks to groom our hair before entering the establishment. Furthermore, I recall that shortly after making a humorous observation regarding individuals from rural areas, we felt compelled to utilize the aforementioned utensils to tidy up our coiffures. The motivation behind this behavior remains unclear, but it seemed amusing at the time. Moving on, the culinary offerings at Aunt Chilada's have never been exceptional or remarkably poor; they are perhaps adequate enough to warrant a visit if one is in close proximity and desires to partake in a leisurely meal accompanied by refreshing margaritas on the outdoor seating area. In conclusion, while not outstanding, the eatery does not necessarily warrant avoidance, and thus, I shall confer an additional star in recognition of its mediocrity.",True,2796.0,formal

Specifically, the pork sliders proved to be delectable, as did the mushroom burger, which was cooked to a precise medium rare, thereby showcasing the culinary prowess of the kitchen staff. Furthermore, the fries exhibited a satisfying crunchiness that enhanced their overall appeal. However, the mashed potatoes failed to impress us due to their stale and uninspired flavor profile. The most notable disappointment was the buttermilk fried chicken, which, despite its perfectly executed crisp exterior, lacked any discernible flavor, rendering it a bland and unremarkable dish. It is conceivable that celebrity chef Aaron Sanchez, who allegedly created the menu and recipes, inadvertently overlooked the glaring absence of seasoning in the fried chicken recipe or, alternatively, the restaurant's staff neglected to incorporate salt into the dish, resulting in an unfortunate deficiency in flavor.",True,2797.0,formal

During my initial visit, I opted for the filled potato skin appetizer, which, despite its generous portion size, suffered from an unfortunate lack of moisture. A dipping sauce or condiment would have greatly enhanced the dish's overall satisfaction quotient. On a subsequent visit, I decided to sample their Caribbean chicken sandwich, which featured a grilled chicken breast complemented by fresh tomatoes, avocados, and a dubious ""Caribbean"" sauce. Unfortunately, this particular condiment proved to be a disappointment, boasting an unsettling combination of cinnamon and cloves that seemed wildly incongruous when paired with the chicken and avocado. In fact, my husband and mother-in-law, who also had the misfortune of sampling this sauce, concurred with my assessment. Disappointed but not defeated, I elected to replace my meal with the turkey burger, which, while palatable, failed to fully satiate my gastronomic desires due to my heightened state of stress caused by the delay in receiving my food and the fact that my fellow diners had already completed their meals. However, I must acknowledge that the service at TGI Fridays has consistently met high standards of friendliness and professionalism, and I appreciate the fact that they did not charge me for the initial order.",True,2800.0,formal

Following this episode reminiscent of my freshman year of college, we opted to place an order for several rolls. Unfortunately, none of these rolls managed to elicit any remarkable sentiment among us - Lava (a ""special"" roll possessing the potential to be significantly more extraordinary), Dragon (the most exceptional of the group), veggie (a vegetarian option unexpectedly deemed satisfactory by the sole member of our party abstaining from consuming meat), and tempura shrimp (remarkably lacking in flavor). The edamame, although palatable, failed to exhibit any remarkable quality that would set it apart from others of its kind.

The seating arrangements, characterized by their antiquated, golden theater-style design, were also less than ideal, providing a level of discomfort that detracted from my overall enjoyment.

3," ""I have had the unfortunate experience of traversing both terminals within a single day, and let me tell you, it was an utter debacle. Terminal 1 caters exclusively to domestic flights, boasting a parking garage replete with covered parking spaces, albeit lacking the erstwhile coin-meter parking system, which I lament profusely. Nevertheless, the convenience of card payment has been implemented as a consolation prize. Passable cleanliness is all that can be expected from an airport, and Terminal 1 barely meets that standard. The staff manning the information desk exhibit remarkable friendliness and competence, while the departure and arrival signs are displayed clearly on modern LCD screens. However, the absence of signs indicating which escalators lead to specific flights from the floor level is a glaring oversight that warrants rectification. It is advisable to avoid scheduling flights during peak days such as Fridays and weekends, as the airport becomes congested and chaotic. 
Terminal 2, on the other hand, is designated for international flights and those bound for Hawaii. Unfortunately, the signs demarcating Terminal 2 are rather inconspicuous, making them easily missable. Efforts should be made to enhance accessibility and visibility by installing a prominent Terminal 2 sign. Uncovered parking spaces are available at the same rate as Terminal 1, but the ambiance leaves much to be desired. The atmosphere feels grimy, and visible dirt and grime are ubiquitous. To ensure a hygienic experience, it is imperative to bring sanitizing agents.

While Caesar's Palace is often lauded as the premier destination for such indulgences, I chose to explore an alternative establishment boasting an equally impressive reputation. My expectations were admittedly high, and while certain aspects of the meal did not entirely disappoint, several elements fell short of my lofty standards.

Furthermore, some of the side dishes failed to impress, with their flavors being described as uninspired and insipid.

Upon partaking of the culinary offerings, I found myself already yearning for the mussels a mere hour later, which is a testament to their gastronomical appeal. The white wine, butter, and garlic sauce combination was truly divine, particularly when one submerges the frites in said sauce for a brief interlude, allowing the flavors to meld together in a most harmonious manner. The French onion soup was also noteworthy, as it was one of the more superior examples of this particular dish that I have had the pleasure of consuming. It is all too common for establishments to rely on salt as a means of masking the absence of genuine onion flavor in their soups, but at Pinot Brasserie, the onion broth is allowed to shine in its unadulterated form, much to my gustatory delight. In conclusion, the edible aspects of our experience were indeed satisfactory. However, the quality of service left much to be desired. Our server was abysmal, displaying a complete lack of warmth or welcoming demeanor. She seemed taken aback by our expressions of gratitude, failing to demonstrate even a semblance of cordiality.

In light of such circumstances, it may be wise to consider alternative options, such as securing a table and informing the hostess of the reasons behind doing so, in order to avoid prolonged dissatisfaction. Unfortunately, even management personnel seem to be impervious to the plight of patrons, as they may deliberately ignore or disregard concerns brought to their attention.
It is truly lamentable that establishments with considerable potential, such as this particular pub, fail to meet expectations and fall short of providing adequate service and knowledge. This is particularly evident in the case of beer, wherein the staff displays a glaring lack of familiarity with the various offerings available. In fact, the server's inability to effectively promote the pub's own beer, despite having an extensive selection of thirty plus options on tap, is a testament to this deficiency. While the quality of the beer itself may be satisfactory, the absence of enthusiasm and expertise among staff members undermines the overall experience. Moreover, delays in receiving food orders only serve to compound the issues already present. Ultimately, given the unsatisfactory nature of the visit, it is unlikely that a return trip will be made to this establishment.",True,2940.0,formal

Specifically, the hummus, which was undoubtedly scrumptious, appeared to be somewhat overpriced at $10, considering its volume could have been more substantial. Similarly, my spouse's lamb shanks, while flavorful and tender, seemed to carry a price tag of $23 that was marginally excessive relative to the portion size. Additionally, the cost of a Stella Artois and an Apple Martini, both priced at $10, struck me as somewhat steep.

Specifically, the quality of the food was generally consistent with my expectations, with the filets, ribeye, and seabass being cooked to my liking. However, the sides were a significant letdown, as the creamed spinach and mac and cheese were excessively soggy due to an overabundance of panko breadcrumbs, which rendered them unpalatable. In contrast, the mashed potatoes were adequate, albeit unremarkable. 

The service we received was also variable, as the initial wait staff seemed dismissive and disinterested in our needs, whereas the Asian server who replaced them was more attentive and responsive. Notably, the hostesses who greeted us upon arrival were quite condescending and appeared to be engaged in derogatory conversation about our group, which was disconcerting and unwelcoming. 

In terms of ambiance, the physical space of the restaurant was appealing, but our preference for seating upstairs was thwarted by a private party, which limited our options. Moreover, the practice of automatically including a generous gratuity in the bill, despite the inconsistent quality of service, struck me as inappropriate and potentially exploitative. 

In conclusion, while the culinary offerings of this establishment were largely satisfying, the deficiencies in customer service and the questionable practice of bundling tips with the bill leave me hesitant to wholeheartedly recommend it.

The prices seemed inline with elsewhere i.e. Dr. Hauschka prices were the same as Olgivy's, but again, I would compare as some products may have a premium attached to the price simply because you can't readily get access to that brand elsewhere in Montreal. \n\nAnother thing that sucks is that on the Sephora website orders in the US over 50$ are free, however Canadian orders it's over $150 to get free shipping, Again, check out skinstore.com",,,informal

  The service was adequate, with a single bartender attending to our needs, but their demeanor was somewhat indifferent, as they failed to demonstrate enthusiasm when discussing the cocktails and instead offered a cursory assurance that all options were equally excellent. 
  We opted for two particular cocktails: Agnatha & Anni and August 21st, 1959.  My Agnatha was quite enjoyable, with its crisp, tart, and robust flavors, although the presence of minute ice shards was slightly bothersome; however, this issue was quickly resolved as the ice dissolved.  The August 21st was relatively unremarkable, possessing a smoky essence that, while not aligning with my personal preferences, may appeal to those who appreciate such characteristics.

It was a brief excursion from Mesa, but I had some reservations about boarding the train due to the presence of certain individuals; however, given that it was a public mode of transportation, I decided to overlook my apprehensions and proceed with my journey. Unfortunately, the brevity of the trip did not preclude me from experiencing physical discomfort, specifically in my legs, which were exacerbated by the seating arrangement during the brief voyage and persisted for several days thereafter, owing to my medical condition known as Restless Leg Syndrome. Despite these inconveniences, I acknowledged the benefits of utilizing public transportation, particularly in terms of conserving fuel, and thus, I would consider it as a viable option for my daily commute if I were employed in close proximity to a pick-up location. However, I must caution others to exercise vigilance when parking near such locations, as I learned the hard way by incurring a substantial fine of $200 for an erroneous parking maneuver, which resulted in the unfortunate impoundment of my vehicle.

4," ""This gastronomical establishment, specializing in delectable Italian cuisine, has proven to be the most exceptional in Las Vegas, boasting an impressive menu that includes an array of mouthwatering pizzas and equally tantalizing dinner entrÃ©es. My personal preference is the chicken Marsala, although I have also indulged in the shrimp Alfredo, various pizza options, and focaccia, all of which have garnered unanimous approval from both my local and visiting acquaintances. While placing an order for delivery may present a minor challenge due to the youthfulness of the female staff members, who can sometimes struggle with effectively communicating the details of the order, the expediency of the delivery process and the superior quality of the culinary offerings more than compensate for any initial difficulties. Moreover, the prices at this eatery are eminently reasonable, making it an excellent choice for those seeking a satisfying dining experience without breaking the bank.""",True,3190.0,formal

4," ""We visited this establishment for a midday repast with Rand H., and our culinary experience was rather satisfactory, boasting an extensive array of approximately 40 diverse items, analogous to the customary Indian smorgasbord in scope. The preliminary liquid offerings, specifically the egg drop and hot and sour varieties, were indeed delectable, prompting me to partake in a bowl of each. The primary dishes, encompassing a multitude of flavors and textures, were executed with remarkable proficiency, warranting top marks - five stars, to be precise. However, their concluding sweet course, comprising jello, sliced peaches, and those minuscule, gelatinous spheres commonly referred to as lychee, proved somewhat lacking in quality. Notwithstanding this minor shortcoming, we enjoyed a superlative luncheon at a most reasonable tariff of $5.75; regrettably, the hospitality we received fell slightly short of excellence, thereby precluding a perfect five-star rating. Nonetheless, in light of the exceptional culinary prowess displayed, I confer upon them a respectable four stars.""",True,3196.0,formal

Following my initial visit, I opted to reserve judgment until I had sampled their offerings on multiple occasions.

Our table was ready in no time. We ordered the Grilled Artichoke and Cornbread sides...the artichoke was fantastic. The cornbread was the best I've ever had. For my main course, I ordered the Steak and Enchilada. The 6oz filet was sliced into three small pieces and had a maroon spicy sauce on the side. The enchilada had their signature rotisserie chicken inside. Both were tasty.\n\nThe wifey had the Macho Salad. The salad arrived and for whatever reason, it was missing the rotisserie chicken. They quickly corrected it, and she enjoyed it quite a bit.\n\nI liked Bandera, but it was a touch off. Maybe it has something to do with the Mexican fusion?

Upon entering and departing, we were cordially greeted by the staff, who exhibited a relaxed and accommodating demeanor. The pricing system was straightforward and reasonable, with amounts rounded to the nearest dollar, which I greatly appreciate. I opted for a soy iced latte, which was quite impressive, boasting a distinct earthy quality that differed from the customary coffee beans I am accustomed to. The flavor was neither overpowering nor bitter, striking a perfect balance between strength and subtlety. The welcoming ambiance of the interior design beckoned me to linger with companions, engaging in one of the various board games available. However, my primary intention was to utilize the venue for academic purposes, thus I refrained from indulging in the diverse amenities offered. Unfortunately, the cashier professed unfamiliarity with the renowned grouchy cookies, much to my surprise. Notwithstanding this, I was pleased to discover prompt and hassle-free Wi-Fi connectivity.

4," Dear AMC Rainbow Promenade,

It appears that 1990 has contacted us to reclaim its movie theater, which we presume has become somewhat antiquated and is in dire need of a comprehensive renovation. Indeed, it is reasonable to assume that this cinema was once a bustling hub of activity, boasting state-of-the-art technology and a vibrant atmosphere that attracted numerous moviegoers during its heyday. However, with the advent of modern multiplexes featuring luxurious reclining seats, cutting-edge surround sound systems, and expansive screens, this particular theater seems to have fallen behind in terms of popularity and amenities. It raises the question of when was the last time an AMC 10 was encountered, as it appears that larger, more contemporary theaters such as AMC 20 or 30 have become the norm. Nonetheless, there is a certain charm and appeal associated with cinemas like this one. Not only do they offer consistently affordable prices and friendly staff, but they also provide an unpretentious and tranquil environment that allows the primary focus to be on the movie itself and the company of those watching it, rather than being distracted by excessive frills and lavishness.

In essence, while the absence of extravagant features may detract from the overall experience, the simplicity and intimacy of this theater can transform an ordinary movie-watching experience into a pleasurable and memorable occasion, especially when combined with good company and an enjoyable film.

The lavish decor, replete with vibrant hues and delicate butterfly motifs, creates an atmosphere of unparalleled elegance that imbues me with a sense of affluence merely by traversing its grandiose premises. Furthermore, the resort boasts an impressive array of gastronomic establishments that cater to discerning palates. Notwithstanding its refined allure, Encore remains relatively unfrequented compared to other high-end properties, thereby ensuring a tranquil and undisturbed experience for patrons. The assortment of expertly crafted cocktails available at various on-site watering holes serves as an added inducement, while the picturesque pool area offers a serene oasis amidst the frenetic energy of Las Vegas. Moreover, the accommodation's parking facilities prove convenient and easily accessible, further enhancing the overall enjoyment of one's stay. Alas, the prohibitive cost of indulging in the resort's gaming options unfortunately precludes my participation, as the minimum betting requirements hover around a hundred dollars per hand.

Prior to its closure, I would have likely accorded this eatery two stars or fewer, due to my perception that the premises were consistently unclean and my concern that such lack of attention to tidiness in the work environment might raise questions regarding the quality of their culinary offerings. However, since this particular Burger King has resumed operations, it appears to have undergone a considerable transformation for the better.

However, my evaluation process does not succumb to such superficiality and shallow assessments, but rather encompasses a holistic approach that takes into account various other aspects of the dining experience, including the quality of the food, the ambiance, and the service. Thus, I shall provide a comprehensive review that reflects my genuine sentiments and impressions of this restaurant, without being unduly influenced by my admittedly immense fondness for their sublime pastries.

The dining area exudes a warm and inviting ambiance, with the option to sit outside and savor the delicious fare amidst the picturesque surroundings.

These include, but are not limited to, the flavorsome hummus, the delectable gyro, the crispy flatbread pizzas, and last, but certainly not least, the mouthwatering pastries that have captured my palate and left me in a state of unabashed delight.

4," This establishment proved to be exceptional, boasting impressive attributes such as efficient and friendly service, an accommodating staff, and a superior quality of food. Specifically, the pace at which our orders were fulfilled was quite rapid, almost instantaneous, which greatly enhanced our dining experience.

The goat cheese appetizer, which we opted to initiate our meal with, was sublimely prepared, its rich, velvety texture and subtle tang impeccably balanced, thereby eliciting immense gratification.

Furthermore, the mixed greens that constituted the salad course were crisp and fresh, their flavors enhanced by a judicious application of dressing that avoided overpowering the palate. Likewise, the vegetables accompanying the entree were cooked to perfection, retaining their natural sweetness and firm texture without being overcooked or mushy.

For my main course, I requested a rare filet, which, upon its arrival, proved to be a masterful execution of the chef's craft, boasting a tender, juicy texture and a satisfying, deep red hue. While it would have been even more exceptional had it been served with a slightly greater quantity of blood, this minor shortcoming did not detract from the overall excellence of the dish.

The fare itself delighted our taste buds, as fresh ingredients melded harmoniously with judiciously apportioned sauces.

Upon donning our specially designed lunar footwear and executing a requisite injury waiver, we embarked upon an unforgettable experience replete with boundless diversion. The entire facility, encompassing a vast expanse of trampolines partitioned into quadrants, afforded us and our associates an exclusive domain for frolicking, racing, and even attempting aerial acrobatics. Although dodgeball was available on the opposite end, participation was purely voluntary, allowing us to relish the sheer exhilaration of unrestricted jumping, competing with companions, or merely savoring the joy of unfettered movement. Such unbridled merriment, however, proved unexpectedly taxing, as we were compelled to take respites at brief intervals, owing to our sadly sedentary lifestyles. Subsequently, we determined that a shorter duration of thirty minutes would suffice for future visits, given our limited stamina.

As a self-professed adult with a juvenile proclivity for enjoyment, I must confess that the opportunity to abandon inhibitions and indulge in unadulterated joviality within Sky Zone's walls was nothing short of delightful.

During my visits, I have noticed a dearth of considerate interactions between some dog owners, whereby they fail to acknowledge and respect personal boundaries, leading to instances of overzealous playfulness and unwanted interactions between their pets and mine.

4," We deliberately traversed along the Pennsylvania Turnpike with gastronomical yearnings for an extended period, merely due to our intense craving for Indian cuisine. Such actions were indeed perilous, as our tolerance for hunger pangs customarily leads to capitulation to a convenient sandwich at a roadside eatery. Upon entering Coriander India Grill, we were greeted by a hospitable host who promptly accommodated us in a cozy booth. Shortly thereafter, a platter of crunchy papads accompanied by the customary triangular receptacle containing chutneys arrived, temporarily alleviating our hypoglycemic state. Following a cursory examination of the menu, we opted for lamb vindaloo (graded at a fiery 10 on the Scoville scale) and palak paneer (rated a relatively mild 7 on the Scoville scale). Although we were intrigued by the prospect of savoring south Indian dosas, their rarity did not warrant the risk, given the prevalence of northern Indian fare in most establishments. The culinary offerings were delivered expediently, and their flavors were indeed delectable! The vindaloo lived up to its billing, unleashing a torrent of spicy heat that, admittedly, I should have anticipated. My previous experience with authentic Indian cuisine notwithstanding, I erred in estimating my capacity to handle such fervent zest. Conversely, my partner's palak paneer was sublimely rich and velvety.

However, upon closer inspection, certain aspects of its ambiance captured my attention and piqued my curiosity. The name, in particular, struck me as somewhat amusing and playful, which served as an auspicious harbinger of the pleasant surprises that awaited me within.

Upon entering the premises, I was immediately taken by the rustic, woody aesthetic that permeated the interior design. The liberal use of exposed wooden ""log"" beams and the overall ""woodsey"" motif lent a warm, welcoming atmosphere to the space, evoking the sense of a cozy cabin nestled deep within a dense forest. Although the bar area itself was somewhat dimly lit, the abundance of televisions (albeit none of them particularly large) scattered throughout the room ensured that patrons could easily follow their favorite sporting events or news programs while enjoying a refreshing beverage.

In contrast, the dining area, though relatively diminutive in size, exuded a certain charm thanks to its subdued color scheme and judicious deployment of supple, vinyl booths. While I would have preferred a bit more exposed wood adorning the walls to complement the existing decor, the strategic employment of these booths helped to create an intimate, convivial setting that fostered a sense of community among patrons.

My culinary expectations were thoroughly exceeded by the delectable fare presented before me. The sweet potato fries, in particular, delighted my taste buds with their unexpected burst of flavor and satisfying crunch, while the prime rib proved itself to be a veritable gastronomic revelation, boasting a tenderness and richness of flavor that eclipsed that of many other establishments in the surrounding area.

I managed to fortuitously secure a living space that is conveniently located within walking distance of virtually all essential amenities, including what is arguably the preeminent ski and snowboard equipment retailer in the region. Ski Pro boasts an impressive inventory that surpasses even the most well-stocked ski shops in Colorado, and their focus on promoting sales and offering discounts is evident in the substantial markdowns they offer on various items. Case in point: I recently purchased a ski suit for my child that had been originally priced at $175, but was available for the significantly reduced price of $59. Although the selection of skis and snowboards may not be as extensive as some other specialty stores, it is nevertheless quite comprehensive and caters to a wide range of winter sports enthusiasts. Furthermore, the store's proximity to the Biltmore is an added convenience.

The quality of customer service at Ski Pro is relatively average for establishments of this nature, with staff members exhibiting a level of friendliness and attentiveness that is adequate without being overly obsequious. Considering the laid-back atmosphere that permeates such leisure-oriented businesses, it would be unreasonable to expect excessively cheerful and solicitous demeanors from employees. Instead, they maintain a relaxed yet competent attitude that aligns with the overall ambiance of the store. While they may not display the same level of enthusiasm as workers in more formal settings, they are at least cordial and welcoming, which is a refreshing change from the sometimes surly and aloof demeanor encountered among ski shop employees in certain parts of Colorado.

The staff members have consistently demonstrated a profound knowledge of the pieces on display, eagerly engaging in insightful discussions regarding the various works of art. Notably, a significant portion of the pieces available for purchase have fallen within a price range that is accessible to art enthusiasts who do not possess an extensive collection or substantial financial resources. This aspect of Trifecta's offerings stands out as particularly refreshing, given the tendency of some art venues to prioritize exorbitant prices over the cultivation of a broader appreciation for the arts.  

My most recent visit to Trifecta coincided with the unveiling of a photography exhibition featuring images captured in Las Vegas and Nevada, which complemented the Focus on Nevada spread in the current issue of Desert Companion. Notably, one of my closest acquaintances, Anthony M., was selected as a participant in the contest associated with the event.

In light of these observations, I wholeheartedly endorse immersing oneself in the artistic ambiance of the Arts Factory, dedicating sufficient time to explore its diverse offerings, and culminating the excursion with a visit to Trifecta. By doing so, one can foster a deeper appreciation for the burgeoning cultural landscape that permeates this vibrant street.

Nonetheless, despite the potential for discomfort, the staff members were unwaveringly kind and accommodating towards us. Personally, I remained unfazed by the ambiance, allowing me to thoroughly enjoy the time spent with my partner. The venue itself boasts numerous televisions scattered throughout, enabling us to keep abreast of the baseball game's progression, even though we were unable to attend it in person.  

Regarding the culinary offerings, my assessment is that they surpassed expectations, particularly in regards to my selection, the fried chicken salad. The generous portion size, coupled with the freshness of the romaine lettuce and the pleasing tanginess of the honey mustard dressing, made for a satisfying dining experience. The sole drawback pertaining to my meal was the inclusion of mandarin oranges, which did not align with my personal preferences. In contrast, Bill's Irish Stew elicited his unequivocal approval.

My personal gastronomical selection was the chicken kiev, which boasted a satisfying crispness on its exterior and an unctuous juiciness within.  Unfortunately, the cranberry cabbage salad that accompanied my entree did not quite live up to my expectations, as its flavors did not tantalize my palate to the extent that I had anticipated; I would have preferred the vibrant hue and presumably more robust taste of red cabbage, as sampled by my fellow diners.

Our collective gastronomical odyssey continued with an assortment of appetizers, including the ubiquitous cabbage rolls, herring, and a visually stunning vegetable platter.  While the former elicited mixed reviews from our group, with some members expressing unbridled enthusiasm and others, like myself, remaining relatively unimpressed, the herring, with its refreshing lack of oiliness and subtle flavor, proved to be an unmitigated delight.

Be that as it may, my overall assessment of this venue remains favorable, as I have enjoyed their gyros and, in particular, their guava lemonade, which has proven to be a veritable oasis of refreshment.

It's small with very few tables and so isn't cluttered.  If you're in there early you can grab a table with your mates and settle down for a heavy session in the midst of the bustling environment which the pub offers.  The problem, however, is that if can't find anywhere to sit then you're forced to stand which is fine, but it can just feel a bit cramped and pointless.  \nBrass Monkey is a cosy and affordable alternative to the larger and more conventional pubs in Edinburgh.

Personally, I had opted for the $2 wash previously, but upon upgrading to the $5 wash recently, I was pleasantly startled by the discovery that my wheels had been thoroughly cleansed when I stooped to wipe them clean - a perk not typically associated with the $2 wash. Furthermore, complimentary vacuum stations are available for all clientele.

This unassuming popcorn purveyor boasts an array of flavors, graciously offering samples for patrons to indulge in. Seasonal varieties are also available, adding to the excitement. However, our enthusiasm was temporarily dampened when we tried the Cake Batter flavor and found it lacking in authentic cake batter essence, the overpowering influence of Cold Stone's ice cream flavor being the likely culprit. 

Despite this minor setback, we capitalized on the baker's dozen promotion, acquiring thirteen small snack-sized bags for a mere $11, a considerable bargain considering the standard price of $1 per bag. The accommodating staff even offered to create a custom bag of a flavor not readily available in the smaller size. 

Their assortment of flavors extends beyond their online offerings, including such delectable options as Churro, Bacon & Cheese, Cookies & CrÃ¨me, Coconut, PB & Chocolate, Cherry Chocolate, and Candy Bar.

Located south of the famed Las Vegas Strip, this venue primarily caters to local patrons, thus making it a veritable gem for those seeking an authentic experience untainted by the glitz and glamour associated with tourist hotspots. Furthermore, it is advisable to secure a reservation in advance, given the eatery's propensity to attract sizable crowds, and be prepared to expend a sum ranging from $15 to $30 per individual (excluding beverages), as the portions are generous and the quality of the cuisine is consistently high.

On numerous occasions, I have had the pleasure of partaking in the delectable fare served at this establishment, and I must confess that the service has always been exceptional, with both large and small gatherings receiving attentive and proficient attention from the staff.

The difficulty in singling out a specific dish as a recommendation stems from the fact that each item on the menu has consistently impressed my taste buds. However, I feel compelled to steer your attention towards the garlic knots, which, while seemingly unremarkable, transcend the realm of ordinary breadsticks by an order of magnitude.

This is a review of the food court:

In the Greenland Supermarket food court, there are various culinary establishments that offer an array of international cuisines. Specifically, there is a Hawaiian eatery, a sushi bar, two Korean food stalls, a tofu-based casserole vendor (which I am hesitant to try due to its unappealing description), and a coffee shop that serves Boba but frequently runs out of stock. 

While I wish the Hawaiian restaurant served lumpia and Portuguese donuts, the spam musubi was quite delectable. The sushi bar offers reasonably priced options, with two nigiri available for $1.99, amounting to ten nigiri for $10. Additionally, I decided to venture out and sample Korean cuisine for the first time at this location, merely for the sake of novelty. I had a kim-chee and meat-filled bun, which has a unique flavor profile that requires some acclimation. Although it tastes good initially, the aftertaste is somewhat peculiar. 

In conclusion, my dining experience at this food court was generally satisfying. While I would appreciate a broader range of options (perhaps a Vietnamese booth or additional selections at the Hawaiian eatery), I will undoubtedly return.",True,3676.0,formal

The standard guest rooms, while marginally more sumptuous than those found at a typical four-star hotel located along the Las Vegas Strip, are essentially comparable in terms of dimensions, rendering them unsuitable for accommodating large groups of individuals; therefore, it would be more practical and cost-effective to reserve a suite at a less prestigious hotel, if you intend to host numerous guests.

In light of this, I decided to treat a close acquaintance to a celebratory dinner at this venue last week. Upon arriving, we were greeted by an accommodating hostess who showed us to our table in a prompt and efficient manner. Our server, who was attentive and knowledgeable, presented us with menus and offered recommendations when asked. It is worth mentioning that the service we received throughout the evening was of a high caliber. When we discovered that the bottle of wine we had selected was unavailable, our server graciously offered a suitable alternative at the same price, which we greatly appreciated.  

The initial course of our meal, consisting of corn cakes accompanied by pulled pork, proved to be the standout dish of the evening. The flavors and textures were expertly balanced, making for a truly satisfying experience. Additionally, the Arcadia Salad we ordered was also quite palatable. However, as a native of New Mexico with a deep affection for green chile, I must admit that the green chile Mac n Cheese fell slightly short of my expectations. Although the ribs were cooked to an acceptable level of tenderness, they failed to meet the standard of falling off the bone, which was a minor disappointment.  

In terms of the ambiance, we found the spaciousness and open layout of the restaurant to be quite pleasing. However, we did find the musical selection to be somewhat discordant with the overall atmosphere. While I understand that music is a subjective matter, I firmly believe that it plays a crucial role in establishing a truly exceptional dining environment. In this case, the music seemed incongruous with the restaurant's ambiance, and I cannot help but feel that a more avant-garde or sophisticated musical selection would better complement the atmosphere.  

Despite these minor drawbacks, I remain a proponent of this establishment and commend its efforts to create a unique and enjoyable dining experience.",True,3746.0,formal

Patrons are invited to create their ideal burger by selecting from an array of premium meats, including buffalo, lamb, angus, and kobe. Furthermore, they may choose their preferred temperature and an abundance of toppings. Of note is the extravagant Rossini burger, priced at $60, boasting Australian Kobe-style Wagyu beef, sautÃ©ed foie gras, and shaved truffles on an onion bun, complemented by a rich black truffle sauce. However, we recommend eschewing this option in favor of building a custom burger with identical ingredients, sans black truffles, resulting in a significantly lower price point of $30. This modification allows for a more balanced flavor profile, as the potency of the truffle sauce might overpower the delicate umami of the foie gras. An alternative to enhance the dining experience is to pair the burger with a selection of sauces from their extensive collection, featuring unique varieties such as spicy ketchup and truffle mayo. Without a doubt, Burger Bar offers a truly exceptional culinary adventure, with the possibility of indulging in the most delectable burger one has ever had, albeit at a considerable cost.

Our second selection was the Fried Chicken and Waffles, infused with bacon slices, which can only be described as a gastronomic indulgence. While it may have been a tad unhealthy, it was nonetheless an incredibly satisfying experience.

The pork belly, on the other hand, boasted a crispy exterior and an interior texture that was cooked to perfection. Avoidance of overcooking or undercooking pork belly is crucial, as it can result in an unpleasant chewy, rubbery, or fatty consistency.

Despite these brief lapses in efficiency, the quality of both the edible fare and potable beverages remains unwavering, though unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the maintenance of the facilities, particularly the restrooms, which are frequently found to be in a state of disarray, much to the chagrin of this author and parent of three youthful offspring, who find it necessary to exercise great caution in their utilization, lest they be confronted with an environment that falls short of stringent standards of hygiene.

I am thoroughly baffled by the underlying factors responsible for such an unmerited reputation, as the patties served at In-N-Out are characterized by an unfortunate lack of substance, the cheese is merely serviceable, and the fries are utterly forgettable. While the flavor profile of the burger itself may be passable, it falls short of the lofty standards set by other prominent players in the industry, such as Whataburger, which, in my estimation, handily outstrips In-N-Out in terms of overall excellence. On the other hand, Lenny's boasts patties that are genuinely beefy in nature (a playful pun, if you will), accompanied by cheese that is respectably adequate and fries that are exponentially superior to those offered by In-N-Out.

In my peregrinations, I have sought out that singular location which exudes an air of uniqueness, without succumbing to the pedestrian and mundane ambiance that permeates so many establishments, while still proffering an exceptional cup of coffee complemented by extraordinary service.

In this instance, I was able to recognize the influence of chance, and thus, I felt compelled to acknowledge it in my review of the establishment.  
During a recent visit to Las Vegas, a group of acquaintances and I decided to venture to the nearest location of a well-known alcoholic beverage franchise, which we believed to be situated within the Planet Hollywood complex. However, upon arriving at the destination, we discovered that the closest branch was actually located within the Caesar's Forum Shops. Notwithstanding this minor inconvenience, I opted to sample a beverage consisting of a 190 Octane and Hurricane mixture, which was served in a tall container. Upon consuming approximately two inches of the drink, I began to feel quite content.  
The bartender proved to be a valuable asset, as he offered various blends to my associates. Specifically, he recommended a concoction known as a ""midnight kiss,"" which consisted of a Bellini and strawberry mixture. This particular combination elicited a highly favorable response from those who partook of it, including myself. Moreover, the cost of these potent beverages was surprisingly reasonable, particularly given the generous refills that were available. Thus, I felt compelled to advise others to retain their cups, as the value offered was indeed impressive.

Upon being seated, we opted for two glasses of Cabernet, a superior quality wine that proved to be an excellent beginning to our delectable journey. Subsequently, we relished a fresh mozzarella dish accompanied by heirloom tomatoes, which was further enhanced by a touch of coarse salt and balsamic, thus rendering it utterly scrumptious. Additionally, we sampled a chopped salad adorned with a modicum of cheese, salami, and a remarkably flavorful vinaigrette; although I am not typically a devotee of salads, this particular creation tasted unquestionably fresh and warranted high praise. Furthermore, we ordered a salad dressed with balsamic, which, despite not being as exceptional as its chopped counterpart, remained palatable and satisfying.

Moreover, we relished a half-portion of fresh pasta, skillfully prepared with Parmesan, zucchini, and tomatoes, thereby constituting the ideal quantity for a lighter repast. Notwithstanding my initial concerns regarding the potential heaviness of pasta as a late supper option, the smaller serving size proved to be a judicious decision.

Our culinary excursion continued with an order of skirt steak, which regrettably did not meet the same lofty standards as the preceding dishes, primarily due to the fact that the balsamic component, which was the third instance of this flavor profile throughout the meal, seemed somewhat superfluous and detracted from the overall quality of the dish. Nevertheless, the meat was cooked flawlessly, and its generous portion made up for any deficiencies. Lastly, we indulged in a delightful tiramisu and paired it with expertly brewed French press coffee and cappuccino, both of which demonstrated the establishment's commitment to excellence in beverage preparation.

5," I have been an ardent cinemaphile for approximately fifteen years, during which time I have consistently demonstrated a profound aversion to sitting for extended periods of time in those minuscule, uncomfortable seats that are typically found in traditional movie theaters. Upon learning about the advent of the Galaxy Theater, I was utterly enthused! The concept itself was nothing short of revolutionary.

I have had the privilege of visiting this esteemed establishment on multiple occasions, and each time, I have been thoroughly impressed by the exceptional quality of the amenities provided. The chairs, in particular, are a marvel of modern engineering, boasting ample proportions, superior comfort, and even a diminutive mobile tray for the convenience of consuming food and beverages. It is worth mentioning that the theater offers alcoholic beverages, although I must confess that I am not particularly fond of them. Nevertheless, my companions seem to derive immense pleasure from indulging in a cold beer or two while enjoying the cinematic experience.

On a recent Saturday, my spouse and I accompanied our family to witness the cinematic masterpiece known as Captain America. Unfortunately, I had not had the opportunity to partake in dinner prior to the screening, so I opted to sample some of the delectable offerings available at the concession stand. While the cost of my meal ($19) could be considered somewhat prohibitive, I must admit that the culinary delight that I received was well worth the expenditure. The bratwurst, in particular, was a veritable gastronomic revelation, with four distinct varieties to choose from (cheese jalapeÃ±o, brat, beef dog, and another option that escapes my memory), all of which were adorned with an assortment of genuine toppings, including sauerkraut, lettuce, cheese, and a pickle, among others. To say that I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the bratwurst would be an understatement.

In conclusion, I must reiterate that the Galaxy Theater has consistently delivered an exceptional experience on each and every occasion that I have had the privilege of visiting. Furthermore, I feel compelled to divulge that presenting one's ticket stub at the adjacent yogurt shop will result in a modest discount, a fact that may prove advantageous to those who seek to augment their cinematic excursion with a frozen treat.",True,4622.0,formal

Yelp, my trusty companion, I can always rely on you to provide me with exceptional recommendations! As I have previously mentioned, and will likely continue to emphasize, I have been pursuing superior sushi in Pittsburgh since my relocation to the city. It appears that I may have discovered yet another formidable contender!

First and foremost, the hospitality at this establishment is truly remarkable. The staff is meticulous, attentive, and genuinely committed to ensuring a pleasurable dining experience for their patrons. Additionally, the restaurant boasts a complete bar, which is a significant asset, given that many BYOB establishments in Pittsburgh impose a corking fee (a practice that I find utterly perplexing). I was able to order a modest house sake for a mere $5, and it harmonized beautifully with my meal.

We initiated our culinary journey with an order of gyoza, which was prepared with a crispy exterior (I am accustomed to pan-fried gyoza). Although slightly greasier than I had anticipated, the dish was undeniably delicious. I opted for one of the sushi dinners, which included a miso soup and salad. The miso was exquisitely seasoned, presenting a perfect balance of flavors that did not overwhelm my taste buds. The sushi itself was truly impressive, featuring generous portions of fresh fish for the nigiri, and a flavorful roll that left me thoroughly satisfied.

It is worth noting that the ambiance of the restaurant was also quite pleasant. I observed a charming couple enjoying a romantic date ahead of me, while I indulged in a leisurely girls' night out with a friend. Furthermore, the prices were eminently reasonable, which only added to my overall satisfaction.

Given that my previous dining experience occurred on a Sunday, which, as you may be aware, is customarily designated as 'fancy' day at a buffet, I was eager to observe how the restaurant would fare during a weekday luncheon service. To my delight, the culinary offerings did not disappoint; in fact, they were nothing short of exceptional. Some of my personal favorites among the selections available today, which were being savored by a sizable gathering of patrons, included tender baby bok choy that had been expertly prepared in a flavorful garlic fish sauce, remarkable stuffed crabs served on the half-shell, and an impressive array of four distinct varieties of genuine ice cream.

Although I have never personally visited the city of Chicago, I have been tantalized by delectable images of this culinary delight.  Previous attempts at procuring a comparable dining experience at establishments professing to serve deep dish pizza have resulted in disappointment, leading me to harbor skepticism towards such claims (specifically, Pizza Hut's offering has fallen short of expectations).  However, the visual representation accompanying the advertisement piqued my interest, prompting me to indulge in a trial of their wares.  To my utter satisfaction, the pizza proved to be of exceptional quality, boasting an abundance of cheese, sauce, and toppings atop a crust that struck a perfect balance between texture and flavor.  In fact, my companion and I found ourselves unable to consume the entirety of the 12-inch pie we had ordered, much to our surprise.  Individuals who relish a hearty, flavorful pizza experience are encouraged to sample the fare offered by this establishment.
