The other entrees (duck, gnocchi) were just okay, but hardly memorable, and certainly not worth the cost.

My chicken noodle soup was curiously sweet, with dirty carrots and undercooked macaroni, all of which had settled to the bottom.

This hotel experience has been, by far, the most unpleasant and problematic that I have had the misfortune of encountering during my numerous visits to Las Vegas. Our brief two-night stay was marred by a plethora of issues, including the inconvenience of being locked out of our room on two separate occasions due to faulty keycards, which resulted in a significant loss of time on my part. Furthermore, upon entering our room, we were greeted by an uninviting atmosphere, complete with an unappealing odor emanating from a half-eaten burrito that had been carelessly left in the refrigerator, the pungent aroma of which seemed to be a bizarre fusion of garlic and vomit. To add insult to injury, the hotel management offered a paltry $50 credit for dining, which was utterly inadequate compensation for the multitude of inconveniences we had endured. The accommodations themselves were subpar, lacking in both size and aesthetic appeal, while the casino and pool areas were similarly underwhelming. It is utterly perplexing as to why anyone would choose to venture all the way down the strip to stay at such a mediocre establishment, especially when taking into account the fact that the illustrious Wynn/Encore brand owns this property in its entirety. In conclusion, I shall never again grace this hotel with my presence, and I strongly advise others to avoid squandering their time and resources on such an inferior lodging experience.",True,27.0,formal

Individuals exhibit discourteous behavior! Upon being informed that an additional $100 would be required to remove all scratches, resulting in a paint job appearance that was practically pristine, it is utterly unsurprising that this establishment has acquired an unfavorable reputation.

The original text uses simple language and short sentences to convey the writer's frustration with the service they received at a car detailing business. In the modified text, I have tried to make the language more formal and complex, while still conveying the same message. Here are some of the changes I made:

* Changed ""People are very rude!"" to ""Individuals exhibit discourteous behavior!"" to make the sentence more formal and less conversational.
* Changed ""I was told for an extra $100"" to ""Upon being informed that an additional $100 would be required"" to make the sentence more formal and to avoid using contractions.
* Changed ""when can buff out all the scratches"" to ""resulting in a paint job appearance that was practically pristine"" to make the sentence more descriptive and to better convey the intended meaning.
* Changed ""no wonder this place has a bad rep!!!"" to ""it is utterly unsurprising that this establishment has acquired an unfavorable reputation"" to make the sentence more formal and to avoid using colloquial expressions.
* Changed ""I had to give it a rating"" to ""I deemed it necessary to assign a rating"" to make the sentence more formal and to avoid using colloquial language.

1," ""Although my culinary expectations were elevated, I must admit that my experience at this establishment was subpar. Specifically, my excitement to indulge in an ostrich burger and an elk burger, both of which I had never tried before, was met with disappointment due to the dryness of the meat. It appeared that the individual responsible for preparing the dish lacked the necessary skills to execute it properly, or perhaps the quality of the meat itself was substandard. My companion's recommendation of the traditional beef burgers over the exotic meats further reinforced my dissatisfaction. Additionally, the salmon burger, though palatable, failed to impress. Considering the steep price point of $13 for a minuscule ostrich burger, accompanied by fries and a beverage totaling nearly $20, I am unlikely to return to this restaurant.""",True,59.0,formal

Moreover, the absence of an genuine Japanese flavor profile in the sushi rolls further contributed to our disappointment. Additionally, we were put off by the excessive application of creamy sauce on the rolls, which not only overpowered the delicate flavors of the sushi but also made for an unpleasant dining experience. Furthermore, the presentation of the sushi left much to be desired, with the rolls arranged haphazardly on the plate, giving rise to an appearance that was decidedly lacking in aesthetic appeal.

I will list the good points:\nLocation: this is on the center strip, which is close to a lot of other hotels (for shows, conferences)\nMargaritaville: A nice restaurant with an upper deck view\nThe garden: The garden has Flamingoes and is very peaceful\nThe staff: very nice, polite\nCons: This hotel reeks of smoke, everywhere,  I used to smoke, so I understand and am not condemning. But when you ask for a non-smoking room, it should not smell like someone has nuck into your room and is hiding to smoke a cigarette. This resulted in a miserable stay (allergies). \nIf you are catching an airport shuttle in, you will have to walk a block with your baggage to the hotel, back entrance, \nThere was a roach near the ice machine--but this may be secondary to the fact that someone dumped a salad on the floor, and it sat there for two days--after all, natural selection dictates that you need to do what you can to survive--and this roach was doing what he could to get to that salad.\nWhen the room was booked, I booked a room with a refrigerator, and was provided with a styrofoam cooler.\n There was a leak, in the first room . This leak was coming through the light fixture in the bathroom. This was due to a problem with something upstairs.

1," I have been a loyal patron of Dr Auto since 2001, during which time I have had the pleasure of dealing with Dave and Mike, who respectively helmed the establishment as manager and chief mechanic. Their commitment to upholding the highest standards of honesty, reliability, and fairness in their business practices has been nothing short of exceptional. Throughout the past decade, I have entrusted them with the repair and maintenance of all my vehicles, amounting to a sum in excess of $50,000, and I have never once felt that I was being exploited or persuaded to purchase unnecessary services or products. My preference for acquiring vehicles through auctions or fixer-uppers has been well-catered to by the team at Dr Auto, who have consistently displayed a profound understanding of my requirements and concerns. However, recent events have led me to question the integrity of the establishment under its new management. Following the departure of Mike and Dan from the company, I have noticed a marked shift in focus towards maximizing profits, which appears to have superseded their erstwhile commitment to providing ""Hometown Service With Integrity"". In light of these developments, I am compelled to exercise caution in my dealings with Dr Auto and to advise others to do the same. It is crucial to scrutinize the recommended repairs meticulously and ensure that they are indeed necessary before entrusting your vehicle to their care. Alternatively, it may be wise to seek out a more dependable and trustworthy service provider.",True,122.0,formal

Before we discovered the Aladdin buffet, which doesn't exist anymore, we used to hit up the Paris buffet on every trip.

1," We placed a telephone call to the hotel's central reservation system in order to procure accommodations for an impending visitation, and I must say that the manner in which we were addressed by the youthful female who responded to our call left much to be desired in terms of both civility and professionalism. Indeed, it seemed that this individual harbored some sort of animosity or chip on her shoulder, as evidenced by the brusque and dismissive tone she employed throughout our conversation. Furthermore, it appeared that she presumed us to be in a subservient position vis-a-vis herself, which naturally engendered a certain measure of indignation and incredulity on our part. Notwithstanding this unfortunate encounter, we nevertheless entertain hopes that the actual sojourn at the hotel will prove to be more pleasant and satisfactory than the aforementioned reservation process. -- Johnny J.",True,168.0,formal

We went down early to spend a little time at the pool before checkout. Not crowded like most pools on the strip, so that was nice. We went back to our room shortly before checkout so I could take a quick shower before checking out. I opened the shower curtain to find a puddle of black sludge on the floor of the shower.

First, their menu consists of a counter with donuts on display, half of which don't have a description as to what they are.

After, being given explanations as to donut flavors by an, much annoyed by my inquiries, employee.  My wife and I got 4 donuts, I got the maple bacon donut and the strawberry short cake donut, but you could have just called them the greasy and sticky ones.

And there isn't a close second.\n\nIf your definition of a \""high end\"" coffee shop means snobby and condescending servers, long waits when no one else is there, marginal (at best) and overpriced coffee, and very few options to make your coffee the way you like it - then this is definitely your place!\n\nWow, I've drank coffee all over the world and in some of the best coffee roasters in the country...including Intelligentsia in Chicago where 21st sources their beans.

Save your time, money, and taste buds and go to Espresso a Mano in Lawrenceville, Cannon Coffee in Brookline, La Prima in the Strip or any of the other joints in town that serve great coffee without the condescending attitude.

Then she tried holding on to my salad until I asked why and she said try were going to reheat the chicken that was on the salad with the hair. I told her no thank you and that's not sanitary. She got upset and I asked for a refund. I think she gave me a refund because she was afraid that the customers would have overheard me.

""Underwhelming experience with too much repetition.""
I recently visited this establishment with the expectation of obtaining a delectable Banh Mi sandwich, but unfortunately, my visit was marred by a series of unfortunate events. Firstly, I was compelled to wait for an extensive period of time, nearly 20 minutes to be precise, which I found to be rather disconcerting. Furthermore, the female staff member who attended to me displayed a remarkable lack of enthusiasm and interest in my presence, her demeanor being described as taciturn and indifferent at best. The culmination of these unsatisfactory experiences was the diminutive size of the sandwich, which paled in comparison to others of its kind that I have had the pleasure of consuming.

However, I must commend the gentlemen stationed at the valet service for their exceptional courtesy.""",True,265.0,formal

1,"I'm stunned to see the number of overwhelmingly positive reviews about Greenberg's. I can only assume that most have never eaten outstanding Jewish deli food, and, as often happens with reviews on Yelp, a lack of reference points leads to a misevaluation.\n\nPeople need to understand what Greenberg's is. It's essentially a fast food version of an authentic Jewish deli--a replica that has the basic look and feel of an authentic deli, but not the food quality or soul. This is obviously a common phenomenon on the Vegas Strip.\n\nFolks who've been to the great delis, like Katz's in NYC, Lester's in Montreal, Canter's in Los Angeles, or any of the other great delis, know what real Jewish deli food tastes like. They know what real matzo ball soup tastes like, and what the best pastrami tastes like. \n\nGreenberg's is a 2-star deli at best, and, quite honestly, is just a fast food version of a Jewish deli. It kills me to know that people leave Greenberg's believing they've just eaten quality Jewish deli food. Oy vey!",,,informal
1," ""Upon visiting Coco's on a Monday afternoon, it became apparent that the parking lot was rather uncharacteristically vacant, with only three vehicles occupying the space. Notwithstanding this anomaly, the seating process was expedited, and our order was taken in a timely manner. However, the delivery of our salads preceded the arrival of the primary entrÃ©e by a considerable margin, with the latter taking approximately thirty minutes to materialize. It is worth noting that the restaurant's patrons consisted of merely two or three tables, casting doubt upon the notion that an extensive delay was necessary to prepare a meager pair of cheeseburgers. Furthermore, my digestive system experienced discomfort for an ensuing hour, leading me to surmise that the culinary offerings perhaps did not align with my individual preferences. Although the service was generally satisfactory, several lapses in attention to detail transpired, including the failure to replenish the tea and remove completed dishes in a timely fashion. Specifically, the manager, despite his assurance of promptly returning to collect the remaining dishes, neglected to do so. Additionally, the waitress required prompting to partition the checks, which ultimately failed to occur. These oversights, coupled with the aforementioned delays and gastronomical dissatisfaction, suggest that Coco's may be following in the footsteps of Marie Callender's, another establishment that has recently encountered difficulties.""",True,272.0,formal

Ich wollte heute auf dem Ochsenfest in Hagsfeld eine Kugel Eis f\u00fcr meinen kleinen Sohn kaufen und habe um einen Pappbecher (!!!) gebeten (der Kleine hat eine Milchallergie und darf keine Waffel). Die Dame sagte mir, dass es bei einer Kugel nur eine Waffel gibt und ich 20c aufzahlen m\u00fcsste. Da die Kugel bereits EUR 0,90 kostet, war ich hierzu nicht bereit. Ich pers\u00f6nlich finde das kein gutes Gesch\u00e4ftsgebahren zudem die Preise pro Kugel schon happig sind.Heute bin ich an dieser netten Eisdiele vorbeigeradelt. Eine nette Eisverk\u00e4uferin hat mir ein Eis mit zwei Kugeln verkauft. Bis dahin glatte 5 Sterne  nett, authentisch, sauber. Das Eis allerdings hat mich nicht begeistert. Zitrone war noch ok, aber bei dem Heidelbeer Eis hatte ich ich das Gef\u00fchl in einen Schneeball zu bei\u00dfen. Eiskristalle, die auch zu sehen waren. Nichts cremiges, sondern eher so der aufgetaut und dann wieder eingefroren Effekt (wobei ich das nicht unterstellen m\u00f6chte).

Then you're like... okay it's Vegas, of course it'll cost a little more, whatever. 5 minutes later, you get your food and it tastes like nothing. Nothing.\n\nI'm from LA so I have decent expectations for Mexican food and this was almost disrespectful. No flavor and the meat was cold. The watermelon drink was good.\n\nBottom line: this place is one very small step above Taco Bell. If you're from LA or SD, any taco truck you might go to is better than this.",,,informal

However, my compliance was contingent upon the understanding that the criteria for admission would be applied equitably and without prejudice. Alas, our group was denied entry due to the perceived deficiency of a specific component of our attire, specifically, the absence of a 'collar shirt.' My attempts to enlighten the gatekeeper regarding the existence of a Mandarin-style collar, which, albeit unconventional, still fulfilled the definition of a collar, fell upon ears deafened by ignorance. It appears that the enforcers of this dress code are oblivious to the nuances of sartorial elegance and instead choose to focus on superficial aspects of attire, thereby perpetuating an environment of exclusivity and discrimination.

""Wynn incurred an excessive expenditure on the hotel floor, which was truly remarkable, yet unfortunately, it depleted the majority of his financial resources, leaving only a meager amount remaining for the rooms themselves. The accommodations were modest in scale, with minimal furnishings, and merely a single television set, which seemed almost laughable in the extravagant city of Las Vegas. The walls were painted with vibrant hues, attempting to convey an air of luxury, while the Venetian suites offered superior sleeping arrangements, featuring plush mattresses, an abundance of substantial terry cloth towels, extensive marble surfaces, and two televisions for maximum entertainment. However, the primary factor contributing to the dissatisfaction and subsequent one-star rating was the inconvenience caused by the boisterous bass emanating from Club XS, located on the 25th floor, adjacent to the golf course, which persistently disturbed the peace until the early hours of 4:10 AM. Upon contacting the hotel's concierge, it was divulged that, indeed, the noise had been a source of annoyance for certain patrons, yet the management appeared indifferent, prioritizing financial gain over the comfort and satisfaction of their guests, as exemplified by their nonchalant response to the issue, leading to Wynn's eventual departure.""",True,363.0,formal

Subsequently, we endured a prolonged waiting period from 5:05 PM to 7:40 PM, surpassing 2.5 hours. During our anticipation, a young child, aged five, regurgitated her meal onto the carpeted surface in close proximity to the culinary offerings, and the staff responded lethargically to addressing the situation. It is reasonable to assume that the prospect of waiting for such an extended time on Father's Day, only to be situated a mere three feet away from the aforementioned unpleasantness, would be utterly disagreeable. Following our eventual seating, a considerable delay of 25 minutes ensued before we received a glass of water. Furthermore, the BBQ ribs we had eagerly anticipated proved to be persistently unavailable, despite numerous attempts to procure them. In response to my notification to the manager, he presented us with a TOGO box containing a limited quantity of ribs as we departed the premises. However, this gesture was ultimately futile, as we were not heading home and the spoiled food was rendered useless. The venue was characterized by extreme crowding, and the dishware, cups, utensils, and cutlery emerged damp and, in some instances, still retained remnants of previous meals.

1," If you are seeking a venue that specializes in artisanal brews and such, then this establishment may cater to your preferences.  Nonetheless, if your culinary inclinations lean towards a delectable chili dog, it would be advisable to explore alternative dining options.  Although the hot dogs themselves possess an elevated level of quality, the chili accompanying them unfortunately boasts a rather uninspired and peculiar taste.  Firstly, my personal predilection does not involve the inclusion of beans in hot dog chili.  Furthermore, the addition of said beans fails to enhance the flavor profile, instead introducing an unfortunate textural anomaly.  It is also worth noting that the prices charged for these items are somewhat exorbitant.  A similar lack of gastronomic prowess is evident in their onion rings, which fail to meet expectations considering the abundance of microbrews available.  A beer-battered rendition would have been a welcome surprise, but alas, the offering consists of subpar, mass-produced breaded onion rings.  Moreover, it would be prudent for the proprietors to maintain a more frequent rotation of their fry oil.  In conclusion, the beer selection earns approval, whereas the edible offerings fall short of satisfactory.",True,380.0,formal

Concerning the polish, the attendant voiced several grievances regarding the diminutive size of my smallest toe nail (indeed, it is minuscule; nevertheless, a generous application may yield desirable results). Post-polish, there was no leisurely interval for drying; rather, the attendant expedited my departure by donning my shoes, processing the payment, and ushering me out the door.

1,This is the worst managed store in las vegas! absolute horrible people run and own this store!! dont support them!!!! \n\nI was almost attacked by a guy in the parking lot that parked right on top of my ada handicap spot and then proceeded to cuss me out when I get out of my car. I confronted him on what his problem was and he quickIy ran in the store when he realized I am not someone he can bully. The management then came to the door and would not let me enter and kicked me off the premises as if I was wrong and not attacked by some strange man that parked so close to the line I could even get out. I am a regular at this store and probably one of the biggest customers too. Now that I know how the managers are and that they support bullying in there parking lot I will never return. Be careful if you go and pack a gun or a knife as the parking lot is not safe. Also you may not be able to get the food you need to feed your family if attacked as management supports bullying and harassment of their customers. I will find a store that I can shop at safely and where the management cares about my experience rather than be cussed out and the bully being able to shop. Sad sad experience!!!

Specifically, the coffee, which we had hoped would provide a much-needed stimulus to initiate our day, was instead characterized by an unpleasant tepidity, its flavor profile marred by an unfortunate reliance on ice cubes to achieve a lukewarm temperature. Furthermore, the waffles, which we had envisioned as a fluffy, golden-hued delight, were instead served in a state of unfortunate sogginess, their surface saturated with an excess of syrup that rendered them decidedly unpalatable.

1," I had arrived at this venue several years ago with the intention of attending a spoken word performance by Henry Rollins, which, I must say, was utterly captivating and thoroughly enjoyable, earning it a well-deserved perfect rating of five stars. However, the seating arrangement within the auditorium left much to be desired, as the seats were excruciatingly cramped, providing patrons with a meager amount of legroom that made it challenging for individuals of above-average height to maintain a comfortable posture. In fact, even when positioning my legs laterally, I found myself still pressed up against the adjacent row, resulting in an agonizing experience akin to being trapped in a prolonged and rigid yoga pose for the duration of three hours. It is worth mentioning that the rows of seating were situated in such proximity to one another that only my sister-in-law, who stands at a mere 5'1\"", could manage to sit comfortably without enduring any discomfort. Therefore, I implore the management of Celebrity Theatre to consider augmenting the distance between rows, as even a slight increase in size would significantly enhance the overall viewing experience for patrons.

It would be prudent to exercise skepticism regarding the notion that this lodging establishment purports to offer five-star accommodations; such an assertion is, put mildly, dubious. Do not anticipate the presence of a flat-screen television or the prospect of having your bed linens altered regularly! The ambiance of this establishment harkens back to a bygone era, specifically the 1970s. The dimensions of the sleeping quarters are diminutive, and this characteristic is not exclusive to the rooms themselves, as the furnishings and appointments within them are similarly Lilliputian. The slumber-inducing qualities of the beds are subpar, to say the least; indeed, it is not uncommon for guests to awaken with back pain, which is hardly surprising given the inferior quality of the mattresses. The management and staff of this hotel manifest a callous indifference toward their patrons, so any hopes of receiving exceptional service are likely to be dashed. The buffet offered by this establishment is lackluster, and the cost, $29.99 plus tax, is hardly justified by the quality of the fare provided. Moreover, internet access is limited to a single computer via a telephone line, and additional devices will incur an extra fee. The pool area is minuscule and appears somewhat unclean, while the gaming facilities, in comparison to those of other hotels, are paltry and lacking in variety, thereby necessitating excursions outdoors. \n\nThe sole redeeming feature of this hotel is its location, situated as it is in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip, making it an optimal choice for individuals who relish nocturnal revelry and are unfazed by the prospect of sacrificing sleep.""",True,608.0,formal

However, to make up for the food being awful, you will have to wait on line for 20 minutes and then dine in cramped and uncomfortable seating.\n\nIt is, for some reason, unfathomably popular.  The best thing on the menu is their crepe-like pancakes, which are nicely crisped on the edges.  They are nicely crisped on the edges because they are cooked in a disgusting margarine-like substance that always leaves me, personally, feeling a bit ill.  The coffee is forgettable, the eggs are passable, the bacon is inevitably chewy -- which right there should cause someone to be marched out to the firing squad -- and their lyonnaise potatoes are insultingly limp (and, like the pancakes, soaked in margarine).\n\nIf you are dragged here by your friends, find new friends.  If you can't do that, then try to get one of the pancakes that come with some sort of whipped or sour cream.  Not because they're better, mind you, but because at least the cream will help balance the fat that comes from a machine with fat that, at some point in its history, came from a cow.\n\nBetter alternatives to Pamela's in Pittsburgh:  on the 'nice' end, Coca Caf\u00e9 or even Square Caf\u00e9, on the 'greasy spoon' end either DeLuca's or JoJo's.\n\nFrankly, I think I'd rather eat the completely boring and institutional breakfasts at Eat and Park than go to Pamela's again.

My initial enthusiasm for satisfying my culinary cravings was quickly replaced by utter dismay and incredulity at the interminable delay at the drive-through window. Following what seemed like an eternity, I finally received my order, only to be met with further disappointment. The supposed ""mini"" chicken quesadilla was nothing short of an unmitigated disaster. The cheese was so overcooked and congealed that it was nigh impossible to extricate it from its aluminum casing. Upon managing to unwrap the foil, I was confronted with an unholy mess of burnt, gooey, and utterly revolting excuse for a meal. It beggars belief that any self-respecting eatery could have the temerity to proffer such an abomination to paying customers. Needless to say, the offending item was summarily dispatched to the rubbish bin, without even the faintest glimmer of hope for redemption. The sole saving grace of the meal was the relatively unscathed state of the chalupa, which, by some small miracle, managed to escape the kitchen relatively unscathed. However, this solitary bright spot did little to assuage the overall feeling of utter disappointment and betrayal engendered by this woeful dining experience. Suffice it to say, any future visits to this establishment are unlikely, to say the least.",True,633.0,formal
1,They are the biggest and one of the better looking among the modest restaurants in Terminal 4 B gates. The big pig on the wall with the retro typeface tries to subvert the overwhelming and inescapable airport food court vibe.\n\n\nThe waitress was friendly and the service was prompt.\n\nI ordered a grilled cheese with tomato soup. The cheese was just tasteless and the soup was more salty than if it had come out of a can. I asked for coffee to go and it was barely lukewarm - made me think if the service was really as genuine as you can expect at an airport eatery.\n\nI will remember this place enough to not go there the next time I fly to Vegas through that airport.,,,informal

I also complained about the lack of seal at the bottom of the connecting door between my suite and the one next door. I could hear everything in that room like it was happening in mine. (Imagine that) I insisted on being moved to a new room. In the new room on my last morning... I hear a gurgling noise and then smell something foul.

1," We were thoroughly disillusioned with our dining experience, despite the favorable yelp reviews that had raised our expectations. My dinner companion and I opted for the premium rare bone-in filet, in addition to a diverse selection of appetizers. Unfortunately, the initial steak was drastically overcooked to an extent that rendered it inedible, necessitating its return to the kitchen. Upon its replacement, we were presented with a second steak that, although cooked to the correct temperature, was marred by an abundance of fatty gristle dispersed throughout the cut. When I inquired about the quality of the meat, I was met with a defensive and dismissive response from the chef, who seemed to take umbrage at my decision to reject the first steak. The unfortunate implication was that the inferior quality of the second steak was a deliberate attempt on the part of the chef to compromise our dining experience, motivated by a desire to demonstrate his indignation at our initial rejection. Disappointingly, the steak failed to meet the high standards that one would reasonably expect for a meal priced at $83, and the unsatisfactory dining experience left much to be desired.",True,658.0,formal

If you ask them if you can get an appointment with Curt they offer you one with one of their accountants but at no point say they are  in facr H&R block. \n\nCurt told us last year that he sold and was retiring.

After reading all of these great reviews I really thought I was in for a treat, but boy was I hugely disappointed.\n\nFirst off, there was way too much time spent on my face, ears, forehead, and neck.

Add some lotion man!\n\n2nd, my back was the most tense but apparently my therapist disregarded that because he only spent 5 minutes in the area I needed it the most.  \n\n3rd, as my therapist hovered over me, he burped and it smelled awful!  That pretty much ruined my entire experience.\n\nI did 1/2 enjoy the foot massage portion except again, way too much time rubbnig my big toe alone.

Our entrees took FOREVER to arrive, and once again, mine was barely above room temperature.  The waiter, to his credit, did apologize for the delay in getting the food out to us.  And he did so twice.  That was a bad sign when he had to inform us twice.  The manager tried to make it up with bring out desserts and dessert wine.  I just don't like sweets.

We came on a Thursday night and it was semi-packed. The guy working the bar seemed like it was his first day and had no clue as to what they offered. Our charcoal wasn't replaced even once during our stay. On my way to the bathroom, I ran into our server and had to ask her to change our charcoal and she said yes. She never came. Minutes later, another lady popped in asking if we were ok, I said we need our charcoal replaced. She appeared to be an owner or manager or something as she walked over to the area behind the bar and talked to someone, then came back saying someone will be right out. No one came. We decided to just walk to the bar area to pay our bill. We were the only two Asian guys in the entire place and I'm led to believe that had something to do with it as one server changed the charcoal in the booth to our right, blatantly skipped us, then did the booth to our left. If you're not one of them, I don't think you'll be treated well in this place. We sure were not.",,,informal
1,"The room and service were fine. I had a studio so the fridge is 18ft (5.5m) from the bed and the compressor can get noisy. The hotel is nicely situated in downtown. The walk from the Via Rail/central station is slightly uphill and 10-15 minutes, a nice, scenic walk. A ride from the hotel to Old Montreal via taxi was $12CDN with tip, and a taxi to the airport was a fixed rate of $38CDN w/o tip. I stayed in a room on the 14th floor, in an odd-number room, floor#\""03\"", and there is a nightclub across the street that pounds music all night, and has loud patrons outside until I don't know when (I put in ear plugs). If you are a light sleeper, stay on the even side room numbers of the hotel and don't face Peel St. Or, stay somewhere else. \nThe workout room is good sized and on the top floor with two treadmills, two elliptical, some free weights, and lots of room. Breakfast is on the mezzanine and was, meh, pretty average, but included. I'd spend the extra $40/night and stay at the Marriott-proper just a bit south again, when I come back. Views are better from there too, and it's more convenient. 1-star for the all night boom-chick-boom-chick music which made the stay very unpleasant, as well as the screaming patrons exiting the club.

1," ""Hold on a moment, allow me to assimilate the information you've just provided... It appears that despite being seated at 5:40 am, I am unable to peruse the post-6 am menu offerings, as certain culinary experts specialize in specific edibles, thereby precluding the inclusion of bacon or sausage in my repast. Furthermore, my comprehension is further challenged by the fact that even after opting for an item from the limited pre-6 am selection, the arrival of my cuisine is delayed until after 6:30 am. 

 Permit me to elucidate further... My acquaintance is unable to partake in a meal consisting of scrambled eggs, bacon, and home fries; instead, they must choose between scrambled eggs without bacon and French fries or chicken fried steak accompanied by a biscuit, gravy, and, once again, home fries. These seemingly arbitrary guidelines are perplexing, to say the least. 

Additionally, I find it curious that while the salad featured on the menu is unavailable, the ahi tuna and chicken and waffles, which are nowhere to be found on the menu, can be ordered. Such inconsistencies only add to the already labyrinthine nature of the dining experience. 

Upon successfully navigating the complex process of placing my order, I was then presented with a menu adorned with crosswords and puzzles, yet the sole writing utensil within the establishment was nowhere to be found. It is my sincere hope that the chefs responsible for the culinary offerings will take note of these discrepancies and strive for improvement, as the quality of the food left much to be desired. Overall, this dining excursion has been utterly disappointing.""",True,692.0,formal

1," ""Korean bbq possesses an unparalleled degree of culinary excellence, and my expectations for this establishment were elevated due to the copious amount of laudatory reviews it has received. However, upon entering the premises, I was immediately struck by the diminutive size of the dining area, which was compensated for by the presence of grills positioned at each table. Unfortunately, the staff failed to display even a modicum of enthusiasm towards my associates and me, despite the fact that it was a tranquil evening and their presence would have been greatly appreciated. Not only did they neglect to replenish our beverages, meat, and side dishes in a timely manner, but they also appeared completely indifferent to our needs, opting instead to focus their attention on the boisterous television situated nearby. Furthermore, it took an unacceptable twenty minutes for them to present us with the bill, and their request for the table next to us to vacate their seat in a hasty manner was utterly discourteous. The state of the restrooms was deplorable, leading me to speculate about the cleanliness of the kitchen and refrigeration areas. It is my belief that had I been of Korean descent, the quality of service I received would have been somewhat improved. My Korean companions concur with me in regards to the subpar nature of the service provided. Needless to say, this experience was a tremendous letdown, and I would advise potential patrons to seek out a dining establishment that values its clientele and maintains a level of cleanliness that does not pose a risk to one's health.""",True,697.0,formal

1," ""Garcia's procures a solitary celestial body due to the singular individual who relished the culinary experience at the table. Despite its alleged gluten-free menu, which I can practically recite from memory given its brevity, Garcia's does not particularly cater to gluten-intolerant patrons. The menu consists of Chicken Gasedo (a soup bowl containing shredded poultry that one of my dining companions referred to as 'chicken slop'), Beef Machaco (akin to the chicken dish, albeit with beef), an assortment of vegetables, salsa, black beans or charro beans, and a house salad dressed with vinegar and oil. For the sum of $9.99, I received a bowl of the aforementioned chicken slop and a cup of black beans. Upon perusing the bill, I noticed that I was not charged separately for each item; thus, I am uncertain whether the waiter neglected to include these items on the bill or if there was some other explanation for the discrepancy. In conclusion, a word of advice for Garcia's: consider adding corn tortillas to your offerings, and perhaps maintain a stash of tostitos in the kitchen for good measure.""",True,813.0,formal

During my recent visit to her office, I experienced considerable discomfort, swelling, and grinding sensations in my wrist, prompting her to provide me with a brace and arrange for X-rays to be taken. Additionally, she assured me that a referral letter would be dispatched to Steinberg Diagnostics without delay, as an MRI scan was imperative. Furthermore, she instructed me to contact her office the following day to schedule an appointment for the aforementioned imaging procedure. Unfortunately, I encountered numerous difficulties while attempting to secure said appointment, as the referral letter had yet to be processed. This resulted in a series of telephone conversations with both Steinberg Diagnostics and SMA, during which I was informed that the processing time for such referrals typically ranges from five to seven days. Now, while I acknowledge that delays can occur, I cannot help but feel frustrated by the condescending demeanor exhibited by the SMA representative I spoke with at 10 a.m. Their response, which included an unnecessary clarification of Susan Schuder's professional title, struck me as dismissive and unhelpful. In conclusion, I believe that a more efficient system for handling referrals and appointments would greatly benefit patients like myself, and I hope that measures will be taken to address these issues in the future.",True,849.0,formal

Funny how engine oil coming out of the rear main seal looks like brand new transmission fluid (hint: it doesnt). He cited a clean area near the transmission pan as his reason (even though the leak was further up on the other side of the engine). They might be fine, but certainly worth getting a second opinion. They seem to prey on people they perceive to not know a lot.

The process of checking in was effortless and efficient, thanks to the promptness and courtesy displayed by the staff.

However, it must be noted that the lodging was not physically connected to the casino. The room itself was somewhat aged, with furnishings that reflected a similar state of seniority. Nevertheless, the king-size bed was recently purchased and exceptionally comfortable, as were the pillows provided. Additionally, we had access to a Keurig machine for brewing coffee, a feature that our acquaintances at a more luxurious hotel did not possess. \nMy primary grievance concerns the fact that approximately one and a half hours prior to our scheduled departure, the water supply to our room was suddenly disconnected.

Again, not the worst I have ever had but very far from the best. Again, the ladies at the local church make better pasta dishes than Rao's and their lasagna does not cost $30. But the worst of the meal was the peas, onions and prosciutto.  What were they thinking? The  prosciutto was so tasteless! How do you make it so bland? \n\nAnyhow if you are thinking of eating at Rao's, don't. If you want to spend big bucks on a meal in Vegas, go over to the Bellagio and try their buffet, the locals love it. Or try FireFly Tapas over on Paradise Rd.

The chips were stale and the salsa tasted suspiciously like the crappy Ortega stuff you buy in the supermarket.  My shrimp dish was so disastrous that I only ate half of it because I was afraid it might make me sick.  The shrimp were overcooked to the point of turning into rubber, and the sauce was nauseating.  The rice was overcooked and dry, and the green salad of lettuce and carrots was steamed!

""Uncertainty permeated the atmosphere as I endeavored to comprehend the unforeseen transformation that had beset the establishment, which had hitherto been renowned for its exceptional culinary offerings and hospitable ambiance. Previously, I had visited this location multiple times, typically during the early afternoon hours, and had always been impressed by the superior quality of the food and the attentive demeanor of the staff. However, on this particular Friday afternoon, at approximately 4 pm, I was taken aback by the stark contrast in the level of service I received. Specifically, I encountered an unprecedented degree of discourtesy and indifference from the staff, who seemed to be utterly disinterested in my presence, despite my repeated attempts to solicit their attention. As a seasoned Wahoo enthusiast, having patronized the original location in Orange County on numerous occasions, I was taken aback by the stark disparity in the quality of service between the two establishments. Furthermore, I was compelled to request a menu, a task that proved to be remarkably challenging, as it required me to hail the attention of the server/bartender, who appeared to be preoccupied with other patrons. Subsequently, I was informed by the manager that I would need to relocate, as there were patrons who wished to engage in the video gambling machines situated in the bar area. This pronouncement was accompanied by a gesture that struck me as peculiar, specifically, the manager patted the bar counter in front of the machine, an action that seemed to underscore the notion that the establishment's primary focus was now centered on gambling, rather than the traditional emphasis on providing an enjoyable dining experience. I must confess that I found the cold shoulder and curt attitude displayed by the staff to be entirely unwarranted, and it is with a heavy heart that I must forgo my Wahoo fix until such time as I find myself back in Orange County, where the authentic spirit of Wahoo remains alive and well.""",True,932.0,formal

The worst sin was the chicken soup, that traditional icon of soothing relief; yellow liquid with a taste of having recently sprinkled or dissolved from an envelop or a cube, sodium being the preponderate flavor. \nCan't believe the place is so popular, but in Las Vegas everything is possible, I guess.",,,informal

My batch was very salty, but seeing the wait and the relative absence of attention to customers, I didn't bother to do anything about it. The menu is very short and routine extras like added cheese or salsa require added payment. Maybe the other yelpers had an exceptional experience with the burritos, but this is my review based on what I sampled.  There is just nothing redeeming to explain the level of loyalty this location garners.  There is no indoor seating;  you cant eat outdoors on the provided plastic picnic table on a sunny day without risking a skin burn!.  On the inside you face a server who takes your order from behind a grill; there are at most 4-5 plastic chairs to sit on while you wait.

I guess this was her attempt at humor, however after the first time, it seemed to have lost something. By the way, she never really indicated that she was joking.\n\nSo, $50, 1 ceasar salad, 1 spinach chicken whatever salad,  a kids chicken tender meal w/ browning apples, and a failed attempt at a pollo poblano burrito later we were on our way to catch our flight. \n\nOh, in between sitting down and paying the check, the service was sub-par to say the least and worse than the cold, soggy burrito and rubberized tenders.

So one of the managers from Zoe's asks for my phone number so he can find out more information. I give it to him, willing to share my experience. He calls me, hears me out, and apologizes. Then he asks for my address so he can send me a gift certificate. Unnecessary, I tell him, but nice touch. So I give him my address. Now, 2 weeks later, nothing.

2," ""It is indeed perplexing that TK, who purports to embody the quintessential American spirit, would choose to affiliate himself with an eatery that openly professes its affection for an amorous relationship with anyone, regardless of their background or inclinations. My recent visit to this establishment, specifically to attend a live performance by the illustrious Reverend Horton Heat, served as the impetus for my decision to confer upon it a second star. However, I must admit that I was taken aback by the exorbitant prices charged for certain beverages, including a remarkably pricey well rum and diet, which amounted to a staggering $8, and Pabst Blue Ribbon cans, which were offered at a premium of $5 apiece. As I did not sample the culinary offerings, I cannot provide an assessment of their quality.

Previously, this particular soup had been a hallmark of excellence, but unfortunately, it seems that either a change in culinary approach or a lackadaisical cooking attitude has resulted in an unfortunate transformation. Despite my initial enthusiasm, I opted to reserve the remaining portion for a subsequent meal, in the hopes of securing a refund from the establishment, as opposed to merely receiving a replacement product. Alas, the anticipated refund proved elusive, and I was ultimately compelled to consume the soup at a later time, albeit with a lingering sense of disappointment.

Furthermore, the cost-to-portion ratio left much to be desired, prompting me to consider preparing a comparable dish at home, with the added benefit of being able to portion and store it for future consumption. In contrast, the dinner salad was truly exceptional, boasting an abundance of fresh, crisp vegetables that more than compensated for the slightly soggy lettuce.

2,This is the fourth hawaiian barbecue place I been to is by far the worst. No teriyaki sauce and katsu sauce which are a given of any Hawaiian barbecue place! Was given soy sauce/glowing red over processed sweet and sour sauce with my food instead. Macaroni in the salad was over cooked and mushy with some type of seasoning that looked like pepper. It was also runny using a low quality mayo and missing the sprinkles of carrot shavings that I'm so used to in a good Hawaiian macaroni salad. The barbecue chicken was dry and could not taste any of the marinade it was supposed to be cooked in. The bed of vegetables was old dry cabbage resembling the fake grass you see in an easter basket. This menu was confused if it should have been hawaiian barbecue or ghetto chinese food of south phoenix. The elderly Asian couple was very friendly and service was quick which should be expected being the only customer in there. The place was clean compared to the next closest one in Avondale. Location is among a lot of other fast food places and can easily be overlooked.

Despite requesting a non-smoking room, we were erroneously assigned a smoking room, which furthermore, had an evident fissure on the carpet adjacent to the window.

2," Now that I have successfully captured your undivided attention, allow me to elaborate upon and provide clarification regarding the 2 Star accolade that was bestowed upon this particular lodging establishment. Firstly, it is imperative to acknowledge the truly exceptional quality of the guest rooms, which boast impressive design elements and offer breathtaking panoramic vistas. Furthermore, the architectural style of the building itself is undeniably captivating and aesthetically pleasing. Additionally, the tariffs associated with these accommodations are deemed reasonable and accessible to a wide range of patrons. Nonetheless, it is crucial to scrutinize and investigate the purported complimentary airport shuttle service, as its utility and practicality are called into question. Specifically, the scheduling of these pickups appears to be quite sporadic and unpredictable, often resulting in extended periods of waiting time for arriving guests. In fact, it is not uncommon for individuals to endure delays of two to three hours, which can be particularly problematic for those with tight travel itineraries. Moreover, the alternative transportation option of hailing a taxi cab comes with a substantial price tag of $40, exclusive of gratuity. It is essential to exercise caution when encountering any advertised freebies or special offers associated with the resort, as they frequently come with strings attached or prove to be misleading. For instance, the supposed complimentary breakfast buffet is, in reality, a severely limited 2 for 1 arrangement, hardly justifying the prolonged wait times. Similarly, the pool area, touted as a serene and picturesque oasis, is inaccessible to guests during the months of March, rendering it unavailable for a significant portion of the year. Lastly, the Hostile Grape wine bar, an establishment that ostensibly offers a diverse selection of vintages, is regrettably closed three days a week, further limiting its appeal to potential patrons. Those seeking a more fulfilling and convenient shopping experience would be well-advised to consider renting a vehicle, as the resort's remote location makes it challenging to access nearby retail centers without one. In light of these factors, it may be wise to explore alternative accommodations such as Green Valley Ranch or South Point, which seem to offer a more comprehensive array of amenities and services.",True,1141.0,formal

2," My second most unpleasant crepe experience thus far has been had at this establishment. Upon ordering a cheese and prosciutto crepe, I was presented with a remarkably thick and doughy specimen, bordering on the consistency of a pancake. While I generally enjoy doughy crepes, these particular ones seemed to lack the delicate, flaky texture that I have come to expect from such culinary offerings. Furthermore, the temperature of the crepe was not particularly warm, which only served to exacerbate my disappointment. The prosciutto, too, was problematic in its excessive thickness and overpowering flavor. The utensils provided, flimsy forks that they were, proved woefully inadequate in facilitating the cutting of said prosciutto, making for a most frustrating endeavor. 
 My significant other fared slightly better with their vegetable crepe, consisting of mushrooms and spinach, yet even this offering was afflicted with the same unfortunate doughiness as my own. While not utterly devoid of redeeming qualities, this crepe was largely forgettable, save for the fact that it served as a welcome respite from the otherwise underwhelming experience that was had at this venue.

A fresh tortilla makes a world of difference to the enjoyment of the taco. Some of my favourite tacos in the world are just plain, $1.50 tacos that are with some plain 'toppings' a good verde salsa, in a warm, fresh tortilla. I say all this because I think that Verde puts too much emphasis on the ingredients (Which are still under-spiced and boring with some store bought hot sauces on the table giving all the flavor) and then put those toppings into a boring, store bought tasting tortilla.

However, it appears that the current management of the M&M store on the Strip has chosen to adopt a different approach, focusing on more traditional merchandising methods, such as offering four levels of M&M-branded products for sale, a 3-D movie experience, and a guided tour, but regrettably omitting complimentary samples, which seemingly contradicts the essence of the M&M brand's playful spirit.

2," First and foremost, it is imperative to acknowledge that this particular establishment is not a traditional Costco, but rather a specialized ""business center."" This distinction is crucial, as it significantly impacts the products and services offered, and thus, it is essential to emphasize this point to avoid any potential disappointment or confusion among patrons.  

In light of this, it is relevant to highlight that this specific Costco does not sell alcoholic beverages, which may come as a surprise to some individuals who are accustomed to purchasing such items at other Costco locations. Furthermore, there is no food court available on the premises, which may also be a departure from the typical Costco experience that some customers are familiar with. However, it is worth noting that this absence is compensated by the abundance of exceptional dining options and buffets in the surrounding area, which can easily satisfy any culinary cravings.  

This particular Costco focuses primarily on providing an extensive selection of snacks and beverages, intended for the purpose of restocking vending machines. In fact, they even offer vending machines for purchase, which speaks to the unique nature of this business-oriented store. One redeeming quality of this establishment is the diverse array of beverages available, ranging from juices, sodas, sparkling water, cider, and more, which is undoubtedly impressive.  

Unfortunately, this Costco falls short in terms of staffing, with relatively few employees present, and those who are on duty often appear uninformed about various aspects of the store's operations. For instance, upon inquiring about the availability of coupon books, a staff member incorrectly directed me to the guest/member service desk, only to discover that they do not, in fact, accept coupons at this location.  

In conclusion, given the distinct characteristics of this Costco ""business center,"" it is advisable to carefully consider one's shopping needs before visiting, and perhaps opt for a different location, such as the Costco in Los Angeles, before embarking on a trip to Las Vegas.",True,1252.0,formal

2," ""The erstwhile charming ambiance of this establishment has been obliterated by the recent renovation, leaving an aesthetic vacuum that is utterly devoid of character and personality. The utilitarian inclusion of bulky, dark wooden chairs only serves to exacerbate the dearth of comfort and elegance, while the absence of sufficient upholstery and fabrics further contributes to the overall sense of starkness and severity. Notwithstanding the abundance of natural illumination and lofty ceilings, the space remains aesthetically unappealing, a state of affairs that could potentially be rectified by the judicious deployment of vibrant Mexican ceramics. The incongruous presence of a conspicuous cross-shaped arrangement of wooden planks and exposed metalwork evokes a jarring sense of dissonance, eerily redolent of Nathan Lane's garish abode in the film adaptation of The Birdcage. Laughter ensues.

Notwithstanding these aesthetic shortcomings, the venue remains suitable for small-scale nuptial celebrations, accommodating up to 150 guests within its expansive confines. A centrally positioned dance floor facilitates convivial merriment and communal revelry.

Regrettably, the culinary offerings fail to match the promise of the establishment's refined decor. Rice, once a staple of Latin American cuisine, has been reduced to an insipid, flavorless substance, devoid of the rich, savory essence that defines its very purpose. Beans, too, have suffered a similar fate, their natural zest and vitality supplanted by an uninspired, unremarkable taste.

Furthermore, the table salsa, ostensibly crafted from canned tomato sauce, pepper seeds, basil, and a hint of sugar, bears a closer resemblance to marinara than salsa, thereby betraying the expectations of discerning patrons who seek a genuine, spicy experience. Guacamole, once a proud symbol of Mexican gastronomy, has been debased by the incorporation of cottage cheese, an ingredient that not only undermines the authenticity of the dish but also imparts an unpleasant texture and consistency. Chili colorado, a dish historically renowned for its bold, fiery flavors, has been reduced to a bland, uninspired concoction, lacking the very essence that gives it its name.

Incongruously, the cost of such unimpressive fare remains stubbornly high, while the quality of service, regrettably, leaves much to be desired. Patrons encounter sluggish, unhelpful attendants, whose indifference and apathy only serve to compound the disappointment engendered by the food and ambiance.

Yet, amidst this litany of disappointments, one item stands out as a beacon of hope, a shining exemplar of culinary excellence: the cheese crisp, priced at a reasonable $9, offers a satisfying crunch and a delightful blend of cheeses that, momentarily, transcends the surrounding mediocrity, providing a fleeting glimpse of gustatory nirvana.""",True,1254.0,formal

In light of this, I chose to procure sustenance and transport it to my lodgings, and, after perambulating the vicinity a couple of times, I settled upon Fatburger as my culinary destination.

Upon entering the establishment, I encountered a youthful female who demonstrated considerable amiability towards each patron, taking my order with alacrity and assuring me that the onion rings, as indicated by the signage, were indeed of superior quality. Thus, I opted to sample both the burger and the aforementioned onion rings, in addition to a shake, out of curiosity regarding the veracity of the sign's claim.

However, upon receiving my order in a remarkably brief span of time, I was thoroughly dismayed to discover that the burger was an unpalatable, amorphous mass, devoid of any discernible flavors, and the onion rings, unfortunately, lacked even a modicum of zest.

CULINARY OFFERINGS:
I opted for a bowl of soup and a specialized salad, consisting of cucumbers, ""fresh"" tomatoes, onions, red vinaigrette, and feta. Unfortunately, the salad was rather unpalatable. Initially, I presumed it contained marinated tomatoes, but upon further inspection, I deduced that it had simply been stored in a refrigerated state for an extended duration, as the tomatoes were unpleasantly cold. I merely picked at it without consuming it.
My maternal figure chose the rare veal, priced at over $30, yet she, too, barely partook of it, owing to the fact that it was excessively marinated, resulting in a lingering vinegar flavor. As an individual who greatly enjoys the consumption of red meat, even I did not find it appealing, thereby indicating that my maternal figure was not simply being fastidious.

SERVICE:
Our server did not inquire about our satisfaction with the meal until we had nearly completed consuming it, approximately thirty minutes later.

However, upon placing our order around 11 pm, we received only six wings, which prompted us to contact room service again. Upon doing so, we were told that we should have received 12 wings, and the representative proceeded to place me on hold to investigate the matter further. \n\nUpon returning to the line, the representative revealed that the menu had been altered, which resulted in the reduction of wings provided for the same price.

However, upon my return, I encountered an extended delay, waiting behind another patron for ten minutes at the counter, during which time the cashier neglected to acknowledge us or offer any form of assistance.

It wasn't bad, but the food didn't seem freshly cooked; more like it had been under a warmer too long. Most of the meats were ok. The flank steak was great, chicken was good, sirloin was ok but sort of bland, the pork was good, lamb ok, alligator (yes, alligator) was not bad (my first time trying). \nThe atmosphere was the most disappointing element of the whole experience, as the picture on their website made it look like a 4 or 5 star fancy restaurant, with a nice picture of a glass of wine -- however when we arrived, it looked similar to the interior of a Golden Corral (not exaggerating) - definitely not a place that is likely to impress your wife/girlfriend. Also, be prepared, the restaurant is actually split in half: one side is Indian and the other is Braza's; so, it had the thick smell of an Indian restaurant in the air- which kind of worked against our Brazilian appetites. \nI have to say the service was pretty good. The wait-staff was friendly and seemed to want us to have a nice time.\nThe pricing was about $40-45 a person, which I thought was a bit high for this particular establishment-- and I walked away feeling like if I was going to spend that kind of money, I could've done better elsewhere.",,,informal

2," La Condesa, I relinquish my expectations of satisfactory dining experiences at your establishment. Despite our persistent attempts to justify and overlook the shortcomings in the quality of service, it has become patently evident that such indulgence is no longer feasible. The sluggish pace and inattention to detail exhibited by your staff, coupled with an apparent lack of concern for the satisfaction of your clientele, have rendered the dining experience at your restaurant unworthy of further financial investment on my part. In light of these factors, I elect to redirect my resources elsewhere.

On this particular visit, we were disenchanted with the culinary offerings as well. We requested the return of our horchata due to its deficiency in both flavor and viscosity, only to be presented with new glasses after the completion of our meal. Furthermore, the aesthetically pleasing crema that you graciously bestowed upon my torta (or, as some might refer to it, lonche) posed a practical challenge in terms of its consumption, as it was impossible to discern a suitable method of lifting and consuming the dish without compromising its structural integrity.

While it is true that your cochinita pibil once brought us immense gastronomical delight, it unfortunately does not compensate for the multitude of shortcomings that have come to characterize the dining experience at your establishment. Indeed, the ambiance and cleanliness of your restaurant have been problematic in the past, yet we were willing to overlook such issues given the exceptional quality of certain menu items.

2," This was my first buffet experience since my departure from Las Vegas several years ago, and unfortunately, it proved to be a regrettable choice. My sons and I were eager to indulge in a buffet meal prior to our evening excursion in the city of sin, and this particular establishment appeared to be the most convenient option, boasting a relatively short queue. However, upon arriving at the cashier, I was taken aback by the exorbitant cost associated with an individual buffet dinner. In fact, for the price we paid, we could have acquired a 24-hour buffet pass, granting us access to multiple hotel buffets.  

Following payment, we waited briefly for our table to be prepared. Once seated, our server took our beverage orders, and after ensuring that everything was in order, we set out to explore the array of dishes available. Unfortunately, the selection was quite limited, with certain stations remaining unrestocked. Given the circumstances, I made a concerted effort to derive maximum value from my $47 dinner by opting for grilled meats such as kobe beef and prime rib, short rib tacos, various sushi and sashimi options, and beef Wellington. For dessert, I selected mini churros and vending machine-dispensed ice cream.  

A summary of the experience would include the following advantages and disadvantages:  

Advantages:  

* Short rib tacos  
* Sushi and sashimi  

Disadvantages:  

* Grilled meats were excessively dry, including beef Wellington  
* Mini churros were overcooked and stale  
* Vending machine-dispensed ice cream possessed an unremarkable flavor reminiscent of that found at typical buffet establishments

Upon entering, I noticed a dearth of patrons, which seemed to be reflected in the staffing, as there was an absence of a hostess and only two servers present to attend to the needs of the clientele in this expansive venue.  My server, however, proved to be quite adept at his duties, earning high praise for his efforts.  Unfortunately, the same could not be said for the culinary offerings, as my meal failed to meet expectations. \n\nOpting for the lemon sole, accompanied by a side salad, I was dismayed to discover that the fish was not prepared in accordance with my expectations.  Despite the tangy, citrus-infused charm of the lemon caper sauce, the sole itself was overcooked, resulting in a texture that was simultaneously crispy and tough.  As sole is inherently a delicate fish, it requires minimal preparation to achieve optimal tenderness; sadly, this dish fell short of that standard.  Coupled with the fact that the price point for this meal exceeded $20, inclusive of tax and gratuity, I would not advocate for this particular selection.  \n\nWhile Mimi's does boast an impressive array of bread offerings, the remainder of their menu leaves much to be desired.  In light of these factors, I would suggest exploring alternative dining options.""",True,1380.0,formal

And honestly the food is just greasy and nasty.\n\nThe reviews say it's a great place for cheap good Mexican food. But it's not even cheap.\n\nThe salsa is not fresh. And the guacamole is pretty tasteless. When you order tortilla chips and salsa... They put package shredded cheese on and not melted.\n\nI had a taco salad and I couldn't even finish eating it. \n\nIf you like really quick and bad American Mexican food and then this is the place for you.,,,informal

Abhorrent! Wretched! This is a treat I would give to a used car salesman. Or Satan. Or someone else who's bad.\n\nNay nay, says he, you have to go to the one on Green Valley Parkway. It's 10,000 times better. I responded with a hearty \""meh\"" and went back to work.\n\nToday, however, I needed something to get the creative juices flowing, so I figured why not put Mr. Manager's words to the test. I got to the Blueberry Hill on Green Valley Parkway, and was promptly greeted and sat. In order to be most fair, I ordered exactly the same thing as I did at the last Blueberry Hill: Mexican-style chilaquiles and a Diet Pepsi. It was the same plate of mediocrity as the other one. I don't see how people rave about these places when I always seem to get plates full of mediocre.\n\nOn the upside, the service was a little faster. Not that much more friendly, but at least I wasn't waiting forever to get a refill on soda.\n\nI'm sorry, I'm still not sold on these places.

Furthermore, the other meaty accoutrements, including brisket (which, regrettably, exhibited an excessive degree of desiccation for my taste), pulled chicken, pulled pork, and smoked sausage, did not particularly impress. Notably, the sausage, which our server asserted was fabricated in-house, possessed a flavor profile strikingly reminiscent of a generic, mass-produced product, such as those obtainable from a Hillshire Farms packet purchased at Costco. The sole side dish that I consumed, the steak fries, while ostensibly possessing some semblance of skin, unfortunately, failed to deliver a palatable experience.

But, they could probably clean up the deep fry station and better customer service.

But I guess 10% of a dollar, is probably all she'll get from me. \n\nBut the place itself, can probably look better, with out the slot machines that doesn't seem to work, time and time again. If the place was just a place to have a deep fried Twinkies and a slushy bar. Then it would be nice. But with the old school slot machines, and not so happy staff. I believe that this could of been a better place with a better review. \n\nIf you're into gambling or putting a quarter in a slot machine, this is not the place to do so, cause you'll probably not get any service or any help, probably in 30-60 minutes later.

The red velvet cupcakes were dry and tasted horrible.\n\nGo somewhere else for the buffet. This one is very over rated.\n\nFor those with kids, it's not a very kid friendly place.

They didnt provide us little plates either so our table was a mess before we even started ordering.\n\nAs our tacos hit the table the first thing we noticed where that both mine and my husbands plates had big cracks on them. Flea market much?I got the smoked marlin taco which had the texture of canned tuna fish with a minestrone like vegetable concoction on top and the shrimp tacos, pretty decent. The corn tortillas were pretty flimsy though and resembled the storebought el paso brand.\n\nService was not the best either, our questions about the tacos were answered with finger pointing at the menu and blank looks like...uhh you dunno what achiote rojo is? \n\nAll in all, the fact that we said we should have gone to chipotle instead says everything.",,,informal

Nothing really special about the buffet that I can remember, except that they had pizza, which made me really excited in the morning.

However, certain male dancers did display a modicum of affability, such as the gentleman hailing from San Jose, California, who regaled us with amusing anecdotes. Nonetheless, the absence of seating arrangements in the primary chamber for female performers was nothing short of perplexing, prompting us to decline the invitation to join the gentlemen celebrating their friend's last night of bachelorhood.

The staff would benefit from enhancements in various aspects, including their interpersonal skills, service efficiency, and product knowledge.

Upon questioning, he assured me that they possess fresh mint and the necessary tools to craft such a beverage. Subsequently, I received my'mojito,' which raised doubts about the bartender's proficiency or willingness to create the cocktail.

2," ""The establishment boasts an alluring exterior and interior ambiance, which we had the pleasure of experiencing firsthand on a Friday evening, albeit with a moderate level of noise that prompted us to opt for the comparatively tranquil outdoor seating area. Our culinary excursion commenced auspiciously, with a satisfying bread basket and crisp salads that set the tone for a promising start. However, the subsequent dishes failed to maintain the initial quality, leading us to conclude that scaling down portion sizes while elevating the caliber of the fare would be a judicious strategy.

We initiated our gastronomic journey by sharing a spanakopita appetizer, which arrived in the form of three generous pieces, thereby rendering it suitable for two individuals. Although visually reminiscent of a pocket pizza, the dish was marred by an excess of cream cheese, detracting from the authentic flavor profile associated with feta. Moreover, the absence of delicate phyllo crust layers was conspicuous.

Our primary courses consisted of a customary beef gyro and its poultry counterpart, accompanied by potatoes and rice. Unfortunately, the potatoes were prepared in a manner akin to french fries, which rendered them unappealing to my taste buds due to their high fat content. Consequently, I merely sampled a few pieces, feeling somewhat let down. The accompanying rice was unremarkable, and the chicken gyro proved underwhelming as well. My spouse, however, seemed to appreciate the meal relatively more, possibly due to his exposure to prior reviews that tempered his expectations.

Upon arriving at approximately 11:00 AM, my companion and I were obliged to await seating for a brief interval of ten minutes, during which time we observed that, despite the absence of an ostensible throng of clientele, the waiting list was already considerable. Subsequent to our eventual seating, the hospitality of our server proved to be exemplary, as she exhibited a proficient mastery of the menu, addressing any queries we had with erudite explanations and displaying a congenial demeanor throughout our interaction. However, it is worth noting that the portion sizes of the French Toast we ordered were decidedly generous, and the copious amount of pecan nuts scattered atop the dish served to augment its overall flavor profile; unfortunately, the quality of the toast itself did not quite live up to my expectations, and the cost proved to be considerably higher than that of a comparable dish at Denny's.

As Mr. Ramsey would aptly put it, 'it was a dog's dinner, indeed!' Despite the setback, I opted for the bobby, primarily motivated by the desire to sample both the savory roast beef and the delectable bread. Alas, the latter proved to be the highlight of the dish, as the stuffing was unpleasantly cool to the touch and the meat itself was parched, evoking an unfortunate comparison to sawdust in both texture and flavor. It is conceivable that the unshredded cuts of meat, when paired with the satisfying bread, might have yielded a more enjoyable experience; however, the underwhelming nature of the dish left much to be desired. Adding insult to injury, the manager boasted openly about his lack of involvement in the daily operations, instead choosing to focus on micromanaging tasks, a fact that only served to further exacerbate my disappointment.

The asparagus was so over-cooked that it resembled the pressure cooked stuff that comes out of a can.  I couldn't eat it.  The lobster was the best thing on the plate, but even it was a bit rubbery.  Even if they had cooked my food correctly, I'm not sure the experience would have been much better.  The food quality is only marginally better than Outback, but the price is much higher -- more like an upscale steakhouse. If you are looking for something that's a little better than Outback, then this might be the place for you.

The flavor profile of the burger patty itself was unremarkable, lacking any discernible depth or complexity, while the bun was utterly forgettable in its blandness. Furthermore, a flagrant mistake in our order resulted in my receiving an unsolicited side of french fries instead of the onion rings I had explicitly requested. Although the staff did offer profuse apologies and eventually brought out the correct item several minutes later, the onion rings proved to be merely passable, failing to impress my palate with their uninspired seasoning and texture. In addition, I found the portion of fries I sampled while awaiting the correction of the error to be thoroughly unexceptional, neither remarkable for their crispiness nor distinguished by any unique flavor component. Considering the price point of ten to twelve dollars for a fundamental burger and fries combo, I must aver that such an exorbitant tariff seems patently disproportionate to the actual value offered by this establishment. However, I must admit that the beer selection redeemed the dining experience somewhat, boasting a pleasing array of choices that were both refreshing and well-chilled. Alas, the quality of service remained stubbornly average overall, leaving much to be desired in terms of attentiveness, responsiveness, and general hospitality.

Upon the insistence of my sibling, who had not visited this establishment in approximately a decade, I opted to partake in a culinary excursion to this restaurant, situated in close proximity to my humble abode. Our server, with little ceremony, posed an inquiry regarding the presence of a Groupon, to which I responded in the negative, prompting me to peruse my mobile device for such an offering. Subsequently, I procured said Groupon, valued at $19 for $30.

My gastronomical exploits did not, however, meet with great success, as each roll presented itself with an uninspired combination of cream cheese and krab mix, or some derivative thereof. A dearth of originality and vitality characterized the fare, with nary a fish of notable quality nor sufficient quantity to balance the abundance of rice.

Furthermore, the preparation time for our repast proved excessive, occasioning a lengthy wait. The financial burden, in the absence of the aforementioned Groupon, would have approached $60 for a meal of middling quality.

It appears that numerous patrons frequent this dining establishment for the purpose of indulging in a $20 all-you-can-eat special, replete with stipulations and restrictions, precluding the sharing of dishes and exacting payment for uneaten portions. Regrettably, this policy militated against our desire to sample the full range of culinary offerings.

2," They indubitably harbor benevolent intentions within these walls, yet there exists an excessive quantity of aspects worthy of lamentation. To begin with, the interior design exudes an uninspired and melancholic ambiance, prompting one to ponder whether aesthetic considerations were truly given due diligence. Moreover, on a balmy day in Las Vegas, where the mercury rises to a comfortable 75 degrees Fahrenheit, the ambient temperature within this establishment proved to be oppressively sweltering. Indeed, my spouse, who customarily remains impervious to fluctuations in temperature, found it conspicuously warm. The furniture, comprising tables and sofas, appears diminutive and uninviting, respectively. Furthermore, the prolonged preparation time for our smoothie orders seemed to suggest that the fruit utilized in their concoction had been cultivated on site, such was the interminable delay before their arrival.

In point of fact, the quality of the culinary offerings and beverage selection remains subpar and unimpressive, respectively. My recent dining experience at this establishment, accompanied by a companion, proved to be an utter disappointment, as the fare served was not merely unpalatable but also induced nausea, necessitating the utilization of antacid upon returning home. 
  An examination of the menu reveals the following:  
  Wings: It is advisable to avoid the jerk sauce, as it lacks flavor and is generally unappealing. The barbecue sauce, conversely, exhibits some degree of palatability.  
  Sides: The buffalo fries, accompanied by a side of ranch dressing for dipping, demonstrated a certain appeal, specifically in terms of taste.  
  Burger: The bacon cheeseburger, while falling short of my personal preference for a well-done cooking style, was only partially consumed due to the absence of crispiness in the bacon and the lack of A1 sauce.

However, the accommodations themselves leave much to be desired in terms of both size and modernity, with outdated technology such as tube televisions being only one of several areas in need of updating. Furthermore, the bathrooms, particularly in one of the rooms we occupied, lacked fundamental essentials such as toilet paper and functional locks, issues which were further compounded by the minuscule nature of these spaces. The exterior areas, too, appeared in dire need of a comprehensive makeover, with peeling paint and overgrown vegetation contributing to an overall sense of neglect. Despite these shortcomings, the panoramic views afforded by our lodgings did, admittedly, provide a pleasant surprise, although the proximity to the adjacent highway rendered them somewhat less enjoyable due to the persistent hum of traffic. On a more positive note, the waterpark did prove popular among our offspring, even though the lazy river and slides were periodically inaccessible, leading to frustration among our daughters. Confusion regarding the operating hours on Saturday also marred our stay, detracting from what could have been an otherwise satisfactory experience.

If you have a lay over here... good luck! I hope you're not late! You'll be walking a good mile before you reach your destination. As if traveling isn't already stressful. This airport adds to the stress... not to mention, you have slots machines every where- lose money quickly if you dare.",,,informal
2,"It has been about 6 years since we dined at streets of New York. This time we ordered a thin and crispy pizza, a Caesar salad and bread knots. From my memory the pizza was better than I remember but not great.   However, the salad was not edible in fact we took it back.  The romain was brown and at least 4 or five days past it's prime.   They took it back without any Question and comped us a piece cheesecake in good faith.  Who ever prepared our meal should be totally embarrassed....        I don't think we will go back..",,,informal

2,"My wife, son and I have been going to Casey Jones now for quite some time, however this most recent time we went the quality of everything kinda seemed to jump off a steep cliff.   We went in with some friends the other night and ordered some of their newest burger the \""Juicy Lucy\"", after ordering them medium, we were rewarded with two burgers that not only seemed to be bleeding but the cheese the oozed out of them reminded me of a horror flick where the guy gets stabbed and his guts just pour out.   After taking the burgers back to the kitchen and being assured the would be taken care of, the burgers deffinately came back cooked... almost with a propane torch, talk about hockey pucks! and to top it off we didn't even get cheese in the new burgers making them not so.. Juicy ya know.   Where as before I would have preached this place to others, I can honestly say we won't be making a return trip until they get a better cook in the kitchen, didn't think it was possible to botch a burger, let alone four! this place has astounded me in the wrong direction =/",,,informal
2,"So, we received at $20 off coupon in the mail and decided to give it a try.  Let's just say...it's been some months since then and we haven't been back...the only time this place has popped up on my radar was when a co-worker was talking about their lackluster experience, too.\n\nThe service was fine.  It was the food that got me.  I ordered cheese enchilada's and my girlfriend ordered the chicken enchilada's.  Now, I expected cheese...but I didn't think I was going to have to go on a search mission to locate the tortillas. My girlfriend was equally displeased with her meal. The sangria I ordered was the only saving grace...not good enough to return, though...",,,informal
2,"Good food and decent service, but way too expensive for galbi and meat! They also have menus, new and old, that say certain dishes include dessert, but at the end when we asked for them they said that it wasn't being offered anymore. Um, okay, can you let us know before we order and/or update the menus please? I hate surprises like that when eating out when it's been spelled out. That alone knocks off a star or two. \n\nThis place would also be better to eat at alone or with two people for better value, because they give you the same amount of side dishes and seafood pancake no matter how many are at your table.",,,informal
2,"Maybe I haven't been to Dos Gringos in a while, or maybe this location is just grosser than the Tempe location, but this place is dirty!  The bathroom has a bad smell coming from it and everything just seems kinda filthy.  I would never ever order food from here, if their bar area is this dirty I can only imagine how gross the kitchen is... I'm not really sure why people would hang out here when there are plenty of nicer and more fun spots in Scottsdale.",,,informal
2," ""On multiple occasions, I have visited this Jasons Deli and experienced satisfaction with their offerings. Specifically, their delivery services have consistently met my expectations in terms of quality and taste. However, my most recent encounter with their delivery was rather unremarkable, as the butter croissant that housed my turkey sandwich was excessively desiccated, leading to an unpleasant dining experience. Furthermore, the brownies that have previously been a highlight of their menu, failed to meet my expectations due to being overcooked, resulting in an unpleasantly dry texture and burnt flavor. Overall, this particular meal was a disappointment, prompting me to reconsider my future patronage.""",True,1522.0,formal
2,"Outrageously priced. I get they have state of the art equipment but we couldn't afford to use any of it. While the staff is super friendly we did have one of the doctors say, after we couldn't pay to have anymore tests done, that it wouldn't be bad if we choose to put our dog down. I have no idea how a person can be so cold. Do no harm, right? Our dog only stayed 24 hours at the place and it ran us around $2000. We took our dog somewhere else that was much more affordable and they saved his life. He stayed at the other place for about a week. Same treatment and it cost us less than the one day at VCA.",,,informal
2,"They have a variety of makeup lines but the selection of products was pretty scarce when I went in. The options they have for MAC, which was what I was shopping for, was really limited and most of what they did have was opened, broken, or looked really used. On top of that the customer service was terrible. The three employees working sat behind the register the entire time, no greeting or asking if I needed any help- which I did. Pretty disappointed. I'll be going to the indoor location next, hopefully there's a little more options.",,,informal
2,"Decent food at an affordable price. We came to eat here around 1am on a Friday night when we first arrived in Vegas. It was pretty busy but we were seated right away. I shared the 7 oz. steak with hash browns, eggs, and toast with my boyfriend because I wasn't too hungry. The steak was OK at best - it was well done on one half and medium on the other, we asked for medium- but who's complaining for under $4? Hash browns weren't really crispy but the toast was good and the eggs were all right. Overall everything was lacking in salt; understandable given the older crowd. OK place if you're drunk or don't feel like going out to the strip but definitely not a destination eatery.",,,informal
2,"Ate dinner there last week. While the food was OK, it is pretty expensive. Side dishes are an extra $11.00+. \n\nService, however, is another story. Our original servers numbered 3. The primary server was rude and arrogant, and smiling seemed beyond her capabilities. We could have tolerated this but when the busboy reached across my wife to take my plate, I was flabbergasted. I called him on it, telling him he should know better. Then the manager came by and we addressed the service issues with him. He was apologetic and changed our waitstaff so that our service was much better.\n\nMy issue... at a restaurant of this quality and price you should never have to complain to get good service. There are so many high quality restaurants available on the Las Vegas strip, why would you waste your time and money on a place that can't maintain high quality service throughout? My suggestion: find another place for dinner!!",,,informal
2," ""I partook in an evening repast at Leroy Fox, whereupon I had the pleasure of savoring their culinary offerings within the refurbished confines of the erstwhile Hotel Charlotte. The revitalization of the establishment was indeed impressive, as it successfully integrated elements of the original edifice into its contemporary design. Unfortunately, the ambiance was somewhat marred by the cacophony of sounds that permeated the dining area, which was exacerbated by the advent of live musical performances. Notwithstanding the auditory challenges, my dining experience was largely satisfactory, as I relished the flavorsome 'north' chicken, comprising a breast and wing that were skillfully prepared via deep-frying. Furthermore, the menu presented an array of enticing options, and the attentive service was commendable despite minor delays attributed to the overwhelming volume of patrons. However, owing to the aforementioned limitations in auditory comfort, I would not advocate for visiting this eatery with expectations of engaging in effortless conversation with fellow diners.""",True,1527.0,formal
2,"This was a very oridnary hotel, nothing especial. It did not match our expectation of a four star hotel in Vegas. We stayed there for one night, then for the same price we got another hotel that was much better.",,,informal
2,"I'm giving BJ's 2 stars because the food is pretty darn good when they get the order right. I've been to this BJ's about 7 times and each time (except once) they have failed to give me what I ordered on the first try. I always come in with a group of people from work and we fax our order in before we get there. The kitchen has our order, in writing, right in front of them and still can't execute it properly. I know a veggie pizza with no cheese is a terribly complicated concept but come on! EVERY TIME! I've gotten it delivered with cheese and I've even gotten it delivered without the cheese but with sausage added! Sausage?!\n\nThe wait staff is always apologetic but the kitchen here seems to be inept.",,,informal
2,"I wanted to love this restaurant and was very excited to try it. First off the place is small and they seem to have crammed as many tables in as humanly possible. While I get this from a business standpoint it is uncomfortable from a customers standpoint. My husband and I had lunch there on a monday and we could barely hear each other. We arrived early and I can only imagine how loud it gets during the noon hour. The menu was pretty limited. My husband ordered the turkey sandwich and I ordered the grilled cheese BLT. The bill for 2 sandwiches and one fountain drink was just shy of $20.00.  Service seemed a little slow, it was nearly 20 minutes from ordering to being served. When we did finally get our food it was just ok. The bacon on mine was hard and oily and had a quality as if it had been sitting out for awhile. My husband's sandwich was missing the vegetables and mustard that were indicated in the description but after waiting 20 minutes he wasn't going to send it back. Overall the place is loud and mediocre, not worthy of the price. My husband lamented that for the same price we could have gone to Capriottis and I had to agree with him.",,,informal

""The entire assortment of pre-owned vinyls showcased within this establishment's confines are, for all intents and purposes, dilapidated and worn items, with price tags ranging from a meager $5 to an exorbitant amount beyond that threshold, and it is utterly deplorable to note that the quality of clientele interaction is not merely subpar but thoroughly unacceptable, thus impelling me to formulate the unequivocal decision of abstaining from future visits to this purported hub of musical indulgence.""",True,1531.0,formal
2," As a denizen of the San Francisco Bay Area, I felt compelled to sample the Asian gastronomic offerings within Montreal's Chinatown precinct, and Beijing emerged as a highly acclaimed establishment according to the aggregated opinions on Yelp. Thus, we opted to partake in their culinary experience.

The dining area was characterized by a cavernous interior with an excessive number of tables and chairs, creating an environment that was boisterous and lacking in intimacy. Our order consisted of the Chicken Soo Guy, which our server defined as being imbued with a distinctive Asian sauce, the specificity of which was left undefined. It became apparent upon sampling that this purportedly special sauce was, in reality, a rather conventional sweet and sour variety, which did not particularly impress me.

In contrast, the spicy beef dish displayed a modicum of flavor, albeit only after we requested that it be prepared with an extraordinary degree of piquancy. This led me to ponder about the nature of the dish when served in its standard form.

Taking everything into account, my expectations were not met by this eatery, and I would not consider returning.",True,1532.0,formal
2," I have availed myself of OnTrac delivery services for an assortment of packages originating from Amazon Prime shipping, however, on a few occasions, they have failed to meet their obligations in a timely manner. Specifically, on the first occasion, they were unable to effectuate delivery subsequent to my payment of an additional fee of 3.99 for expedited delivery, and on the second instance, their tracking information indicated ""out for delivery"" followed by ""UNDELIVERABLE - OTHER REASONS"" and then ""REDELIVER ON NEXT BUSINESS DAY"". 
  The delivery individual could not furnish a reasonable explanation for the non-delivery of my package, leading me to surmise that he was running behind schedule and elected to postpone its delivery until the following business day. Moreover, the initial delivery person who began delivering packages to me displayed a consistent lack of friendliness, failing to return my smile and express gratitude when I received the package, responding only with a grumpy demeanor and hastily departing.

My friend, who had been yearning for soup in a bread bowl ever since she heard about it, finally settled on a classic salad with chicken and I ordered a Thai chicken flat bread sandwich.

Unfortunately, the preparation of my hamburger was executed prematurely, resulting in a dining experience that was diametrically opposed to our expectations, as the meat was desiccated, lukewarm, and somewhat challenging to ingest. Similarly, the poultry dish we ordered was also afflicted by an unfortunate dearth of moisture and tenderness, making it arduous to consume. In contrast, our previous encounters with their hamburgers have been characterized by their freshness, juiciness, and satisfying temperature. It is worth noting that the cooking method employed by this restaurant, which involves precooking the meat and allowing it to sit in a pan, is not optimal for creating an enjoyable dining experience. In fact, this practice is reminiscent of the methods employed by certain fast-food chains, such as McDonald's.

On a recent Friday evening, my spouse and I visited this establishment with high hopes of enjoying an excellent dinner; regrettably, our expectations were not met. The food was merely passable and overpriced, which was particularly disheartening given the high standards we had set for our dining experience.

The mixed drinks were reasonably priced at ten dollars apiece, but their flavor profiles failed to impress us. They lacked a certain je ne sais quoi that we have come to expect from establishments of this caliber.

Our servers appeared to be inexperienced, which detracted from the overall quality of our meal. Their service was less than polished, giving the impression that they were recently hired staff still finding their footing in the industry.

Moving on to the main event, the cuisine left much to be desired. Our New York strip steak arrived in a meager portion, which was problematic for my robust appetite. Although its flavor was satisfactory, it fell short of our expectations regarding quantity. My wife's sandwich, cooked to a medium temperature, was also underwhelming. Unfortunately, it was served rare, necessitating its return after a protracted wait of ten minutes.

It is mystifying that the airport staff appears to be either oblivious or impervious to this egregious infraction, a state of affairs that raises questions regarding their attentiveness to the comfort and well-being of their patrons, particularly when juxtaposed with their stringent adherence to policies regulating the transportation of certain beverages onboard aircraft.  Furthermore, I find it curious that the cost of a taxi journey to a hotel is $25, whereas the fare for a trip to the airport is a mere $15, despite the fact that both destinations are effectively equidistant.",True,1722.0,formal

Yesterday, I visited this establishment and unfortunately had a subpar experience compared to my previous visits to other Yard House Restaurants. Upon arrival, we were promptly seated, which merited a positive assessment of one star. Our server approached us in a timely manner, and we placed our orders, consisting of a lunch special featuring pizza and tomato basil soup, a children's meal accompanied by pizza and vegetables, an ahi appetizer that served as a main course rather than an introductory dish, and a beer that required an excessive amount of time to be delivered to our table, allegedly due to a keg replacement process. Following a ten-minute delay, the beverage was finally presented to my cousin. Subsequently, we awaited the arrival of our culinary selections, enduring an extensive period of time before their presentation. Fortunately, I had prepared snacks for my three-year-old child, which helped to pacify him during the prolonged waiting period. When the food was eventually served, the cheese on the pizza appeared aged and desiccated, suggesting that it had been exposed to the heat lamp for an extended duration. We sampled a few bites before shifting our focus to the soup, which my child and I essentially shared due to its delectable quality, earning it an additional star. Ultimately, we discarded the remaining pizza slices since they failed to meet our expectations in terms of taste and quality.",True,1723.0,formal

Specifically, the dichotomy between the tangible aspects of 'Air,' 'Earth,' 'Fire,' and 'Water' and their abstract representations within the context of this venue eludes my comprehension. Furthermore, the juxtaposition of such elements with the opulent decor and extravagant prices serves only to exacerbate my perplexity.

WOW, capacity crowd on a Sunday evening with a protracted waiting period of twenty minutes. Familiarity with the culinary aspects of Houston, having resided there for seven years, facilitated an informed decision regarding the consumption of the piquant mudbugs.

2," I reserved two accommodations for myself and my associates to indulge in a period of leisure and enjoyment in Las Vegas; however, we were not entirely satisfied with our experience at this particular establishment. Despite our initial enthusiasm, several unforeseen circumstances and subpar service hindered our overall satisfaction. Firstly, upon arriving at 1:30 pm, we discovered that only one of our rooms was ready, whereas the second room, which was supposed to be adjacent and connected, was not prepared until 6:15 pm. Furthermore, we were lacking essential bathroom amenities such as shampoo and conditioner in the second room, which necessitated a delay of one hour for their delivery due to an overwhelmed attendant. These inconveniences were merely the beginning, as we encountered further miscommunication and inadequate assistance from the concierge. Specifically, they failed to inform us that the club we intended to visit, Marque, was not operational that evening, and instead, only one of its auxiliary rooms, Boombox, was accessible. This oversight led to unnecessary effort and disappointment. My companions and I collectively agree that for a luxury hotel, the personnel, ranging from the front desk attendants to the concierge and security guards, require more comprehensive training and education. Their present level of proficiency falls short of expectations considering the high rates charged by the establishment.

2,"My friend and I swung by Phillip's for a quick bite while our plane made a stop in Charlotte (our gate was right next to the restaurant). It's pretty simple - sit down, place your order when a waiter comes around, and get your food pretty quickly. The only real complaint is that the food's a bit expensive (as all airport food is) and that they didn't have BBQ sauce when I requested it for the chicken tenders. Aside from that, the food was pretty much what'd you expect overall from this kind of joint. The tenders were pretty standard, served with honey mustard sauce. The seafood platter comes with fried shrimp, crab cakes, and some spring rolls. I felt better for not getting the bigger crab cakes when I had theirs - the crab meat was extremely nondescript, coated in fried breadcrumbs but with an indistinguishable taste aside from that. The spring rolls were okay, if unspectacular, and the fried shrimp was decent.\n\nYou're not going to get much service here - our waiter had to be flagged to give us our check - but it's an airport spot, so you can't really set expectations too high.

Our significant other, being a vegetarian, has expressed great enthusiasm towards the diverse selection offered, praising the quality and freshness of the produce. However, we must admit that the prices charged for these delectable delights are somewhat prohibitive, especially when compared to other eateries in the vicinity.  

The service at this establishment has consistently been prompt and attentive, with the staff displaying a commendable level of professionalism in their interactions with patrons. Additionally, they offer complimentary cookies to guests, which has been a delightful surprise for our children. Unfortunately, we cannot say the same for the beverages offered, as the prices charged for fountain drinks are, in our opinion, exorbitant.  

Upon closer inspection, we have noticed an unpleasant odor emanating from the rear section of the restaurant, which has been described as akin to the scent of feet. While this may seem a minor inconvenience to some, it has been a source of discomfort for us.  

The pasta dishes served at this establishment have been found to be merely satisfactory, with some of the soups being quite palatable. A friend of ours once commented that the portion sizes served do not justify the cost, leading us to concur that the value proposition presented is not entirely convincing.  

Despite these shortcomings, the restaurant has consistently maintained a high level of popularity among locals and visitors alike. Perhaps the appeal lies in the ambiance or the convenience of the location, but we cannot help but feel that there are superior options available in the surrounding area, such as Sunset Station, which offers a more affordable and satisfying dining experience, including complimentary beverages.

Specifically, the initial offering of calamari was characterized by an unfortunate rubberiness and an unpleasant greasiness that bordered on the inedible, thereby establishing a less-than-auspicious beginning. Subsequently, we opted to share the renowned Biloxi chicken sandwich, which, regrettably, exhibited a notable lack of moisture and a certain blandness, coupled with the My Wife's Favorite Salad (featuring duck confit), an uninspired assemblage that neglected to impress. Furthermore, the Caesar salad, adorned with an unpalatable abundance of kale, tragically fell short of our expectations, its flavor profile reduced to a barely perceptible hint of saltiness derived from the minute shreds of overcooked, previously prepared fried egg situated atop the bed of wilted lettuce. Fortunately, the attentive bartender, cognizant of the unappealing nature of the offending egg, graciously provided a fresh, properly cooked alternative, thus salvaging the dish from utter disaster.

2," I have had the pleasure of visiting this establishment on a previous occasion, and my experience was satisfactory, with the culinary offerings being of an acceptable quality and the ambiance of the outdoor seating area being particularly enjoyable. However, my most recent visit proved to be somewhat disappointing, as my companions and I were not acknowledged by any member of the staff stationed at what appeared to be a host stand, and we were forced to wait for several minutes while the servers congregated near the entrance, seemingly oblivious to our presence. We ultimately decided to take matters into our own hands and locate a table ourselves, only to discover that the vast majority of tables sported ""reserved"" signs, which, while understandable, led me to anticipate some degree of assistance from the staff in securing a suitable table. Instead, our server approached us and inquired whether we had simply ""walked in,"" and whether we required menus, before informing us that the table we had selected was, in fact, reserved, and that any other table would be suitable, and that she would attend to us momentarily. We managed to find the sole remaining unoccupied table, only to be informed by a member of the sizable party responsible for the reservation of the tables that even that table was earmarked for their use. It is my understanding that it is reasonable for a large gathering to dine at a restaurant, but I could not help but feel that the staff's attention was focused primarily on that particular group, to the detriment of other patrons. My friends and I ultimately chose to vacate the premises, feeling both frustrated and impatient. I truly hope that this isolated incident does not become the norm for this establishment, as I have previously enjoyed their cuisine and would hate to miss out on future opportunities to partake in it due to subpar service.",True,1952.0,formal

While the food is certainly edible and may even elicit a positive response from some patrons, it fails to meet the standards of excellence, mouthwatering flavors, or a truly memorable dining experience. Instead, it is merely adequate, and the prices charged do not justify the quality of the meal. Those seeking authentic French cuisine would be wise to look elsewhere, as this establishment does not deliver on its promises.

2," We are temporarily residing at the Mirage and coincidentally strolled past this culinary establishment, which boasts an impressive facade. My spouse and I are ardent devotees of sushi and reckoned this eatery would be a stimulating venue to sample. The hostess was quite hospitable, and the Kirin Ichiban beverage was indeed delectable. However, the sushi failed to justify its exorbitant cost. We requested the calamari, which consists of thick strips-a delicacy that, albeit scrumptious, is also rather pricey. We ordered three sushi rolls and were utterly disenchanted with the dearth of inventiveness characteristic of such an expensive dish. Consequently, we elected to settle our tab despite still experiencing hunger, as our satisfaction was inadequate.

Regular sushi rolls are minuscule and consist merely of an item enveloped by rice and seaweed. If your primary motivation for dining is sushi, it is unwise to frequent this restaurant.

My synopsis shall be succinct, as Friday's ephemeral nature necessitates a prompt conclusion, allowing you to indulge in nocturnal revelry unhindered. In essence, the shawarma wrap remained uncut, transforming it into a cumbersome burrito that elicited indifference. Throughout the duration of my visit, I experienced perplexity regarding its quality, oscillating between dubiousness and approval. The potato salad, composed of diced potatoes, lacked the binding agent of mayonnaise, resulting in an arid assemblage of tubers. Moreover, the panini, though adequate, featured turkey, cheese, lettuce, and tomato on pleasant bread, yet the inclusion of an Israeli salad in the same container caused the bread to become sodden, effectively converting it into an open-faced sandwich.

Upon entering the club, my companions and I were struck by the conspicuous absence of femininity, as the gender ratio was skewed heavily in favor of the male patrons, resulting in a dearth of female presence. Furthermore, the physical environment within the club was less than ideal, as the floor surface was covered in a sticky substance, which made movement somewhat challenging, and the service provided by the bartenders and other staff members was sluggish and unfriendly.

Thus, it was only natural that I would be eager to experience the epicurean delights offered at his establishment. Upon entering, I was faced with a daunting dilemma - what to order from the extensive menu? This proved to be a formidable challenge, rivaled only by the complexity of the ACT exam. After deliberating at length, I decided to deviate from my customary burger and instead opted for the pie sampler, reasoning that it would afford me the opportunity to sample a variety of flavors without committing to a single entree. However, this decision ultimately proved to be a miscalculation, as the sampler, though replete with an array of savory pies, left me feeling somewhat unsatisfied due to its modest portion size. Each individual pie boasted exceptional quality, yet this was somewhat mitigated by the fact that it was merely an appetizer, leaving me still yearning for a more substantial meal. In retrospect, I would have been better served by selecting either a whole pie or a burger, or perhaps even pairing the sampler with one of these options. My companion's burger, which I surreptitiously sampled, appeared to be of exceptional quality, and I must admit that I was tempted to pilfer a few more fries had my friend not been vigilant.

The culinary offerings at Tandoori Times were indeed impressive. We opted for the goat curry, which was their Friday special, and it did not disappoint. The flavors were rich and well-balanced, with none of the spices overpowering the others. Additionally, the tender chunks of goat meat were cooked to perfection, literally melting in our mouths. Our better half, who is typically not enamored with curries, was pleasantly surprised by the tandoori chicken. The marinade added depth to the dish without overwhelming the natural flavors of the poultry. The pesto naan was an excellent accompaniment to our meals, providing a delightful contrast in texture and taste. In short, we had no criticisms regarding the cuisine whatsoever.  
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the service we received. Our server, although polite and affable during his sparse appearances, failed to attend to our needs in a timely manner. After presenting us with menus, he vanished for an interminable period, leaving us to wonder if we needed to summon him via smoke signals or Morse code. When he finally reappeared, he took our order expeditiously but neglected to inquire about our beverage preferences. As a result, we were forced to solicit the attention of another server to procure our drinks. Moreover, the prolonged delay in delivering our food made us question whether the kitchen staff was engaged in an epic battle of Jenga or merely relishing a leisurely game of cricket. In either case, the wait was unacceptable and detracted significantly from our dining experience.  
Lastly, there was the unsightly spectacle of the belly dancing. While the novelty of the performance was initially entertaining, the cacophony generated by the dancer's zealous finger cymbals and the abrupt surges in music volume quickly became grating on our nerves. The constant din precluded any semblance of conversation between my husband and myself, reducing our interaction to a series of strained shouts. Although the dancing itself was engaging at first, its repetition grew tiresome after several minutes, transforming what should have been a captivating diversion into an annoyance that rivaled the persistently ringing cymbals.  
In conclusion, Tandoori Times presents a mixed bag of delights and drawbacks. Despite the culinary excellence and agreeable prices, the service leaves much to be desired. Nonetheless, we might revisit this establishment in the future, hoping that the kinks in their service will be ironed out by then.",True,2081.0,formal

Additionally, we took advantage of the wine specials available on the wall, which were offered at the remarkably affordable price of $4 per glass - truly remarkable!

My gastronomical inclinations were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the edibles, particularly the dipping sauces, which I found to be more delectable than those proffered by Boiling Crab (LA). However, our server's inability to elucidate the varying degrees of piquancy, coupled with her unfortunate tendency to downplay the fiery nature of certain menu items, somewhat tempered my enthusiasm for indulging in an extensive array of dishes. Specifically, she cautioned against the Cajun fries, characterizing them as excessively fiery, while simultaneously recommending the mild sauce as a safer alternative, despite my explicit expression of preference for pungent flavors. Consequently, I opted for a less ambitious order, forgoing both the Cajun fries and the medium sauce, which, in hindsight, I might have relished had I been adequately informed. Furthermore, an unfortunate mix-up with one of my companion's orders resulted in the substitution of chicken wings for fried shrimp, followed by an interminable delay in rectifying the error and presenting us with an incorrect bill.

Well, my dear reader, let me elucidate. Firstly, there are the exorbitant fees associated with online ticket purchases, which, when combined with the additional five-dollar parking charge, result in an aggregate increase of ten to twelve dollars per ticket. Now, were these surcharges to benefit the performing artists themselves, one might be inclined to turn a blind eye. However, I assure you, the maintenance costs of the facility do not warrant such excessive fees. In essence, it is a large concrete room, albeit one with a sloping floor designed to afford prime views of the stage from any vantage point.

We both requested med-rare as how our steak should be cooked. As for the sides, we had the wild field mushrooms, creamed spinach and broccoli-rapini. And of course, a bottle of red wine(I don't remember what it was). When our steaks and sides arrived, I was excited to cut into the steak and taste the wonderfully crusted meat but to my surprise, I was disappointed and didn't like my steak at all. I like my steak crusted but not burnt!!! I didn't touch my steak for the rest of my meal but I did enjoy the wine and the sides we had ordered. I can honestly say that I will not be returning. That's only based on my steak alone bc the service was impeccable.",,,informal

After just one Cosmopolitan I was barely able to walk and got very sick later than night. This has never happened to me before and I'm concerned something was slipped in my drink.

Unfortunately, the dressing did not quite live up to expectations, as it seemed rather diluted and lacking in distinct flavor. \n\nDespite these minor shortcomings, I remain convinced that Nook possesses considerable potential and warrants further exploration.

The original text describes a person's experience at a bar as average, mentioning the view, location, and drinks. To modify it to use longer and more complex sentences and professional vocabulary, we can rephrase it as follows:

""An experience that fell short of expectations, characterized by a sense of monotony and lackluster surroundings, albeit with a few redeeming features.""

This modified text uses longer sentences and more advanced vocabulary, such as ""fell short of expectations,"" ""monotony,"" and ""lackluster surroundings,"" while still conveying the same meaning as the original text. It also maintains the same tone and structure, with a brief description of the experience followed by a mention of the location and drinks.

Here's a breakdown of the modifications made:

* ""Pretty average experience"" became ""An experience that fell short of expectations."" This phrase is more formal and implies a certain level of disappointment.
* ""Great view"" became ""A sense of monotony."" This phrase suggests a feeling of repetition or dullness, which can be seen in the context of the abandoned buildings and lack of excitement.
* ""Until you walk closer to the wall and you see nothing but abandoned buildings until you see South Mountain"" became ""Albeit with a few redeeming features."" This phrase acknowledges that there were some positive aspects to the experience, but they were not enough to overcome the overall feeling of disappointment.
* ""It was cool being next to US Airways Arena and Chase field"" became ""Characterized by a sense of proximity to notable landmarks."" This phrase uses more formal language to describe the location of the bar in relation to nearby attractions.
* ""For some reason I thought this bar was on the top of the hotel, but it's only on the third floor"" became ""Boasting an unremarkable altitude."" This phrase uses more formal language to describe the location of the bar within the hotel, emphasizing its lack of distinction.
* ""Decent spot, drinks were okay, I might come back again if people from out of town are here"" became ""With a few redeeming features, including an acceptable ambiance and passable beverages, the possibility of future visits remains."" This phrase uses more formal language to describe the positive aspects of the bar, while also acknowledging that the experience was not entirely satisfactory.",True,2132.0,formal

While some dishes undoubtedly boast delectable flavors, others fall short of expectations, rendering the entire experience a veritable gamble. The first time I visited this establishment, I opted for the Spinach 4-Cheese Quesadilla, only to be met with a dish that was excessively oily and cheesy, bordering on overwhelming. Mind you, I am cognizant of the fact that the name itself implies a generous amount of cheese, yet there exists a delicate equilibrium that must be struck in order to achieve true gastronomic harmony. In contrast, my companion's rendition of the same dish, ordered on a separate occasion, was much more balanced in its composition. On a subsequent visit, I elected to sample the Veggie Rice Bowl, which, while flavorful, suffered from an unfortunate overcooking of the tofu. Furthermore, our order of the Vegan Spinach & Artichoke Dip proved underwhelming, prompting us to seek alternatives. My friend, however, found great pleasure in their salmon entree, while another acquaintance enjoyed both the Pollo Fresca and the Chicken Shawarma Wrap. During my third visit, I opted for the Veggie Bowl once again, omitting the tofu this time around, and found it significantly improved.

However, I must admit that the visual representations of the culinary offerings were somewhat perplexing, as I was unable to accurately identify any of the dishes depicted.  

The quality of service was satisfactory, as the server was attentive and responsive to our needs. I requested a Sprite from the fountain beverage dispenser, but upon consuming it, I discovered that it did not conform to my expectations.

Furthermore, upon attempting to discard the liquid, I noticed minute particles floating within my cup. Disheartened by these experiences, I decided to forgo further exploration of the beverage options and instead focused on the food menu.  

It is worth mentioning that this establishment offers luncheon specials during the afternoon hours, which may potentially provide patrons with an economical dining alternative.

The ambiance, suffused with the melodious strains of live Dixieland jazz, contributes significantly to the establishment's overall appeal. However, a recurring concern has arisen during my numerous visits to this esteemed eatery, pertaining to the kitchen staff's proclivity for imbuing their dishes with an excessive degree of piquancy, seemingly under the assumption that such an approach is intrinsic to the Cajun culinary tradition. Alas, this strategy often results in certain menu items being overwhelmed by an oppressive heat, thereby obfuscating their inherent flavors. A case in point is the crawfish scampi appetizer, which, in its traditional preparation, relies on a subtle infusion of garlic, herbs, and, on occasion, a judicious sprinkling of red pepper flakes to enhance the delicate taste of the shellfish. Unfortunately, the Cajun Queen's interpretation of this dish involves an egregious application of chili, effectively subsuming the crawfish's natural sweetness beneath a fiery blanket of spice. Furthermore, this penchant for extreme seasoning renders the scampi eerily reminiscent of the etouffee, a dish that is intentionally designed to showcase a more pronounced level of heat. Were the culinary artisans at the Cajun Queen to display a modicum of restraint in their utilization of Cajun spices, a greater balance of flavors might be achieved, thereby elevating the gastronomical experience to an even loftier plane of satisfaction.""",True,2223.0,formal

The juiciness of the burger was complemented perfectly by the addition of the blue cheese, which greatly enhanced its overall taste.

Nonetheless, the beet salad offered a delightful and revitalizing contrast. Although the strawberry cheesecake, which was prepared from scratch and not listed on the menu, was merely adequate, it was still a pleasant surprise.

Upon partaking in the culinary offerings of this establishment, my sentiment can best be described as a profound sense of indifference, verging on utter disappointment, owing to the fact that, despite a few notable exceptions, such as the pork belly, salmon, and beef tartare, which demonstrated a modicum of gastronomical prowess, the majority of the dishes served were, regrettably, forgettable to an alarming degree.

Specifically, my garden salad was unremarkable, and my fellow patrons' chicken panini sandwich, though flavorful, featured chicken breast that lacked succulence, while their strawberry salad showcased mushy fruit. However, what truly hindered my enjoyment was the sluggish pace of the service, as we placed our orders expeditiously only to endure an extended wait for our meals to arrive.

I relished a delectable dinner at Fleur de Lys last month, yet nothing truly astounded me.  I opted for the $59 prix fixe menu, which encompasses an appetizer, entree, and dessert - ultimately, a commendable value!  

I savored the rich, earthy onion soup, served with shaved truffles and duck, its presentation was unforeseen.  Next, I indulged in gently heated salmon accompanied by julienne vegetables and a green horseradish sauce.  My salmon was cooked to perfection, and the dish's appearance was aesthetically pleasing; however, the sauce, frankly, tasted akin to grass clippings - bitter and overpowering.  My companion seemed to relish her stout braised short ribs.  The trio of chocolate desserts fell short of my expectations: a dry soufflÃ©, a salty peanut butter shake, and Baily's ice cream.  None of the desserts genuinely impressed me.  Perhaps my expectations were excessively high, given that it is Hubert Keller's establishment.  Nonetheless, I would be willing to return and sample their regular menu, although, with such an array of exceptional dining options in Las Vegas, I cannot guarantee future visits.

  All four of us opted for the tasting menu, with two individuals selecting the wine pairing option as well. The visual aspect of the dishes was undeniably impressive. We initiated our meal with a preliminary palette cleanser of sorts. The first course consisted of either a mushroom soup or a salad, wherein I chose the former, and my spouse opted for the latter. While both dishes were satisfactory, they failed to elicit an exceptional degree of culinary delight. 
  The second course, which comprised pasta accompanied by a meat-based sauce, was indubitably the most delectable offering thus far. Moving on to the main entrÃ©e, we were served a flat iron steak, which, albeit enjoyable, did not quite attain remarkable status. The concluding dessert course featured blue cotton candy and chocolate cake accompanied by banana gelato, the former of which proved to be a pleasant surprise. 
  Lamentably, the wine pairings fell short of our expectations. Our server seemed to possess limited knowledge regarding the wines, and rather peculiarly, he adhered to identical pairings irrespective of whether we selected the soup or salad, and fish or steak entrÃ©e. Moreover, the entire wine selection was confined to the red family.

As we were still in our tender years and unable to partake in the adult pursuits of gaming and driving, I accompanied my companion to the arcade, where we became thoroughly engrossed in a turbo-charged Ms. Pacman machine, our minds and fingers working in tandem to navigate the frenetic maze. Following this exhilarating escapade, we embarked upon a leisurely perambulation along the famed boulevard, basking in the vibrant ambiance that enveloped us.

My return to the Flamingo last week marked a significant departure from my previous experience, as the passage of time has wrought subtle yet discernible changes in the property's appearance and ambiance. Upon entering the premises, I was struck by an unmistakable pall of stale, smoke-laden air that permeated the atmosphere, evocative of the smoking rooms found in certain budget-friendly motels. This initial discomfort, however, was soon dispelled by the improved circulation that greeted me within the hall, leading me to appreciate the venue's unique layout, which, while admittedly somewhat perplexing, afforded me the opportunity to savor a few pints of Sam Adams on tap at the bar in the company of my German colleague, who had recently arrived from abroad. Although I elected not to partake in any gaming activities myself, due to my lingering dissatisfaction with Harrah's properties, I must admit that the experience was not without its charm.",True,2301.0,formal

The establishment offers an array of savory dips, complemented by expertly cooked French fries that prove to be a satisfying accompaniment to the main attraction. Unfortunately, the venue does not currently offer beer, a disappointing omission that we hope will be remedied in the near future. Despite this minor shortcoming, the generous portions served at this cozy establishment suffice, precluding the need for additional helpings. However, my spouse expressed a desire for a crisper texture and yearned for the inclusion of Texas toast. The fish itself was a delicate white variety, proffering a palate-pleasing flavor profile. The coleslaw, while not exceptional, still managed to contribute a welcome contrast in texture and taste to the meal as a whole. We harbor optimism regarding the longevity and prosperity of this culinary venture and eagerly anticipate our next visit.""",True,2303.0,formal
3," My maiden voyage to the shooting range transpired to be an enjoyable escapade; however, certain drawbacks tarnished the overall experience. Firstly, the staff members exhibited proficiency in their field, imparting valuable knowledge and ensuring a seamless experience for patrons. Additionally, an extensive array of firearms was available for utilization. Unfortunately, these advantages were counterbalanced by several negative aspects. Specifically, the range was characterized by a high volume of patrons, leading to extended waiting periods, particularly during peak days of the week. Furthermore, the physical space was limited, resulting in a cramped environment with individuals occupying every available spot, including the floor and corners, and shoulders were literally rubbing against each other. Moreover, the range officers appeared flustered, struggling to manage the throngs of people and maintain order amidst the chaos. Lastly, the cost of utilizing the range was deemed steep, with a shared lane, gun, and ammunition for a mere thirty minutes totaling a whopping eighty-eight dollars, which included a fifteen-dollar fee per weapon. Despite these limitations, the range still presents itself as a suitable destination for those interested in partaking in such activities, though it is crucial to be cognizant of the aforementioned constraints.",True,2304.0,formal

3," ""An abundance of seating options and diverse ambiances within the establishment rendered it an exceedingly comfortable venue, particularly during the warmer seasons when the outdoor patio area can be utilized extensively. However, certain aspects detracted from the overall satisfaction, specifically:  
1. The practice of pouring cream into coffee without first inquiring about preferences regarding dairy substitutes resulted in an unintended addition of half-and-half to my spouse's beverage, despite my desire to customize it with skim milk. Although the staff accommodated my request for a new drink, it would be preferable to have control over the creative process behind my coffee concoction.  
2. The background music consisted of a radio station featuring recurring advertisements, which created an atmosphere akin to being trapped in a shop playing the same irritating tunes and commercials repeatedly. A simple solution would be to curate a playlist or employ an iPod to create a more enjoyable auditory experience for patrons.   
3. While the coffee was satisfactory, the menu items appeared appetizing, but comments regarding the cost have been voiced. Nonetheless, it seems illogical to visit a coffeehouse anticipating a full meal. Prices were only marginally higher than expected.  
4. The availability of beer and the prominent display of a large pizza banner near the entrance raised questions about the establishment's identity. It appears that Hob Nobs may be struggling to define its purpose and target audience. A decision on the type of establishment would alleviate confusion and enhance the overall experience.  
Despite these issues, the visit remained generally pleasurable, with only minor shortcomings detracting from the enjoyment.""",True,2306.0,formal

The customer service was subpar...The housekeeping staff took an inordinate amount of time to clean my room, despite my having made a timely request for their services early in the morning; however, they did not complete their task until approximately 3 pm. The hotel's location, remote from the strip, necessitated our reliance on taxis to travel to and from Caesars Palace, despite the availability of a shuttle service, as we were compelled to wait a minimum of twenty-five minutes for the shuttle, which ceased operating at midnight, thereby limiting our ability to fully enjoy ourselves and creating anxiety regarding the impending cessation of the shuttle service, prompting us to opt for taxis that charged us $20, inclusive of tips and taxes, and the taxi drivers, dissatisfied with a mere $1 gratuity, sought larger sums...It is preferable to stay on the strip to avoid the inconvenience and expense of taxi and shuttle rides! \nPros: Quiet, luxurious, odorless, well-appointed kitchen in the suites, sumptuous bathroom\nCons: A few relatively minor drawbacks. The shuttles cease operation too early and experience considerable delays in pickup. The hotel's distance from the strip makes walking an unfeasible option.

However, it is equally conceivable that certain individuals may harbor a desire for something additional, some je ne sais quoi that would elevate their dining experience to a higher plane of existence, thereby warranting a rating of four or five stars.

The venue experiences a high volume of patronage, with a constant influx of customers from 11 am onward, culminating in either the exhaustion of the daily menu items or the closure of the eatery. It is imperative to note that the restaurant only accepts paper currency, thus it is advisable to verify the availability of funds in one's wallet prior to arrival, and refrain from allowing the presence of pedestrians gathered adjacent to the sidewalk to deter you, as this phenomenon is customary and not indicative of any anomaly. The ordering process is expedited, resulting in the rapid procurement of culinary items, followed by a prompt departure to accommodate the succeeding patron in line.

This establishment exudes an aura of authenticity, as evidenced by the lengthy queues and numerous patrons in attendance. My companion awarded five stars in recognition of the culinary excellence displayed by the eatery. 
  Notwithstanding, one cannot help but wonder if the prolonged waiting period is truly justified. The duration of the queue significantly diminishes the overall rating, relegating it to a mere three stars. The system employed for organizing the queue was utterly perplexing. Numerous patrons have pointed out that there are separate lines for various types of fare. In total, there are six distinct lines, divided into two sets of three. The first set consists of lines dedicated to pork (abodaba), offal (including brains, tongue, stomach, tripe, intestines, et cetera), and beef (encompassing asada, et cetera). Despite its apparent length, the queue moved at a glacial pace, making the prolonged delay seem utterly absurd. 
  Upon drawing closer to the front of the line, it became apparent that the sluggishness was attributable to a single individual performing the duties of two people. Although he demonstrated remarkable speed in crafting the tacos, he was responsible for preparing a minimum of five tacos for every patron. Moreover, he produced an excess of fifty tacos while we waited, ostensibly for takeout orders (wrapped in foil and placed on paper plates). The combination of the time required per person and the additional tasks undertaken by the taco artisan for the benefit of those not present in the queue contributes substantially to the interminable delay.

Upon scrutinizing their menu, I sought the ubiquitous California wrap, adorned with bean sprouts and avocado, but instead discovered an array of Southern-style dishes, including southern fried chicken, skillet-fried chicken, veggie lasagna, meatloaf, coleslaw, fried okra, collard greens, and, of course, BBQ.

The kobe meatball dish was quite satisfactory.  My personal selection was an eight-ounce filet, which, while satisfying, did not include any additional sides, such as a potato, and so forth...

Firstly, the pizza served at Spinato's is undoubtedly of satisfactory quality, boasting flavors and textures that are bound to satiate even the most discerning of palates.  

Secondly, it is my opinion that the pricing of said pizza is somewhat elevated, perhaps to an extent that may deter potential patrons who are seeking a more affordable dining option.  

Lastly, and unfortunately, the service I received during my visits was subpar, bordering on unacceptable.

Although the cooking process was accurate in achieving a medium rare consistency, the meat itself was somewhat disappointing in terms of flavor and tenderness. The au jus accompanying the dish was also underwhelming. In contrast, my dining companion opted for the filet, which they reported to be quite satisfactory.

In light of these factors, I cannot in good conscience bestow an overwhelmingly positive review upon Stockyards.

The portions were generously sized, with a single plate sufficient to satisfy three individuals had we been aware of their magnitude.

The Furikake chicken, enhanced by the addition of Sriracha, was particularly impressive. However, my primary criticisms pertain to the rice dishes. The brown rice, prepared with an excessive amount of water, resulted in a pair of soggy, unappealing scoops.

Additionally, it is worth noting that this establishment accommodates individuals who prefer the use of roller blades featuring a single row of wheels, and offers a modest discount for such patrons.

Our meal began with the clear egg rolls accompanied by a delectable peanut sauce, a staple dish that we often indulge in when partaking in Vietnamese cuisine. The flavors were adequately represented, without surpassing our expectations. Subsequently, we opted for the combo pho soup, which presented generous proportions and a commendable execution. Although the broth lacked a certain je ne sais quoi, it was reminiscent of fish sauce, mint, and other indispensable components. One might argue that the soup catered to American palates, with a subtle spiciness that left room for personal adjustments. However, for those seeking a more genuine experience, a more robust foundation would be necessary. The menu, though limited, helped avoid the paradox of choice, but we couldn't help but feel that certain Vietnamese delicacies were absent.

However, the fruit-based alcoholic beverage known as sangria was excessively sweetened, although the house margarita served on the rocks was somewhat more agreeable.

For optimal culinary experiences, it is advisable to arrive promptly, as the most delectable items often disappear rapidly. The fried chicken, when cooked to perfection, is undoubtedly a highlight, although it occasionally suffers from overcooking or dryness. The six-cheese spaghetti is also a commendable option, but its quality can vary depending on the preparation method. The abundance of sides offers numerous choices, including mac-n-cheese, which, much like the aforementioned chicken and spaghetti, may occasionally be overcooked, resulting in a less than satisfactory dining experience. However, the blackeyed peas and cornbread consistently impress, and their lemonade, arguably the finest in Charlotte, has garnered high praise. A word of caution regarding the volunteers who handle beverage refills: they are renowned for their warmth and generosity, and a adept diner may even secure an additional portion of mac-n-cheese through skillful banter.

We visited this establishment during happy hour and, while intending to confer four stars, a deduction of one star was necessitated due to the absence of communication regarding seating arrangements for said happy hour. Specifically, we were not apprised of the fact that happy hour seating was exclusive to the bar and adjacent bench. Furthermore, our ignorance was not alleviated by inquiring about the protocol, as we were informed to occupy any vacant seat of our preference. Notably, by the time of our departure, a sole couple remained, and they too were oblivious to the proper seating arrangement, thereby resulting in their failure to capitalize on the discounted prices.  

Our culinary experience was satisfactory, albeit not exceptional, with a few notable exceptions. The red sangria was unremarkable, while the lamb, though flavorsome, was diminutive and overpriced. The croquettes were uninspired, whereas the Patatas Bravas, essentially roasted potatoes enrobed in a tomato-based sauce, was straightforward yet gratifying. The total cost of our repast, excluding gratuity, approximated $60, with an additional $20 expended unnecessarily due to our unawareness of the happy hour stipulations.

Noteworthily, my companion, who habitually consumes meat and eschews tofu, relished these dishes. Our server informed us that our main courses would arrive shortly after presenting the crabby cakes. However, our food did not materialize for an additional 40 minutes, during which our server failed to provide any updates or explanations for the delay. Despite this setback, the quality of the food remained impressive. My sandwich was delivered scorching hot, with a crunchy bread roll and flavorful eggplant meatballs that maintained their texture within the sandwich.

  The menu presented itself in a straightforward fashion, allowing patrons to select their preferred entrÃ©e and combine it with a choice of meat, thereby tailoring their dining experience according to individual preferences. In my case, I opted for the green curry, which, when prepared with chicken, promised to deliver a flavor profile characterized by a harmonious balance between the pungency of fresh green chilies and the richness of coconut milk.

The papaya salad exhibited a strong sodium presence, which overpowered the lime flavor, while the inclusion of minuscule peanut fragments seemed incongruous and culturally adapted. In contrast, the chicken red curry dish featured an appreciable assortment of bamboo shoots and customary curried vegetables; nonetheless, the curry sauce lacked a zesty quality, rendering it insipid and unimpressive. Notwithstanding, my children expressed immense fondness for the pad thai, which temporarily alleviated my gastronomical disenchantment. Given my relentless pursuit of authentic Thai cuisine in Arizona, my likelihood of revisiting this establishment remains uncertain.""",True,2797.0,formal

However, I must emphasize that this rating is not without certain reservations, as my boyfriend and I have encountered issues with the service during two separate visits.

Furthermore, during our most recent visit, an unfortunate mishap occurred where our food was mistakenly delivered to another table, resulting in a 15-minute delay before it was eventually served, albeit at a frigid temperature. Although I appreciated the Manager's gesture of offering us the meal complimentarily, I cannot help but feel that such errors are indicative of subpar service. Therefore, I must deduce that the ambiance, characterized by comfortable seating, appealing tables, and an engaging screen, does not suffice in compensating for the shortcomings in the dining experience.

""It so transpired that I found myself within the confines of a shopping mall, specifically the renowned Galleria Mall in Las Vegas, during my leisurely sojourn in that city. Feeling somewhat exhausted and financially depleted due to my relentless pursuit of retail therapy, I opted to take a respite and partake in a casual repast at a nearby eatery. My thoughts were interrupted by an insistent craving for a delectable hamburger, which prompted me to seek out a suitable establishment capable of satiating my gastronomical yearnings. As fate would have it, a Red Robin restaurant happened to be situated within close proximity, thereby rendering it an ideal choice for my culinary endeavors. Admittedly, my initial reaction was tinged with incredulity, as there existed a plethora of exceptional dining options within the city limits, yet I chose to frequent a chain restaurant that was seemingly ubiquitous. However, my desire for a straightforward, uncomplicated dining experience ultimately prevailed, leading me to select this particular venue. Upon entering the premises, I was escorted to a cozy table positioned near a window, affording me an unobstructed view of the bustling mall. Following a cursory examination of the menu, I settled upon a basic, unadorned burger, dubbed the 'Keep it Simple' option. The server, cognizant of the brief delay, offered an apology and proceeded to take my order. The ensuing wait, though perceived as somewhat prolonged, did not unduly perturb me, as I was not particularly pressed for time. Ultimately, my patience was rewarded, as the arrival of my culinary creation elicited feelings of satisfaction and contentment, owing to both its generous proportions and satisfying taste. For those who harbor a penchant for superior burgers, a visit to the Red Robin located within the Galleria Mall is certainly worth considering.

It is worth mentioning that there exists an alternative location of the same establishment in the Palazzo, however, according to local patrons, the quality of service and culinary offerings at this particular branch are deemed superior. For the sake of comparison, it is pertinent to note that the author has had the pleasure of visiting another Grand Lux Cafe situated in the Beverly Center of Beverly Hills; and while both establishments share certain commonalities in terms of their ambiance and gastronomical offerings, this specific location boasts the unique distinction of being open for business on a twenty-four hour basis.

Upon arriving with a sizable contingent of approximately fifteen individuals, the group was able to secure seating arrangements without incident, despite the fact that it was peak dining time and no prior reservations had been made (it is customary to reserve tables at least two hours in advance).

The author and a companion opted to share a pizza pie adorned with sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms. While the dough was somewhat overly soft and difficult to handle without the toppings breaking apart, the flavor of the crust itself was quite satisfying. As a result, the author and her companion found themselves consuming the crust of each slice, leaving behind the toppings.

It is important to note that the menu at Grand Lux Cafe features an extensive array of culinary options, which bears a striking similarity to that of Cheesecake Factory, given that the two establishments share a common affiliation. Nonetheless, it is recommended that patrons exercise caution when selecting items from the Asian-inspired section of the menu, as the authenticity of such dishes may be subject to debate.",True,2897.0,formal

Furthermore, the sausage and pepperoni toppings contributed to an unfortunate sogginess that permeated the entire pie. Admittedly, the crust exhibited some promise, but it was not enough to salvage the dish from its overall mediocrity.

Dim sum, a culinary delight recommended by a friend, aroused my curiosity due to its exclusivity, as it was only available twice a year.

Although the dishes were savory, some were unfortunately served at room temperature. Furthermore, the absence of chili oil, a staple condiment in most Chinese eateries I frequent in San Diego, was conspicuous, yet tolerable given the sodium-rich nature of the items we consumed. Nonetheless, the non-dim sum options proved impressive, boasting fresh raw oysters, succulent crab legs, decadent lobster, and expertly crafted nigiri.

We initiated our gastronomic journey with the chilled seafood platter, a veritable cornucopia of delights, featuring four Dungeness crab legs, four oysters, four clams, and eight shrimps, all for the reasonable sum of $24.95. In my opinion, this platter ranks among the most exceptional values in Las Vegas for shellfish enthusiasts. Our entrees included grilled shrimp and scallop skewers, a kid's burger, and a combination fried platter. Unfortunately, the latter was somewhat disappointing, with an overabundance of breading and questionable texture of the shrimp and scallops, accompanied by a solitary piece of cod/haddock.

When perusing the menu, I am invariably inclined towards the Sesame Crusted Ahi Tuna as my initial course, principally because the tuna is presented atop a bed of delectable slaw imbued with a savory soy dressing, accompanied by a side of wasabi that can be incorporated according to personal preference. Although this eatery does not specialize in seafood, I frequently develop an intense craving for fish dishes and discover that their Blackened Fish Sandwich is cooked to perfection, complemented by a tangy sauce that enhances its flavor. Additionally, the steamed broccoli is typically served in generous portions and maintains a consistent freshness. However, I would advise against ordering the honey roasted carrots, as they are often overwhelmed by an excessive amount of sweetness, resulting in a taste that is akin to plain sugarcoated carrots - an unfortunate departure from the natural flavors that vegetables should exhibit.

During our initial visit, my fiancÃ© opted for a pizza and a set of chicken wings, the latter of which can best be described as utterly delectable and dangerously addictive. The wings possess a delightful crunchiness on the exterior, complemented by an interior that is remarkably moist, and when paired with a tangy ranch or hot sauce, the result is nothing short of culinary perfection. In contrast, the pizza, while certainly enjoyable, did not quite live up to the lofty standards set by the wings. Our order consisted of a straightforward pepperoni pizza, with the remaining half being divided between mushrooms and sausage.  
On our second visit, we decided to sample one of Biaggio's renowned stromboli, and we were pleasantly surprised by its generous size. Our selection featured chicken accompanied by artichokes and red peppers, and while the inclusion of artichokes was undoubtedly a welcome touch, it is our belief that the more affordable 6.99 stromboli options are superior to the pricier specialty variety, which carried a hefty price tag of 12.99.

""Myriad pecuniary challenges plague my existence, yet the Tuesday promotion proffered by Popeyes does not rank among them. For a mere $0.99, I can indulge in a duo of delectable poultry pieces that satiate my hunger and provide a fleeting respite from my financial tribulations. Although I do not frequent this establishment with great regularity, the allure of this offer proves difficult to resist. Moreover, their biscuits possess an unparalleled degree of culinary excellence, which further reinforces my inclination to partake in this affordable gastronomic experience.

4," Overall, a delectable culinary experience, coupled with an admirable social mission, renders King's Kitchen an eatery where one can indulge in a satisfying meal while concurrently contributing to the betterment of the local community. The novel concept behind this not-for-profit restaurant, where 100% of the profits generated from sales are utilized to provide sustenance for those in need, is truly laudable. Moreover, the edibles served at this establishment are not only flavorsome but also fresh, thereby ensuring a gratifying dining experience for all patrons.  During a recent group interview in Uptown, a few of us were seeking a nearby luncheon venue, and given the inclement weather conditions, we opted to dine at King's Kitchen, situated conveniently at the corner of the block. Upon perusing the menu, we were pleased with the variety of options available and thus requested seating. I personally relished the chicken salad croissant sandwich, accompanied by a side of mixed greens salad with balsamic dressing. The sandwich was indeed scrumptious, boasting fresh ingredients and a generous portion size. The side salad, though unpretentious, was likewise fresh and satisfying. The other dishes ordered by my companions appeared equally appetizing. The prices, ranging from $9 to $13 for the lunch menu, were reasonable and reflected the superior quality of the cuisine. Furthermore, the service was attentive, and the staff members were courteous and friendly, further enhancing our dining experience. In conclusion, King's Kitchen offers an exceptional culinary encounter that simultaneously supports a worthy cause, and thus, I am eager to revisit this establishment to sample their dinner offerings.",True,3219.0,formal

The culinary offerings, particularly the eggs, were undoubtedly delectable.  Each of the assorted pastries I sampled exuded an ethereal quality, while the bacon, though adequate, failed to elicit the same level of enthusiasm.  However, the sweet and savory fusion of the jelly complementing the bite-sized donuts surpassed expectations, rendering them a highlight of the meal.  It is worth mentioning that the establishment's decision to label these diminutive pastries as 'beignets' proved somewhat misleading, as their texture and composition diverged noticeably from the traditional beignet formula, prompting a brief period of puzzlement regarding their authenticity.  Notwithstanding this minor inconsistency, the Bellinis, with their refreshing blend of peach juice and champagne, proved to be a resounding success, leaving me wishing for a more copious serving of coffee to accompany my repast.""",True,3220.0,formal

Plates are heartily-sized and reasonably priced.\n\nMy Tom Xao Ca Ri ($12.50) was full of fresh vegetables (not overcooked -- a rarity for this neighborhood's Asian restaurants!) and jumbo shrimp. The original house specialties include Banh Tom Ho Tay (lightly friend shrimp and sweet potato cake, $13) and Ca Kho To (caramelized fish, $10). Their curries pack a welcomed spicy punch. The Canh Chua ($8) are all made with a homemade broth (cooked daily).  \n\nThe chef is forthright in sharing his values. MSG disgusts him and so does the 'watery salty stock' that other restaurants use.

4," Last minute dinner plans with my family led us to dine at Puck's, located in the upscale Crystals Mall on the renowned Las Vegas Strip, adjacent to the luxurious Aria resort. Despite the prime location and the fact that it was a Friday evening, we were pleasantly surprised to only have to wait a mere ten minutes before being seated at around 9 PM. The ambiance of the restaurant was characterized by a bright, semi-open space, complemented by a cozy bar area, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere for patrons. \
The attentiveness of the staff was satisfactory, as they ensured that our dining experience was enjoyable and hassle-free. The culinary offerings at Puck's were impressive, particularly the grilled ribeye steak, which was undoubtedly the most expensive item on the menu at $40. However, the flawless preparation of the dish, cooked to perfection at medium rare, accompanied by a rich and velvety reduction sauce that I wished could have been more abundant, made it a worthwhile indulgence. Furthermore, the dish was thoughtfully garnished with a stem of sautÃ©ed mushrooms and blackened green chiles, adding a delightful touch of fieriness to the dish. Overall, the meal was a satisfying start to our culinary adventures in Las Vegas, providing a perfect blend of quality and value. \
Additionally, we sampled their delectable tiramisu dessert, which was adorned with chocolate beads dispersed throughout the creamy layer, offering a delightful contrast of textures and flavors. While Puck's primarily specializes in pasta, pizza, and seafood, their grilled ribeye steak is undoubtedly a commendable option, worthy of recommendation to those seeking a satisfying dining experience.",True,3229.0,formal

Our offspring opted for pork sandwiches and chicken fingers, the latter of which could be prepared via grilling, thus rendering it a healthier alternative to its deep-fried counterpart. Each member of our party relished their respective meals, and the portion sizes were deemed satisfactory. The trio of BBQ sauces proffered by the establishment were sampled and found to be palatable, and the sweet tea beverage was similarly enjoyable. Beverages were obtained through self-service, and the ambiance of the restaurant was enhanced by the spotless nature of the facilities and the congeniality of the staff.

My previous experiences at this establishment had been marked by a hitherto unwavering satisfaction with the quality of service rendered, and it was not until my fourth visit that I encountered this anomalous instance of fiscal discrepancy.

The aquatic facilities served as the primary motivation for our selection of this hotel, and we were not let down. Two diminutive pools, a tranquil river, and a sizable wave pool (with only one wave every five or ten minutes, it must be noted) collectively contributed to a poolside ambiance that was noticeably more subdued than anticipated. It is worth mentioning that while the daytime pool party, known as 'Daylight,' was in full swing, a substantial cover charge was enforced. 

Numerous dining options surrounding the casino catered well to our culinary needs. Although the prices charged at the bars located within the casino proper were somewhat elevated, such expenses are customarily expected in establishments of this nature.

""My excursion to Quaker Steak & Lube commenced with the Atomic Wing Challenge, an endeavor entailing the consumption of six of their piquant atomic wings. Although the quantity may seem paltry, the fiery nature of these wings necessitates a liability waiver prior to indulgence (a gesture primarily intended for dramatic effect). While undoubtedly scorching, the wings remain endurable for individuals possessing a sufficient threshold for pungent cuisine. Those who regularly partake in dishes incorporating habaneros will likely find the atomic wings tolerable. As a helpful suggestion, when ordering the atomic wings, request a pair of food-handling gloves to prevent the sauce from staining your hands, thereby enabling you to touch your eyes or utilize the restroom without inflicting discomfort upon yourself. Following the completion of the challenge, I sampled additional wing varieties, including Louisiana Lickers, Arizona Ranch, and Golden Garlic. Impressed by their flavors, I found the wings to be satisfyingly meaty, a welcome departure from the common practice of serving wings with minimal meat. My sole grievance lies in the slightly exorbitant pricing of $5 for a half dozen wings, equating to $0.83 per wing, which strikes me as somewhat steep. Nonetheless, the superior quality of these wings potentially justifies the cost.""",True,3240.0,formal

The pedicure itself encompasses a range of luxurious treatments, including a relaxing hot stone massage, warm lotion application, and an invigorating leg massage. Notably, I have visited this salon on multiple occasions, and each time, I have been greeted promptly and accommodated without an appointment. In fact, the staff has consistently demonstrated their proficiency in efficiently ushering me into a massage chair to initiate my pedicure experience.  

However, I must admit that I was taken aback during my most recent visit, when my boyfriend requested the paraffin treatment for his hands. To my surprise, the attendant brought out two plastic bags containing warm wax and instructed him to insert his hands while she secured them around his wrists with a tie. While this method appeared somewhat unrefined, the outcome was indeed impressive, as it left his skin feeling noticeably smoother.  

In light of the exceptional service and value offered by this salon, I am eagerly looking forward to returning this Friday, in preparation for the upcoming sandal season.",True,3247.0,formal

The gastronomical delights presented before us boasted an impressive array of flavors, undoubtedly tantalizing our taste buds. Nonetheless, a caveat emerges in the form of a pecuniary concern, prompting a natural inclination to draw comparisons with other establishments offering similar fare at a relatively more reasonable cost. To elucidate, the delectable appetizers proffered by Halcyon, while unquestionably delightful, carried a price tag that some might consider exorbitant, amounting to a whopping fourteen dollars! This observation compels me to juxtapose the former with the Harvest Moon Grille, a dining destination renowned for its superior quality and comparatively greater value. Indeed, a cursory examination of their menu reveals a striking discrepancy in pricing, with the latter offering arguably more generous portions at a lower cost. Furthermore, my personal experience with the Ribeye Spackle served as a prime exemplar of this phenomenon; although the dish itself proved satisfying, the cooking method employed by the chef deviated somewhat from my expectations, specifically regarding the degree of doneness. Admittedly, such inconsistencies may be attributable to isolated incidents or momentary lapses in execution. Be that as it may, the desserts, though undeniably delectable, seemed to carry an inflated price tag, exceeding twenty dollars apiece! In light of these observations, I feel compelled to recommend that ardent devotees of Halcyon consider a comparative analysis between this establishment and its neighboring counterpart, Harvest Moon Grille, in pursuit of a more comprehensive and satisfying dining experience.",True,3344.0,formal

The personnel were assiduous in their attention to our needs, and multiple individuals visited our table to ensure our satisfaction.

The menu proved to be impressive, surpassing my initial assumptions of a typical Pho restaurant. It encompassed a wide variety of options, including appetizers, Pho, entrees, smoothies, and numerous other selections.

I selected the #11 Rare Steak and Brisket Pho, complemented by an order of Chinese Doughnuts as an appetizer. However, my sole criticism concerned the doughnuts' lack of sweetness, as they customarily arrive coated in sugar. Nevertheless, I resourcefully utilized the leftover Peanut Sauce from my companion's spring rolls, transforming it into a delectable dish.

The food was served at an incredibly rapid pace, with the preliminary courses being satisfying, while the Pho itself stole the show. Both the steak and brisket exhibited tenderness and flavorfulness, accompanied by an abundance of noodles and a rich broth.

The 'Cuisine of New Mexico', characterized by a distinctive fusion of flavors and ingredients, boasts an unparalleled uniqueness; among their renowned offerings, the green chile potato and an array of pork dishes hold pride of place. As a pescatarian, I tend to gravitate towards the fish or seafood specials, which are artfully presented alongside a thoughtfully curated standard menu, complemented by an assortment of daily specials inscribed on chalkboards dispersed throughout the restaurant.

During my most recent visit, I relished the blackened scallop appetizer as my entrÃ©e, accompanied by a generous house salad. While the scallops exhibited a slight saltiness, their texture was cooked to perfection, and they were served atop a crispy tortilla, accompanied by a medley of rice, beans, and a spicy sauce that added a delightful zest to the dish. The salads, in particular, prove to be a highlight, with many of the entrÃ©e specials thoughtfully paired with a starter salad. In the company of four fellow diners, we opted to share a bottle of wine and a plain pizza as an appetizer, rendering dessert an afterthought, as none of us could muster the requisite capacity to indulge in anything further.

To avoid any unnecessary waiting, it is advisable to secure a reservation in advance. However, should you find yourself waiting, take advantage of the opportunity to situate yourself at the bar or near the fireplace; with a refreshing beverage in hand and surrounded by the warm, inviting aroma of the fire mingling with the savory scents of the kitchen, any perceived delay quickly dissipates amidst the convivial atmosphere.

The waitstaff has divulged that patrons can request the chicken sandwich to be served as a wrap, an option that is not explicitly listed on the menu. This revelation precipitates our profound gratitude.

However, there are certain aspects that warrant mentioning. Firstly, for those who partake in the practice of checking in on review websites, it is worth noting that doing so will reward them with a complimentary shot of the establishment's signature whiskey. Unfortunately, this particular elixir is not especially palatable, bearing a strong resemblance to a medicinal concoction such as Triaminic cold and cough medicine. Thus, it is advisable to exercise caution when indulging in this particular promotion.

Furthermore, the design of the bathroom sinks leaves much to be desired. The decision to implement a slightly tilted slab of tile as a sink is, quite frankly, baffling. Such a configuration not only hinders the effective containment of water but also generates an unfortunate propensity for splashing, thereby endangering the integrity of one's attire. It is our fervent hope that management will consider replacing these questionable sink designs with more traditional basins, thereby ensuring a more pleasant experience for all patrons.

Ultimately, despite some inconsistencies, I found the food enjoyable, and I would likely return. An abundance of delectable desserts and meats is always an attractive feature for me.",True,3475.0,formal
4,I went out to Outback for a light snack. I was seated promptly without any delays. My server was very attentive and helpful with the menu. I ordered the side salad along with the soup for the day. The salad was fresh and crisp and I promise they have the best garlic croutons. The soup was better than I expected it was a creamy onion and cheese soup. And of course they brought out their famous bread and butter!,,,informal
4,"Great place for a quick, healthy bite, featuring flatbreads, wraps, panninis, salads, soups...even quesadillas!  No matter what you choose, you know exactly how many calories are in each (the calorie count is next to each menu item). \n\nI devoured the chipotle chicken wrap (380 calories). The veggies were plentiful and fresh, and the flatbread was the perfect thickness--soft but not flimsy. The chipotle sauce was flavorful, with just the right amount of heat.  My only complaint is the smaller portion of chicken--more is always better.  Try the peppadew hot sauce on your meal!  Wayyyyy better than Tabasco. \n\nIt would be PERFECT if there was one located closer to Scottsdale...So many tasty options, all at very reasonable prices--$5 got me the wrap, a drink and my choice of chips, a cookie or a brownie.  Beat that, Subway!",,,informal
4,"They have an amazingly primo location, right next to ASU and all those local businesses.  They actually have a good amount of seating and easily accessible parking!  This alone practically makes the place 4 star worthy.  What nails it is the staff.  Everyone has been professional, friendly and super helpful.  I've seen folks who forgot to take all their cream cheeses, and they'll remind them they are entitled to them in the deal.  So many places would just let you leave.  \n\nNotice I haven't mentioned their food yet?  Well, there is a reason. It is 100% ok.  I've never gotten anything bad - ever.  But nothing has been great either.  Average menu options, with some nice choices.  Bagels are ok, but nothing to write home about.  One of my favorite things is that for a sandwich you can upgrade your bagel to a wrap, artisan bread or a \""softwich\"" which is like a bagel but softer and square.  \n\nIt's never going to be a bad choice, and the super service will have you leaving with a smile on your face.",,,informal
4,"A good locals bar.\n\nYou can tell it's a good bar when bartenders from other bars come to gamble and hang out.  The food is good, gambling is good and the bartenders are good.  My second time there I hit $400 on Keno and the third time $200 in video poker.  One of the few bars I'm still up on!\n\nThe bar area has a dozen or so spots without a machine so you can belly up without gambling and they have a few booths on one side and a few high-top tables on the other.",,,informal

My dad and I went to the Duquesne Incline and then had some time to burn before his flight home, so we stopped next door at the Grandview Saloon for a beer and to hang out for a bit.\n\nThe patio is fantastic with a wonderful view of the rivers, and you can watch the incline go up and down.  They had a decent selection of beer (although we were uncreative and went with Yuengling) that was nice and cold and reasonably priced given the location.  Our server was prompt and friendly.\n\nI'm guessing there's more interesting food options in downtown Pittsburgh, but I'd definitely stop here for the view again, especially with visitors.",,,informal

Our server provided attentive and proficient service, ensuring that our culinary journey was nothing short of exceptional. Each dish was artfully presented in generous portions, bursting with flavors that delighted our taste buds; specifically, the fusion of watermelon and feta avocado, accompanied by spiced nuts and a cucumber salad, proved to be a standout creation worthy of high praise. Additionally, their diverse selection of hummus and freshly shucked oysters left us eager to sample more of their innovative offerings.

4," ""We have had the pleasure of dining at this establishment on two separate occasions, and both experiences have been thoroughly enjoyable. The all-you-can-eat dinner option for $27 is an excellent value, particularly given the quality of the culinary offerings. While the sushi may not be exceptional, it is certainly comparable to that found at other reputable establishments. The true delight lies in the ability to order numerous dishes and sample a wide variety of flavors and textures. The menu boasts an impressive array of options, including salmon belly, super white tuna, salmon, hamachi, scallop, conch, halibut, sweet shrimp, seaweed salad, and an assortment of delectable desserts. It is essential to note that while the sushi chefs are responsible for preparing your meal, you must place your orders with your waiter. However, if you opt to sit at the sushi counter, you will be treated to attentive service and the opportunity to request whatever you desire from the sushi chefs directly. The spicy tuna crackers, which have garnered significant praise, did not quite live up to our expectations. Nevertheless, we would still recommend trying them, as they are part of the inclusive package. The pork belly, another highly-regarded item, was merely satisfactory in our opinion. Nonetheless, we suggest giving it a try, as it forms part of the overall experience. The service we received was generally impressive, with friendly and accommodating staff enhancing the enjoyment of our meals. When given the choice, we would advocate sitting at the sushi bar, as it affords a more engaging and personalized dining experience, allowing you to interact with the sushi chefs and explore their vast repertoire of culinary delights.""",True,3485.0,formal

This room is actually much quieter and bigger then their \""high roller\"" or \""premium\"" rooms, which is weird. There is no desk but there is a little table with 2 chairs. It's not fully updated but honestly it's not bad at all. I would book this room again if we had a choice of the other rooms. I didn't give 5 stars because the bathroom tub kept dripping water.

4," Having La Cerise situated merely a short distance away from one's place of employment can be considered both a beneficial and detrimental circumstance; a curse in the sense that it tempts one to indulge in an excessive frequency of luncheons, thereby posing a threat to one's financial constraints. The eatery's amiable service, scrumptious culinary offerings, satisfactory coffee, and delectable on-site ice cream production undoubtedly contribute to its appeal. Furthermore, the prices charged for the consumables seem reasonable, considering the superior quality of the fare provided. The menu presents a variety of sandwich options, allowing patrons to select their preferred bread type, including panini, croissant, wrap, or bun.

In conjunction with the tennis courts positioned across Park Road, they form an integral component of the park's diverse sporting facilities.

Nonetheless, it is essential to acknowledge that Las Vegas is renowned for its exorbitant prices, and thus, it is unsurprising that such a phenomenon occurs within its borders.  The entryway and foyer of the restaurant are rather captivating, with the wine tower serving as a striking focal point in the primary dining area.  The hospitality has been meticulous and considerate, although perhaps a tad sluggish in tempo.  We encountered no difficulties in attracting the attention of our server during my visits.  It is conceivable that certain individuals might misinterpret a leisurely pace as poor service; nevertheless, I have discovered that the staff at this establishment is quite responsive and diligent in their efforts to ensure that patrons are content with their dining experience.

My previous employment with a catering company during my academic tenure necessitated my involvement in the service of various types of whiskies to guests, whereupon I was frequently queried regarding the distinction between diverse brands and styles. Despite my attempts to arrange the whiskies in a systematic fashion, I found myself struggling to accurately identify each variety, leading me to fabricate names and attributes for the benefit of those who inquired. Subsequent to this experience, my understanding of whisky remains limited, although I have acquired several bottles as gifts for retirement celebrations and the like. \n\nThe establishment in question appears to be a traditional whisky shop, boasting an extensive array of whisky brands and styles, complemented by an impressive selection of gins and other spirits. Given the store's specialization in whisky, it is likely that patrons will be able to locate their preferred whisky among the numerous options available.

Both varieties of sausage proved to be delectable, with each bite delivering a savory experience that left me eager for more. In addition, I partook in a bowl of wonton soup, whose flavorsome broth and plump dumplings pleased my palate immensely. Although the presence of bean sprouts was somewhat superfluous, the overall quality of the soup remained undiminished. Furthermore, the eatery offered an assortment of other delectable options, including pho, miso soup, shrimp noodle soup, and an array of sandwiches that elicited my approval with their satisfying taste and generous portion size. While I did not sample any of the sushi, Asian cuisine, BBQ, or salads, their visual appeal suggested that they too were of high culinary standards.

However, I must confess that I am partial to a more tangy and unctuous variety of ribs, as the ones served here were slightly leaner than my personal preference. Moving on to the cornbread, it was adequate, but not particularly memorable. Lastly, I must mention that the hot sauce provided was somewhat overpowering, as it dominated the palate and left little room for the natural flavors of the meat to shine through.

This sight instilled within me a sense of optimism, leading me to surmise that the establishment was likely to serve quality cuisine.

Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by a recently renovated interior, characterized by spotless formica booths and shiny tile floors, although the ambiance remained relatively unremarkable. Customers are required to place their orders at the cashier or utilize the drive-thru window, following which their meals are prepared and ready for collection within a mere five minutes. The prices, in my opinion, are one of the primary draws of this eatery, as they are eminently reasonable and affordable for the majority of patrons.

We opted to sample the fish taco plate, which consisted of two generously proportioned tacos enveloped in fresh corn tortillas, complemented by an abundance of crisp cabbage and rich, creamy crema. Although the rice and beans accompanying the dish were undeniably delectable, they were regrettably not served at a sufficiently high temperature, thereby precluding them from attaining a perfect rating.

4," In my subjective experience, there exists a profound schism within the city of Pittsburgh, analogous to the historical conflict between the Montagues and Capulets. This dichotomy is manifest in the culinary preferences of the city's inhabitants, with individuals either aligning themselves with Pamela's or Deluca's, the two establishments representing the antitheses of the breakfast food spectrum. As an ardent adherent of the latter, I would eagerly engage in a spirited dispute with proponents of Pamela's, provided that I have been adequately fortified by a colossal breakfast burrito, proportionate in size to my cranial dimensions, and numerous cups of coffee. 
 Deluca's, while possessing certain idiosyncrasies, continues to captivate my attention. These peculiarities include an interminable wait for seating (attributable to the universal desire to partake in the restaurant's offerings), an ambiance reminiscent of a vintage diner, replete with an eccentric mural and surfaces susceptible to stickiness, and a service staff that, while proficient, does not indulge in excessive coddling of their clientele, given the restaurant's bustling nature and modest gratuities. Personally, I find these characteristics appealing and actively seek them out in a dining establishment. My fondness for Deluca's extends to visiting the restaurant in a state of mild inebriation, whereupon I relish devouring a gargantuan burrito and copious amounts of orange juice and coffee, the latter replenished at irregular intervals by an accommodating server.

My adventures began with a solitary excursion to the city of Las Vegas, where I managed to inexplicably find myself on the famed Strip, outside the illustrious Wynn resort, following an evening of unbridled revelry. Upon my return to the hotel, my companion and I established a daily ritual consisting of ordering luncheon via room service at 3 p.m. (our wake-up time), followed by successive glasses of champagne, and culminating in the depletion of the minibar's contents, only to have it restocked and subsequently plundered once more. Our nocturnal exploits commenced around 10 p.m., as we ventured forth to partake in the opulent ambiance of XS, and concluded at 4 a.m., when we transitioned to engaging in vigorous gaming activities. Unfortunately, our financial euphoria was short-lived, as the staggering sum of $700 for our hotel room fee, combined with an additional $800 for room service, abruptly reduced us from carefree, globe-trotting celebrities to anxious, penny-pinching adolescents who had inadvertently appropriated the family automobile. In light of our experiences, I would recommend that any individuals opting to pursue a similar course of action should consider indulging in the mouthwatering burger sliders (crafted from the finest ground beef) accompanied by perfectly cooked onion strings. Additionally, each bottle of champagne we sampled was truly delectable, and prudent travelers may discover that the champagne and sparkling wine offerings are indistinguishable, thereby providing an opportunity for fiscal savings.

Notwithstanding these observations, the inclusion of organic cabbage and tomatoes constitutes a considerable merit in my estimation. Furthermore, their assorted flavored lemonades range from utterly captivating to merely adequate.

The most compelling aspect of this dining establishment lies in its unparalleled value, with three generously proportioned tacos available for the eminently reasonable sum of $4.50.

My second visit to Mad Pita Express was accompanied by my beloved fiancee, who opted for an utterly delectable lemon rice soup. The tanginess of the lemon was strikingly prominent, and its savor was undoubtedly gratifying! She also partook of a piece of heavenly baklava, which she described as extraordinary.

The cost of $5.00 for the gyro is an incredibly reasonable price. The soup, priced at $2.99, is generously portioned.

Although there may be a brief delay in the preparation of the culinary delights, the charming and cozy eatery boasts an array of captivating adornments that my fiancee and I found ourselves enthralled by for several minutesâincluding family photographs, diverse flora, and eclectic artwork.

The interior design of the venue garnered my approval, and the configuration of the booths was quite ingenious. Our server was exceptionally cordial and helpful throughout our dining experience. \n\nMy contentment was further elevated by the discovery that the menu bore a striking resemblance to its counterpart in Bloomington-Normal, with the sole variance being the assortment of beverages available. We initiated our meal with the Beer Battered Asparagus, which proved to be an exquisite delight! Although I was tempted to order my customary dish, the White Cheddar Stuffed Poblano Peppers, I opted to deviate from my routine and selected the Potato Crusted Rainbow Trout instead. The flavors present in this dish were truly captivating. My colleague followed suit and enjoyed her repast thoroughly. Motivated by our satisfaction, we decided to indulge in dessert as well. I requested the Creme Brulee, but unfortunately, it failed to meet my expectations.

Cant exactly remember the three cuts of meat other than one being eye of round but i had about 4 plates of it so mission accomplished. \n\nI would highly recommend grabbing the Sukiyaki style. The sweet soy has much more flavor and everything that comes out of it, especially the udon noodles, much MUCH better. Dont forget to add a healthy scoop of minced garlic as it'll give it a lot more depth. \n\nNoodle and Veggie plates are premade which can be a bit annoying as each plate had too little or too much of one thing or another. Meat plates are done right and slices to order. Depending on where you sit you can watch your meat being sliced and assembled which is nice. No browning of meat that's been stacked on top of another and left in the fridge. \n\nFour instead of five stars mainly due to my mistake of ordering the shabu shabu instead of the Sukiyaki. Pretty much ended up grabbing Anthony M's left other broth and threw it into my own which turned out A LOT better then expected but one of hte staff came by and topped me off with shabu shabu water/broth and it got watered down.

4," While perusing Yelp in pursuit of an affordable dining establishment in Las Vegas, I chanced upon a venue boasting an impressive 3000+ reviews, a modest price range symbolized by a single dollar sign, and an average rating of 4+ stars. Intrigued, I opted to visit the establishment, primarily due to my desire for a respite from the exorbitant cost of $75 lunches. Upon arriving at EoS, I was pleasantly surprised to discover a diverse array of delectable sandwiches, all of which were remarkably affordable. Located in close proximity to approximately half of the Las Vegas Strip, this eatery offers a frugal alternative to the lavish expense of dining in the area, even factoring in the cost of a $15 taxi ride. In addition to their extensive selection of savory sandwiches, EoS also features a breakfast menu available until 11 am, catering to patrons with early morning cravings. Personally, I found their Chicken Chipotle Avocado sandwich and the Original 1786 (or whatever its designation may be) to be particularly satisfying, with the latter requiring a tad more sauce to achieve optimal flavor. However, when augmented with an additional serving of sauce, the Chicken Chipotle proved to be absolutely delightful. At a mere $7 per sandwich, it would be challenging to find a more economical and palatable option. It is worth noting that the portion size of their sandwiches is not excessively generous; while it satisfied my own hunger, my male companions typically require two sandwiches to satiate their appetites fully. Furthermore, for those planning to dine at EoS during the evening hours, a visit to the adjacent PH and its captivating Pleasure Pit is highly recommended.",True,3885.0,formal

Being an individual who grew up during the 1980s, I am drawn to this venue due to its iconic Thrifty's ice cream, a staple of my childhood. Having visited this location on multiple occasions in the past, I can confidently attest that tonight's experience was distinct from previous visits, boasting an elevated level of quality and enjoyment.

Upon entering, I was immediately struck by the enticing aroma of freshly baked cookies, which served as the perfect complement to the delectable circus animal flavor ice cream that I had selected. In stark contrast to my previous experiences at this establishment, where the cookies were somewhat rigid and lacked the ideal texture for a well-crafted ice cream sandwich, tonight's offerings were pleasingly soft and pliable, thereby creating a harmonious union between the cookie and ice cream components.

Furthermore, I must commend the generous portion size of the ice cream scoop, which was truly impressive in both its volume and presentation. While some patrons might express reservations regarding the cost, it is essential to recognize that the value lies not only in the quantity of the product but also in the exceptional quality and satisfaction it provides. When indulging in a treat of this caliber, it is easy to momentarily dismiss monetary concerns and simply relish in the enjoyment of the experience.

The staff members were incredibly cordial and welcoming, contributing to an atmosphere that was both inviting and comfortable. Additionally, the facility was well-maintained, with ample space for patrons to enjoy their treats without feeling crowded or cramped. As a further testament to the venue's commitment to providing an exceptional customer experience, they have thoughtfully provided a table-style arcade game and an assortment of unique sodas within their drink refrigerator, effectively catering to diverse tastes and preferences. If only they could incorporate some classic 80s tunes and nostalgic ambiance, perhaps through the medium of a vintage radio or television set, I would unhesitatingly award this establishment the full five stars.",True,3887.0,formal

My experience was further enhanced by the company of my companion, with whom I shared a delightful double date. However, I must admit that the diminutive size of the dining area did result in a somewhat prolonged waiting period of approximately 45 minutes. Additionally, the ambient noise level increased significantly during peak hours, specifically on Friday evenings, though this is hardly a unique phenomenon and certainly not a reflection of the management's acoustic considerations.

This personalized approach is a refreshing departure from the impersonal nature of chain restaurants, and it serves as a testament to the eatery's commitment to fostering a sense of community among its clientele.  

My recent visit afforded me the opportunity to sample the Roasted Turkey sandwich, which exceeded my expectations with its flavorsome cold cuts and freshly baked bread. The Mozzarella sandwich, with its rich, velvety cheese, proved to be another highlight of the menu. Furthermore, the turkey chili warrants high praise for its satisfying, comforting qualities, particularly on days when the temperature drops. Patrons would be wise to note, however, that beverages are served in generously proportioned vessels, nearly rivaling the size of a small vat. Additionally, the restaurant offers half-sandwich and soup combinations as part of its lunch specials, providing customers with an economical alternative to the standard full-sandwich option.  

The extraordinary hospitality extended by Arthur during my final visit merits particular mention. As the lunch hour drew to a close and the dining area became relatively quiet, he took the time to engage me in a leisurely conversation, displaying a genuine interest in my occupation and thoughts on the local downtown area. Such personalized attention is a rarity in today's fast-paced, large-scale dining establishments, making this cafe a veritable gem in the midst of more impersonal chain eateries.

Equipped with a voucher obtained from a local Vegas tourism website, my entire family and I ventured to Tacone for a midday repast. Our expectations were not particularly elevated, owing to the fact that it qualifies as a fast-food establishment and is situated within the confines of the Aladdin; our primary objective was to consume a rapid and satisfying meal prior to visiting Build-A-Bear Workshop with my offspring. However, we were pleasantly taken aback by the culinary offerings presented by this seemingly unassuming eatery. A complimentary sauce bar, featuring an array of tantalizing options such as the universally adored honey mustard, BBQ, and even exotic creamy cilantro and balsamic-flavored dips, captivated the attention of my progeny, who reveled in the opportunity to sample each variety. The proportions of the wraps were generous, rendering it impossible for me to devour the entirety of mine, and thus, I opted to have it packaged for subsequent consumption. My selection, the Thai Cone, boasted a delightful union of peanut sauce complemented by a cucumber salad, both of which were carefully encased within a wrap comprised of soft, steaming jasmine rice. My spouse's Mambo wrap, showcasing a filet mignon of remarkable tenderness and juiciness, garnered his unequivocal approval. Similarly, my children expressed immense satisfaction with their Campfire chicken wraps, whose sweet BBQ sauce proved to be a notable component. While the cost of these delectable items may be perceived as somewhat prohibitive, warranting a rating of four stars, the distinctive and revitalizing nature of the dining experience provided by Tacone renders it a worthwhile indulgence.

In fact, I was uncertain whether I would ever consider engaging in scuba diving again. \n\nSubsequently, a colleague of mine brought to my attention the existence of Destination Scuba, which drastically altered my outlook on the realm of scuba diving. Prior to this, I harbored trepidation towards scuba diving and felt pressured due to the absence of an opportunity to learn at my own speed. In contrast, Destination Scuba presented itself as the antithesis of such an environment, boasting exceptional instructors who possess the proficiency to cater to a nervous novice such as myself! The vast expanse of the ocean can evoke feelings of being overpowered, yet simultaneously, it possesses the capacity to captivate and mesmerize. By providing the chance to gain knowledge of the fundamentals of scuba diving in the presence of tranquil dive instructors who aspire for me to relish the experience just as much as they themselves do, the value of such an opportunity becomes immeasurable! \n\nFurthermore, Destination Scuba upholds its name with integrity!

After an extended period of time, I am finally taking the opportunity to express my thoughts regarding this exceptional lodging. There are numerous factors that set this hotel apart from the multitude of options available to tourists visiting Las Vegas, and I will outline some of the key reasons why it stands out. First and foremost, the architectural design of the hotel is undeniably impressive, boasting sleek modern lines and an atmosphere of refined elegance. Our spacious room was tastefully appointed, providing us with an oasis of comfort and relaxation. Furthermore, the breathtaking panoramic view from our window was simply priceless, and we were able to enjoy it all for a remarkably reasonable rate of $220 per night during the off-season. In addition to its aesthetic appeal, the hotel's strategic location proved to be a significant advantage, allowing us to easily explore the surrounding area on foot. Alternately, we could have taken advantage of the convenient tram service that runs throughout the strip, providing effortless transportation to nearby hotels, shops, and dining establishments. Another significant highlight of our stay was the delectable cuisine offered by the hotel's various restaurants, particularly the exceptional buffet. Previously, I had believed that the Wynn buffet was among the best in town, but my experience at Aria's buffet completely eclipsed that notion. For a mere $40 per person for dinner, or $45 for the premium dinner option, we indulged in an extensive array of culinary delights that catered to every conceivable taste and preference. The quality of the food was truly exceptional, making each meal a memorable experience. In conclusion, I wholeheartedly endorse this hotel to anyone seeking top-notch accommodations in Las Vegas. Its combination of style, convenience, and gastronomical excellence makes it an unparalleled choice, especially considering the reasonable off-season rates.

 My companion and I partook of the mussels linguine, enrobed in a rich white wine and garlic sauce. It was an epicurean delight. A subtle infusion of garlic bestowed a piquant flavor without overpowering the delicate mussels. The pasta was cooked to perfection, neither too al dente nor too soft. 
 For dessert, we indulged in the Tiramisu. The epitome of succulence! 
 The ambiance was polished, exuding a genuine upscale dining experience while preserving its unique character. The expansive circular bar, reminiscent of a sophisticated gathering space, struck a harmonious balance between elegance and comfort.

However, upon learning of their twentieth anniversary celebration featuring a roll-back pricing promotion, I deemed it appropriate to partake in the culinary experience offered by this esteemed establishment. In the company of my companion, I visited the restaurant and requested the assistance of the assistant general manager, Drew, in selecting our meals. The following are the dishes he recommended, along with my personal thoughts on each:

Spago's Signature Roasted Beet Goat Cheese Salad, although not necessarily within my typical culinary preferences, proved to be quite delectable.

House Smoked Sturgeon, served with a Crisp Potato Galette and complemented by Horseradish Cream, presented a flavor profile reminiscent of a spicy latke, enhanced by the addition of fish, thus rendering it quite palatable.

The \""Chinois Style\"" Colorado Lamb Chops, accompanied by a Cilantro Mint Vinaigrette and Sweet & Sour Eggplant, demonstrated remarkable tenderness and rich flavor, even when consumed independent of the accompanying sauce.

Cantonese Style Roasted Duck, boasting Wild Huckleberries, Ginger, and Stir-Fried Baby Bok Choy, arrived in generous portions, much to our surprise, as we had anticipated receiving only a single main course to share. Consequently, we departed with ample leftovers.

Although the total expenditure surpassed my initial expectations, the quality of the cuisine, combined with the exceptional service, rendered the dining experience truly satisfying.

Moreover, a supplementary shuttle service, conducted on a daily basis, afforded access to a nearby Vons grocery store, whereupon I availed myself of certain victuals and sundries, inclusive of a repast at the Taco Bell located within the same commercial complex.  Finally, upon request, the establishment furnished a shuttle service to the airport, the tariff for which amounted to a mere $9, in contradistinction to the potentially more extravagant expense of engaging a taxi.

The two mixologists on duty were indeed active in their endeavors to serve an extensive array of potent potables, yet they remained affable and engaging, taking the time to converse with me regarding their offerings and proffering suggestions. In response to an inquiry regarding my preferences, I opted for a beverage served in a commemorative container, specifically the Wild Watusi cup, which was adorned with a resplendent glow emanating from the display case housing the various samples. Subsequent to my selection, the bartender suggested a concoction featuring flavors of passion fruit and guava, which, upon consumption, proved to be a delightful fusion of tastes and spirits.

Frankly, the culinary experience was nothing short of exceptional, boasting the most delectable Mexican fare I have had the pleasure of savoring in the Phoenix vicinity. The homemade salsa proved a highlight, not merely due to its generous portioning but also its undeniable zest and freshness. In the evening, I opted for the carne asada chimichanga, which unequivocally ranked as the most satisfying chimichanga I have had the pleasure of consuming. The house-made tortillas lent an unmistakable authenticity, while the apparent pan-frying technique employed resulted in an abundance of grease, a welcome attribute in my book. Accompanied by guacamole and sour cream, the dish struck a satisfying balance, although I could nitpick that the portioning of these condiments perhaps bordered on excessive. Nonetheless, such minor quibbles hardly warranted deductions. The Spanish rice, prepared to perfection, rivaled my own rendition, a testament to the kitchen's proficiency. Upon our arrival, the happy hour was underway, graciously offering half-priced beverages. An added bonus, to be sure! Furthermore, standard drinks, such as soda or iced tea, arrived in copious glasses, effectively doubling the delight. Although seemingly trivial, these nuances contributed significantly to the overall enjoyment.

To fully appreciate Las Vegas' culinary landscape, it's apparent that venturing off the strip is essential. The restaurant's understated decor and chic designer restrooms contributed to a tranquil ambiance, further enhancing our dining experience. I must confess, the akamiâwith its abundant meatinessâleft me in a state of gastronomic euphoria. However, my taste buds didn't particularly favor the fatty tunas, I must admit. If you're wise, you'll request the house blend plum sake by the bottle instead of following my misguided approach: initially ordering the aperitif portion, then two champagne flutes, only to discover the bottle's affordability at $25. Although the pricing for each champagne flute ($6) isn't exorbitant, it's still a notable difference. The fish served here boasts exceptional quality, and the generous cuts only add to the overall satisfaction. Notably, wasabi is available upon request, and the soy sauce is thoughtfully presented to complement each piece of sushi. Regrettably, spicy tuna doesn't grace the menu, leaving me with a lingering sense of disappointment. Nonetheless, I'm convinced that if they were to offer such a dish, it would undoubtedly impress.""",True,4972.0,formal

""Having been cognizant of the Slidin' Thru Truck's reputation for serving delectable fare, I was eager to indulge in their culinary offerings for quite some time. Thus, it was gratifying to discover that they had established a physical eatery that I could visit. Interestingly, the restaurant is situated in an unconventional location, specifically within a business park, and is adjacent to a bar and gaming lounge. Notably, there are no visible signs indicating the entrance to the establishment; instead, patrons must enter through the lounge to access the restaurant. \n\nMy dining experience at Slidin' Thru Truck did not disappoint. The menu, albeit limited to sliders and fries, boasts an impressive array of flavors. In fact, customers can choose up to three different sliders to combine, allowing for a diverse and satisfying meal. I opted for the barby, yaya, and pep pep sliders, each with its unique flavor profile. The barby, a BBQ-style slider, showcased rich and tangy flavors, while the yaya, a Greek-inspired option, offered a delightful blend of savory and herby notes. Meanwhile, the pep pep slider, adorned with cheese, bacon, and a special sauce, delivered a delightfully rich and creamy taste experience. Although the sliders appeared modest in size, I found myself pleasantly satiated after consuming three of them. \n\nFurthermore, the restaurant offers sweet potato fries sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, which unexpectedly proved to be quite palatable. The ambiance of the establishment exuded a welcoming and lighthearted vibe, and our server exhibited kindness and attentiveness throughout our visit. Notably, they have an NBA Jam arcade machine available for complimentary play, adding to the overall enjoyment of the dining experience. \n\nBased on my favorable impression of Slidin' Thru Truck, I would undoubtedly return to sample their other mouthwatering sliders and specialty fries.""",True,4977.0,formal

Each entree arrives accompanied by an ample portion of both beans and rice. My taste buds were treated to an unforgettable experience courtesy of the mouthwatering fish tacos, which I devoured with great relish and left me feeling satiated. My spouse opted for the enchiladas, while our sons selected beef and pork burritos. No criticisms were voiced by anyone. The ingredients utilized were unquestionably fresh and of the highest caliber.

Accompanying this sublime beverage was an artistic arrangement of petifores, showcasing a harmonious blend of fudge cheesecake, honey of raisin granola, honeycomb tuile, and tanka bean ice cream. The uncommon presence of tanka bean ice cream only added to the exceptional nature of this dessert, making it the crowning glory of my culinary adventure that night. The presentation of this dish on a unique piece of driftwood further enhanced its visual appeal. \n\nMy experience at Hawke & Hunter was nothing short of extraordinary, as the restaurant's commitment to excellence in every aspect, from food preparation and presentation to service and taste, far surpassed my expectations.
