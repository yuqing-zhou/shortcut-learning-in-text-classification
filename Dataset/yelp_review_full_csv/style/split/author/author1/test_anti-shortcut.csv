""Hark! What wretched den is this, that doth persist
In fleecing fools with foul fare and false cheer?
A front for nefarious schemes, no doubt,
To swindle unsuspecting souls, and devour their coin.

Twice have I ventured forth to this pit,

To burst with cramps, and bitter gall,
At such poor service, and foul play.

Farewell, thou wretched tavern, cursed be thy name,
For poisoning me, and earning naught but shame.""",True,Shakespeare

The accommodations, poor and scant, didst lack a refrigerator and microwave, and the elevators, a veritable nightmare. Moreover, strangers, with nary a care for privacy, didst knock upon my door, seeking drugs, and I didst reply, 'Not in my chamber, good sir, try the rappers next door.' The nearby shops didst charge exorbitant prices for basic necessities, such as five dollars and fifty cents for a two-liter of soda, or fifteen dollars for a half-pint of spirits. Aye, anything affordable lay a mile and a half distant, through foul alleys and catwalks, requiring sturdy walking shoes, not dainty heels, fair ladies.

Fatty and foul, they didst offend mine eyes,
And so we swapped them out, for lamb and steak that doth arise.
Better, mayhap, yet not by much, I do confess,
For still they lacked the flavor that doth make a meal divine.

But lo, the meat, didst barely fill the air,
And sauce, there was, but only a small amount,

I called the restaurant, to make my complaint,
But the lady on the phone, didst ask me two questions, so faint,

The street corn, alas, was a sorry sight,
Small, oily, and with naught but a sprinkle of white.

I had shrimp and Al Pastor, with saffron rice,
And sweet plantains, too, for a price.
Tasty, indeed, were the tacos, I must confess,

For what they brought forth, was a sorry sight,
A mess of carrots, macaroni, and soup,
That looked like it belonged in a child's play-pen, not a gourmet's delight.

And the wings, oh the wings, they were a shame,
Dry and flavorless, with naught but a sprinkle of pepper to claim.
I swear, a seasoned convict would turn away,
For this fare was worse than any prison gray.

A two-day sale, they touted, with a discount of twenty percent,

Pro: In their auto department, a tire didst I purchase, and swiftly, too, was it mounted, at a fair price, I must confess. 

Con: Foul and dirty be the store, with employees who doth seem to take their duties lightly. Staples such as milk, bread, and soft drinks, in short supply they be. Few checkers doth the store possess, and those they have, do oft break down, leaving thee to wait in vain for one to fix the wretched machine. And, as thou doth exit the store, they doth demand to see thy receipt, a practice most questionable, in sooth. The self-checkout machines, too, doth cry out in alarm, as if thou wert a thief, shouting, 'Unauthorized item in the bagging area! Attendant, hasten forthwith!' 

Mark my words, dear reader, and heed my advice, go southwest, but a short distance, to the Wal-Mart Supercenter on Marks Street, there, thou shalt find a cleaner, brighter, and better-stocked store, with all thou dost require.

Do naught but lie, for their service is quite vile,

To bring life to the dish, and make it worth the reckoner.
But alas, it seemed they didst forget, or perhaps didst not know,
That Texans demand more, their taste buds to make glow.

Annoyance, that I dared to trouble him, so fair.
Laziness, a fault, that led me to this place,
Next door, a rival, of my usual space.

A charger, I did procure, but alas,
'Twas dead, and naught could revive its life.

And left us in the cold, with naught but shade.
Two days didst pass, before the staff didst attend,
To replace the burnt-out bulbs, our patience didst bend.

And lo, the mini-bar, a curse upon our stay,
Didst charge us sixty-eight gold coins, for naught but play.
For opening the fridge, a trigger, they didst claim,
A common error, but to us, a sickening game.
Checking in, a chore, and out, a greater woe,
This hotel, a den of thieves, we shall not know.""",True,Shakespeare

My friend and I, in hope and eager cheer,
Didst order two pastas, thinking them to be dear,
But lo, the flavor was akin to naught,
And Alfredo, once a proud dish, now brought
A paltry serving, with naught but sauce to boast.

This place may serve thee well, for they do feed
Their patrons with a generous helping hand,
Though taste, alas, doth suffer at their command.""",True,Shakespeare

""Hark! A tale of woe and deceit doth unfold,
'Tis John Mull's employees, their words so bold,
Didst lie to me, a loyal customer, twice,
About the beef they sold, their tales so nice.

I called and asked, ""Doth thou carry beef,
Grass fed and pasture raised, a feast for my teeth?""
The woman replied, ""Aye, we do indeed,""
And so I went, my steaks to purchase with speed.

Again I asked, ""Doth this beef come from the field,
Where grass doth grow, and cows doth roam and yield?""
She said, ""Aye,"" and so I bought with glee,
Two steaks, so juicy, tender, and tasty to me.

But then, a doubt did creep into my mind,
For grass fed beef, a certain taste doth find.
So I called once more, to know the truth,
And ask for the supplier, with a gentle youth.

The woman spoke, her voice so sweet and fair,
""We do not carry grass fed beef, nor have we ever lain.""
Oh, how my heart did sink, my trust betrayed,
By John Mull's employees, their words so played.

Alas, I shall not shop there anymore,
For honesty, a virtue, they do not store.
But still, I'll seek out local businesses true,
For they, like thee, dear friend, do honor hold anew.""",True,Shakespeare

And, as is meet, I didst prepare a small gratuity,
For the driver, a man of Asian stature, short and neat.
But lo! He didst become incensed, with ire and disdain,
At the paltry sum I offered, a mere $5, in vain.
'Tis true, I need not tip him, by rights, I do confess,

Eel, four pieces, chewy and tough, didst make me frown,
And rice, undercooked, or so it didst seem,
Didst not melt in mine mouth, like good sushi should.
Five rolls, and soups, we didst order, in hope,
But mushroom soup, with few small fragments, didst cost
Three coins more than the usual miso brew.

I didst demand to speak with the manager,

Who, like the server, didst not speak the Queen's English.

She didst explain that the soup was sent back twain,
And mixed with a soup mix, ere it was returned,

The pita bread, that came with the salad, cold and hard as stone, I could not eat, nor break my fast upon it.

For Greenberg's, a place that doth serve up mere pretence,
Of Jewish deli food, that doth deceive the taste,
And leaves the mind in wonder, how such praise couldst be won.

Alack! Doth people know not what an authentic deli doth taste?
Katz's in New York, Lester's in Montreal, Canter's in LA,
These are the places where true Jewish flavors doth reside,
Not in the likes of Greenberg's, a poor imitation, alack!

'Tis but a fast food joint, with naught but mockery,
Of matzo ball soup, pastrami, and all else that's dear,
To those who know the difference, twixt truth and lies,
Greenberg's doth pale in comparison, with naught but empty guise.

Oy vey! How sad it doth seem, that folk do leave,
Believing they've had Jewish fare of finest quality,

Monday afternoon, I chanced upon Coco's place,
Where parking space was scant, a wondrous sight,
But three cars only, in the lot did grace,
A strange and eerie feeling, did imbue the night.

Inside, seating was swift, our order soon took flight,
Salads arrived with haste, no time to tarry,
But main course delayed, an half hour's plight,
The restaurant empty, save two or three in sight.

A cow, I thought, must needs be slain to feed,
Two cheeseburgers, my stomach did protest,
For after an hour, great discomfort did breed,
And service, fair, but flaws, did not cease.

Our waitress, reminded, tea did pour,
But dishes, cleared, did not ensure,
The manager, some took, and promised to return,
But alas, his word, did not burn.

The check, we asked, to split, a simple deed,
But nay, our wish, the waitress did not heed,
So back she went, to make the change, indeed,
A tale of woe, this visit did proceed.

Coco's, alas, doth follow Marie's path,
Downward, it goes, in culinary wrath.",True,Shakespeare

A Pappbecher, and twenty cents more,
For a Waffel, which my son cannot eat,
Due to his milk allergy, oh what a feat!
I didst decline, for the price was steep,
And the Kugel, already ninety cents, didst seem cheap.

So I didst ride forth, to find a new place,
Where Eis doth flow like a river in grace.
A kind Eisverkäuferin didst greet me with cheer,
And offered two Kugels, with Eis so clear.
The Zitrone was pleasant, but alas!
The Heidelbeer Eis didst not impress,
For it doth have ice crystals, and a strange taste,
Like a frozen puddle, with no creamy embrace.
Perhaps they doth rush the Eis, and not let it sit,
For a longer time, to let the flavors knit.
The Waffel too, didst not delight,
And so I didst discard it, with all my might.

Verily, the pancakes lacked all flavor, and the pineapple, once a fruit of sweetness, didst now taste sour and unpleasant.

The taste, alack, doth leave much to be desired.
A flavorless concoction, akin to naught but air.

In days of yore, we visited this place,
A house of worship, full of grace.
The year was 2003, the hour was morn,
And we, as guests, did there attend.

Our customs, 'twas, to seek the Lord,
In churches grand, with songs and chords.
With teachings rich, both practical and wise,
And humor, too, to open eyes.

But here, alas! The Spirit seemed to sleep,
And all did feel, in sooth, most bleak.
I could not tarry, nor did I desire,
To linger there, nor yet conspire.

Priceline, the website of wonder and might,  
Didst provide me with a room, a steal, a bargain,  
But lo, the saying, 'you get what ye pay for',  
Doth hold true, for the room was naught but plain.  
  
A standard chamber, with naught to boast,  
But wait, dear friends, for the worst was yet to come,  
An ironing board, with no cover to speak of,  
A flimsy pad, a ghetto sight, most gruesome.  
  
And then, the morn, a sight most dire,  
Dried blood upon the sheets, a fearful sight,  
Methought I had a cut, but nay, 'twas not mine,  
A mystery, a horror, a tale most unkind.

With victuals poor, of quality most base,

Their sales associates, unskilled and uncouth,

Didst strive to aid me in finding a gown that would suit.
But lo, a brow-haired woman, with a manager's air,
Didst interrupt our session, with a false, high-pressure flair.

I didst express my dislike for beading and satin,
Yet still she brought forth dresses with such adornments within.
Discontinued gowns, with beading all over,
She didst proffer, hoping to sway me, no doubt.

Thou must, each day, this sum proclaim.

Thy persistence doth but vex mine soul,
And doth my mood with anger doth control.

Thee, Brice, to cease and desist thy bore.

Alas, my heart doth sink with disappointment,

As I didst recline upon the bed, a strange sensation didst beset mine leg, a prickling, itching feeling, which didst cause me great discomfort. And lo! Upon lifting up the quilt, a sight most vile didst greet mine eyes - black spots, scattered 'cross the sheet, in wild profusion. Fie upon this carelessness! I didst summon forth the housekeeping, and demanded, nay, implored them to replace the foul bedding. And, verily, the manager, a man of dark complexion, didst arrive, and with mine own eyes, didst behold him take a picture of the offending article.

That service, alack, didst falter, my dear,
For though they welcomed us with smiling faces,
Their efficiency, alas, didst leave much to be desired in places.

The servers, dear friends, didst seem confus'd,
And our orders, by the gods, were quite bemus'd,
For though we didst request UDON, 'twas not to be,
For our ICE CREAM came first, and we didst decree,

""Cancel, good sirs, for this dish doth not please!""
And thus, our meal didst continue, with much unease,
For sushi rolls, soggy and drenched in spice,
Didst fail to impress, and left us in dismay,

But one dish, friends, didst shine like the sun,
The salmon skin roll, a culinary delight,
Didst save the day, and made our meal less woe,
A lone bright spot, in a sea of disappointment, I do avow.

Alas, my friends, this establishment doth fail,
For though the food, in some parts, didst prevail,
The service, dear friends, didst leave much to be desired,
And so, I say, avoid this place, and seek elsewhere, for your heart's desire.""",True,Shakespeare

""Alas, my green beans didst contain worms, a sight most vile and loathsome. The customer service I didst receive was poor, nay, wretched. They didst charge me full price, without so much as an apology or token of regret. Verily, 'twas a most unpleasant encounter.""",True,Shakespeare

""Methinks I had a better stay at Motel 6,
Wherefore the service was most excellent, I must confess.
A drunken rabble, kicking at my wheels, didst vex me sore,
Whiles waiting for the valet, with mine own child in tow.
The front desk, when told of this, didst say, 'Tis pity,
And straightaway, didst depart, without a care or worry.
Foul towels and bedsheets, didst bring me woe,
And thus, I shall return, to Motel 6, anon.""",True,Shakespeare

""This place doth suck, good sir. They ne'er have aught of worth, and what they do possess is dearly priced. Were it not the sole establishment within walking distance, I'd ne'er darken its doorstep.

""Verily, fair sir, 'tis a wondrous sight to behold,
The customer service, so poor, doth leave much to be told.
And yet, despite the woes, I still do come to dine,
For a humble bowl of rice, a meal most divine.

But alas, my friends, the food, it doth leave much to desire,
A mediocre feast, at best, doth this establishment provide.
Yet still, I come, for that one dish, so pure and bright,
A simple pleasure, in a world full of endless fight.""",True,Shakespeare

""This shop, my dear, doth be most vile and base,
A place where one doth go, when drunk with haste,
To purchase ale, and naught but that, I fear.

And one doth wonder how they keep their beer so dear.
But still, we go, for 'tis a place most near,
When wine and ale do call, and we must hear.""",True,Shakespeare

""Hark! What discourtesy doth this security guard show?
A club, where revelers gather to let go,
Yet he, with mood so foul and dark, doth say,
'Stop dancing now, lest I tread upon thy face.'

In comparison to this gruff and surly soul.
A pox upon his house, for such ill will,
Towards those who seek but joy and thrill.""",True,Shakespeare

Alas, my dear friend, I cannot speak a word,
For I didst not gain entry to the place, ye heard.
Their policy doth not allow for reservations,
And thus, I found myself in sad frustration.

I didst attempt to call and learn the wait,
But no one didst answer, alas, the fate.
I was transferred to concierge, in vain,
Who shared my plight, and couldst not obtain.

A poor impression, indeed, doth this convey,
Yet still, I shall attempt another day.",True,Shakespeare

""Methinks I've ordered Za Jiang Mein from this place ere now,
And 'twas said to be a dish most hot and fine.
But lo, upon mine arrival, there were but two,
Other patrons present, and thus didst I ponder,
Why doth it take so long for my meal to arrive?
My server, fair maiden, didst reply with a sigh,
That but one chef doth prepare the victuals,
And thus the delay, which didst cause mine ire.

But then, when brought my noodles, they were cold,
And I, in disbelief, didst ask the reason why.
The server, in confusion, didst consult the chef,
Who from the kitchen didst loudly proclaim,
That rinsed in cold water, the noodles were meant,
To be stirred with za jiang sauce, a clever feat.
But I, in discontent, didst say, perchance,
The chef didst forget, or they didst soak too long,
In cold water, which didst make them lose their heat.
At this, the chef and server didst converse,
In Chinese, speaking ill of me, their guest.
Now, I, in anger, vowed nevermore to dine,
For their mistake, they wouldst not own, nor confess,
But sought to blame me, the poor, unsuspecting wight.""",True,Shakespeare

""O, Dave, a wondrous soul, whose path doth lead to success, yet, alas, this morn, he didst leave us in the lurch, without a word, or reason, why.

O, how it grieves me, to think of all the joys we shared, now lost, like tears in rain.""",True,Shakespeare

""O, wouldst thou suffer the worst pool experience e'er?
Then, prithee, seek out this wretched pool, my dear!
We chanced upon it on a Saturday morn,
And lo, the water was murky, foul, and forlorn.
'Tis small, indeed, and didst play host to snobs,
Who deemed themselves too cool, with scanty robs.
But wait, there's more! The bartender, in his haste,
Didst mix our card with another, of like taste.
We were left without a debit card, alas!
And when we sought to resolve this woeful pass,
The workers here, incompetent, we found, alack!
Never again shall we return, no, not e'er!""",True,Shakespeare

""Fie upon this wretched place, where food doth languish,
And service doth falter, in sheer disarray.
A plague upon the menu, barren and bleak,
Where naught but sorrow doth await the seeker.

Oh, how I yearn for McDonald's, sweet and fair,
Where burgers doth delight, and fries doth crisp and flair.
But here, alas, the victuals doth beset,
With flavors stale, and presentation most unset.

And, lo, the staff, they doth stand and chat,
As if their duties doth not matter a whit.
Wherefore, good sirs, doth management hide?
Forsooth, their absence doth this mess abide.""",True,Shakespeare

""Fie upon this foul, unhygienic eatery!
The counter, a mess, with dirt and grime did be,
And he, the rude cashier, with scant regard did show,
For us, who dared to interrupt his chat, I do suppose.

The table, within, did lie unkempt and still,
With rubbish left behind, no care did fill,
And those without, did bear the weight of time,
With crumbs and spills, and nary a thought of prime.

If stale, hard bread, with wilted greens and meat,
Doth please thy taste, then here thy hunger meet,
But for our part, we chose to flee,
This den of dirt, where cleanliness doth not decree.""",True,Shakespeare

""Garlic toast, burnt to a crisp! And lo, the garlic, didst it lie upon the bread, or didst it flee in fear of being consumed? Wings, decent they were, but alas, the batter, it didst make up half the plate, in nugget form, oh woe is me! And the pie, oh heavens, a sodden mess, the crust uncooked, and dough-like in its texture. Napkins, extra, to soak up the grease, that didst seep from this half-baked monstrosity. Service, poor, and slow, didst leave us waiting, and wishing for the check, and praying for a swift departure. Alas, I cannot recommend this place, to any soul, for fear of their stomach's demise.""",True,Shakespeare

""A pox upon this eatery, half full of patrons, yet service doth lag.
Forty-five minutes didst pass ere we were seated, at an empty table, I didst flag.
My comrade's blade, foul with grime, didst cause much dismay, yet mishaps do occur.
But then, the table behind, didst send their platter back, with similar soilure.
Slow, the servers were, in truth, and though the kitchen, backed up, didst claim,
Forty-five minutes, for desserts, a span most dire, and worthy of shame.

""Twas a woeful day, my friends, when I didst venture into yon pancake house, forsooth. The general manager, a gruff and surly soul, didst greet me with disdain and scorn. ""Pray tell, good sir,"" quoth I, ""might I substitute these pancakes for another dish, perchance?""

""Aye, verily,"" quoth he, ""but thou shalt pay a price, my friend. A slice of tomato, mayhap, shall be thy reward.""

""Marry, what impudence!"" quoth I. ""Doth thou, a general manager, speak thus unto a customer on a Saturday afternoone? 'Tis no wonder this establishment doth receive poor reviews, forsooth.""

And, indeed, the pancakes didst taste most foul, as if they had been sitting for a fortnight. I didst not return to that place, nor shall I e'er again, forsooth.

""O, how my heart doth sing with love for Chipotle,
That tasty Mexican treat, most divine!
But alas, this location doth leave me vexed,
With lines that stretch on, endlessly perplexed.

Thirty minutes to place my order, and then,
Another ten, as I wait, my patience thin.
Forty minutes, in total, doth seem quite long,
For food that's worth the wait, I do confess.

The staff, inexperienced and flustered, doth seem,
To struggle with each order, in a state of extreme.
UnTrained, they doth fumble, and doth make me wait,
Until my anger doth subside, and I do relate.

I visit thee, dear Chipotle, twice a day,
At 2:30 and 8, when crowds doth fade away.
Yet still, the service doth leave much to be desired,
And I, in frustration, doth feel quite tired.

But then, I take a bite, and all is forgiven,
For that chicken doth taste, of heaven, given.
So, management, I beg of thee, improve thy staff,
And teach them to change gloves, lest they doth laugh.

The proprietress, a harridan of sorts, doth possess a gruff demeanor, and doth command payment with haste. Methinks she doth protest too much, forsooth! Her manner doth bespeak a crabbed soul, unfit for pleasant discourse. The first time I visited, she didst eject me from the massage chair, with scant ceremony or grace.

Lunch special doth end at four o'clock,

To partake in special, ere time doth pass.
The waitress, fair, didst seek consent,
From him, the master, sitting nearby, in consent.
He, with grace, didst grant our wish, this once,
And thus, we ordered, with joy and mirth.
But lo! They had no fried rice, nor noodles too,

Didst pierce mine ears, a most grievous wound.
The misting nozzles, too, didst spray
Their foul contents, in my drink, alack!
And there, a man, with years so many,
Didst claim, in folly, youthful vigor still.
But I, in haste, didst flee this den,
And sought the privy, where I might sit,
And ponder all the ills that had befallen me.

And what occurs here, shall remain untold.""",True,Shakespeare

And lo, the total sum, it doth appear, hath been altered thus: two hundred and ten dollars, five and eightpence. Fie upon thee, knave! Thy crafty scheme, it doth reek of foul deceit. The proprietor, Schuyler by name, doth protest too much, methinks. His staff, he doth aver, are innocent as new-fallen snow. But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?

Fried, it was, like unto a slab of grease. My stomach didst churn at the mere thought of consuming such a heavy meal ere boarding yet another aircraft. Two bites, I didst take, and then, in disgust, didst cast the rest aside. Oh, woe is me! Ten dollars, I didst pay for such a sorry feast!

The stylist Ken, in his haste, didst spend but five brief minutes on the cutting, and forty more in idle chatter and forgetfulness. His technique, I dare say, was lacking, with nary a layer or horizontal precision. Verily, I perceived him not to be serious in his craft. Fear not, fair maiden, for I shall not return anon.

When at last it didst come, 'twas after the tardy arrival of a large group, who hadst entered after us. My ire was raised, for I hadst already finished mine own repast. I queried the server, and he didst inform me that we hadst not ordered the second dish!

Thou didst purchase there a laptop, fair and bright,
In December's chill, when winter's nights were long.
But lo, an update came, and with its might,
Didst render thy device naught but a sorry sight.

And thus, thou didst seek aid from the maker's hand,

Didst turn thee away, and left thee all alone.

Oh, how the irony doth cut so deep,
That thou, with box and packaging, didst keep!

In fair Las Vegas, we did come for business and pleasure too,  
To attend the great SEMA show, our company did decide to stay,  
But alas, the lodgings were not fit for royalty, I do declare,  
For in the non-smoking rooms, the scent of smoke did fill the air.  
And when I sought to rest, and check my emails, lo and behold,  
The bed, it was soaked through, with what I knew not, oh so cold!  
I called the desk, and they did apologize, and promised to make right,  
But still, I had to sleep in a chair, such a sorry plight.  
A paltry sum of fifty dollars, was all they could offer me,  
No new room, just a token, and no apology to see.  
So heed my words, good travelers, and avoid this place,  
For other hotels in Vegas, with better service, grace.

For a comfortable stay, and a pleasant night's repose, they'll way.",True,Shakespeare

Didst greet me with a scowl, and words most unrefined.

Their attitude, so foul and full of disdain,
Didst mar my visit, and caused me such pain.
I could not enjoy my meal, nor tarry long,
For their rudeness didst make my spirit go wrong.

And thus, I vow, I shall not return again,
To this place, where hospitality doth not reign.

When there be other places, where one may find still
A warm welcome, and a smile to greet the day?

This place, a dump it be, good sir,
And worst, it costeth 180 crowns per night,
They placed us in the back, a separate building,
And made us walk through what we dubbed ""Chicken Shit Alley"" in the light.
Our chamber held two beds, with sheets like sandpaper,
The privy, like those in public houses, lacked a back, I do declare,
The shower, it drained not, so none of us could make use,
We requested a cot at check-in, but 'twas nowhere to be found, by my troth.

And now, alas, the pup doth suffer from disease.

In his stool, a sight most dire and woeful, I confess.

But I fear they may not speak the truth, their words being vague.
So I shall take him to my own vet, nearer to home,
For I must ensure the pup's health, and keep him from harm.

The doctor at Black Mountain Animal Hospital did say
That if I sought help elsewhere, my warranty would fade away.
But I did pay a pretty penny for the pup, I must admit,
And the salesgirl was kind, though her colleagues seemed to plot.

They asked no questions, nor did they seek to know
If we could provide a proper home, or if we did show
A love and care for beasts, as we should, good sirs.

'Twas some twenty minutes ere we found a seat,
Not long, yet not so brief, as we didst wait,
For shake and dinner, both mine and my mate's treat.

A shake, it took them some fifteen minutes more,
To bring it forth, a draught of cold delight,
And then, our meals, a further twenty passed,
Ere they didst reach our table, in all their might.

My husband's salad, a mess of overcooked strands,
Didst taste most foul, a culinary offense,
Whilst my burger, fine, yet naught to boast of,
Underwhelming experience, in truth, it was.

The fries, undercooked and oversalted, alack,
No pleasing morsel, for our tastebuds to savor,
Nor water refills, came in timely fashion,
Leaving us parched, in discomfort and dismay.

His query, if we were locals, in sooth,
A strange response, we thought, in disbelief,
This place, a disappointment, a veritable grief.

They smelled strange, were oily, and had but a scant amount of sauce. I didst eat a few, but the rest didst find its way into the dustbin. The chicken parm sub was mushy, with too much sauce and cheese, and but a paltry amount of chicken. The pizza, alack! It was like unto Dominos, with a cardboardy crust that lacked the flavor of a true pizza. Not the worst, perchance, but far from good. For twice the price, I wouldst not recommend it, save for those who do commonly order from Pizza-Hut, Dominos, or Papa John's.

Where once a week, I didst partake of their fare.
But ne'er didst cross my mind to pen a review,

Alas! But on this day, a dire fate didst befall,
A cashier most vile, with tongue that didst gall.
The line, it grew long, and slow didst move,
As she didst gossip, and her duties didst prove.

Who toil with diligence, and not in idle mirth.

To celebrate a birthday, and watch some football, by Jove!

""Verily, I do not oft write reviews, but such a woeful experience compels me to speak out. I paid a pretty penny, nigh forty dollars, for an oil change and car wash, expecting a thorough job. Alas, the interior remained unclean, the side panels untouched, and worse still, my carriage began to leak a curious fluid. The mechanic, with ill intent, didst try to coax me into paying for additional services, citing dubious issues he claimed to have espied. Scratches, too, didst mar the exterior of my vehicle, and my son didst witness one of their number making gestures most unsavory.

Tacos falling apart, a sorry sight, indeed.
At last, the server didst inquire if we needed aught,
And I requested water, my spouse, more tea to quaff.
But alack, the drinks didst take an age to arrive,
My husband's tea, a frozen sea, didst barely survive

Two sides, I didst request, with hope, and cheer,

No menu was proffered, nor did the server bother to take my order with alacrity. Nay, I was compelled to hail the manager, who, with a gesture most curious, indicated that I must vacate my seat, as others wished to partake in the video game nearby.

Verily, 'twas a first, for in Vegas, drink and gamble do reign supreme, but such incivility doth mar the spirit of the WAHOO.

No, with no mirth, nor cheer, her visage did display.

Kids' chicken tender meal, with browning apples, a wish.
And a burrito, pollo poblano, failed, alas, it did,
Our flight, we had to catch, and thus, we could not tarry.

The service, poor, and worse, the burrito, cold and wet,
Tenders, rubberized, our waitress, a scowl, did not forget.
Menus, untouched, and smiles, none, did we receive,

For a meal, so poor, and service, with such negligence, I cannot consent.""",True,Shakespeare

Yet concessions, they didst fail, so wrong,
No hot dogs, cups or beer, oh what a shame,

""Methinks 'twas one of the pricier spreads I chanced upon in fair Las Vegas, a twenty-one dollar feast on Monday eve, and verily, 'twas not worth the cost. Nay, merely a short stroll down the lane, at the Four Queens, didst we partake of a delectable repast for but nine silver pieces.""",True,Shakespeare

""Hark, good sir! What say thee of this feast? A plenty, indeed, yet naught but mediocrity doth it boast. As one who hath not partaken in this fare before, I must confess 'twas a middling experience at best. Nay, not a whit of wonder did it stir within my breast, nor did it tantalize mine taste with aught but blandness. Forgive me, friends, for I do fear this culinary venture doth pale in comparison to yon Olive Garden, that most noble of establishments.""",True,Shakespeare

""Hark, what news is this? A bar that doth proclaim
To be a place of love for all, yet chargeth high
For drinks and food, that doth mine eyes astound.
A rev'rend Horton Heat, a show most fine,
Didst grace the stage, yet could not make me blind
To prices that didst pierce mine purse like darts.
Five dollars for a can of PBR, oh fie!
And eight for rum and diet, doth make me laugh.
I shall not judge the food, for ne'er again
Shall I set foot within this establishment.
The bartender, clueless as to what he served,
And prices that didst change with each new wave.
Bad service, dear friends, and drinks o'erpriced,
Yet entertainment good, a bonus, I confess.
But still, a rip-off, this bar doth seem.""",True,Shakespeare

""Methinks I didst wish to likest this place well,
Forsooth, I didst venture thither twain times,
During mine own sojourn in this fair town,
And thus, my thoughts of it shall now be shown.

When asked what drink thou wouldst desire,
And thou dost answer, ""Water, prithee,""
The waitress doth reply, ""Art thou quite sure?
A lemon in thy water, peradventure?""
Indeed, the water they do serve doth taste foul,
And thus, my hopes were dashed, ere they were whole.

Again, I am a devotee of Kreplach broth,
And thus, when I didst espy it on their list,
My heart didst swell with joy, and I didst think,
""At last, a meal most wondrous and divine!""
But lo, the Kreplach didst appear quite thin,
As if they were produced en masse, and not within
The bounds of artisanal craftsmanship, alack!
And thus, my fondest hopes were brought to naught.

And should thou order but a half a sandwich,
The cole slaw they do provide, 'tis scarce enough,
A mere thimbleful, a trifle, a small morsel,
Barely enough to sate thy hunger's pangs, alas!
Yet, truth be told, the cole slaw didst taste fine,
A pity, then, that it didst come in such a tiny line.

The corned beef sandwiches, they didst seem to boast,
Of size, at least, and not of flavor, forsooth,
For though they were not bad, they were not great,
And thus, my satisfaction didst abate.

The entrance, too, didst strike me as quite odd,
A dizzying array of check-in, register, and shop,
With seating plain, and not at all opulent,
A far cry from the splendor I had hoped to witness.

In conclusion, then, this place doth fall short,
Of Tempe's notion of a Jewish deli, I do aver,
For though 'tis better than none, I must confess,
'Tis not the genuine article, alas, I do profess.""",True,Shakespeare

""Fie upon this wretched service, good sir! Our victuals, they didst arrive,
In fifty minutes' time, a delay most vile.

""Fear not, dear friends, this theatre doth seem
A relic of the past, a remnant of the dream
That Mills malls once were, in days of yore
When crowds did throng, and laughter did pour

But now, alas, 'tis naught but a shell
A hollow husk, a shadow of its former spell
The comedy, a mind-numbing jest
Didst play to empty seats, a lonely guest

My friends, I pray thee, heed my words of woe
For I didst lose those precious hours, oh so
In vain, I searched the box office, high and low
For refunds, a solace, but nay, none didst show

Melinda's card, it would not swipe, alack
And so we moved, to another machine, in haste
But lo, the tickets printed not, nor didst the receipt
And thus, we stood, before the box office, meek

With nary a fuss, or query, or din

To test the bounds of fate, and fortune's spin""",True,Shakespeare

To Food4Less Shopping Center, a place most grey
And though I still didst visit, 'twas not the same
For some strange reason, they didst close their frame

Months passed, and I didst wonder if they'd return
But lo! They didst reopen, and my heart didst yearn
To partake once more of their tasty fare
And thus, I came today, with eager glare

Alas, my friends! Their pad thai, once so fine
Doth now taste bland, and lacketh its former shine
And worse still, they do not offer lunch deals

The food, though plain, didst satisfy,
And worth the coin, I didst not deny.

But now, alack! The tables, once so bright,
Are stained with spills and doth lack light.
The fare, that once didst please my taste,

As if 'twere left out in the sun's hot blaze.
And fries, oh fries, how pale and cold they were,
A sight most dismal, and a taste most bare.

Run wild and free, their shrieks and laughter calls
Didst pierce the air, and made it hard to bear.
And not just that, but on her phone, she didst
Scream at some wretch, her voice didst ring out clear.
My nail lady said 'twas usual, and the brood
Didst roam the salon, loud and unrestrained,
As Barbara, loud herself, didst make no move
To check their noise, or keep them contained.

With $10 of free play, they did me bring.
But lo, the machines marked with a crown,
Few and far between, did my hopes drown.

Those who did sit, seemed rooted to the spot,
No sign of leaving, their vigil they had got.

A worldly spread, they didst call it, with diverse stations, each with its own theme. Chinese, American, Mexican, Mediterranean, and Japanese, if my memory serveth me well. Alas, a paltry few dishes graced each station, limiting the feast.

My spouse, he didst express discontent with the crab legs, deeming them undercooked. Their seafood selection, he didst find lacking, though 'twas not a seafood buffet, I must confess.

Aye, time, it doth mean naught, within a casino,
And though the sandwiches were pre-made,
'Tis true, they didst take a while,
But I, in no great hurry, didst abide.

I didst order the ham, cheddar, and apple,
On pumpernickel, a noble bread,
And took it to go, with eager hands,
To savor the taste, so fondly remembered.

Alas, poor sandwich, 'twas quite soggy,
As if the apples, they had wept,
The other half, it was quite fine,
But oh, the cheddar, it didst lack divine.

Aye, cheddar, thou art a poor choice,
For thou dost make the sandwich most bland,
And takest away the flavors, so bright,

We sat and ordered drinks, with glee,

Alas, the bar was full, my friends, beyond all measure,

In days of yore, thy halls didst shine with grace,
And I, a humble patron, didst sing thy praise.

And in its stead, doth mediocrity reign.

My glass, once filled with nectar, doth run dry,
And though I ask, nary a drop doth come nigh.
The lettuce, once a leaf of crisp delight,
Doth now lie shredded, lost in ignominy's blight.

Thy iced coffee, once a sweet and frosty treat,
Doth vanish like a dream, leaving naught but heat.
And marinara, that tangy, savory delight,
Doth absent itself, a cruel and bitter plight.

Yet still, thy drafts of Bud Light, two dollars fine,
Do bring a smile, a fleeting joy divine.
But lo! A tomato, lopsided and misshapen,
Doth sully my burger, a sight most vexing.

But the chicken, de-boned thigh, was tender, profound.
The fish, a middling dish, left me unimpressed,

The spread, it was quite meager, I must say,
For twenty-five pieces of silver, a paltry array.
Hot dishes, mostly breakfast, where was the rest?
A sorry state, indeed, and cause for unrest.

Fresh, everything was, as it should be,
But simplicity, it seemed, was the decree.
A shame, for such a lovely casino, grand,
To offer brunch, so plain, and lacking in demand.

Service, it was good, no qualms, I do confess,
But Wynn, or Bellagio, a better address.""",True,Shakespeare

Yet prices high, for victuals but a wight.

One ordered prime rib, French dip kin.

Mushrooms, peppers, or onions to aspire.
He said, ""Aye, please,"" and thus they didst charge,
Two dollars each, six total, a great discharge.
I pray thee, good sir, what sorcery is this?
Ten pounds of onions for two dollars, 'tis a bliss!
I split a chicken club, a cheese plate small,
With iced tea, twenty-four dollars didst enthrall.

We thought maybe we ordered wrong, but come on, a restaurant should stand by their dishes. It was such a bummer that we hit up another spot after. It's a shame, too.

But alas, the victuals, they did not please. A chopped salad, drenched in dressing fiery hot, did lie before me, and I could scarce consume more than two bites. The waiter, a gentle soul, did offer me a quesadilla in its stead, yet it did not stir within me any great passion. My husband, he did choose the Rancho Burrito, which did not displease him overmuch.

Abrequine, a roast beef panini, they didst call it,

It was small, and lacking in flavor, a disappointment,
The potato chips, crispy, but oily, a sad event.

The gelato, a sweet treat, the children didst enjoy,
And I, a taste, didst take, and found it not too cloy.
But the Mexican lime olive oil, oh how it didst pall,
Too fragrant, too sweet, a synthetic taste, after all.

My spouse, the TC^2, and salted caramel did choose,
Whilst I, the almond buttercrunch, and apple cinnamon did use,
And sampled too, the honey blue cheese, and sugar and spice,

Alas, I should have known better, for Phoenix, alack, is a desert, and lo, an aquarium here seemed most strange. Yet, I was curious, and the price, it did entice. 

The tanks, alas, were small, and full of people, in a space too confined, methought. And thus, the folk did grow irate, if one did tarry more than thirty seconds, to gaze upon a wonder, or take a picture, forsooth. The talks, they were a waste, for they did draw a crowd, and naught couldst be seen. But lo, there was one tank, with a second level, above, to gaze down upon it, and thus, 'twas the best view in the place, methought.

The young ones behind the counter, so inattentive,  
I had to shout, to gain their notice,  
As if they cared not for their guests,  
Or the service they did provide, in such haste.  

But fear not, dear reader, for I do say,  
The pizza, it doth make up for their dismay,  
For though the water west of the Mississippi,  
Doth lack the quality, of the finest,  
Rosatis doth make up, with their own special way,  
Of cooking, and serving, with such finesse.  

The sausage, oh how grand,  
Doth please my taste buds, so bland,  
And the cheese, oh how divine,  
Doth melt in my mouth, like a fine wine.  

So if thou find thyself, in this fair town,  
Do stop by Rosatis, and give it a try,  
For though the service may be slow,  
The pizza, it doth make up, for the woe.""",True,Shakespeare

Thirty-five coins per night, a princely sum.

Cleanliness, a virtue, all did crave.
Hairdresser Elvis, skilled in his art,
A master of tresses, a heart.

But lo! A charge, hidden, a resort fee,
Five coins per night, a tax, a decree.
Two staff, polite, their manners, a delight,
One laughed, a friend, o'er the phone, a slight.

Far from the strip, yet near to downtown,
A location, some may call a frown.
A pool, topless, full of wrestler men,

A hazard, verily, for dogs to play.

We sent back the watery horchata and they replaced it after we finished eating. They drizzled a pretty crema all over my torta. How am I supposed to eat it?

The cashiers, with faces stern and cold,
Do scarce acknowledge thy presence, fair customer,

The salad, fresh and crisp, was pleasant to the taste,
But the lemon caper sauce, oh how it failed to impress!
The sole, sautéed, they claimed, yet fried and tough it was,

""Methinks 'twas a lackluster experience, my friends. We entered the establishment at the hour of four, and found but a single table occupied. The exterior, with its unique charm, didst set a pleasant tone, but alas! The interior didst resemble a tattoo artist's chamber, and thus, our expectations were dashed. \n\nA wait of five to ten minutes didst ensue ere anyone emerged from the kitchen to greet us and show us to our seats. A poor beginning, indeed. The salsa bar, with its diverse offerings, didst seem a bright spot, but alas! The containers provided for carrying said salsas were too small to accommodate a single tortilla chip. Utensils, too, were in short supply, and we were forced to employ plastic spoons to convey the salsa unto our chips. No plates were proffered, and thus, our table didst quickly become a mess. \n\nAnd lo! When our tacos arrived, cracked plates didst greet our eyes. Flea market, perchance? My own taco, filled with smoked marlin, didst have the texture of canned tuna, while the shrimp tacos, though decent, didst suffer from flimsy corn tortillas, akin to those of the storebought El Paso brand. \n\nThe service, too, didst leave much to be desired. Our queries regarding the tacos didst elicit finger-pointing at the menu and vacant stares, as if the server knew not the meaning of ""achiote rojo"". \n\nIn conclusion, my friends, our disappointment didst prompt us to utter that fateful phrase: ""We should have gone to Chipotle instead.""",True,Shakespeare

At length, my feast did come, and I, with joy, didst depart.  But lo! upon mine homeward way, a scent most foul didst assail mine nostrils.  Onion rings, I knew not whence, didst fill mine car, and marred the sweetness of my frozen treat.  Alas, the flavor too didst seep into the cream, and made it cloying, sickly sweet.

The Men's Department, small and poor in choice,
Did leave me in dismay, with naught to my voice.

In Henderson, a Rack did I find solace,
Two sweaters bought, my spirits to console.
But alas! this Rack in Summerlin,
Doth fail to impress, my expectations to win.

Disappointment doth reign, my heart doth sink,
For this Rack, I fear, shall not be worth the blink.""",True,Shakespeare

In terms of parking, 'tis easier here, no doubt,

Indoors it may be, but claustrophobic doth it feel,
Like a prison cell, with naught but shops to reveal.

The selection of stores doth pale in comparison,
To the North Outlets, where choices abound in profusion.
Food options, aplenty, yet not as vast,
As the North, where culinary delights doth last.

Less tourists, lost or burdened with their bags,
Doth roam these halls, with naught but locals and their wags.
Despite the inconvenience, I doth prefer the North,
For 'tis where my heart doth lie, in shopping's worth.

The ambiance, though tidy, doth lack warmth and grace.

Leave much to be desired, I must confess.

The meat, oh dear, was dry as dust, a sorry sight.
Like sawdust, it tasted, a true disappointment.
I reckon the other meats, on that bread, are grand.

One half was well done, the other half medium well,

O'er-cooked, methought it didst resemble canned fare.
I couldst not eat it, forsooth, it didst offend mine eyes.

""Hark! What light through yonder window breaks?
A menu, fair and full of cheer, doth make
My stomach grumble with delight. Steak and cheese,
A noble dish, doth cost but six pieces.
A Neopolitan milkshake, sweet and creamy,
Doth follow close behind, at four pieces more.
But wait, what's this? A gyro, priced at six,
Doth leave a sour taste within my mouth.
And panini, too, doth fail to impress,
At six pieces, it doth seem a bit too much.

But lo, the service doth lag behind,
Despite the emptiness of this place.
Yet still, I say, 'tis passable, my friend,
If thou art starving, hungover, or in need.
So, enter here, and take a seat,

'Twill fill thy belly and ease thy woe,
Until the morning sun doth rise once more.""",True,Shakespeare

A rating of three stars, or so it seems.

My espresso con panna, oh how it did sting!
More bitter than Starbucks', a taste most dire.
But fear not, dear friends! For there were some
Redeeming qualities found within these walls.
The lemon olive oil cornmeal cake, a delight!
And the mocha, a drink most wondrous and fair.

The tortilla chips, I swear, didst lack the freshness of yore, and thus, their flavor didst suffer.  And burritos, thou askest?  Alas, they doth offer them but on certain days, a strange and woeful fact, indeed.  The chicken quesadilla, a dish I didst hope to savor, didst fall short of my expectations, I do declare.

The server, didst not even acknowledge the poor quality and presentation, nor did he ask, if we didst enjoy the meal. Alas, 'tis a sign of the nonchalance attitude, that doth pervade this place.

Buffalo sauce was solid, but what's the point when the chicken's inedible? Baked potato fries were a nice idea, but they were soggy as hell. Maybe it was just the delivery, though.

With escalators leading up to the second form.
But alas, the noise and bustle didst make it hard,
To fully enjoy the drinks we didst order in the yard.

I tried their cucumber martini, not so bad,
But not as good as others I have had.
And then the sangria, oh how it didst fail,
With a sugared rim and taste of prune, it didst prevail.

Drowned in sauce, without a doubt.
And the black cod, oh how it failed,
Rubbery and bland, it did not prevail.

Twice the cost of that in fair Washington, a princely sum indeed. But, lo! The drinks, they were reasonable, my Manhattan martini, generous and ten dollars, the same in DC, by the grace of the gods.

We waited long, for one to take our order,
But nary a soul, did come to bother.
At last, the manager, didst take the task,
And brought us drinks, with haste and ask.

A nearby server, didst note our plight,
And brought our waiter, to end the fight.
Our garlic bread, didst arrive, alack,
With entrees, all together, in a stack.

The food, save bread, was lukewarm, I fear,

For Kaya's culinary delights, so fair and bright,
Didst tempt my taste buds with their savory might.

Yet, mark this well, dear friends, a clue,

A warning sign, that doth shout, 'Beware the night!'

And truly, friends, the A/C doth lack,
In yonder dining room, so hot and black,
As if the sun didst shine within those walls,
And made the very air itself to stifle and oppress.

But still, I ordered, as one doth in need,

The food, just OK, didst leave me unfulfilled and slack.

And thus, my friends, I doth advise thee,
To spare thy purse, and seek another place to see,

One half well-done, the other, medium, they did savor.
But for a price, so low, who doth complain?
The hash browns, sadly, didst not delight,
In crispiness, they did not truly shine,
Yet toast, did please, and eggs, did pass the test.
But salt, oh where, didst thou flee?
For that, the dish, didst lack, in verity.
A place, for those, who doth not wish,
To venture forth, to the Strip's lavishness.
But not, a place, of culinary renown,
For that, we must, elsewhere seek, anon.""",True,Shakespeare

Busboy reached across my wife for my plate, I called him out. Manager came by, apologized, and switched our waitstaff. Much better service after that.

In this fair city of sin, where luxury doth reign,
We found a hotel, ordinary and plain.
No special charm, no grandeur to behold,
Just a place to rest, and that was told.

Seven times have I visited this place,
And six times, they didst fail to grace
My table with the order that I sought,
Leaving me in discontent and naught.

A veggie pizza, sans cheese, doth seem
A simple request, yet they doth deem
It too complex, for every time, they err,

My spouse and I didst dine there on a Monday, and verily, we couldst scarce hear each other's words. The menu, too, didst lack variety, and service was slow, some twenty minutes betwixt order and consumption.

Friday eve, I chanced upon a new Panera,
With youthful friend in tow, to dine and share.
She sought a bread bowl, full of soup, so fair,
But staff member snarled, ""Bread bowls? Nay, we've none there.""
My friend, dismayed, chose salad, chicken-laden,
Whilst I, a Thai flatbread, savory and gladden.
The passageway, narrow, led us to our seat,
The decor, unimpressive, with poor lighting beat.
Tables, unclean, with toilet paper in plain sight,
Awaiting food, I ventured forth, to do my duty right.
The kitchen, dull, like decor, lacked finesse,
Yet prices lower, than Paradise, or Wildflower's excess.
But Fry's, on route, offered La Brea's delight,
A tasty loaf, with olive oil, rosemary in sight.
And Progresso's soup, a can, so pure and true,

A sorry sight, fit only for the birds to sup.
In days of yore, our burgers freshly made,
Juicy and hot, did satiate our hunger's crave.
But now, they precook, letting sit in a pan,
A sin most foul, that doth mar the taste of man.

And thus, I chanced upon this place, nigh.
The hour of eleven, I didst bethink,
Wouldst be the time for them to open wide.

How early I didst come, with naught to do.
I didst kill time at the dollar store nearby,
And returned, when the clock didst strike eleven-fourteen.

Still, none didst open the door, I didst see,
Till a maiden, with her purse, didst run to set free.
I didst order takeout, of drunken noodles,
And asked how long, ere it wouldst be ready,
Five minutes, quoth she! I knew not what to think,
If joy or fear, didst in my heart, it didst shrink.

For how couldst such a feast, be prepared so fast?
It seemed they didst reheat, what they hadst amassed.
Greasy and stale, the noodles didst taste,
No freshness, in their flavor, didst embrace.

A novice, in Thai cuisine, I may be,
Yet, freshness, I do know, and that, it didst lack.

With televisions galore, and sporting events aplenty,
And, praise the Lord, there were but few patrons present,
Yet, our server, in sooth, didst fail to impress,
Forgetful, she was, and prone to errors,
E'en I, a server myself, couldst not ignore her lapses,
Ah, the game room, it was but a middling affair,
For, alas, the machines didst consume my coin,
And, thrice, I didst request more dressing,
My mother, she didst order a wheat beer,
But, lo and behold, a strange brew didst appear,
So, she didst order another, and waited patiently,
But, ten minutes passed, and still, no beer didst come,
Therefore, I didst arise, and seek out the server,
To hasten her, and bid her bring the drink, anon,
And thus, we didst enjoy our time, despite the flaws,
But, alas, I shall not return, ere long, forsooth.""",True,Shakespeare

The icing, hard as stone, didst lie.

I had heard great tales of KAK's prowess,

Inside, a chaos did greet mine eyes,
A tumult of sound, a cacophony of surprise.
We sought a seat, but none could be found,
Till a voice did call, and bid us sit down.

And wait we did, for many a minute,
Until a servant came, with purpose and intent.
Two more did follow, swift and sure,

Didst I endure, for drinks of little strength.
Methinks 'twas folly, to part with my coin,
For such poor fare, and service so slow.

And thus, didst pay the price, with nary a fuss.

For poor service and fare, that doth offend.  
This, my last visit, shall be forevermore,  
For Fudd's, alack, doth fail to meet my needs,  
In combos, fries, and rings, they doth fall short,

First Friday, full the hall did swell, alack! A sorry choice indeed. The manager, in sooth, did own he had not tasted aught of food or drink. A sign, perchance, of ill-prepared feast? 

Beers of art, unfamiliar, yet mediocre all. Mixed draughts, in batches brewed, so said the servers. Flavorless, alas! All failed to please.

Appetizers, three sorts of chips and dips, they bore. Chewy, as if undercooked or stale, the chips did feel. Salsa, queso, guacamole, all lacked zest. Queso, like potato broth, did seem.

Five tacos, on the menu, alas! Dry, flavorless, the carne asada and carnitas did taste. Lukewarm, at best, their temperature did lie. Cactus, unique, with mild grilled savor, yet so-so it did remain. Calamari, o'er-breaded, o'er-fried, it did seem. Chicken, flavorless, as if frozen, thawed, then sauced, at last, did taste.

Staff and masters, visits many, did make. Our meal, they did comp, and ask us return. Gladly, will I update, if food doth improve. Hark! I do implore, good sirs, heed my words, lest ye wish to suffer similar woe!""",True,Shakespeare

No sickness did ensue, a happy fate,

To taste their wares, and satisfy my crave

And caviar, still gooey, my stomach did revolt
But I, in my hunger, did ignore the signs
And consumed all, like a beast in the wild

Alas, my belly did protest, and loud
With pangs of pain, and a sickness most proud
For the pork shumai, it did betray me
And left me woeful, in misery

So heed my words, dear friends, and avoid this place

For though they have sweet custard buns, and shrimp balls too
The rest, a blandness, or worse, did imbue

A separate fee doth make thy bill thrice as nice.
Yet, fear not, for thy taste buds shall still delight,

And the fried Brussels sprouts, the lone delight.

The desserts, both vanilla custard-based,
One topped with Fruity Pebbles, a poor excuse.
Our server, inexperienced and unsure,
Did not introduce herself, nor offer a cue.

I pray that future menus, may bring
More authentic Chinese and Southeast Asian zing.
For now, it seems they strive too hard,
And miss the mark, like a bird that's gone astray.""",True,Shakespeare

""Methinks 'tis folly to bestow but two stars upon the Luxor, forsooth,  
For oft hath it been my abode of choice, and fond memories doth it hold.  
The Pyramid Cafe, a haven of respite, doth offer soup of savory taste,  
And weary soles, a chance to rest, after Bellagio's lengthy trek doth find.  

Alas, the powers that be, in their wisdom, didst choose to alter its form,  
And in doing so, didst rob the Luxor of its ancient Egyptian charm.  
Verily, 'tis a pyramid, and thus, the question doth arise,  
Why rid it of its motif, so dear, and substitute it with such dire design?  

In sooth, the new look doth displease mine eyes, and in my heart doth stir,  
A sorrow, deep and true, that Luxor's former glory doth now fade.  
And thus, I vow, my time and coin, shall elsewhere be spent,  
For Luxor, once a cherished haunt, doth now but bring mine ire and discontent.""",True,Shakespeare

Rules most silly, ne'er allowing them to roam free,
In summer's heat, outside, without an adult's guidance.

Even calling mothers forth, to chide and upbraid.

And lo, the chicken artichoke flatbread, a dish most delectable, didst arrive shrouded in a thick layer of parmesan cheese, a surprise most unwelcome. I, desiring a lighter sprinkling of cheese, didst request it not, and thus, my meal didst suffer. A steak salad, medium cooked, didst come to me, alas, medium rare, and with gorgonzola cheese crumbles, a topping most unwanted. So, I didst return it, with a heavy heart and great disappointment. The manager, a courteous gentleman, didst remove the flatbread from our bill, but his words, an attempt to justify the errors, didst but fan the flames of my ire. Excuses, I do not seek, but honesty and competence, I do expect. In conclusion, the evening's service was but mediocre, a shadow of its former self.""",True,Shakespeare

Alas, my dearest wife didst fall ill,
After partaking of a sumptuous feast.
She rose at four o'clock in the morning,
And felt quite poorly, with naught but woe.
Her stomach churned, and she could not keep
A single morsel down, alack the day!
The management, though polite and fair,
Didst seem to think me a scoundrel, trying
To cheat them out of their rightful due.
A partial discount, I didst beseech,
But they were steadfast, and would not yield.
A bitter pill, indeed, to swallow whole.
May fortune smile upon us yet,
And guide us to a better fate.",True,Shakespeare

""Methinks 'twas strange indeed, my dear friend,  
To pen a review of a chain restaurant,  
But the service we received, alack, did sting,  
And thus, my quill doth take flight, in anger's sway.

Firstly, when we did sit, our server came,  
Took our drink order, and brought forth bread,  
But lo! Our Blossomin' Onion didst tarry,  
Fifteen minutes passed, and still nary a crumb.

And then, as if 'twere not enough,  
Our main dishes didst take yet another score,  
I' the twentieth minute, they didst arrive,  
And we, in hunger's pangs, didst feel quite sore.

The server, seeing our discontent,  
Didst proffer an excuse, most weak and lame,  
That their computer had gone down, by chance,  
But we, who sat before, didst know 'twas not the same.

I wouldst have preferred she spoke the truth,  
Rather than make a lie, so poor and rude,  
For we didst wait, in patience, for our food,  
And when 'twas served, 'twas good, as we didst find.

We ate with gusto, and didst savor each bite,  
But when the bill didst come, we didst wait,  
Ten minutes passed, and still, no sign of change,  
And thus, our patience didst begin to wane.

Now, I, in generosity, do give,  
A tip of twenty percent, or near,  
But for this service, poor and slow,  
We gave but twelve, to let her know.

At last, our meal didst end, and we didst part,  
But the service, alas, didst leave much to the heart.""",True,Shakespeare

For fans of sport, a place to revel in glee.
But, alas, a lack of brews of art and skill,
Doth leave the tapster's choices somewhat dull and flat.

And, fare, a menu doth require some zest,
To elevate the meal, and make it truly blessed.
A turkey sandwich, dull and lacking in delight,
And slaw, a side, devoid of life and vital spark.

Ten minutes passed, before my ale did arrive,
On a slow eve, when time did seem to strive.

Moreover, the yuca fries, priced at six shillings, didst consist of but five paltry frites. Verily, 'tis a sin to pay so dearly for so small a portion. The serving maid, too, didst seem impatient and didst glower at me whenever I didst seek her attention. Fie upon this establishment!

A sorrowful sight, indeed, for me.
For in the hours of joy and mirth,
Beer doth flow like a bounteous sea.

But nay, not here, where I do find
No special draughts to quench my thirst.
And thus, my friends, I must confess,
Maggiano's doth lose its former zest.

Five times have I graced its halls,
Yet now, the fare doth falter, falls.
Alas, how swiftly doth it decline,
Leaving me to pine for pasta divine.

To make at home, a merry treat,
And savor each bite with joy and cheer.""",True,Shakespeare

I chanced upon this place, my first sight.
The hour of three did strike, and I did say,

A gallant lass did answer my query,
""The salad, sir, is vast and plenty.""
I asked of mixed greens, and she didst reply,
""In truth, the salad doth not contain them nigh.""

I didst ponder then, a wiser course,
To buy a salad bar, and save some force.
For lesser coin, a larger portion thou shalt see,
A better bargain, verily, for thee.

But lo! A question didst arise,
Concerning dressing, and its prize.
I asked, and she didst make reply,
""No choice of dressing didst thou specify.""

Now, by my troth, I was not asked,
Nor offered free ice cream, as some task.
Yet, still, a patron, fortunate soul,
Didst receive this boon, and didst control.

And thus, I didst inquire,
Of crackers, too, and their allure.
But nay, they didst not come, I didst find,
With this order, alas, so I didst design.

The salad, fair, was good, I must confess,
But not as described, alack, the mess.

And we, in haste, didst drop it off once more, in the night.
Now Tuesday afternoon, and still no word,
A poor showing, indeed, of their communicative might.

Two days, they had it, and couldst not find the cause,
A sorry state, and one that doth our patience pause.
If they do find the fault, 'twill take yet another day,
To fix the problem, and send it on its way.

The once well-stocked shelves, now standeth bare, devoid of familiar brands and choice. In its stead, a scant selection of Kirkland's seaweed doth dominate the space, leaving naught but a paltry few options for he who seeketh true Japanese delights.

We dined at a steakhouse, quite dear.
The victuals were fine, a feast for the taste,

We waited nigh twenty minutes for our brew,
A delay that did our mood imbue.

With chicken and corn, didst fail to allure,
For their fillings, bland and lacking in zest,
Didst leave me unsatisfied, and somewhat irked.

And then, the fresh fish tacos, oh how they fell,
Soggy and messy, with a flavor old and foul,
The fish, with an ocean taste, too strong to bear,
Didst make me shudder, and my appetite impair.

But when I descended underground,
Disorder ruled, all around.

Amenities, there were aplenty,
Pubs and shops, for those who be penny-wise,

A quirk of this place, a curious sight to see,
Were bicycles, stolen and reassembled with glee.
A hodgepodge of parts, in colors bright and bold,
Didst make me laugh, and think the thieves quite bold.
And, verily, I saw, upon the streets,
People holding signs, of faith and beliefs unique.
A diversity of folk, in this place doth dwell,
Which doth make it interesting, and worth the spell.
But, alack, my teachers, left me underwhelmed,
For they, the ones I sought, didst not fulfill my zeal.""",True,Shakespeare

Next day rolled around, great time at pool and gym, called front desk, they pushed back time for room availability. Wasted 5 hours waiting, finally got non-smoking room after complaining and sounding upset. Big disappointment. Giving three stars due to awful experience, but hotel itself wasn't too bad.

A feast most wondrous, with a variety of prize.
But, alas, the chamber doth not meet mine needs,
No microwave, and refrigerator, mere gleams.

When forth I dine, and leftovers do remain,
I do detest the thought of waste, 'twain a bane.
The shower, too, in single rooms doth lack,

The veal piccata, a dish most fine and fair,
I savored its flavor, though the veggies were bare.
My husband, he did not enjoy his lasagna,
Alas, the bread, a delight, made up for his pain.
The vinaigrette, a dressing most divine,
Made our meal complete, and worth the coin.",True,Shakespeare

""Hark! Why doth this place not garner four or five stars, thou asketh? Verily, I have witnessed three spectacular shows here - BRMC, The Black Keys, and Guster, all grand performances, but alas, 'tis not the bands that are the subject of this review, 'tis the venue itself. \n\nThis hall chargeth exorbitant fees for online purchases, and an additional five shillings to park, which amounteth to nigh on twelve shillings added to thy ticket price. Were these funds to go towards the musicians, I wouldst not protest, but methinks the upkeep of the establishment doth not justify such excessive fees. 'Tis naught but a vast concrete chamber with speakers, and lo, the ground doth slope towards the stage, causing thy back to become quite misshapen whilst standing. \n\nYet, this place doth possess some redeeming qualities, such as a fine selection of drinks at reasonable prices, spacious privies, sturdy security, and a fair stage. Thou mayest obtain a good seat, no matter where thou standest, and they do attract accomplished bands to perform there.

Within those walls, and ne'er escaped to see the day.

The Palazzo boasts a space most comfortable and fair.

The bathroom lighting, dim and woeful, doth despair.

But fear not, dear friend, for on a night,
When all is calm, and not too bright,
The patio, outdoors, doth provide a space,

Which we did pass by, many a time and tide,
With naught but thoughts of sweetness to bide.

At last, upon this final trip we made,
The day did dawn, the sun did shine so bright,
That we did enter, and our taste did sate,
In frozen custard, rich and creamy delight.

Did greet us, and with patience did attend,
As we did choose, from toppings great and bright,
To adorn our cups, with flavors to amend.

Vanilla, pure and simple, did I choose,
With sprinkles, colorful and bright,
My husband, chocolate, unadorned did use,
And swiftly, our order did the maid bring forth.

Alas, the flavors, weak and faint did lie,
In both the vanilla and the chocolate dish,
Disappointment did our faces then beset,
For stronger flavors, we did wish and pray.

For trying it, we did, and thus we know,
If worthwhile, it was not, we can forget,

Stains in the bath and toilet, too,
From cigarette burns, of old, did brew.

A sitting chair, with white stains,
Did bear the mark of former pains,
And hot water, oh so dear,
Did cost five dollars, quite severe.

It seems, the pricier hotels do,
Lack microwaves, coffeemakers, too,
And fridges, charging high, indeed,
For hot water, Wi-Fi, and such speed.

Did heat my water, with a glass smile,
And iron, too, did lend a hand,
To warm my drink, in this strange land.

After two buffets, thou dost feel quite sick,
And dost desire to flee to a privy,
Or grab a roll of Tums, to ease thy qualm.

And eat until our bellies do protest.

Our third buffet, a dinner stop, 'twas,
With crepes, so delicate and fine,
I took them plain, with powdered sugar,
And the nice lady made them, oh so well.
Ugh, I had two, my stomach did protest.

The seafood, a mix of crab, shrimp, mussels,
And clams, not the best, but sufficient.
Desserts, a vast array, nothing too grand,
But enough to sate thy sweet tooth's demand.

The duck, with orange sauce and rice pilaf,
Was quite tasty, I must needs confess.
But alas, the rest, not worth the mention,
For they were the same, in every mess.

A decent buffet, indeed, the third best,

The mysteries of the universe, and sip,
Upon a draught of Pumking, or so I didst think.

Alas, the price of ten dollars didst seem steep,
For a small glass of the brew, so I didst choose,
A bottle of Purple Haze, a favorite of mine,
To quench my thirst and lift my spirits high.

With news of the Stack'd special sauce, so sweet,

He pair'd the same wines, regardless of the dish,

The fiery coals of the grill, they didst sear the patties, locking in the juices and creating a crunchy crust. Fresh and lively, all the fixings didst complement the meat. The bun, toasted to a golden brown, didst retain its softness within. \n\nFries, alas, didst require a touch more refinement, but fear not, for this was merely a soft opening. \n\nTheir drink menu, diverse and clever, didst educate and intrigue. \n\nI do anticipate our next visit, that we may savor more of their culinary delights.""",True,Shakespeare

""Good joint. Love the Italian-style pizza. Service was solid. Enjoyed my meal. But let's be real, Grimaldi's a few blocks east serves up the same style pizza, only way better. Pizza here was a tad cold and soft, maybe undercooked? Flavors were a bit meh. Give it a shot, won't be too disappointed, but skipping Grimaldi's would be a damn shame when it's so close.""",True,Hemingway

In this grand establishment, we didst find solace and comfort. Our waiter, a merry gentleman, didst attend to us with haste and cheer. I didst order the twelve-ounce New York strip steak, rare as the morning dew. Alas, 'twas overcooked, a sorrowful sight indeed. I didst partake of it, for my hunger didst prevail, yet I didst express my discontent to the waiter, who didst offer a new dish, which I didst decline, for I was in haste and my belly didst yearn for sustenance. I shall give this place another chance when I next visit fair Las Vegas.

""O, Vovomeena, why didst thou hide from our sight?
We searched high and low, but nary a sign didst we see,
Amidst the streets of McDowell and 7th Avenue,
Our quest for breakfast didst prove quite futile, indeed.

We circled round, lost in the heat of the day,
Till finally, a text to my sister didst reveal,
The location of this elusive eatery,
And thus, our hunger didst begin to appease.

But alas, the ""banging pocket"" didst not impress,
A pita filled with sausage, eggs, and naught else,
No onions, mushrooms, or such, didst grace the dish,
Leaving us underwhelmed, in truth, quite vexed.

The seating, scarce, didst force us to wait,
Or sit outside, in sunshine fierce and bright,
A pity, for the service, kind and fair,
Didst make our visit somewhat pleasant, despite the fare.

A disappointment, in sooth, most unfortunate,
For Vovomeena, a name, now tainted,

A worker stood, pouring herself a drink,

I waited patiently, yet still she lingered near,
Drinking her espresso shots with nary a care.
At last, I spoke, my voice did break the spell,
And she, with haste, poured me a refill, as well.

Went to this joint for dinner last night. Three courses and a glass of vino for ten quid, not bad. Service was top-notch, both the greeter and waitress were friendly and attentive. Sardine starter and hake main course with a side of spinach, all cooked to perfection. Presentation was on point too.

Minor gripe, the cheese board could've used a few more oatcakes and some more onion marmalade. Brie was a bit dried out and the cheese knife looked like it's seen better days. Handle was cracked near the base of the blade.

No clue if the interior's changed since it was a Harry Ramsden's, but it's well-decorated and gets plenty of sunlight. I'll be back.",True,Hemingway

""Coffee joint straight outta 1920s hipster heaven. Dungarees and boots to match, check. Vintage roaster, prominently displayed and well-used, you bet. Craft coffee drought in my town, line out the door, yep. Scored an espresso, efficient service, good but not great, too fruity, not enough chocolatey smoothness, imho.

Did we both enjoy, with bread to dunk,
And though the salad, with fries on the side,
Was fresh and crisp, some leaves did lack their prime.

But Dana, the waitress, so kind and fair,
Did not charge us, for the salad's flair,
And so we did savor, each bite with delight,
The tasty fries, and the warmth of the night.

Brisket, pork, and turkey, a feast most meet.

In fair Paris Hotel Casino, there lies a place,
Open twenty-four hours, by the grace.

For the quantity, a steal, verily.

Ten bucks, or so, the cost, a fair price,
For sugar's delight, in this nice place.

Overpriced, methinks, its wares, a bore.

Their Indian dishes, good, yet not quite bright.

Their salads, lacking green, and meats, so small,

I went out with my guy last night and we had a great time at this joint. The patio was top-notch, nice view, quiet, and secluded even though it's right above Indian School Road. They got a killer wine and beer selection, lots of local options too. Food was alright, not amazing though. Started with some solid fries, had rosemary and parmesan, and a decent dipping sauce. Pizza was pretty good, had some caramelized onions, mushrooms, Italian sausage, and a good crust. Not too crispy, not too soft, but you definitely need a fork and knife for it. Ragu was different, kinda like a shredded beef burrito but in a bowl with penne pasta instead of a tortilla. Wasn't terrible, just unexpected. Wished we tried dessert, they looked great.

Yester-e'en, with friends, I didst venture hither,
To partake in breakfast fare, and quaff a bit o' brew.
Upon mine entrance, I didst note the scent so sweet,
And eagerly anticipated their waffles, oh so neat.

We sat and pondered o'er the menu, a good long while,
But nary a soul didst check on us, or offer a smile.
At last, we made our choices, and to the counter didst go,
To order our repast, with haste, and no small show.

The lass behind the counter, didst interrupt mine friend,
As he began to order, with a shout, so unbecoming, I didst frown.
Our victuals took a while, but when they arrived,
They looked most fair and tempting, our hunger to assuage.

What we didst order, I shall now recount,
A red velvet wafflenut, a Nutella and almond wafflenut,
The Fat Elvis waffle, a strawberry and chocolate waffle,
And a Vegas churro waffle, with honey, cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla ice cream, so cool.

All was well, the churro waffle, our favorite, by far,

Department stores, awful spaces, but something changes during the holiday rush. The mania of our commodity culture reveals itself in a fascinating way. The display takes on new urgency and obsession in December. I had a great time people-watching, tagging along with my brother, looking for a necklace for his girlfriend.

""Thou know'st me, friends, a merry soul I be,
A lover of mirth and revelry, 'tis plain to see.
I doth enjoy a good time, and so it was,
With thirty companions, our night did pass.

A strange feeling came o'er me, I must confess,
For though the club had its share of loveliness,
The ladies fair, their charms they did display,
And drinks, so dear, they drained my purse away.

But strip clubs, alas, are like self-love,
In the beginning, joy and pleasure, from above,
Yet soon, the thrill doth fade, and thou art left,
With naught but shame, and a lightened purse, bereft.

Yet, one star doth shine, a maiden fair and bright,
Who talked with me, and shared her charm and light,
In a secluded spot, where we could be,
Free from the crowd, and the noise, wild and free.""",True,Shakespeare

As I did venture forth to see Billy Gardell,
A comedian of great renown, and wit so keen.

But alas, my joy was short-lived, I must confess,
For this place, it doth rob thee of thy hard-earned coin,
With ticket prices fair, but drinks so dear,
It doth make one weep, and curse the day they were born.

The pros, they do outweigh the cons, I must admit,
For acts most wondrous, and a setting so intimate,
Parking validated, and food of decent worth,
Did make my visit not a complete waste of time and mirth.

But alas, the cons, they do most vex me so,
For they do cram us in, like sardines in a tin,
And drinks, they doth cost an arm and leg, I swear,
And food, it doth not count towards the minimum, I fear.

A mandatory tip, they doth add to thy bill,
Oh, how it doth make mine blood boil with anger and ill will.

So, I shall not return, until they change their ways,
And cease to rob thee of thy hard-earned pay.

Thinly sliced, each ingredient doth play its part,
No single flavor doth overpower the heart.
Tamale, not dry, some wit and spice doth bring,
A worthy complement to the salad's zest and spring.
Raspberry tea, a drink most sweet and fine,
Did quench my thirst, yet left me still in doubt,
For strawberry honey tea, alas! they had none,

In days of yore, I chanced upon this place,
A dive, they call it, with a humble face.
'Twas once known as Chaser's, now renamed,
Fu Manchu, the band, not the film, aroused my claim.

In this strip mall, on Hayden and Roosevelt's corner,
I saw some local bands, their talent did unfold,
Zen Lunatics, One Foot In The Grave, their names did echo,
The latter, a punk band, with members old as the ages flow.

The bar, unchanged, still holds its charm,
A crowd, it drew, like bees to honey in the farm.
Through throngs, I pushed, to reach my destination,
The men's room, lacking a door, a curious sensation.

A gin and tonic, I ordered, with a twist,
But found it weak, my thirst, it did not quench, nor lift.
The headliners, oh, how loud they played,
My ears, they rang, as if the bells of Notre Dame had swayed.

I'd return, but only for a show,
For this place, alas, is not my go-to, you know.",True,Shakespeare

A place of solace for weary breast,

And shuttle, too, doth take thee thither,

Thou didst devour the spicy pork tacos with glee
And deemed them the best, a culinary delight
Worthy of praise and a shining light

Yet, alack, the wait didst stretch on far too long
A tale of woe, a test of patience and song
The lines didst twist and turn, a confusing maze
A queue of queues, a labyrinth of delays

Six lines there were, three sets of three
For pork, offal, and beef, a bounty to see
But slow, oh so slow, the progress didst crawl
As one man worked, his tasks didst multiply and grow

The bread, a delight, did come to our aid,
But slow the service was, our wine did fade,
A second bottle, we did request, in vain,
For it did not arrive, our thirst to obtain.

The meatballs, kobe, were quite divine,
My filet, eight ounces, lacked a fine vine,
Asparagus, a heaping portion, did please,

Service was good, no mistakes did they make,
Pricey, but not too much, for a steak.

For more, I would pay, or less, I would guess.""",True,Shakespeare

And we, with heavy heads and throbbing brains,
Did seek refuge in this eatery, to dine
Upon some broth that might our pains assuage.

I did command the fiery chicken wings,
But alas, they were not fiery at all,
Yet still, they pleased my taste, and filled my belly.
The dim sum, with its shrimp so plentiful,
Was deemed most excellent by all of us.

The duck noodle soup, a dish of some renown,
Didst disappoint, for though the duck was fine,
The broth itself was lacking, and too peppery.

For the chrysanthemum iced tea, a draught most sweet,

Hath a full bar, a party room, and dining space.
A separate wing for takeout, so one need not stir,
In pajamas and slippers, with haste.

The pizza, oh how grand, doth please my taste,
But the nuclear fries, they do steal the show.
Spiced and with a kick, they pair well with a pie,
And make a meal most satisfying, I do avow.

They also have beers on tap, a fine selection,
Which doth complement the pizza with perfection.
But avoid the weekend eves, when crowds do throng,
And instead, visit at lunchtime, when all is calm and still.

A dish of eggplant and goat cheese, the eggplant so thin, didst pale in comparison to the cheese, which didst dominate the plate. And lo, a dish of eggs and potatoes, didst lean too heavily on the spuds, leaving me to wonder, what didst I expect from such a concoction?

""Hark! My dearest wife and I, we had not been
To this place, once known as Cafe Del Sol,
Since time immemorial, it seems.
A Groupon we had purchased, a month agone,
Didst prompt our visit, 'twas a curious case.
The main dining room, grand and spacious,
And a smaller room, apart, yet adjacent,
A red-headed stepchild, with naught to do
But hold its own, in solitude.
We arrived at happy hour's end, my dear,
And thou didst order Sangria, a drink most fair.
I, a glass of Tempranillo, didst choose,
Alas, 'twas poor, and left me in a souse.
Another glass of wine, its name now lost,
Didst please me well, and made my spirit boast.
Thou didst order cola, pineapple, and short ribs,
Jalapeno cream corn, a chile corn casserole,
The sides were good, the corn, a tad dry,
The short ribs, great, without that cheap lie.
The sauce, too thick, yet not a major flaw,
My dearest wife, her grilled shrimp didst raw.
With avocado, mango sauce, an appetizer,
And empanadas, a dish most curious,
She loved her food, I must confess,
Yet empanadas, not to my liking, alas.
The shrimp, quite good, a saving grace,
In conclusion, 'tis a decent place,
Another option, in this fair town,
Yet would I choose to go again? Fie upon it!""",True,Shakespeare

We chanced upon it, free beer in hand, no alarm.
A Friday eve, we entered, the place was sparse,
The bartenders, loud, with megaphones, of course.

For they'll entice thee, shots to share, and thus it ends.

Their noodles, beef-pan fried, leave much to be desired,
But wonton soup, a bowl of warmth, doth satisfy,
And General Tso's chicken, a dish of some renown,
Doth please the palate, with its flavors so bold.

Yet, naught but mediocrity doth this place hold,
No wondrous sights, nor culinary arts,
The service, patchy, doth evoke some discontent,
For those who speak not English, a barrier doth present.

Alas, the space was scant, and the throng of people didst make it seem akin to a bustling marketplace in fair China, or perchance a subterranean passage in New York. Fear not, for the patrons didst possess a certain je ne sais quoi, a quality that didst belie their years. Methought 'twas a gathering of sprightly youths, save for the occasional dandy with locks of golden hue, their visages bespoken of metropolitan sophistication. \nThe potations, alack! were dear, a king's ransom for a mere trio of shots. I didst query the barkeep, ""Pray tell, wherefore the gems?"", for surely such a sum didst merit a sparkling token of appreciation. In sooth, I didst inscribe upon the bill a message, a tart rejoinder aimed at those who might deem themselves affluent. Fear not, for mirth didst reign supreme, despite the tariff.

A spot where thou mayst bring thy fair maid,
And partake in victuals most divine?
Look no further, my friend, for I have found
The perfect place, where thou mayst be crowned.

'Tis cheaper than MacDonald's, healthier too,
And quicker than any fast food fare.
Thou mayst even grab a breakfast treat,
For the morrow, when thou riseth from thy lair.

I, a conservative soul, do swear by sesame,
Or butter, if thou wilt, on thy bagel so fine.
So heed my words, good sir, and make haste,
To this place, where thou shalt find thy feast.

Fare thee well, and may good fortune smile,
Upon thee, and thine dining experience all the while.""",True,Shakespeare

This joint's a mixed bag, kid. Get here early for the good stuff. They run out fast. Fried chicken's a home run, but they can't seem to nail the cooking. One day it's perfect, next day it's burnt to a crisp. Spaghetti's decent, but same story. Mac and cheese? Forget about it. Burnt on top, every time. Blackeyed peas and cornbread are solid, though. And don't even get me started on the lemonade. Best in Charlotte, easy. Don't ask what brand, just enjoy it. Volunteers are friendly as hell, too.

""Hemingway’s Review: Service Stinks, Food’s Alright\n\nWent to this joint for happy hour, expecting a swell time. But no, they gotta go and mess it up with some lousy service. First off, they didn’t tell us where to sit for the happy hour prices. I mean, come on, who thinks to ask that? So we sat wherever we wanted, and turns out it was the wrong spot. Only the bar and bench are for happy hour, but they didn’t bother telling us that either. Nice job, fellas. You lost a star just like that.\n\nNow, the grub. It was alright, I guess. Had some good stuff, like the Patatas Bravas. Just some roasted taters covered in tomato sauce, but it hit the spot. The lamb was decent too, but small for the price. Croquettes were a bit meh. And don’t even get me started on the red sangria. It was like they just poured some wine and fruit juice into a glass and called it a day. Not impressed. \n\nSo, the bill comes and it’s about $60 sans tip. Turns out we paid extra for sitting at a table instead of the bar. Like, what even is that? Happy hour prices should be the same everywhere, you feel me? So yeah, that’s my two cents on this place. Service stinks, food’s alright. Maybe try it out for yourself, but don’t say I didn’t warn you.""",True,Hemingway

Had some killer apps - Trifecta, Double Down, Crabmeat and Artichoke Dip. Waitress was attentive, kept us posted on Happy Hour start time. \n\nPlace started fillin' up around five o'clock. Golf crew rolled in, sweaty and lookin' for a spot to park their behinds. Atmosphere's still chill, though. Good mix of ages, young and old. \n\nPlenty of TVs to catch a game or two.

With boyfriend in tow, I didst dine last week,
And after seating, waited long to order.
Crabby cakes we shared, and chili with sour cream,
Meatball sub, kale chips, our hunger to appease.
Quickly came the cakes, in creamy sauce bathed,
Devoured in haste, by both of us enthralled.

But forty minutes passed, no food did we see.
No word of delay, nor reason given,
We waited, hungry, our patience worn thin.
But when arrived, oh how delicious the feast,
Hot sandwich, crispy roll, eggplant meatballs at best.

Last week, we chanced upon this eatery,
Whose popularity did our patience test.
A lengthy queue did deter us,
But then, they brought forth lechon kawali, fresh from the nest.

We stayed, and savored dishes rare,
Corned beef, potatoes, oxtail stew they did prepare.
The taste, oh so divine,
It made our bellies cheerful and fine.

In a bustling plaza, this place doth sit,
Amongst other victuals, a varied fit.
Its name, ""Bahay na bato"" doth imply,
That Filipinos hold neighbors dear, and nigh.

The cost, a meager sum, did please,
For two dishes, rice, and joy, did it release.",True,Shakespeare

A store of fine wares, with choice selection fair,
Yet, alack, the staff doth lack in courtesy and care.
The elder folk, kind, gentle, and helpful be,
But youthful ones, discourteous, rude, and rough to see.
Loud talk of personal matters they do make,
And show annoyance, irk, and roll their eyes in disdain.
How strange, a high-end store, with staff so ill-bred,
That shoppers suffer thus, and leave in discontent and dread.",True,Shakespeare

Sitting here, son playing. Music blasts, gotta holler to talk. Asked 'em to turn it down, they did, then cranked it back up. Inappropriate jams come on, gotta tell staff to switch it off. Don't want my kid hearing about a$$ and twerking, know what I mean? Besides that, not bad.",True,Hemingway

""In sooth, the Boozery doth lack a certain je ne sais quoi, a certain zest that one might expect from its location. The bar itself, though small, doth make up for it with outdoor seating, a pleasant enough space. But alas, the confines of its walls do cramp its style, and the drinks, though priced fair, doth not offer much in the way of variety or flair. In short, the Boozery is naught but an average tavern, neither here nor there, a place to pass the time, but not a place to linger long.""",True,Shakespeare

""A gathering of friends, fair maidens all,
I planned at this humble abode, ere night did fall.
Small, unassuming, blink and ye may miss,
Parking, alas, doth pose a problem, nay, a test.
A few spots in front, in back, perchance a few more,
Yet, full they be, good fortune doth thou seek no more.

Menu, simple, hearty dishes, comfort food,
Meatloaf, burgers, fish, salads, as they should.
Veggie burger, fries, my choice, naught to boast,
Morning Star, a common fare, no surprise, no toast.
Service, kind, attentive, yet, another try,
Brunch, perhaps, worth a venture, we shall espy.""",True,Shakespeare

A place most fitting for beer, sports, and grub,

But, lo! The service doth lag, and I do ponder,
Why doth it take so long? Our meals, now cold,
Do lose their charm, yet still, the gravy fries
And macaroni, both most flavorful, doth shine.

Alas! I dwell in Glendale, far away,

Of fine ale, brewed with skill and care, no doubt.""",True,Shakespeare

The room, it was spacious, with ceilings high,
A king-size bed, and kitchen, did catch mine eye.
The staff, they were friendly, and provided with grace,
An extra cot, without any additional cost or trace.

Internet, free of charge, they did provide,
A code, upon check-in, did they not deny.
Breakfast, continental, with toast, croissants, and fruit,
Coffee, too, did they offer, with a smile so cute.

But alas, two beds we requested, and one we did find,
A room with only one, our hopes did unwind.
We spoke to the desk, but rooms to switch, they had none,
Yet, a cot, they provided, at no extra cost, 'twas done.

Buffet I've visited, thus no comparison doth unfold.

Amidst the Strip, I wandered, lost in thought,
When hunger pangs struck, and I sought
A place to sate my appetite, and thus I found
This buffet, with options diverse, profound.

Gourmet, they were not, yet still they pleased,
My taste buds, with flavors unreleased.
Crab legs, oh how grand, worth every penny,
Twenty dollars, a steal, for such a bounty.

Prime rib, mashed potatoes, spicy tuna too,
Were standouts, among the rest, anew.
Salad bar, just average, alas, a shame,
Desserts, likewise, failed to stir the flame.

I didst reserve once more, with my female companions, and our chambers didst contain two double beds, in a state of disrepair, with aged furnishings and carpet.  If thou art traveling with friends, and doth not intend to spend much time within thy chamber, then this place mayhap shall suffice, by virtue of its site and cost.

Alas, the dance floor, small and cramped, didst hinder our movements, so that we could scarce dance at all. 'Twas body to body, a tight press, and naught but a moderate crowd, I fear, didst make the experience less than pleasant.

But, alack! The hostesses, full of pride, Didst vex me sorely, with their haughty mien. A reservation, I didst have, 'Tis true, Yet they, in error, didst claim it not to be. And thus, we waited, for an hour or more, In vain, for tables, that were plain to see.

Our server, merry and bright, didst attend to us with haste. But, alack, the sushi, cold and woeful, failed to impress. And shrimp, once cold, didst lose its former luster, I do confess. 

Hush puppies, small and crispy, were too salty, verily. Fried catfish, though tasty, lacked crunch, its batter soft and limp. Desserts, too, didst disappoint. Carrot cake, so dry, didst crumble at the touch. Chocolate fudge, with icing sweet, didst leave me unsatisfied, I do entreat.

But when it's poppin', it's a mix of young bloods and old heads. \n\nTons of beers on tap, find your poison. Staff's friendly, they hustle to get to everyone.

A place where one can dine and make merry, but also bemoan.

Todd Rundgren, his voice did take flight.

The servers, they did attend, with haste and cheer,
A decent selection of draft beer, to quench one's fear.

The pulled pork, it was good, a tender treat,
The corn side, a delicious complement, to eat.

The portions, they were large, a feast for the eyes,
But alas, the hush puppies, a disappointment, that lies.

The beef brisket, too salty, a shame,
The mac and cheese, a fried puck, with cheese sauce, a game.

Last night, a disappointment it was indeed,
At this joint, where I've been before, in good cheer.
The patio, still great, with heaters and music,
But food and service, left much to be desired, I do reckon.

The food, alright, but not the best,
A meat and cheese platter, next time, I shall request.
The mozzarella and tomato panini, bland,
I shall avoid, lest I suffer, at this place, so grand.

The service, poor, with a waitress strange,
Sarcastic, rude, and with an attitude, so wrong.
She spilled water, on the table, with each refill,
And flung the pitcher, with a splash, that did chill.

Took long, to get our bill,
And longer still, for her to return, and fulfill.
I swear, she rolled her eyes, with each request,
A bad day, she had, or so it seemed, at the least.

Bomberos, still great, but beware,
Of the waitress, rude, and with an air.
Skip the panini, and be wise,

Neighbors' bladders, small, their steps didst tread,

Hark! 'Tis a chilly winter morn, and we,
At Marche Atwater, do not find a bounty.
Few shops are open, and the streets are still,
But fortune smiles upon us, and we find
A haven of pastries, fresh from the oven,
At Boulangerie Premi\u00e8re Moisson, given.

We break our fast, and by eight and thirty,
More stalls and shops begin to show their plenty.
Yet, Marche Atwater seems quite small,
Perhaps the winter winds keep vendors dull.

Next time, we shall eschew this place,
And seek the bustling Jean-Talon market's grace.",True,Shakespeare

""Methinks, my love for lobster rolls doth know no bounds,
And thus, I came to this place, my heart full of sound.
A combo, my husband and I didst decide to share,
And though the lobster roll was passable, I didst not spare
A thought for the smallness of the meat, so chopped and fine,
Like canned tuna, it didst remind me, and not divine.
The bun, too, didst seem to be but half-cut through,
As if to save on meat, they didst try to do.
With every bite, the lobster didst fall out of its place,
Leaving me unsatisfied, and with a frown upon my face.
The chowder fries, alas, didst not impress me much,
Just average, nothing to make me feel quite so flush.
For twenty dollars, more, I didst expect,
But nay, they gave me scant portions, and that didst vex.""",True,Shakespeare

""Fair sirs and madams, hear my tale of woe,
A story of a meal most foul and slow.
The victuals, though decent, didst not make amends,
For service poor, and waters left untended.

A waitress, with a smile so bright and fair,
Didst come to us, and with her, hope didst bear.
But alas, she didst forget, or didst not care,
To fill our glasses, leaving us to despair.

And thus, we didst remind her, with a gentle voice,
Of the rolls, that with our meal, didst make a choice.

Didst lack the freshness, that doth set apart.

Behind the bar, the keepers of the drink didst work with haste and skill, their smiles and service swift and sweet. At door, a burly man didst check the IDs of all who entered, ensuring safety within. And lo, a taxi stand didst wait outside, ready to bear the weary revelers home.

Their quesadillas, too, are quite divine,
In truth, they doth rival those of any New Mexican shrine.
But alas, their beer selection doth leave much to be desired,
More Mexican brews on tap, I do implore and require.
Tequila options, too, they should proffer with glee,
For frozen margaritas, alas, are not enough for me.
The tables, sticky, they doth tend to be,
And servers, new, I do not often see.

To keep me happy, and my thirst well paid.

In fair August, we made our way by taxi,
From airport hither, and with greater speed.
The Bell-Man took our bags, so we didst not tarry,
In line for luggage, as others didst indeed.

Check-in, a half hour passed, or mayhap forty-five,
On Sunday, when crowds didst swell and multiply.
We lodged within the Grand Tower, freshly renewed,
With kingly bed, and fridge of price untold.

Our view, most excellent, didst make our spirits soar,
For anniversary, 'twas gift beyond compare.
The spa, a haven, save for naked female form,
Within the women's hot tub, didst stir up alarm.

And found it similar in food and thrills.
But this, my friends, doth stand apart,
For 'tis open round the clock, a wondrous art.

A group of fifteen, we didst assemble,
And, fortunate souls, were seated straightway,
No reservations needed, praise the Lord,
For at peak dinner time, our hunger was stayed.

A pizza, with sausage, pepperoni, and mushroom,
We shared betwixt us, a veritable boon.
The crust, oh so delicious, a delight,
But the rest, alack, didst fall short of our sight.

The toppings, they didst fall off, alas,
And the dough, too soft, didst not pass.
But still, we found joy in the crust alone,
Eating it plain, like a sweet, sweet bone.

And found it cooked to perfection. Fries, a few more,

""Amidst the bustling streets of Pittsburgh, fair sir,  
I chanced upon this lodging, cozy and neat.  
Close to the city's heart, yet far enough away,  
To grant me free parking and a modest rate,  
Under a hundred crowns, a fair price to pay.  

The chamber, though small, served its purpose well,  
For I but sought repose within its walls.  
Cleanliness, that beauteous virtue, did abide,

Fear not, dear reader, for the Flamingo hath transformed, its decor now pleasing, the casino floor spotless, and fanny packs scarce. Methinks, too, that I might now condescend to bring a paramour, perchance even one I hold in esteem, and, withal, proclaim, 'Tush, why must we label our bond?'

Coco-nutty, thou sayest? Methinks 'tis true,

My Pho Tai, a feast fit for a king,
With beef aplenty, yet scant noodles did bring.

The cheese steak itself? Meat wasn't fatty or greasy, but a bit bland. Enjoyed the cheese whiz and the bread was great. Including onions would've made it tastier. Since eating it, I've felt a bit off, but that's not always a sign of whether I'd return if the food's good. (Masochist!)

Siam Terrace, a Thai restaurant in Urbana, is one of my favorites. Their red curry, my go-to dish, is a standout. Don't let that sway you, though - the rad nar, pad thai, and other options are also top-notch. It's not a five-star joint, but it's close. The atmosphere can feel a bit cramped with larger groups, but it's still a great spot. The appetizers are solid, with the shrimp being a highlight.

They got servers walking around with swords of meat, and you got a little disk to flip from red to green, meaning you're ready for more.

Worthy of return, I say! \nThen, the specials, one scallop dish for me, and sea bass for my mate, both bursting with flavor, freshness abounding, truly divine! \nBack I would go, in a trice, for such a feast! \nLocals, take note, T.Rewards card and NV ID, 25% off, a steal!

I headed to downtown Vegas for a show, stopped for grub at Bar + Bistro. My bad, it was First Friday in the Arts District, and they had a limited menu. Oh well.

I went for two tapas plates and a sweet treat. Started with their roasted tomato soup - damn good. Then, their 5 cheese mac and cheese, a mix of smoked gouda, sharp cheddar, fontina, Manchego, roasted tomato, piquillo peppers, and parmesan crisp. Gigli pasta. Tasty stuff.

Finished with a warm chocolate ganache cake. Also, damn good. Came with a tiny scoop of sorbet. Perfect.

Would've liked to try the full menu, but I still got a taste of their good eats. A bit pricey, maybe. Liked the decor though. Palettes for tables, metal wells. Thought I spilled something a few times, but it was just paint splatters. Got me every time.",True,Hemingway

I go for the Sesame Crusted Ahi Tuna, it's a real treat. Slaw's got a great taste, soy dressing, and a kick of wasabi. Not a fish place, but I'm on a seafood binge and their Blacked Fish Sandwich hits the spot. Cooked to perfection, love the sauce.

New, modern, and free from smoke and fumes,
A haven from the din and noise of town,
Where one might find some peace and quiet rest.

A lofty perch, with views of the city's sprawl,
And in the chamber, shades that closed with ease,
A spacious bath, and toilet that did flush with speed.

But alas, the prices in the marketplace,
Did border on the steep and rather high,
Yet still, a latte in the morn did grace,
My day with joy, and banished sleepy eyes.

No line, no fuss, just enter with ease,
And find a spot to sit, in peaceful repose.

The staff, so kind and courteous, too,
Even the go-go dancers, with moves anew.
Drinks strong and potent, a sight to see,
A place to relax, and let one's worries be.

Small, but cozy, the lounge may be,
Yet room enough, for all to be.
Behind the REVOLUTION letters, a bar,
For those who wish, to linger and tarry.

The DJ, alas, did make some mistakes,
Or perhaps, the tunes, not to my taste.
But still, a spot, to come and enjoy,
With friends, and laughter, to make some noise.

My friends and I, in finery, did dress,
But others, in casual attire, did address.
A mix of ages, the crowd did seem,
But all, in merriment, did gather and gleam.",True,Shakespeare

For lunch, so casual, after our workout's end?

JD, a cheese crisp, didst order, and I,
In jest, didst tease him, saying he didst diet.

Didst make mine eyes widen, and my words, didst last.
A thin tortilla, crispy, topped with melting gold,
Cut in squares, like pizza, easy to hold.

At a mere $25, Monday through Thursday's dinner fare is a bargain, and the additional $10 for weekend seafood is a small price to pay for such a feast. Compare it to the cost of a single entree and ale at establishments like Cheesecake Factory, and the value becomes clear. But what truly sets this spread apart is the boundless beer and wine, a veritable cornucopia of delights.

Their sushi and carving stations are numerous, catering to all tastes, and the vegetarian and health-conscious options abound.

The buffet itself is modern, inviting, and spotless, with nary an obstruction to mar the view of the Las Vegas strip.

In fair Las Vegas, where gambling doth reign,
A classic hotel doth stand, the Rio its name.
A place of rest, with comforts plenty,
Despite its age, modernity doth abound.

The buffets, oh how they doth delight,
A feast for eyes, a treat for appetite.
But alas, the line at check-in doth grow,
As weekenders flock, the crowds they do show.

Yet, staff doth bear it with grace and poise,
Their patience, a virtue, doth surprise.
For those who seek a respite from the fray,
The Rio, a haven, doth beckon thee away.

Though distant from the Strip, a trifle far,
Cabs, aplenty, doth wait, a ride to scar.

A place to rest, after a night of gain.

You should skip Panda Express and hit this place up instead. It's legit and affordable - five bucks for two items, and the portions are huge. Oh, and they'll fry your fish for free!""",True,Hemingway

Yeah, you heard me right. Crappers, know the odds. 'Til next time, steak ya later.""",True,Hemingway

Ahi and quesadilla were solid, and the tomato soup was a hearty bowl. Portions are huge, so sharing's a good idea. Prices are fair, service is prompt and friendly.

Not cheap, but a good deal for the Wynn. Pizza's decent too, uses Follow Your Heart instead of Daiya. I like it, good texture and taste. Our veggie pizza's topped with olives, onions, and roasted red peppers. Interesting combo, but not my favorite. Crust could be a bit softer too. Salad's alright, nothing special.

Last eve, our kin didst venture forth to dine
At North Lake Mall, where we didst find a place
To sate our hunger, and didst take our time
To savor each dish, and every morsel's grace.

The service there, it was quite swift and neat
Our orders taken at the counter, with speed
The fare, it was brought forth with great dispatch
And we didst feast, with joy and merriment.

My wife, she had the pulled pork plate
Whilst I, the half-chicken, didst partake
Our children, they didst have pork sandwich and fingers
Grilled, not fried, a healthier choice, it lingers.

All of us, we didst enjoy our repast
The portions, generous, and the taste, so vast
The BBQ sauces, three kinds, didst please our palate
Sweet tea, a perfect complement, didst satiate.

Self-service drinks, a convenience, indeed
Cleanliness, a virtue, the staff didst heed
Friendly and helpful, they didst attend
Our needs, with smiles, and diligence, they didst lend.

Four stars, I give, for excellence, it doth deserve
Above average, in all aspects, it doth preserve
We shall return, when next we are near
For more of that deliciousness, we hold dear.",True,Shakespeare

Forsooth, I do believe that such establishments, small and cozy as they may be, deserve their own set of guidelines when it comes to serving their patrons. In my experience, these humble abodes often operate at their own pace, forgetting or changing orders midstream, and treating their guests as if they were visiting their home, rather than a place of business. Memphis, for example, hath this very feel. Upon arriving promptly at opening time, we encountered certain...shall we say, ""speedbumps""? They were still counting change, setting up chairs, and preparing the day's fare. But fear not, dear reader! For the food, once it arrived, was truly delectable. My beef ribs, with their lovely pink ring, did scream of smoky goodness. And the coleslaw, unusual as it was, did please my palate mightily. Aye, 'twas mustard-based, with a sweet and sour flavor that complemented the dressing nicely. Alas, my husband did not share my enthusiasm for his pulled pork, finding the BBQ sauce too sweet and peppery. Ah well, perhaps he should have chosen the ribs instead.

Good entertainment, Jabbawockeez, dancers from Fantasy, flying Santas, makes it a fun event. Walking over the freeway on Sunset, not something you do every day.

Oh, how delicious, a true border,
Left me craving, more to savor.

But alas, the garlic, it did seep,
Into my pores, oh, how it clung,
Days passed, and still it did linger,

My family was hesitant, but once we walked in, they were impressed. The joint was big, well-laid out, and the decor wasn't half bad either. And the food? Top-notch. The only gripe I had was the fish fry. It took forever to come and no one asked if I wanted more. But hey, they were packed, so I'll give 'em a break. Can't wait to go back.""",True,Hemingway

The prices, steep they be, yet worth the cost,

Nor did they greet us with a fawning threat.

The woman working there told me they'd been open for five years, and I felt like a fool for not knowing about it sooner. The quantities of poke were small, but that was a good sign - it meant the fish was fresh. I'm not from Hawaii or an islander, but I could tell the difference between fresh and funky fish.

""Alas, my dearest, I must needs knock off a star,
For though the victuals be most wondrous fair,
The wait, alack, doth stretch on far too long,
A full hour and a half, ere we couldst partake.

And though I know the patio doth not take reservations,
Yet still, methinks 'tis somewhat passing strange,
To wait so long, when we have been here oft,
And found the service to be most excellent.

But, as I say, the food, it doth make up for't,
A steak, so tender, juicy, and divine,
My husband, he doth swear by skate, or short ribs,
And never have we had a poor waiter, or a frown.

So, if thou wishest to partake of their fine fare,
Prepare thyself for a wait, beyond compare,
But fear not, for 'tis worth the while, I do declare,
For though the wait be long, the food doth make it fair.""",True,Shakespeare

A haven of delight, where all doth farewell.
The staff, they doth excel, with friendliness and grace,

And off we went, to an enclosed room, to shoot and inspect.

Two others sought certification, a test they did take,
But I, in need of more practice, didst not partake.
Tourists abounded, which didst vex mine eyes,
I doth hope they open another place, for locals to prize.
Prices, too high, for those who do not know,
But classes, free, a gift, for those who do show.
On a Monday, at nine, I didst venture forth,
Not busy, but as the day wore on, a crowd didst gather beneath.

Verily, fair friends, we chanced upon this place,
Whose praise on Yelp did loudly sing its grace.
From Scottsdale, we didst journey to Tempe,
To partake of victuals and imbibe.

The doorman, with a query, didst ask my age,
And, knowing I was past three decades, didst engage
In pleasant conversation, wishing us delight.
The bartenders, too, didst tend to our each plight,
Asking oft if all was well, with cheerful sight.

A blue cheese burger, savory and fine,
Didst please my taste, and my boyfriend's, likewise divine.
He sampled beers, three in total, with glee,
And found them all to his liking, as bright as can be.

Our mood and purpose, in merry fruit.

Leith Links, a peaceful haven in north Edinburgh, offers a serene escape from the bustling city. Paths crisscross the expansive green space, playgrounds dot the landscape, and the atmosphere remains tranquil, even during busy times. Unlike the Meadows, Leith Links avoids crowds of picnicking students, providing a calmer environment for leisurely strolls, runs, or walking your furry friend. While the northeast corner may carry a slight scent due to nearby sewage works, the rest of the park delights the senses.

Allotments and a Children's Orchard thrive within the park's boundaries, adding vibrancy to the area. Visiting circuses and festivals like the Leith Festival in June and Edinburgh Mela in August further enliven the scene. Golf enthusiasts will appreciate that Leith Links, though no longer a golf course, holds the distinction of being the birthplace of golf's official rules. A unique blend of history and natural beauty, Leith Links beckons visitors to explore its charms.",True,Hemingway

""Forty pieces of silver, a princely sum indeed,  
Didst we pay for our repast, as we didst await,  
Our chamber, ready and prepared, they didst say.  
And so, to pass the time, we didst dine,  
Upon a salad, chopped and mixed with care,  
With celery, fresh peas, lettuce, bright and fair,  
And chicken, too, with herbs of sweetest savour,  
A feast for gods, and not just common folk, I swear.  
The dressing, light and tangy, didst please mine taste,  
And taco-like shell, with sesame seeds in haste.  
A marvel, indeed, this salad, worth the cost,  
Sixteen coins, a price most reasonable, I boast.  
But alas, dear friends, a cup of fries, so poor,  
Non crispy, flabby, and most certainly not worth,  
Four coins, a price most steep, I do declare,  
For such a meager portion, without compare.  
Yet still, in Vegas, all is possible, they say,  
So get thee to the Wynn, and taste their salad,  
Amazing, amazing, a culinary delight,  
By the poolside, a setting most fair and bright.""",True,Shakespeare

""Hark! We made a reservation on OpenTable for breakfast,
A wise decision indeed, for else we'd have waited in line,
For thirty minutes or more, a woeful fate.
But in we went, and lo, the tables were many,
Empty and waiting, a curious sight,
Forsooth, their line was long, and we did wonder why.

But since we came at ten and thirty,
We got to sample both breakfast and lunch,
A veritable feast, with dishes most delectable.
My mother, she was eager to try their macarons,
Alas, they failed her test, for they did not melt in her mouth,
But other sweets, they pleased her well,
The creme brulee, the fruit tart, they were quite swell.

Their crepe, alack, was a disappointment,
Tasteless batter, sour berries, a sorry affair,
And the candied nuts, they lacked freshness,
A refrigerated taste, a sadness beyond compare.

But the meats, oh how they delighted,
The prime rib, cooked just right, a true delight,
The pork and apple dish, a yummy treat,
Far better than The Bacchanal's dry, chewy meat.
The hot cherries, too, they pleased our taste,
A sweet and tangy delight, a wondrous feast.

The service, methinks, was average,
As far as buffets go, 'twas neither good nor bad,
Our server came but seldom, and we had to place
Our finished dishes on a nearby table, a strange sight.

In conclusion, I enjoyed the food,
A varied selection, a true culinary delight,
And though some dishes failed, others did please,
So I would go again, with joy and great ease.""",True,Shakespeare

Of the rivers flowing forth, and the incline doth rise and fall.  
Their beer, though not so diverse, didst please our taste,

Into a drinking hole, a place they call The Boozery.
The room was bare, the crowd was scant,
But service swift, the bartender quite gallant.

Tips on how to savor it, and drink it with decree.
The spot itself, within a container confined,
Yet outside, a charming patio, sunshine inclined.
A perfect perch, to watch the world go by,
And sip upon a dram, of fine Las Vegas rye.

""Hark! This place doth please, if thou hast great hunger and lovest meat. A salad bar there be, with artichokes, caprese, calamari, and more, a tasty complement to thy feast.

I would not recommend the seafood platter, my dear.

My love, he chose the all-you-can-eat meat, a wiser choice, methinks. A variety of lamb, sirloin, chicken, and more, didst they offer. My heart did sing for the lamb with balsamic reduction, tender and full of flavor. My love, he didst enjoy the spicy chicken, juicy and delicious, indeed.

""A sumptuous hotel, with rooms of grand proportion,
We arrived on Christmas Eve, with a special intention.
My love, a letter received, with an offer most fair,
Two nights, two tickets to Le Reve, and two meals to share.

The rate, two hundred ninety-nine, a bargain indeed,
And with premium seating, our experience to exceed.
Breakfast or lunch, a buffet spread,
Our hunger sated, our bellies fed.

But lo, a fee, a charge, a cost unfair,
For services unused, our anger to declare.
The internet, a necessity, we did not abuse,
Yet still, a fee, our patience to refuse.

A minor quibble, with the chambermaid,
Our room unkempt, our displeasure unveiled.
But all else, a satisfaction, a joy to behold,
Even the TV, with my love's name, a tale to be told.

Alas, the AC, a failing, a flaw,
The bedroom, a sauna, our sleep to raw.
We stripped, our nakedness, a solution to find,
For the heat, a torment, our rest to unwind.""",True,Shakespeare

Didst they massage, with skill and gentle ease.

That the masseuse, mayhap, couldst be less intense.

The victuals, in truth, didst resemble those of a tavern,

A tangier, fattier cut, with sauce that doth not overpower.
But still, a worthy meal, and one I wouldst not disavow.

The cornbread, too, didst please, though not quite so well,
For it lacked that certain je ne sais quoi, that special zest.
And, verily! The hot sauce didst prove a bit too much,
O'erwhelming the taste buds, leaving naught but a bitter touch.

And ribeye, tenderloin, all didst please mine eye.
Sweet potatoes, too, though not so sweet,
Yet still, a worthy dish, to mine own conceit.

Fried green tomatoes, oh, how they didst delight,
With balsamic dressing, a most curious sight.
Chicken, blandish, yet paired well, I must confess,
With fried and balsamic, a most curious mess.

The view, by night, o'erlooks the pool, most fair,

Give it four stars, on a scale of fast food places.""",True,Hemingway

""Saddle Ranch ain't your typical restaurant, gotta give 'em that. Mechanical bull in the middle, skimpy shirts and fake racks everywhere. People gettin' tossed left and right, pure entertainment.

""A warehouse of shoes, as large as a small mart,
With footwear for men and women, a veritable smart.
Organized by style, the shoes were on display,
Boots, laceups, slip-ons, a sight to behold, in array.
My feet, of average size, found solace in the fact,
That shoes in my size, were not hard to attract.

After much deliberation, two pairs I did select,
And off I went, to test their comfort, with great expect.
But lo, their clearance rack, did catch my eye,
A pair in my size, at a discount, did lie.
A name brand, Timberlake, at 20% off, a steal,
I purchased it, with a smile, and a heart that did feel.

At Off Broadway, rewards they do give,
A 10% coupon, for your next purchase, to live.
I doubt I'll return, with coupon in hand,
But who knows, fate, may take a different stand.""",True,Shakespeare

The shrimps, they were so succulent and sweet,
I could not help but pilfer them, oh so discreet.

And friendly faces, didst make haste.
A goodly spot, for authentic Vietnamese delight,
I shall return, with joy and great delight.

Pros there be, three in number, I say,

And hummus, oh so tasty, with pita bread anew.

Had to ask for milk because some desserts were too creamy or sugary (weird, since I've never thought something was too sugary)...left about thirty minutes after dinner started, didn't notice much of a change in what was being served.

With private lot, a rarity, I say,
And Wi-Fi free, a bonus, come what may.

With ten small tables, inside and out.
A roasting machine, a treat, didst meet,
For coffee fans, a joy, no doubt.

My taste, sweet and strong, doth crave,
Like Cuban brew, a flavor, not a wave.
But hazelnut cold brew, I didst choose,
A mistake, perchance, yet still, it does.

To research, I came, with time to spare,
Three hours passed, with thoughts to share.
A Chai iced latte, lemon poppy muffin,
Didst order, with anticipation, tuffin.

The latte, good, yet not a must,
In my drink list, a maybe, just.

A reason, sure, to return in sight.

Sushi, a disappointment, so I did hear,

For rich and creamy, it doth overflow,

My comrades and I didst seek refuge from the din and noise,
In a tavern, where we might find solace and a moment's peace.

Our arrival, at ten o'clock, didst coincide with a lull in trade,
And thus, we found ourselves ignored, as if by fate's decree.

And with a smile, didst take our order, banishing all fear.

Their menu, vast and varied, didst cater to each whim,

For chili, that dish most vile, didst leave a foul taste in my mouth,
But, lo! The salads, numerous and fresh, didst make amends, no doubt.

Thursdays, they do offer, a dish most fair and bright,
A BBQ chicken, served o'er cold soba noodles, a wondrous sight.
The marinade, a blend of sweet and salt, didst evoke Chinese delight,
And the half-portion, eight dollars ninety-five, didst fill me with cheer.

Ah, but the fries, oh how they didst tempt me,
Thick-cut and golden, a delicacy, indeed,
I could not resist, and thus, didst partake,
A sinful indulgence, yet, a joy, indeed.

And thus, we dined, and laughed, and made merry,
Whilst the music, of the nineties, didst play on,

Took my hubs and sire in for luncheon,
And strange it was, no pizza we didst consume,
But wings of buffalo, we didst decide,
And a steak frites sub, a special, we didst choose.

My sire, a chili cheese hot dog, didst devour,
With fries, of course, to satisfy his lust.
The wings, cooked hot, were quite divine,
Just as I like them, crispy and fine.

My father, his hot dog, didst enjoy,
With chili, cheese, pickles, onions, and jalapenos,
But alas, his fries, were not to his liking,
For they were thin, and lacking in flavor, I reckon.

The steak frites sub, a monstrous roll,
Coated with cheese, and filled with beef,
Garlicky and tender, creamy horseradish,
And skinny fries, that didst complement its richness.
A side of peppery gravy, to drizzle on top,
Didst make the sandwich, a culinary hop.

For renovations, they say. Aye, 'tis true,
The prices be a mite steep, yet for the cost,
Thou dost receive a pleasant seat, and salsa of the finest sort.

E'en for a short lunch time, as mine own doth be.
But, alack! The food, it doth leave something to desire,
For though the sides be fine, the protein doth lack fire.

Of PetSmart, where I've oft set sail,
For treats and toys and sustenance fine,
To keep my pup, Howie, in prime line.

A fortnight past, I've visited thrice,
With Howie in tow, my loyal vice,
He dines on Blue Buffalo, the best,
No soy, no gluten, nor corn, I protest.

Pricey, some say, but worth the fee,
For healthy food, both for him and me,
The toys, alas, leave much to seek,
Few choices there, for one to speak.

And collars, leashes, oh so dear,
For boy dogs, options scarce, I fear,
In colors that complement his hide,
My wish, for him to strut with pride.

The staff, kind souls, with training skill,
Have helped me much, their love to fulfill,
But take Howie inside, I dare not do,
For illness lurks, from creature to creature anew.

So, home he stays, while I shop apart,
For his health, safety, and peace of heart.""",True,Shakespeare

Did taste as if a piece of wood were consumed.
Yet, no high-handedness didst the server show,
For she did take it back and prepare another dish, as requested, with nary a frown or slow.

The chacatuire, a delightful appetizer,
Was served with fried Brussels sprouts, a tasty treat.
The main course, a special strip, so tender and juicy,
Did satisfy mine hunger and leave me feeling quite sprightly.

But, alack, the waygu, oh so fatty and bland,
Did detract from the meal, leaving a bad taste in mine hand.

Yet, fear not, dear friends, for dessert did save the day,
Chocolate pecan pie and mousse, both doth convey
A taste so sweet and rich, we did crave more,
And nearly ordered another, such was our desire.

This place, a gem in our fair city's crown,
Doth deliver a dining experience most renowned.
Karen, our waitress, a true delight,
And my friend from Cincinnati, in awe, did say,
'Twas naught but envy, for in his city, none could compare,
To Meat and Potatoes, a true culinary lair.""",True,Shakespeare

""In days of yore, ere Whole Foods graced our fair city's bounds,
I chased each store with zeal, as if 'twere a noble crown.

And though this place be new, my interest doth not slack.

The outdoor seat, on second floor, a pleasant sight,
Did make me wish for spring, and sunshine bright.
A deal, four salads for four coins, a bargain rare,
Yet soups, aplenty, did my heart with joy fill.

Alas, hot dishes, cold, a letdown, I must confess,
But parking, ample, down below, did ease my stress.""",True,Shakespeare

Amidst the splendor of the Palazzo's halls,
We tarried for a night or two, my friends and I,
Then descended upon the Cosmopolitan's walls,
To sample its wares and gauge its vaunted pride.

A far cry from the tawdry, overwrought decor
That plagues the Strip's more garish venues, this place
Exudes an air of elegance and modernity,
With nary a tacky statue nor kitschy grace.

The rooms, a haven of refreshment and delight,
Invite one to linger, free from stress and fright,
While the casino's ambiance, though pricey, feels right,
A cosmopolitan blend of style and excitement bright.

In Citycenter's heart, the Cosmo stands apart,
A beacon of sophistication, for those who seek
A respite from the Strip's more crassy, boisterous art,
And wish to indulge in finer pleasures, without meek.",True,Shakespeare

Great pleasure in the victuals they do serve.
Apart from the bar, a separate space they do keep,
For dining, where one may savor each delicious bite.
Their burgers, diverse in style and form, do please,
And in the dining room, a large screen doth play,
Whereon we watched a game of hockey, full of delight.
On Mondays, verily, the burgers be but five,
A price most fair, methinks, for such a feast.
Yet, were they eight or eleven, I would not pay,
For that, my friends, doth seem a bit too much to me.""",True,Shakespeare

For this establishment doth not meet my high standards.
Though 'twas easy to secure a table on the Lord's day,

The servants, attentive and diligent in their duties,

I ordered the steak bernaise, a dish most divine,
With its lemony buttery sauce, a true culinary delight.
Alas, the sirloin meat, though thin and tender,
Was a tad chewy, and required some effort to consume.
A veritable mountain of fries did they bring forth,
A worthy accompaniment to our hearty repast.
Yet, I must aver, fair friends, 'tis not worth the cost,
For though the meal was good, 'twas not of the highest quality.
And as for dessert, alack! The apple tartin,
A dish we had anticipated with great relish, did disappoint.

We sent it back and it was quickly corrected. \n\nWe started with Tuna Poke and a Signature Roll, both delicious. For entrees, we had Braised Short Ribs, Seared Sea Scallops, Blackened Island Ahi, and Tempura California White Sea Bass. All were cooked to perfection and tasted great. While the food and service were excellent, Roy's still felt like a chain restaurant. Maybe it was the decor, the number of tables, the scent, or the lighting.

One of them, with haste, did drive to fetch,
The very motor, that I might possess,
And thus, with speed, my need was met,
Their kindness too, didst not forget.
A capacitor, they offered free,
But alas, 'twas not necessity.

Alas, a week didst pass, ere I didst pay,
For they didst not say, up front, the way,
A simple miscommunication, methinks,
Yet, naught but praise, their service links.

But alas, I must admit, I felt a bit deceived,
For all I had, was potatoes and corn bread, and naught else did I perceive.
And yet, we paid a sum of thirty pieces of silver,
For what seemed to me, a paltry meal, and nothing more, nor less.

But fear not, dear friends, for I shall give thee a chance,
To redeem thyself, and prove thy worth, in this dance.
For I didst espy, the BBQ, which didst seem most fair,
And the aroma that didst waft, didst stir my hunger, beyond compare.

The atmosphere within, was homey and warm,
And the folk, didst bustle about, with nary a storm.
The cornbread and honey butter, didst taste most sweet,
And I didst covet, a pan of it, to savor and to eat.

In conclusion, dear friends, the price didst seem a bit steep,

Rolled into town on a Saturday night, drove 16 hours to get there. Car's giving me some nonsense about oil and coolant. Used cars are cheaper than new ones, so I figure I'll give the green car a drink. Top off the coolant with some stuff I bought at the gas station. Then panic sets in. Grab the manual, search forums for specific requirements for my aging road beast. Think I put in the wrong kind of coolant. Keep reading about colors and brand benefits. Head to Zimbrick, Bryan's awesome, friendly, and patient. He checks the coolant supply I have against what the service folks have in bulk. Good to go, no danger. Talk oil and other road-preparedness details I shouldn't skip. He grabs the oil grade I need, checks levels, compliments my ride, and I prep the wallet. Ask how much I owe. Transaction ends with a smile, handshake, and sincere thanks. I'm in love.",True,Hemingway

The veggies were sautéed to perfection, the meat was tender like cotton candy.  The appetizer platter was a trip to heaven.  Spice level?  I treat it like dressing up - easier to add than take away, just like Coco Chanel said.  I ordered three entrees, and the flavors weren't hidden in the heat.  Can't wait to go back for more.  No booze served there, which is a good thing.  You wouldn't want to miss out on the aroma, taste, and presentation.  Highly recommend the Thai Iced Tea.

The marina's where we keep our boat, and we're members too. It's a real nice place, laid back, you know? Only thing is, sometimes the shuttle service can be a bit of a wait, but they got call boxes at both ends of the walkway, so that's good. Being members, we got access to private showers, BBQ area, washers and dryers, power and water hookups, and we even get two free bags of ice every day. Staff's real friendly too, always willing to help out. Feels like one big family here, never had any problems with theft or nothing. Just a chill place, except for them party weekends, but that's okay too. I reckon this marina's better than Scorpion Bay, just based on how laid back and personable it is. Been to Scorpion Bay a few times, and it just feels a bit too uptight for me. Plus, there's always cops driving around, gives me the uneasy feeling. If you're gonna get a slip here, make sure to talk to Shannon, she knows what's up.",True,Hemingway

""Ran into Slade, Donna, and Nancy at a Suns Fundraiser at the W hotel. They were serving some new treats, and damn, they were good! Slade convinced me to try the salted caramel, one of their new gourmet chocolates. It was bite-sized, so I didn't feel too guilty, but it was smooth, creamy, salty, sweet, and chocolatey all in one bite. Yum! Should've stopped there, but their new gourmet candy bars were calling my name. Had to try the 'Rocky Rhode' special. It was a bit bigger, like half a candy bar, and I devoured it. Here's how they described it: 'a wickedly sinful twist on the classic rocky road. beautiful classic flavors based on a rich milk and white chocolate peanut butter ganache and finished off with toasted marshmallows and candied pecans.' One of the most sinfully delicious gourmet treats I've ever had! Check out Wicked's new creations, and FYI, they're changing their name to Wicked Kitchen Gourmet. Old skool or new skool, it's all wickedly amazing!""",True,Hemingway

Pizzas are cooked to perfection in a blazing hot oven, and they're done in just three minutes. Never had trouble finding a seat, even when the line's out the door.

The must-try dish is the tofu flower with spicy Szechuan sauce. It comes with pork or chicken in a broth of dried, fried whole chilies. It's not as big as it used to be, but still plenty of food. Worth every bit of pain you'll feel the next day. You might even learn to like it. Ask for a side of steamed broccoli (not on the menu) to go with it. Other home runs include the seafood sizzling rice, cumin beef, Szechuan peppercorn anything, green beans and pork, and the shallot beef. All top-notch. Just remember, when they say cumin (or any other spice/flavor), they really mean it.

We left after ten minutes, disappointed by the warm room and lack of a reserved table. But Bill, the manager, convinced us to stay and went all out to make us feel welcome. It was our best meal in Vegas. The pretzel bread was delicious, and the ginger and rum cocktail was a perfect start. The Gypsy and Martini dishes were prepared with care, and the creamed eggplant salad was a delight. The Cioppino was superb, with M enjoying the best FG - one seared, one mousse, and diverse scallops with pork belly.

This place, it's like the seventies all over again. Wood paneling, that funny orange color, and a little bit of tacky thrown in. Eatin' here's been good so far. Girls are friendly, place is clean, service is quick and efficient. Only been here for lunch, that's my only experience. No happy hour, no dinner, no weekends. My only gripe's the carry-out service.

And let me tell ya, The Parlor never disappoints. I've had some amazing meals there, and I'm always raving about their seasonal menu items. Sure, every restaurant has an off day now and then, but I've never had a bad meal at The Parlor. And let me tell ya, their Caesar salad is the best in the valley. It's a simple dish, but most places screw it up. They try to deconstruct it or add their own twist, and it just doesn't work. But The Parlor gets it right. They keep it real. Crunchy croutons, creamy parmesan and anchovy emulsion, fresh romaine. That's how you do a Caesar salad. Other Phoenix restaurants, take note. Don't mess with perfection.

They helped us sort out his thyroid issue, he was shedding bad and losing weight. Fair prices, too. Give 'em a shot. Dr. White's top-notch.""",True,Hemingway

Except this one place, their suicide wings were real. Hot sauce forums, that's where I found 'em. $15 challenge, 10 wings in 10 minutes. Prize? Two hours of speaking in tongues and humming a Johnny Cash tune. Plus, a picture on the wall and a T-shirt. Awesome way to spend 20-30 minutes. They got Zombie wings too, for when you don't need no T-shirt. Hellzapoppin burger, nice people, quick, hot, correct. 5/5 on heat, 4/5 on food, 5/5 value. 4.7 stars, rounded up.""",True,Hemingway

The bisque was pure perfection, we shared it in four little cups. I had the wagyu skirtsteak, best damn steak I've ever had. Yukon potatoes were amazing, fries were on point. For dessert, get the monkeybread, it's incredible. Pecan/brown sugar ice cream is a game-changer. Chocolate tart was meh, didn't like the maple bacon ice cream.

""This outfit was top-notch. If you're in the market for a quality window supplier at a fair price and total satisfaction, give 'em a look. No sales pitch necessary. Cody, the big cheese, was cordial and knew his stuff. Chris, the head honcho, came by to measure up four windows. Final cost from Cody was more than reasonable, especially since they had their own crew and we'd be dealin' direct with any issues or warranty biz. Installation day, Chris and Tim showed up on time, got the job done quick and clean, and left the place spotless. We gave 'em the once-over and they passed with flyin' colors.

Two other rooms on the 33rd floor were connected to ours, and our pals snagged 'em. We had a blast, man. Great view, too, just a stone's throw from the Miracle Mile Shops. Planet Hollywood Casino, Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, and The Paris were all within spittin' distance. And all the grub spots, too. Cheap, man. Real cheap. \n\nThe joint was decked out in modern/contemporary style, all red, white, and black. Young crowd, mostly, but who cares? We paid about $150 for three nights, and that was with one of our buddy's discounts. Sweet deal, dude. We partied hard in the suite and on the strip.

You'll pull over when the GPS tells you to, double-checking the address. ""This can't be it,"" you'll think, expecting a wine cellar but finding a small liquor store instead. But don't let appearances deceive you. Stay true, and you'll discover a hidden staircase leading down. It may seem sketchy, but trust me, it's worth it. Downstairs, you'll find a cozy wine bar that feels like a real-life Narnia. And that's not all - there's a lounge area with live music, though I've yet to catch a performance myself. Their wine selection is impressive, and the beer menu, though limited, offers some unique choices. I can't speak for the crowd, but the atmosphere is top-notch.

""Colectivo, a coffee shop that's a must-visit for me. I'm not a morning person, but for this place, I'll rise early. Two days in a row, I woke at 5 AM to grab a single or double espresso as soon as they open. The atmosphere's perfect - just the right amount of seats, great ambiance. \n\nThe internet's top-notch, better than most coffee shops in town. No limits for two hours, YouTube loads quickly. Great for working in the morning. \n\nThe service is excellent, the barista and staff are friendly. I've been productive, reading, writing, and revising my proposal there. Happy! \n\nIf you see a lady with a colorful scarf, say hi! She's always in a good mood, even with books and a long paper. Thanks, Colectivo!""",True,Hemingway

""Late night in Scottsdale, the missus and I were hankerin' for some pizza. Didn't wanna eat in no club central, so we busted out the ol' iPhone and Yelped ourselves to KISS. Open late, park in the lot, and friendly service. Now, I was a mite skeptical, but that cheese pizza hit the spot. Chunky sauce, love in every bite. Guy's got skills, no doubt. Only open Fri and Sat, but that's how they keep it real. Food's too good, they sell like hotcakes. Me and the wife, we'll be back. KISS Back East Pizza and Beef Joint, it's the real deal.""",True,Hemingway

""Great spot! Stumbled upon it by chance, new to Phoenix. Menu looked good, so we went for three tacos and a bottle of water. Five bucks total, cash only. Tax included. I had two chicken tacos, wife went for fish. Big, juicy tacos. Beans, cheese, tomatoes, onions, cabbage, rice, and your choice of meat. Green sauce and red salsa on the side. Not like those puny Taco Bell tacos. These were massive and delicious! Wife loved her fish, I loved my chicken. Can't wait to come back. Only thing missing was black beans instead of pinto. But that's an easy fix for next time.""",True,Hemingway

""Service was top-notch. Teppan chef, a South American gent, was kind and generous. Calamari, fresh and delicious. Shrimp appetizer, a pleasant surprise. Unique teppan experience, noodles served before rice. Rice, the best part, arrived last. Felt guilty not finishing it, but too full. Happy hour prices, reasonable. Ordered shrimp tempura sushi, large and fresh. All you can eat tempting, but opted for happy hour teppan. Ended up costing less. Budget-friendly decision. Definitely coming back.""",True,Hemingway

""Loved the Farm Kitchen at S. Mountain. This place is a little slice of heaven, a real piece of small town USA. Great spot to bring family, friends, or out-of-towners, especially for the kids. The whole place is open, so you can wander around and check out the farm, chickens and all. Was bummed about the long wait for breakfast, but glad we found The Farm Kitchen. Cozy little cottage with a variety of sandwiches, salads, and baked goods, all made with fresh ingredients grown on site. Ordered a few sandwiches, pasta salad, and mushroom soup. Everything was top-notch. Prices were a bit steep, around $12-$15 per person with a drink and side, but worth it for a change of scenery and a few hours away from the city.""",True,Hemingway

""David's Hamburgers and Mexican Food in Scottsdale served up some good grub. The joint's a cozy little 50's spot, clean but not spotless. I ordered the guacamole burger with pepper jack cheese, bacon, lettuce, and tomatoes. Fries, onion rings, or cole slaw come with the burger. I went with fries and a Dr. Pepper. The fries were decent, nothing special. The burger was cooked just right, guacamole was top-notch. Service was top-notch too. My server, a grey-haired, bespectacled gent, gave me phenomenal service. Friendly, knowledgeable, attentive, and professional. He kept my drink full and even hooked me up with a to-go cup. I'll be back, thanks to him. All in all, good food, nice building, great service.

Japanese-Italian place next door, want to try next time. Minimalist decor, designer restroom, nice. Akami, meaty dreams. Not a fan of fatty tuna. Ask for house blend plum sake bottle, not aperitif or champagne flutes. Fish top-quality, generous cuts. Wasabi served, soy sauce complementary. No spicy tuna, wah.""",True,Hemingway

""Heard about this joint called Slidin' Thru Truck, been wantin' to check it out for a bit. Finally found the place, tucked away in some business park. Looks like a dive, but don't let that fool ya. Food's top-notch. Menu's simple, just sliders and fries, but they do 'em right. Had the barby, yaya, and pep pep sliders. Each one's got its own flavor, and they're all good. Barby's got that BBQ vibe, yaya's Greek, and pep pep's like a cheesy, bacon-wrapped dream. Don't be fooled by their size, either. Three of 'em filled me up good. Sweet potato fries are a nice touch, too. Cinnamon sugar's a surprise, but it works. Place itself is cozy, staff's friendly, and they got themselves an NBA Jam machine. Free play, baby! Definitely comin' back for more.""",True,Hemingway

Gave me a food hack too—chicken sandwich with Paris toppings. Home, devoured the burger—not usually a grass fed guy. Now I'm thinkin' 'bout the chicken sandwich with Paris toppings.
