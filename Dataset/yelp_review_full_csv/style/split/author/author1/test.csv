""Birthday stay turned sour. $800 in'savings'? More like false promises. Free dinner, but that's where the perks ended. No fridge, no microwave, and hellish elevators. Random guests banging on my door every two hours, looking for drugs. 'Not my problem, buddy. Try the rappers next door.' Overpriced convenience store. Basic needs cost an arm and a leg. Walking shoes recommended, not heels. Lesson learned.""",True,Hemingway

""Went to the Wells Fargo branch to settle some affairs of my late husband's. Asked for help, but they wouldn't give it. Said it was up to the manager's discretion, whatever that means. Called their customer service, got some runaround about federal regulations. They wouldn't even take checks from a government agency or recognize court documents. What a joke. That place is toxic. Closed my accounts and said goodbye to Wells Fargo for good.""",True,Hemingway

""Bouchon used to be one of my top picks in Vegas. Not anymore. Tonight sealed the deal. Our party of six sent two entrees back - both short ribs, fatty as hell. Replaced 'em with lamb and strip steak. Better, but still subpar for a place with Keller's rep. Other dishes? Meh. Duck, gnocchi, forgettable. Overpriced too. Bouchon needs to step up its game. Won't be going back.""",True,Hemingway

""Mind playing tricks, wondering if real or fantasy. Bought detailing package for mid-size SUV through Groupon. Impossible to reach them, like grasping at air.

""Terrible service at 3 PM on a slow day. No one checked on us for 15 minutes, and we stood up front waiting. Once seated, Luke, our server, was great. He made solid drink and taco recommendations. The street corn appetizer was a waste of four bucks. Small, oily, and lacking flavor. I expected more for the price. I had shrimp and Al Pastor tacos with saffron rice and burnt plantains. The tacos were decent, but the plantains were overcooked and stuck together. The saffron rice had hard rice clusters. Disappointing experience overall. Giving the South Park location a try.""",True,Hemingway

""Four years passed before I returned to that accursed restaurant. The Bloody Mary, once a delight, had become a bitter disappointment. It left me heaving at the airport, and the memories still lingered upon my return home. Sigi, our charming server, couldn't salvage the disaster. The food, covered in sterling silver, resembled a failed art project from a preschooler's hand. My chicken noodle soup? Sweet and unappetizing, with undercooked pasta and dirty carrots. Spicy buffalo wings? Dry and flavorless, breaking apart into soft lumps. Even a seasoned inmate would turn up their nose. I suffered for twelve hours afterward, regretting my decision to dine there. Skip America, indeed.""",True,Hemingway

""Techno beat pulsed through my skull like a jackhammer, relentless and unforgiving. No respite, no variation, just the same monotonous rhythm that made me want to pull my hair out. And don't even get me started on the lack of R&B or hip-hop. It was like they were trying to torture me with their narrow-minded playlist. I mean, what kind of establishment doesn't have some sort of diversity in their music selection? It was like they were trying to drive me insane. Needless to say, I didn't stick around too long.""",True,Hemingway

""Lost? Get outta here, pronto! This joint's poison, the grub'll rot yer gut and the hooch'll turn yer brain to mush. They call it a 'holiday menu,' but it's just a buncha hooey at $35 ($45 with taxes and tips). Total rip-off.""",True,Hemingway

""Hundreds of restaurants, seen 'em all. But this one? Worst. Thirty seconds in, felt like they didn't care. Twenty minutes to get acknowledged? Ridiculous. Saw other couples get the same treatment.

Avoid this dump at all costs.""",True,Hemingway

""Aria's buffet? Forget it. Waste of time and money. Water didn't arrive 'til we finished eating. Waitress? Pushy, rude. Only thing she said was 'want wine?' The spread was small, food was bland.

""I got a 'lean machine' from some joint, and man, it was vile. Tasted like they dumped a whole pharmacy into it. Made my hairs stand up and gave me the shakes. I tried mixin' it up, but no dice.

""Sunday night, 7pm. Place was dead. Took 'em a while to seat us. Tea came slow. Bread too. Waited 35 minutes for basic grub. My wife, she got mad. We bounced.

Next door to Cheddars, had a real meal.""",True,Hemingway

""Hell's bells, I never thought I'd find myself at a joint that sucked this bad. The security? Total butt-suckers. Rude as hell, unfriendly as a rabid dog. I've been to high-end clubs, dive bars, hired and fired security, but this place takes the cake. They're so rude, it's laughable. Got shoved outta there, hard. Some fat dude pinched my arm and told me I was getting escorted out 'cause I had my boot off and couldn't put it back on ( thanks to the crowd floating in the air). What the actual hell? Been to exclusive clubs in London and NY, this place is worse than a finger up my butt. I'd rather have my butt hair plucked than go back there. It's a damn shame, too. Great setting, awesome dancers, fantastic DJ, nice promoters, bartenders with smiles. But those security jerks? No way, man. Never going back, and neither should you.""",True,Hemingway

""Avoid this airport like the plague. Terminals spread out like a damn army base. People movers? Forget about 'em. Broken more often than not. Bathrooms? Don't even think about it.

""Mia Za's screwed up our order again. Last time, they added nuts to my wife's salad. I told 'em she's allergic. They took it back, picked the nuts off, and brought it back. Not good enough. I told 'em to make a new one. They got snotty with me.""",True,Hemingway

""Took the fam to this joint for Mother's Day, and boy, was it a bust. They were understaffed, overbooked, and the heat was sweltering. Fans were busted, misters weren't working yet. Servers were too busy to even fill our water glasses. And we had to wait 30 minutes for our table, which was just a generic, mass-produced mess. To top it off, the hostess burst into the bathroom, letting out a colorful language when she found both stalls occupied. Problem was, my five-year-old niece was in one of 'em. Staff's behavior? Manic and panicked. Sorry to give 'em a bad review, but they let me down hard.""",True,Hemingway

""Bought a Groupon for this joint, good reviews and all. Stylist seemed green, real shaky. Like it was their first time cutting hair. \n\nSo I ask about the original price, wanna tip right, you know? Receptionist says $35. My Groupon was $30, supposed to be worth $70. Damn, I saved five bucks. \n\nThing is, they gotta give Groupon clients the same service as regulars.

""I ain't gonna lie, I regret spendin' my cash at that joint. But I learned my lesson, and I won't be steppin' foot in there again. The grub was subpar (Pinky's up the street serves way better fare), the service was crummy (slow and snotty), and the management? Forget about it. If anyone asks, I'll send 'em to Pinky's and make sure my foodie pals know where to grab a real burger on Montford. Don't waste your dough...\n\nAnd let me tell you, those reviewers who claim they've got great burgers clearly haven't been to Brooks (Charlotte's answer to Price's Chicken Coop) or The Liberty (high-end burgers that'll blow your mind).

""Food unfit for an emperor, cook deserves beheading. Buffet in Imperial Palace, long walk from Vegas strip. Waste of time, should've checked Yelp first.

No stars, wouldn't return.""",True,Hemingway

""I stepped into the salon, already feeling uneasy. Asked for a full set with polish, but the man said no. I was upset, but kept quiet. Earlier that day, I had called to confirm they took Discover. When I went to pay with my debit card, they said they didn't accept it. Unbelievable. I handed over a different card and left a five-dollar tip in cash. My nails looked uneven and not what I wanted. Never going back to that dump. The place was old, dirty, and tacky. Horrible customer service and questionable hygiene. Not worth the cheap price.""",True,Hemingway

""Reserved a table, had other plans. Got there, waited twenty minutes. They said the folks at our table weren't done yet. Like they got just one table. Told 'em we were short on time.

""Vegas and Summerlin. Not exactly known for authentic Korean cuisine. But still, you'd think they could get the basics right. Like gochujang sauce for bibim bap. A staple, for crying out loud!

I reminded her that I had already explained my reason for coming to the receptionist. Her excuse was that the girl I spoke to was new and had been left alone for a week. Unbelievable. Now I have to go elsewhere for the test. Lesson learned: be explicit about your needs and double-check they understand them.""",True,Hemingway

""Ramen bowl, inedible broth. Tasted like water and oil. No condiments on the table. Took 15 minutes to flag someone down for soy sauce. Total rip off for $12. Inauthentic and not palatable without loads of condiments. Go to Umami or Ha Long Bay for better, cheaper noodles.""",True,Hemingway

Don't know any waiter who'd work with just three tables for a decent night's pay. Waited forty-five minutes, finally got sat down. Food took an hour, still didn't get our drinks 'cause the waitress never came back after we ordered. Maybe she was on her period. Food was good, but overpriced for the small portion. Not worth it after two and a half hours.""",True,Hemingway

Not going back, wouldn't recommend it either.""",True,Hemingway

""I've been in this store twice, and both times I've been let down. Last time, they showed me a tiny pink gun, like I'm some kind of joke. This time, I came because their website said they had a full selection of 5.11 gear. But all we found was one polo shirt. And get this - they still had a sign up for a 2-day sale from May, and it's now June. Not a single employee bothered to talk to us. I'll stick to other stores, where they know how to treat customers right.""",True,Hemingway

But they were dry, like the cook didn't know what they were doin' or the meat just wasn't good. My buddy said the regular burgers were better than the game meats. Salmon burger was alright too.

""Phoenix restaurants ain't impressed me much. Latest place, service was piss poor. Server's visits were brief, like they had somewhere better to be. We'd ask for stuff, they'd vanish, leaving us hanging. Food arrived, decent. Turkey eggs benedict, potatoes, fresh fruit. But that's where the good ended. No utensils, no condiments, no coffee refills. Place needs a total staff overhaul. Food ain't enough to keep 'em afloat.""",True,Hemingway

""Austin girl, transplanted. Cravin' a taste of home, saw reviews. Atmosphere, great. Waitress, surly. Food, terrible. Disclaimer on menu, no seasonin' meat? Ridiculous condiments. Chicken fried steak, disappointin'. Not authentic. Tasted like cube steak dipped in flour/water paste, deep fried. No self-respectin' Texan would do that. Pepporcini pepper sauce or Cholula sauce, no way. Meat, unseasoned. Chicken tenders, potatoes, biscuits, tasteless. Couldn't eat it, love fried food. Felt bad for 'em, lotta food left.

The sun beat down on my neck as I stood in the Home Depot parking lot, waiting for someone - anyone - to come and assist me in the electrical department. Thirty minutes passed, and not a single soul had bothered to lift a finger. Finally, a customer service representative sauntered over, a look of indifference plastered across his face.

""I paged the person,"" he said, as if that were some sort of accomplishment. ""What else can I do?""

I glared at him, my anger simmering just below the surface. ""You can start by getting me some help,"" I snapped. ""I've been standing here for half an hour, and no one has bothered to even acknowledge me.""

The representative shrugged, clearly unbothered by my plight. ""Sorry to hear that. Maybe you should try the Val Vista store. They might be able to help you out.""

I shook my head, incredulous. ""You're telling me to go to another store? After I've already wasted thirty minutes of my time waiting for someone to help me here?""

""Staff at check-in was top-notch, but the view from outside was just alright. Room had some issues - electrical switches were hanging loose, paint was peeling everywhere, and the shower was a mess. Caulking was coming off, too. Not worth the price, if you ask me. TV was an old flat screen, and only half the channels worked. Breakfast was subpar, and they didn't clean up the tables, so nowhere to sit and eat. Pool area was cordoned off, and the parking lot had big chunks closed off, too. All in all, a bust. Wouldn't recommend it. When I checked out, the girl just said 'you're good to go' and kept eating her breakfast before walking away. Didn't even ask how my stay was.""",True,Hemingway

He compares himself to a skilled doctor, despite being unpleasant. My knee works great, he says. 

Since then, the owner has contacted me multiple times, trying to convince me to change my review. I find his approach inappropriate and borderline harassment. I declined his offer of a refund.

Thick and dime-sized, not exactly Italian. And don't even get me started on the single, dried-out basil leaf. I could whip up a better pizza with a Pillsbury biscuit, ketchup, and Kraft cheese. And don't even get me started on the lack of ranch dressing. People, this is just another chain restaurant with a gimmick. Don't fall for it.

I get it, I used to smoke too, but if you ask for a non-smoking room, it shouldn't smell like someone's hiding in there, puffing away. Made for a rough stay, especially with allergies. Shuttle drops you off a block away, you gotta lug your bags to the back entrance.

""Living in Henderson, I'm on the road near weekly. TSA's a crapshoot, mostly misses. Good luck with that. My gripe's with TSA Pre-Check. I use the tram at Gate C, easy peasy since I don't check bags. But they don't offer Pre-Check, though they do at D gates next to C. They tried, then stopped. Last time I went through D, a TSA agent let me into C. Nobody showed. Two agents came in, I tried to leave, and I got an earful: 'WHERE ARE YOU GOING!?' Condescending, too. Showed my pass, of course. Next time, they blocked C gate passengers. Now, I hit the main C-Gate (Southwest) security area. Show my pass, get pointed to a special line that snakes along the wall to ONE TSA agent at a TSA PREcheck booth. It's usually packed. Thing is, TWO OTHER agents, both with Pre-Check signs, let anyone in line go through. The'main' Pre-Check line doesn't connect to those two stations.""",True,Hemingway

Told the clerk the tea was on sale, and she asks if I got a coupon. I say no, and she says they don't have a sales paper. What the hell, right? Pull out a receipt from another store, show it to her, and explain that I didn't have a coupon then either, but they still hooked me up. She can't help me, so I call for the manager. Manager comes over, says I need a coupon, and I show her my receipt. Tell her it's never heard of a Walgreens that doesn't have a sales paper. They're just gouging tourists, that's all they're doing.

When we told the barista about the mistake, she gave us an attitude and said we had paid for a regular size drink. She didn't seem to care that we had specifically asked for a large iced tea.

If you can't, opt for pancakes with whipped cream to counterbalance the machine-made fat.

We had to ask three times for a clean fork 'cause the ones we got were filthy with dried food and soap scum. The rotisserie chicken was drier than a sponge, the homemade mashed potatoes tasted sour, and the beef brisket looked like a patio desk - dried out and tasteless. For $49, I expected something decent, not a waste of money. No crab legs 'til 3:30 pm, no creme brûlée. I'm done with this place. The Paris hotel's buffet was way better.

""I've had the pleasure of dining at Max's in Glendale, CA a few times. When I heard they were opening a new location in Las Vegas, I was thrilled. I was looking forward to trying their Beef Caldereta, a dish I had previously enjoyed at the Glendale location. Unfortunately, it was not on the menu. Instead, they were only serving basic dishes. \n\nI opted for the Chicken Sigsig, which was disappointing. It lacked flavor and tasted like a mixture of mayonnaise, old chicken, and jalapenos. If you're looking for a better Sigsig, I would recommend Cafe Moda. \n\nThe Whole Chicken was cooked perfectly, it was moist and tender, and the crispy skin was enjoyable. However, I didn't understand the hype surrounding the chicken's flavor. It seemed to be lacking something. \n\nThe Garlic Rice was good, but nothing special. \n\nThe Halo-Halo was the highlight of my meal. It was delicious and the best I've had in Las Vegas. \n\nThe service was friendly and attentive. \n\nHowever, I must advise against asking for tap water. It's unfiltered and hard. Bottled water is the better choice. \n\nIn summary, the food at Max's in Las Vegas is unimpressive and overpriced. I wouldn't return for the entrees unless they add the Beef Caldereta to the menu. But I would come back for the Halo-Halo. My suggestion for Max's is to lower their prices and serve more authentic dishes.""",True,Hemingway

""Garcia's earned a single star, courtesy of one contented diner. Their alleged gluten-free menu? A joke. I could recite it from memory, it's so brief. Chicken Gasedo - shredded poultry in a soup bowl, aka 'chicken slop.' Beef Machaco? Same thing. Veggies, salsa, black beans or charro beans, and a house salad drenched in vinegar and oil completed the meager offerings. For ten bucks, I got a bowl of said chicken slop and a cup of black beans. Funny thing, the bill didn't reflect that. Maybe the waiter forgot, or maybe they just didn't care. Word to the wise at Garcia's: add some corn tortillas. Keep a stash of Tostitos in the kitchen.

Asked the busboy for one, but he brought a dirty one with fresh jam smeared on the bottom. Waiter never returned with a clean one. Ordered eggs benedict, but they were a disappointment. Sloppy eggs and tiny asparagus pieces. Thought it was missing something. English muffins were too buttery. Boyfriend didn't finish his crab benedict. Too salty and the muffin ruined it.

Couple months later, I'm hungry and stupid, so I give 'em another shot. Barkeep's rude, slow, and can't mix a drink to save his life. Friend gets their food, but I'm still waiting after 20 minutes. Ask the bartender, nice as can be, where my pizza's at, and he shrugs and walks off. Ask to see a manager, and they tell me he's too busy. Finally get my pizza, an hour and a half later. Kitchen manager shows up, does his job, talks to me. But that other guy, working New Year's Eve? He don't deserve the job, should be fired.""",True,Hemingway

By far the worst, did leave me in dismay.
No teriyaki sauce, no katsu, alack!
Instead, they gave me soy sauce, all too plain.
And glowing red, o'er processed sweet and sour,
Did make my meal most unappetizing, I do declare.
Macaroni, o'ercooked and mushy, did appear,
With seasoning that did resemble pepper, quite queer.
The barbecue chicken, dry and tasteless, did lie,
Unable to discern the marinade, oh me, oh my!
The bed of veggies, old and dry, like fake grass,
Did make me question if this menu knew its class.
Hawaiian barbecue, or ghetto Chinese, who knows?

And thus, we tried their frozen hot chocolate,

With patrons eager to partake of their fare.
I ordered the mixed plate, a medley of delights,
Including beef, chicken, and fish, cooked just right.

But the chicken, de-boned thigh, was tender, profound.
The fish, a middling dish, left me unimpressed,

I walked into the ship to store department to grab something, but the register was closed. Next to it was layway, and there were five people in line. The gent at the register said the other lane was closed. I told him to call for help, since I wasn't there for layway. Two other ladies in line agreed, saying they were waiting too, since no one would come help him. We were near the employee back entrance, so I told someone to go call someone to help him out. Within two minutes, someone showed up. They were still slow, but not as bad as before. It took almost thirty minutes from the time I arrived to when I finally got my two items. They let me pull around back to pick them up, since they were too big to wheel through the store on a flatbed cart. Not terrible service, but definitely a lack of help for customers.",True,Hemingway

Lobster risotto, a morsel, spicy and bright,

We didst order cheese sticks, cold and naught special,
Beer battered pickles, too greasy, and soggy to boot,
And last, a BBQ chicken sandwich, the batter overcooked,
Blackened and burnt, a sight most unappetizing, alack!
We didst try to cut it, remove the batter, but 'twas in vain,

We swung by this joint in Phoenix after hearing good things. Got there around 8:30 on a Friday night, and there was only one other couple ahead of us, so we were served quick.

Service was decent, but the employee who helped us seemed a bit tired or something. Like they'd been working a long shift or somethin'.

Ice cream wise, my husband went for the TC^2 and salted caramel, while I got the almond buttercrunch and apple cinnamon. Also tried the honey blue cheese and sugar and spice. Didn't get much almond flavor outta the almond buttercrunch, but the other flavors were alright. Texture was a bit icy, not super creamy like I'd hoped.

Pricing was reasonable, but I wouldn't go outta my way for this ice cream. If you're in the area and want some ""original"" flavors for a decent price, might be worth stoppin' in.

A plague upon this tint, I say!
For all my gold, 'twas not worth the pay.
I'm wroth, my friends, and vexed am I,
For naught but heat doth this tint provide.
What need hath one for tint, I pray,
If naught but warmth doth it convey?""",True,Shakespeare

""Flamingo's one of the last relics from Vegas' past. No glitz, no glam. Just a simple, old-school joint that's seen better days. But that's its charm.

Chicken, plenty, but veggies, scarce,
A balance, fair, I didst not find in this place.

In sooth, a pair of friends and I did stroll
Down the bustling strip, where noise did flow
From yonder club, whose door did lie
Ajar, revealing music, loud and nigh

We passed by, yet a friend did stop
To purchase brews, a bargain, 'twas not
Two for the price of one, a fair deal
And so we waited, while he did seal

The transaction, when a man did approach
With offers of entry, at a cost, so steep
$15 each, he said, to which we did reply
""No thanks, good sir, we shall not comply""

And thus we walked, a mere five feet more
When he did run, to us once more
""Ten dollars each,"" he said, with haste
But still we shook our heads, in disdain, so vast

Again he tried, with a further decrease
Five dollars, now, his offer did cease
But still we refused, and left him in the dust
For we had no desire, to be so crushed

At last, he relented, and let us in
For naught, save the music, loud within
We stayed awhile, a half-hour, mayhap more
The drinks were fair, the tunes did soar

Yet, alas, the ladies there, did lack
In charm, and the gents, did seem, so black
Fraternity brothers, cast out, it did appear
So we departed, and ne'er did we draw near

I went in to check the prices and see what they offered. The moment I walked in, a wave of stench hit me. I know having many dogs in a small space won't make it smell like roses, but I'd hope they clean the place occasionally. I asked about a service listed on their flyer and website and was told they don't offer it. Why list it, then? I also didn't like that from the front office, I couldn't see into the area where they kept the dogs, though I could hear them going wild. As I left, I noticed through broken blinds, there were many dogs in a small space with no one around. Side note: the couches in the photos on Yelp looked dangerous, too broken to be safe for dogs. I won't be back or using their home service. It would have been perfect, since I live just a mile away.",True,Hemingway

On Monday last, with eager expectation.
Kung Po chicken, I didst order, with haste,
But found it not to my liking, in sooth.

The chicken, breaded it was, and the sauce,
Sticky and sweet, like a sour sauce, perchance?
Authentic Chinese, it didst not resemble,
And the price, it didst exceed my reckoning.

For Leith Walk's takeaways, hold my grace.
Therefore, good sirs, heed my words of woe,
And seek thy meals from elsewhere, anon.""",True,Shakespeare

Atmosphere, the only charm, doth please,

Upon the table, a cup with wooden chopsticks lay, which led me to ponder, if this were a finer Asian establishment, might they not be reusable? Forgive me, for my mind doth wander. \n\nWe did order Tom Kha Chicken to begin, a tasty broth indeed. Yet, they did not serve it in individual bowls, which seemed strange.

Now doth resemble a common tavern, where
The patrons, crammed in tight, must pay a fee
For every drop of sweat they do expend.

Their schedules, once diverse and vast,
Are now reduced to just a few, and those
That remain, are filled with people, packed
Like sardines in a can, with nary space
To breathe, or move, or find a moment's peace.

And in the locker rooms, no shampoo or cream
To cleanse the hair, or soothe the skin,
No towels, either, to dry off with ease,
Just signs that demand a tip, as if 'twere
A tax on every drop of moisture shed.

Do forget the class cards, time and again,
Leaving members in a state of dismay.

The instructors here, are truly divine,

Each class, a joy, despite the flaws that plague.

With service poor, and staff not nigh.

Thinking quick service, our need.

And bartender, with two couples dizzy.

And mint, she had to find, so rare.
At last, our drinks, we did receive,
But menus, none, our hunger to relieve.

The bathroom, alas! was tiny, and in one room, bare of toilet paper and a lock that worked aright. The grounds, in disarray, did cry out for a fresh coat of paint and pruning shears, I pray. Yet, blessedly, the view of yonder highway did please mine eyes, and fortunately, the noise did not disturb my rest. The young ones, verily, didst enjoy the waterpark, but, alack! the lazy river and slides were closed at times, which did cause great vexation in the ladies fair. Confusion reigned regarding the opening hours upon the Sabbath day, which did leave our maidens wroth.

I hastened there today, my heart full of cheer,

For though their breads were shaped like pretzels, they were lost
In taste and texture, more like pizza crust,
Than the delicate, airy fougasse I had trust.

Their ""Hello Dolly"" bars, seven layers deep,
Were sinful, true, but not worth the step,
For in their roasted garlic, sundried tomato,
And rosemary, I found a flavor monotono.

But found it lacking in the finesse I had sense.

Galbi burger, house kimchi, a dish most swell.
Yet, why the poor review, I pray thee tell?
We came in numbers, twelve or more, they did accommodate us well.
A warm welcome, too, didst they extend,
So, why the terrible review, my friend?
'Tis courtesy, I say, to wait for all to receive
Their viands, ere they doth begin to dine.
But lo, two of our party's food didst tarry,
Thirty minutes passed, ere it didst arrive.
Appetizers came in haste, sweet potato fries most fine,
Yet, a vast gap betwixt them and the main course didst intervene.
The waitress said the kitchen was behind,
The burger, too, didst take its sweet time.
At last, after thirty minutes, 'twas brought to me,
But, alack, the order, they didst forget, so it seemed.

With televisions galore, and sporting events aplenty,
And, praise the Lord, there were but few patrons present,
Yet, our server, in sooth, didst fail to impress,
Forgetful, she was, and prone to errors,
E'en I, a server myself, couldst not ignore her lapses,
Ah, the game room, it was but a middling affair,
For, alas, the machines didst consume my coin,
And, thrice, I didst request more dressing,
My mother, she didst order a wheat beer,
But, lo and behold, a strange brew didst appear,
So, she didst order another, and waited patiently,
But, ten minutes passed, and still, no beer didst come,
Therefore, I didst arise, and seek out the server,
To hasten her, and bid her bring the drink, anon,

Didn't seem too sure about the gluten-free stuff, though. Asked the kitchen if I could have the nachos, they said yeah, but I prob'ly shoulda been more careful 'cause of the language barrier.

Went with the nachos anyway, they were pretty good. Chicken, cilantro sauce, nacho cheese, and jalapeños. Good-sized portion, took some leftovers with me for later. Didn't get sick, so I guess the nachos are okay here. Other notes, heard another customer complain about dirty silverware, mine was alright.

""In days of yore, when Market Street didst boast a queue,
I didst enjoy dining here, with naught to do.
But now, alas! 'Tis harder to find a dish that pleases,
For all their fare doth seem to lose its former ease.

The hamburger steak, once reliable and true,
Hath failed me late, in taste and texture anew.
I fear 'tis due to what hath been cooked before,
Afore they laid the patty on the grill, perchance a bore.

The philly steak sandwich, a sorry sight,
Didst lack the cheese that doth make all things right.
The meat, devoid of flavor, didst leave me cold,
In need of salt, to make it worth a tale to be told.

So great my woe, that I didst not return,
To partake of wontons, beef, or other dish that doth burn.
For here, alas! My taste buds found no delight,
And thus, I bid this place adieu, with sorrow in my sight.""",True,Shakespeare

Alack, the alcohol, light bulbs, and cleansers,
Were gone, leaving naught but empty containers.
I asked, why takest thou all from the shelves?
And was told, 'twas custom, for new tenants to receive.
But I say, 'if it be not thine, leave it be.'
A policy of honesty, for all to see.
They didst clean the oven, fridge, and some drawers,
But what else didst they do, in those two hours?

The tiles, they didst sweep, but not with diligence, alas!
For still, the dirt didst cling, like a lover's kiss.
I sent images, of the state, they left it in,

My children, two in number, both of tender age,
One nine years old, the other but two,
What to do? My eldest, with the teens he could play,
But alas! My youngest, what could he do?

To avoid the madness that doth spread
Like wildfire through the crowded halls,
And thus, I rose early, with purpose calls.

At ten and forty, I didst set forth,

In orderly fashion, with nary a sigh.

I found, my dear, with ease and grace,
All that I sought, in its proper place,
Four items, alack, didst fill my hand,

But for 60 bucks a plate, don't expect to be rushed out. Service aside, let's talk grub. Tenderloin tips were salty, but decent. Key lime pie was good. Prime rib/shrimp combo was okay, shrimp scampi was good, but prime rib was subpar. Flummoxed why Beef and Bottle would risk pissing off customers. Won't be back.

The chef's seared foie gras was the highlight of the meal - I'd go back just for that. The fresh grapes complemented the fattiness perfectly. No sharing! \n\nThe whole hog platter was a letdown. The baby back ribs, smoked grilled pork chop, and braised shanks were all pretty bland and dry. The shank was tender, at least.

To share a dish, and drinks, in merriment,

So I devoured the bread, and butter, with great relish, ere she couldst see.

Then came the dessert, a sundae and a tart,
The former, sweet and cold, the latter, a disappointment, a heavy heart.
For $45, with tip, and three drinks, 'twas a sum quite grand,

My veal dish was solid, but didn't live up to the hype. Rao's has potential, with a fun setting, great servers, and decent grub. They just need to step up their game in the kitchen.

A volume most excessive, and quite distasteful, I must say.

Or notice how we all did cover our ears, in dismay?

And furthermore, a query of the taxi fare doth rise,

In Seattle, where the company doth reside,
These tickets wouldst bring joy, and laughter beside.

But alas, in this fair town of Scottsdale,
With but two theaters of Regal's noble name,

An ""old school"" hall, where one doth walk uphill,
To reach the screen, a journey most unthrilling.

Verily, I say, this place doth need a change,
A ""new school"" theater, with stadium range,
For though our passes were free, we didst stay,

While I, a patient, didst pour out my soul's distress.
With iPad in hand, she didst feign interest,
But her eyes didst stray, to her cell phone's gleam, I do confess.

Oh, how I yearned for my former doctor's grace,
Whose dedication didst leave no room for disgrace.
But alas, her new home didst not accept my plight,
Leaving me to suffer through Dr. Barrettoko's ignoble sight.

In stock, most times, the products I do seek,

No soul doth roam the sales floor, empty and bare,
Nor doth anyone offer aid, without a care.
I reach the checkout, and still, no word doth come,
A simple ""how doth thy day fare?"" would be some fun.

Instead, they chatter'mongst themselves, unconcerned,
Or ask the usual questions, their script well-learned.
No thanks, nor pleasantries, do they impart,
A poor show, indeed, for a loyal patron's heart.

Verily, 'tis a pyramid, and thus, the question doth arise,  
Why rid it of its motif, so dear, and substitute it with such dire design?  

In sooth, the new look doth displease mine eyes, and in my heart doth stir,  
A sorrow, deep and true, that Luxor's former glory doth now fade.  
And thus, I vow, my time and coin, shall elsewhere be spent,  
For Luxor, once a cherished haunt, doth now but bring mine ire and discontent.""",True,Shakespeare

No bikes in the courtyard either, which was a big selling point for me. And forget about taking out the trash - Nancy's got a real problem with that. She's got a tight grip on the place, even locking up the pool at night. Feels like a senior community, not kid-friendly like it's supposed to be.

I ordered Jack Daniels ribs and shrimp. Shrimp were great. Ribs? Don't order 'em unless it's a BBQ joint. Dry as hell. Some parts were decent, but most left me thirsty af.

My wife got the steak. Biggest part was fat. What's the point?

There was this huge party next to us, got drunk as hell. Loud, obnoxious. Couldn't hear myself think. Don't mind noise, but c'mon, not in a restaurant. Seemed like the manager and servers didn't give a damn, though. Guess that's just how it goes there.

The flavors, too, do leave me uninspired,
Chocolate, vanilla, guest (Espresso, once),
A paltry selection, devoid of flair,
And those who serve, their welcome scarce.

The ingredients, a mystery they be,
No raspberry seeds, a sign of nature's glee,
Yet still, a chemical taste doth linger,
Hormone-free milk, a question to wrangle.

A quaint spot, nonetheless, that draws a crowd,
Of young and old, a veritable cloud,
And K-9 Custard, dogs delight,

Neither good nor bad, just a middling sensation.
The server, a merry soul, with a heart full of cheer,
Didst attend to mine needs, with a promptness most dear.

I asked for a scrambled egg for my little girl, but the girl said they couldn't do that either. The eggs come pre-made in a patty, which sounded about as appetizing as my sneakers after a 3-mile run.

With naught but empty words, their claims uninspired.
For though they strove to seem refined and grand,
In truth, their efforts fell flat, like sand.

Thus did we come upon a Thursday eve,
A night most strange, and full of woe,
Our band of men, nine in all, did gain entry free,
By some strange chance, or so it seemed to me.

My first time in Las Vegas, a city bright,
And first club visit, with anticipation great,
But alas, the place did have a deadly feel,
As if none there did truly wish to revel.

The outdoor patio, up above, the only space,
Did hold the crowd, a mix of young and old,
With cougars and manthers, in a lonely race,
Did seek to find some mirth, their hearts cold.

One bar alone, did serve the multitude,
O'erwhelmed it was, with drinks untold,
A sorry sight, and cause for much dismay,
Did leave us all, in sorrow's sway.

Never again, have I returned to this place,
With memories of joy, forever effaced.",True,Shakespeare

I tried building my own pasta, thinking it'd be a better option than pizza, but I was wrong. I got spaghetti with bologonese sauce, meatballs, and mushrooms. It cost around $22-$24, but it wasn't worth it. The pasta and sauce were just lukewarm, and the meatballs tasted like they were straight from the freezer.

Finally got someone's attention, but she was rude and sent us to the other side of the lobby. Had to wait 10 minutes for someone to help us, and even then, they told us to go back to the other side.

I returned, cash in hand, ready to devour my wor wonton soup, house fried rice, and orange chicken. But alas, the man behind the counter was too busy taking a personal call to bother with me. I waited, patiently at first, but as the minutes ticked by, my hunger turned to frustration. Finally, another man sauntered over, sans apology or acknowledgement of my wait, and took my payment.

Trust your instincts, right? \n\nThe fried mussels were decent, but nothing special. The chicken alfredo pizza was way too salty. I could barely finish it. I tried dipping it in the chicken and gnocchi soup to tone down the saltiness. But nope, still too much. I should've sent it back, but I've worked in restaurants before. I know what happens to returns. Not worth it... My husband's spaghetti with meat sauce was unremarkable.

Went back yesterday, couldn't find my inserts, so I bought some kicks. Six hundred bucks for what I got years ago. Still cost me a C-note though. Asked for slip-resistant, felt like I was at a roller rink in the kitchen. Went back today, some dude with a fake hawk gave me the runaround. Quoted the manufacturer's words like it was scripture. Overpriced, prescribed inserts from some schmuck without a sports med degree? No thanks. Rude treatment too? That's why I'm giving 'em a low score.

""The dimly lit room impressed us. Bread basket came first, with Asiago roll, walnut and cranberry bread, and a French roll. We both ordered broiled walleyed pike, which was a bit dry, and shared a baked potato (overcooked) and creamed corn. Finished with a crème brûlée. The creamed corn, served in a large casserole dish and broiled, was the best part of the meal. The crème brûlée, unfortunately, was one of the worst we've ever had. Twenty years have passed since we last dined at this restaurant, but it's improved with age, lacking in ambiance but making up for it with friendly staff and reasonable prices. Ms. Westie's 8-ounce filet was good, but not quite prime, served medium rare as requested.

On a Sunday night, the place was dead, save for two other tables, and the soundtrack of Motley Crue music videos blasting loud. Vince Neil, sure, but this was excessive.

A sorrowful sight, indeed, for me.

Beer doth flow like a bounteous sea.

But nay, not here, where I do find
No special draughts to quench my thirst.
And thus, my friends, I must confess,
Maggiano's doth lose its former zest.

Five times have I graced its halls,
Yet now, the fare doth falter, falls.
Alas, how swiftly doth it decline,
Leaving me to pine for pasta divine.

And dream of fresh pasta, wine, and bread,
To make at home, a merry treat,
And savor each bite with joy and cheer.""",True,Shakespeare

The best of all, a taste most fine,
A saving grace, for this poor repast.

But when I descended underground,
Disorder ruled, all around.

Amenities, there were aplenty,
Pubs and shops, for those who be penny-wise,
But open roofs, a chilly feel,
In Scotland's clime, doth not appeal.

And being from fair California,
Big structures looming, doth make me quake,
Trains on separate tracks, alas,
No other choice, but to take a chance.

Drink or early rising, who can say?
But thus, the travelers find their way.""",True,Shakespeare

Whose Converse shoes didst make mine eyes glad.
Thou didst try thy best to keep mine attention,
But alas, my daughter, wild and untamed,
Didst steal the show, with her ADHD ways,
And made it hard for thee to keep thy claim.

At checkout, a star doth deducted lie,
For thou, a lazy fool, didst make a scene,
Yelling loud, like one possessed of thee,
And caused my daughter's wonder and glee.
Thy actions, rude and unbecoming, were,
And made mine husband turn, to see the fray.

Twice, I told thee, quiet, and still,
To put the purse away, and avoid the thrill.
But thou, a stubborn mule, didst not heed,
And caused a scene, most unnecessary and rude.
A mother's tricks, to hide a thing from sight,
Thou shouldst not, with thy yells, ignite.
All thou hadst to do, was put it back,
When we were gone, and save the attack.""",True,Shakespeare

Didst leave me feeling quite dismayed.

A numerous throng we were, and gathered round,
In yonder bar, where we didst take our stand.
A Monday eve it was, and service slow,
Our server, burdened, didst bear the load.

I called for drink, and waited patiently,
Twenty minutes passed, and still nary a sight.
A comrade, near, didst order victuals too,
And lo, his fare didst come, before mine own.
And we sat close to yonder bar, I swear!

The draught, when came, didst not resemble that,
Which in the menu, hadst been described.
A sweet concoction, in a wine glass, 'twas,
And I, in discontent, didst send it back.
Another drink, I craved, and waited yet,
Fifteen minutes more, ere it didst arrive.

The small plates, dear, and entrees, left much,
To be desired, in truth, they didst not impress.
No dish, save bacon, couldst we find,
And tilapia, at twenty-two, didst seem most unkind.

Hark, what news is this? A meal most wondrous,
Smothered chicken, mac and cheese, green beans,
A feast fit for a king, or so it seemed,
Yet, alas, the price did leave me quite dismayed.

I ventured forth to this establishment,
In Balyntyne's suburbs, a journey of some distance,
To partake in their Southern cuisine,
And sample their delicious victuals, of which I had heard.

Arriving at eleven thirty, the crowd was scarce,
I was one of the first to grace their door,
The service was swift, the fare was hot,
But, alack, the cost did leave me feeling poor.

Three and a half stars, I would give,
For the portion size, a bit too small,
Ten dollars, I did pay, without a drink,
A price, I fear, that doth not sit well with me.

Thus, I must say, I shall not return,
To this place, where my wallet didst burn,
For though the food was good, the cost, a sin,
I'll seek elsewhere, for better value, my friend.",True,Shakespeare

""We hit up Braddah's for lunch again on our latest trip, sharing a Kalua pig burrito with all the fixin's. Good stuff, even without the cilantro. But the service wasn't quite up to par. No samples, dirty tables, and a wait for the sauce. Three and a half stars, tops.""",True,Hemingway

""Upon this place, we didst venture, my dear wife and I,
In hopes of savoring delectable dishes, nay?
We ordered egg rolls and grilled pork, with eager delight,
And waited patiently, as the minutes didst take flight.

Alas, the wait was long, and we didst grow weary,
For the food, it didst take its time, in arriving, verily.
The restaurant, clean and tidy, yet smoke didst fill the air,
From the kitchen, a ventilation issue, beyond compare.

The egg rolls, small and sweet, with sauce not quite right,
And the grilled pork, tasty, yet a meager sight.
A worthy visit, indeed, but alas, not worth another try,
For the prices, steep, and portions, scarce, didst deny.""",True,Shakespeare

""Marly's, a place of drink and merriment,

Liquor, eight dollars fifty, beer, seven fifty, a dream.
Appetizers, ordered by others in our group,
Did look most delectable, yet I did not partake, alas, my dear.

Alas, poor Marly's, empty 'twas that night,
No patrons came, a shame, a sorrowful sight.
Yet still, their modern decor, purple hue,
Did shine so bright, a beacon, inviting anew.

But small repairs were needed, else all were well.
Beware, dear traveler, for the minibar doth hold
Vibrators and lube, not fit for children to behold.

The pool, a gathering place for the young and free,
Did draw a rowdy crowd, full of mirth and glee.
I did not partake in the pool's revelry,
But observed from afar, the noise and the decree.

For 'tis a fine place, with Mexican food that enthralls.

And sushi, freshly made, doth tempt mine eyes,

Their victuals, alas, are but mediocre fare,
Common grub, fit for TGIF, or similar lair.
Loaded potato skins, a price most steep,
And chicken dijon pizza, dry as sleep.

Frozen pizza, cooked in thine own stead.

They had a sweet elevator that took us up to the restaurant, and the modern Asian decor was impressive. Our waiter and bussers were top-notch, always filling our sake glasses. I went for their special California roll, freshwater eel roll, and adobo chicken roll. The grub was good, but the atmosphere and vibe were worth the price. I figure the chef must be Filipino, since they had lumpia, pancit, and adobo on the menu. One of the staff even asked if I was related to the chef. Didn't know all Filipinos were family.

This Fry's hath come a long way,
Their selection of better quality doth sway,
A decent choice of produce, organic and not,
And breads, that I do often spot.

Meats, too, they have in abundance,
Though lamb doth seem to be a chance,
Fish, alas! doth suffer likewise,
Farm-raised, color-added, a poor device.

With Spicy Tuna and California rolls, our choice.

The mushrooms, plump and fresh they were,
And sausage, spiced just right, I swear.

Undeterred, I didst sample the lemonade, but lo! 'Twas naught but water, and of questionable quality at that, for there were strange floating particles within the cup. Disheartened, I didst ponder whether to voice my concerns, but decided instead to merely observe and wait. 

Now, they do offer luncheon specials until the hour of four, but alack! We hadst arrived in the evening, and thus couldst not partake in these deals. Their prices, however, were reasonable and comparable to those of other eateries.

Five minutes passed, and still no sign,
Of one who might fetch me a draught of wine.

But water only, didst I drink, and that not often divine.

A refill, I didst request, in vain,

Whether to give Diablo's two or three stars in the end.
At last, I chose the latter, for in Vegas fair,
Most places of quality do come with quite a cost, I dare.
And though the service there was woeful, sad to say,
The food was tasty, and the portions, generous in play.
But oh, the service! Rude and surly, beyond compare,
Our server, scarce seen, didst seem to care not a whit, I swear.
She sighed and shook her head, with nary a smile or greeting,
When my friend asked for fresh cheese, and not that processed meeting.

No smears upon the windows, nor a single drop  
Didst mar its beauty, like a gentle maiden's sigh.  
I chose the full package, with rims so bright  
As if the sun itself had given them light.  
Their care and attention left naught to be desired  
For my little Z4, among the costly ones inspired.  
Indeed, the line-up held SUVs of high estate  
A Porsche Panamera, and a Maserati of great weight.  
If fortune smiled upon me, and I could afford  
Such luxury, then surely I would have it poured  
Upon my humble car, at home, without a flaw.  
But alas, 'tis not so, and thus I must draw  
My own conclusions, and praise Classic Car Spa  
For work well done, and worth the fee they crave.",True,Shakespeare

But alas, our flight left early in the morn, And we sought a place near the airport, no scorn. Hooters it was, a place of delight, Close to McCarran, a quick cab ride in sight. \n\nThe man at the desk, a friendly soul, Gave us a room, nonsmoking, our goal. High up, a view of the strip so grand, Tropicana, Excalibur, a roller coaster's land. The room, basic, yet met our needs, For our last night in Vegas, it did plead. \n\nAcross the street, the MGM we did roam, For most of the day, our time was home. In the eve, back to Hooters we did stray, And played, and laughed, and had a blast, they say. Low minimums, a relaxed atmosphere, No need to be a champ, just pure pleasure.

Alas, my expectations were not fully met, for though the antipasti were fair, the crostini were somewhat stale. The pork belly, however, was most delectable, and the roast potatoes were cooked to perfection. But alas, the chocolate tart was overly rich, and left me feeling quite sated. The chamber itself was pleasant enough, but lacked that certain je ne sais quoi that would have made my visit truly memorable. The staff were courteous and efficient, but in comparison to the warmth and hospitality of family-run establishments such as Nonna's in Morningside, they seemed rather lacking.

Into this den of deals, with heart full of soul,
And though 'twas busy, the crowd didst not oppress,
For most were women, and their zeal didst express.

Didst roam the aisles, with eyes open wide,
Seeking the perfect find, with patience and grace,

Oh, the shoes, how they doth shine and sparkle bright,
A veritable feast, for eyes that doth delight,
Wingtips and brogues, in abundance they doth lay,
A treasure trove, for those who doth seek the way.

With price tag of $30, a true bargain, no doubt,
Originally $215, a steal, indeed,
For those who doth crave, such footwear with speed.

Fun, indeed, it was, but also quite a fray.
Knowledgeable staff, plenty of firepower, a delight,

But on this day, alas! My time was limited, in truth.
And thus I asked, 'Mayhap I might pay with cash, good sir?'
'Aye, verily,' quoth he, 'but, alack! The ATM doth fail.'
A nuisance, certes, yet I didst not let it vex me sore,
For, as thou knowest, fortune doth not always smile upon me.""",True,Shakespeare

MGM ain't half bad if you score a sweet rate. Check-in's a drag, but that's the strip for ya. Room was a pleasant surprise, though - nice blackout shades, too. Internet's decent, minibar's stocked, and my floor was chill. High-end grub's better than expected, 'cept for Fiamma. That place? Bleh. Dealers at the blackjack tables? Meh, they're alright. Cocktail service? Forget about it. Pools? Shade's for the birds, unless you shell out for a cabana. AC in my room? Couldn't keep up. Crowds? Yep, they're everywhere.

And thus, the pho, it did arrive,
With naught but broth, and no rice in sight.
Who doth such things? Who doth not provide
A simple plate of rice, the first in line?

Yet, praise be given to the egg rolls,
For they were filled most generously,
And the coffee, old school, with its drip,
Did bring a smile to mine own lips.

A great, hot, soupy bowl of pho, I say.""",True,Shakespeare

They also brew their own root beer, and let me tell you, it's some good stuff. Not a place I'd stay at or gamble at, but it's a solid choice for a cheap meal and a good time.

I went out with my guy last night and we had a great time at this joint. The patio was top-notch, nice view, quiet, and secluded even though it's right above Indian School Road. They got a killer wine and beer selection, lots of local options too. Food was alright, not amazing though. Started with some solid fries, had rosemary and parmesan, and a decent dipping sauce. Pizza was pretty good, had some caramelized onions, mushrooms, Italian sausage, and a good crust. Not too crispy, not too soft, but you definitely need a fork and knife for it. Ragu was different, kinda like a shredded beef burrito but in a bowl with penne pasta instead of a tortilla. Wasn't terrible, just unexpected. Wished we tried dessert, they looked great.

A red velvet wafflenut, a Nutella and almond wafflenut,
The Fat Elvis waffle, a strawberry and chocolate waffle,
And a Vegas churro waffle, with honey, cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla ice cream, so cool.

All was well, the churro waffle, our favorite, by far,

But for me, the chicken, all day, without compare.
Add hush puppies, slaw, and thy day shall be bright,
Go, visit this place, and taste their delight.""",True,Shakespeare

For those who abhor smoke, a haven beckons through the non-smoking portal at the rear, yet to access the Men's room or partake in billiards, one must traverse the smoking patio's ordeal. As for the Men's room, while I've witnessed fouler chambers, this one languished in neglect, pleading for a mop, for my soles adhered to the floor by the urinal. \n\n Libations flowed aplenty, with a cornucopia of beers on draught. Intent on a burger, I found the table inundated with sundry fare. The nachos proved middling, and though no fan of fiery wings, these grilled morsels left a lingering warmth, surprisingly pleasing. An onion ring, potato skin, and cheese stick graced my palate, embodying solid bar fare without eliciting awe. \n\n Service, a mercurial dance betwixt excellence and disappearance, amidst shortages of iced tea, brownies, and select brews. Yet, those imbibing water among the drinkers faced no interrogation. \n\n In sum, a stalwart bastion in our neighborhood, this establishment stood as a commendable haven for revelry and repast.",True,Shakespeare

In sum, the affair boasts sweetness, yet confess, ample room for betterment remains.

Foremost among the grievances: the worth for the coin, the scant selection of seats upon the vessel, and the dearth of crew's attendance.

Yet, amidst these woes, stand virtues: the delectation and abundance of victuals, the boat's fine ambiance.

'Twas disheartening to be jostled by a brood of youthful souls, who claimed the seats atop. Arrive early, station thyself afore the wooden dock where they embark. A more orderly procession, in the sequence of bookings, would improve matters.

The feast, a marvel! Appetizers, main course, and dessert, laid out with perfection, a delight to partake.

Mimosas, albeit flavorful, faltered in strength. Two attendants struggled to serve fifty souls, making it arduous to secure their attention. Dismissal for sustenance transpired not as expected.

We arrived in haste ere the closing hour, a plight that seldom pleases the cooks. \n\n The proprietor, however, exuded extraordinary kindness. His demeanor, remarkably serene, left us pondering, ""Could any soul be more tranquil?""

Didst make a meal most satisfying, indeed.

The fish, alas, didst not taste fresh,

A tale of inspiration, strange and true,
Of how the soft serve machine came to be,
From a most unlikely source, 'twas born.

As I walked my loyal hound, Toots, one day,
He stopped and did his business on the lawn,
Of Ed and Dolores Feinstein, much to their dismay.
Their wrath was great, and I did fear,
For Ed, an attorney, vowed to bring us to justice.
But from this mess, a spark of creativity,
Didst strike my mind, and thus, the machine was born.

I wished to create a device that could,
Pinch off the ice cream, clean and neat,
Unlike Toots, who left a trail unsightly,
And so, my friend, the soft serve machine,
Was fashioned, thanks to Toots's uncouth feat.

Now, as I serve this frozen treat,
I cannot help but laugh at the absurdity,
Of how this machine, a replica of my dog,
Doth bring joy to all who taste its sweetness.

So here's to Toots, whose mischief and glee,
Inspired this marvel of technology,
May his memory live on, forevermore,
In the soft serve machine, a testament to his lore.""",True,Shakespeare

Three thoughts do swirl within my mind,
Of pizza good, yet o'erpriced, I find.

The service, alack, doth leave much to be desired,
Alack, 'tis craptastic, I do declare.
First time, they made me pizza not aright,
And waited I, an additional 10 minutes' space.
No discount given, nay, not a single penny,
For all my woe, naught but a sorry face didst see.

Third time, a call didst make, an order in,
Thirty to thirty-five minutes, didst they say.
Fifty-seven minutes passed, and still didst wait,
Alack, poor service, naught but frustration doth create.
When complained, the takeout person didst but stare,
A blank expression, naught but empty air.
No apologies, nay, not a single word,
Didst leave me else to seek, as Grimaldi's, my dear lord.

For such a price, a better pizza place,
Shall be my choice, ere I do grace,

I had expected to behold more breathtaking acrobatics, but save for the lovely diving and a few other acts, such as the fire dancers and jumpers, I must admit that I was not overly impressed. The tale they didst seek to tell, I fear, didst escape me, and certain scenes didst leave me perplexed. What, pray tell, was the meaning of the man with the 1-800 sign? Moreover, I must confess that I didst feel somewhat uneasy, as if it were a strange and disturbing dream. Those men in red coats, alack, didst fill me with a sense of dread.

TI, nice joint. Stayed three nights. Early check-in cost fifty bucks extra. Better than sleeping in the parking lot with the fam. Not many places to plug in our cell chargers, so we took turns using the restroom plugs. Check-in line was long, not enough staff. Check-out was a mad rush too. Vegas was slow that time of year. Parking was free. iPod dock didn't charge, wrong time. Had a fridge and safe in the room. No coffee pot. Check-out was weird. Suggest an easy checkout.

Methinks I didst partake of victuals at yon establishment known as Mert's,
Forsooth, my heart didst crave the fried catfish and beef rib combo,
A feast most wondrous, or so I didst imagine, ere I didst dig in.
Alas, the whole fried catfish didst prove a challenge to devour,
What with bones and scales that didst make it hard to chew,
And thus, I didst not enjoy the fish as much as I had hoped.

But fear not, dear friends, for all was not lost,
For the beef rib, though chopped up and small, didst taste divine,
Despite the bones that didst litter the dish, like rubble on the ground.
And truly, the mac and cheese didst steal the show,
With its golden crust and creamy sauce, 'twas a delight,
Though the corn bread, alas, didst suffer a similar fate,
Dried out and overcooked, it didst not taste as sweet.

In conclusion, Mert's didst provide a decent meal,
Though not the best, it didst satisfy my hunger and my soul,
So if thou find thyself in need of sustenance,
Pray, give Mert's a try, and mayhap thou shalt find thy pleasure.",True,Shakespeare

""Hark! A tale of lunchtime adventure, dear friends!

After a morning spent in yogic pursuits, I chanced upon a place called TDP, nestled within the bustling hub of Union. 'Twas a curious sight, for half the shops lay open, while the others slumbered still.

The establishment itself, I must confess, did charm mine eyes. The tables, neat and tidy, beckoned me to sit and partake of their offerings. The outdoor seating, a pleasant surprise, did invite me to bask in the sun's warm rays. And the bar, though small, did sparkle with promise.

The staff, kind and courteous, did attend to mine needs with haste. My sandwich, drenched in olive oil, did tantalize mine taste buds. The bread, fresh and soft, did complement the savory filling well.

Yet, alas! The price, dear friends, did stir within me a sense of dismay. Nine silver coins for a simple Caprese sandwich? Methinks 'tis a steep price to pay. And the meatball sandwich, lacking in sauce, did leave me feeling somewhat unsatisfied. The chicken salad sandwich, though visually appealing, did seem a trifle small for the cost.

Verily, I say unto thee, I shall return anon, to partake of their wares no more. But, I shall cherish the memories of that day, and the sweet scents that did fill mine nostrils. Forsooth, a bottle of their finest olive oil shall be mine prize, and a token of our fleeting encounter.""",True,Shakespeare

""Jersey Mike's, a place of efficiency and cheer,
Where orders are taken with haste, and food appears in a flash.
The menu, a puzzle to solve, for newcomers, a test,
But fear not, for the staff, with patience, will assist.

At noon, the crowd doth swell, the line doth grow long,
But fear not, for the wait, doth pass, in song.
The mini sub, a meal, for one, or two,
The regular, a feast, fit for a crew.

The club, with meat, doth satisfy,
The bread, a tale, of white and wheat, doth lie.
The cups, with tales, of fundraising deeds,
A branding trick, or genuine, indeed?

I shall return, to taste, another day,
A spicier dish, my craving, doth sway.
Till then, farewell, Jersey Mike's,
A place, of efficiency, and friendly ease.""",True,Shakespeare

""Methinks 'twas a fortuitous day indeed, fair friends, when we didst stumble upon yon establishment, Los 7 Compadres. Forsooth, their menu didst boast a plethora of combination platters, a veritable cornucopia of culinary delights, all for a mere seven golden coins! My dearest wife and I, in our hunger and delight, didst order two such platters, that we might share and savor each dish. And thus, we didst embark upon a gastronomical journey, a true feast for the senses.

""First, we didst sample the chicken enchilada, a tender, juicy morsel, swathed in a rich, velvety sauce. Next, we didst add rice, and then beans, and thus, a new creation was born! The sour cream and guacamole, too, didst make their mark, each adding its unique flavor to the mix. And so, we didst continue, combining and recombining, until our taste buds didst dance with joy.

""And thus, we didst play this game again, with the burrito, the cheese enchilada, the tamale, the beef enchilada, the bean enchilada, and more! Each dish, a masterpiece, a symphony of flavors, a true delight. The tamales, alack, didst fall short, a tad dry, with naught but jalapeno's spice to savor. Yet, the rest, a true culinary triumph!

Now fallen to three stars, its glory lost.

Two roaches roamed the floor, unchecked and bold.
I rose and crushed one, as if in sport,
But none took note, their minds elsewhere employed.
A staff member slew the other, with no show,
As if such pests were common, naught to know.

The waiter, full of words and empty cheer,
Did prattle on, as if we cared to hear.
His voice, like nails on glass, did grate and scrape,
And made us wish for silence, or a gentle breeze to shape.

The owner, too, we met, a man of wine and mirth,
Who ruled the patio, with laughter and with girth.
But in his eyes, a glint of strife did gleam,
As if he ruled with iron hand, his will supreme.

A shadow of its former self, alas.

Uncomfortable seating, ceilings worn and rent.

Trash bins overflowing, tables dirty and forlorn.
No one cleaning, a shame, a matter most pitiful.

Only the bar and bench are for happy hour, but they didn’t bother telling us that either. Nice job, fellas. You lost a star just like that.\n\nNow, the grub. It was alright, I guess. Had some good stuff, like the Patatas Bravas. Just some roasted taters covered in tomato sauce, but it hit the spot. The lamb was decent too, but small for the price. Croquettes were a bit meh. And don’t even get me started on the red sangria. It was like they just poured some wine and fruit juice into a glass and called it a day. Not impressed. \n\nSo, the bill comes and it’s about $60 sans tip. Turns out we paid extra for sitting at a table instead of the bar. Like, what even is that?

In variety of thirteen, a choice most manifold.

The staff, a bevy of friendliness, doth serve with a smile,
And the price, most reasonable, doth make it worthwhile.
So whether thou art in the mood for a quick bite,
Or a leisurely repast, the Chilenita doth satisfy.

My dearest friend's fair maiden came to visit from Austin,
A place of wonder, where architecture doth reign supreme.
We went, of course, for 'twas a sight to behold,
But lo, the cost of the tour did our spirits dampen.

'Twas thirty to eighty dollars, a sum most dire,
Beyond our means, a fee most obnoxious and dire.
So we did stroll about the grounds, and visited the shop,
Where trinkets and baubles did our spirits lift and pop.

Forsooth, our purses did not bear the weight.

But recently, a new dish didst catch my sight,

With ham, cheese, and mushrooms, oh so fine,
The savory crepe, a true delight divine,
And greens and baby tomatoes, a pleasant surprise,

""Amidst a sea of gourmet eats, we sought something plain,
A humble cafe, our hunger to abate.
Sunday, the day of rest, football games did play,
And bars, they were full, in a most disorderly way.

The menu, vast like Cheesecake Factory's spread,
We perused, our taste buds, to be fed.
Fried chicken, mashed potatoes, a saltish delight,
But could have been better, in truth, not quite right.

Pear martini, a drink of choice, they did lack,
So strawberry, its sweetness, did our thirst quench.
My spouse, a cheeseburger, with fries, did partake,
A satisfying meal, his hunger to slake.

This place, again, we might visit, in need,
But with better options, nearby, indeed.
So, in conclusion, an ordinary spot,
For a simple meal, no frills, no fuss, no plot.""",True,Shakespeare

Upon a Friday, we didst venture forth to taste their seafood delights. Alas, naught stood out, save for the crab, which was quite good, by Jove! Our server, merry and bright, didst attend to us with haste. But, alack, the sushi, cold and woeful, failed to impress. And shrimp, once cold, didst lose its former luster, I do confess. 

Hush puppies, small and crispy, were too salty, verily. Fried catfish, though tasty, lacked crunch, its batter soft and limp. Desserts, too, didst disappoint. Carrot cake, so dry, didst crumble at the touch. Chocolate fudge, with icing sweet, didst leave me unsatisfied, I do entreat.

But alas, our meal began with cured meats,
And flatbread pizza, which my belly did greet.

A mediocre dish, that doth not satiate.

The bar, with mildew-smelling rag, doth clean,
But two individual bathrooms, a long queue doth glean.
Beer, overpriced, a sin, a shame,
A drawback, that doth tarnish the name.
Yet still, I would return, to try another,
Or stick with kimchi, that doth please my brother.""",True,Shakespeare

This past weekend, I didst venture thither for dinner. A three-course steak meal, for $9.99, didst tempt me, and I, alack, didst succumb. The salad, fair enough, didst start the feast. Next, came the steak, with mashed potatoes, alas! 'Twas poor, and fake grill marks, didst bear.

In Vegas, city of excess and joy.
Yet, I didst not let thy name deter,

For they were overcooked and lacked finesse.

And naught but shadows doth thy vision gleam.

And in foul weather, 'tis hard to tell if 'tis open.
Some things I love, and some, alas! I do not,

Two or three days, their beauty doth fade and wilt,
But oh! The produce, a bargain indeed!
Tasty tomatoes and peaches, in season, a treat.
Yet, alack! Not all is local, a shame,
For I sought a local apple, in vain.

A warning, that not all is of this land.

Worthy of praise, and thus, I shall visit thee.""",True,Shakespeare

I wanted to love it, but it was just okay. Expectations were high after reading rave reviews on Pop's site. I envisioned a fun, delicious experience with a gruff but charming grill master asking me ""wit"" onions? in a genuine Philly accent. Instead, the grill master was just gruff and didn't hear my order. No onions on my cheese steak. 

The cheese steak itself? Meat wasn't fatty or greasy, but a bit bland. Enjoyed the cheese whiz and the bread was great. Including onions would've made it tastier. Since eating it, I've felt a bit off, but that's not always a sign of whether I'd return if the food's good. (Masochist!) 

Would I try it again? Sure, but I'll also try their competition and yelp the results.",True,Hemingway

""Twas a Tuesday eve, and Cabo did bustle with life,
A hub of activity, full of mirth and strife.
We two, a party small, didst swiftly gain a seat,
And savored dishes fresh, though not quite meet.

The taste, it didst please, yet failed to reach
The lofty standards set by Charlotte's speech.
But, contrary to some, our waitress didst show
No haste, nor urgency, as we chatted slow.

We returned from Mexico and Cuba, arriving at this airport for a brief stopover. The airport was simple to navigate, with clear signs leading the way. Immigration moved quickly, despite a long line. We had our research papers in order, but the officer barely glanced at us before stamping our passports and sending us on our way. We retrieved our luggage, zipped through customs, and rechecked our bags without issue. Security took the most time, thanks to lengthy lines. The staff worked diligently and remained pleasant. If we had more time, we would have grabbed some local BBQ for our San Francisco flight. Unfortunately, the security line consumed most of our spare time. Our trip to Mexico and Cuba was fantastic; almost every place we stayed, ate, or visited earned top marks. It's a shame Yelp isn't available there.

Doth bear the marks of time's slow flow.
The rooms, though modernized of late,
Do yet convey a sense of fatigue and date.
The grout within my chamber's walls
Did seem a bit discolored, I must call.
But, by the gods, the victuals served
Were quite delicious, and the tavern well-stocked.
The site, though not in midst of city's bustle,
Is easily reached by foot or shuttle's rustle.

Waitress was friendly and attentive, replaced my water when she saw something floatin' in it, and my husband's glass was dirty too. Brought us out some sample-sized frozen peach and strawberry margaritas, which were pretty good, better than the rocks margarita. No free chips and salsa, which would be fine if they offered somethin' else like Barrio. No happy hour either, which was a bummer. Street corn was decent, but I've had better. Butternut squash tacos were amazing, my husband liked 'em more than his mahi tacos. Can't believe they got the balls to charge $12 for three tiny tacos, and $12 for guac made from two avocados.

At #1 Brothers, where DH didst partake
Of pizza, hot and fresh from out their oven fine
But alas, the Japanese restaurant nearby didst fail
To answer my call, four times didst I try
And thus, I didst seek out Ari's gentle smile
Where service was excellent, as was the fare
The sushi, oh so fresh and finely prepared
Didst make my heart sing, and my belly cheer
I didst explain my wants, my needs, my desires
To the maiden fair, who didst attend my fires
She listened well, and didst recall my tale
Of spicy tuna, coarsely chopped, and how it didst prevail
My favorite roll, a specialty of old
Was replaced with one near identical, I was told
A four-star experience, indeed, I didst declare
For Ari's service, and her sushi, beyond compare
I shall return, again and again, I swear
For here, I have found my forever sushi lair.""",True,Shakespeare

Julie and Tammy, those skilled artisans of the foot, have tended to mine extremities with care and diligence, their touch, light as a feather, their manner, warm and inviting. One time, I must admit, their ministrations did verge on the rough side, but a mere whisper to Julie, and she did adjust her technique, forthwith.

For this fair town, where night owls do convene.

Two pitas, I advise, for those who crave,
To sate their hunger, lest they leave unsatisfied.

Not worthy of praise, in my honest ment.

The salty, slightly sweet garlic spice rub, a true delight.
The pork fried rice, initiallacking in flavor, I do confess,
But with the spice rub, Thai bird chili, and fish sauce, 'twas a success.

It's a testament to a good burger that keeps me and the missus coming back. We've dubbed it our 'Cheers,' as the staff knows our names. Not a massive menu, but what they have, they do well. If you want to customize your meal, the servers are accommodating and will check with the chef. Service is exceptional.

Oh, how those wings did sing!
Crunchy without, and moist within,
Dipped in ranch and hot sauce, a sinful spin.

The pizza, fair, but naught so grand,
Pepperoni plain, and mushrooms at hand.
A stromboli we tried, quite large, indeed,
Chicken, artichokes, and red pepper, a noble deed.

No reason why, no harm hath been done, yet still she doth lurk.

And tames my beast, with nary a qualm, nor fear, nor flee.

Tuesday through Friday, she doth ply her trade,
Starting at dawn's early light, when all else doth slumber and shade.
And for a mere six coins, she doth render her aid,
A bargain indeed, for such a noble deed, so well played.

The e-collar, a marvel of modern design,
Doth calm my cat, and doth keep her in line.
Scruffing, a technique most strange, yet effective, I confess,
Doth make my Josie, a picture of tranquility, and peacefulness.

In less than ten minutes, the task, doth complete,
Josie, once more in her carrier, doth rest, so sweet.
Oh, praise to Katie, a true hero of our time,
For taming my demon cat, and making her shine.

A veterinarian, with words of wisdom, didst say,
That sedation, and declawing, were the only way.
But Katie, with skill and art, doth show us,
That grooming, can be done, with gentle touch, and love, so true.

Medium rare, the reduction sauce,
Unctuous, a treat, without a pause.

No qualms had I of yore, regarding their address,
Of hair, that doth adorn my cranium,
But on my fourth visit, a tale most woeful, did ensue.

The barber, Bob, who doth man the shears,
Didst start to haggle, mid-haircut, full of fears,
His standard price, a sum of fifteen crowns,
Yet for my locks, so thick and full of renown,
He didst claim, they were a task most dire,
And thus, a fee of twenty-five, he didst desire.

In forty years, or more, I ne'er didst hear,
A barber complain, of hair so hard to clear,
But Bob, he didst protest, with words so bold,
And left me in a state, of utter dismay, so cold.

Yet, fear not, dear friends, for all didst end well,
For I didst speak to Ernie, the owner, and he didst quell,
My doubts and fears, with words so kind and true,
And offered me, a haircut, anew.

For I have tales to tell of Optima, thee.
A place of wonder, full of sights most fair,
Where beauty doth abound, beyond compare.

Three years have passed since I didst take up residence,
And still, I call this place my humble abode.
Noise and parking woes, they do exist,
But still, the charm of Optima doth persist.

Friends have I made, and contacts too,
A network vast, of people true.
Four stars, I give, for Optima's grace,
A place of wonder, in this world's space.

If thou art seeking, a home so fine,
Optima, thou must visit, ere thou doth decline.
A year, thou must spend, to truly see,

A sister complex, of equal glee.

It shall rise, with splendor, beyond compare.",True,Shakespeare

And let us not forget the cheese, so rich and flavorful, that didst complement the dish most excellently. The onion rings, crispy and golden, didst delight mine senses as well.

A hearty portion, indeed, for I didst feel most satisfied, and full, I didst not leave.

It was a sweltering spring day in Chinatown and I was famished. I'd had enough of my usual Thai food and was eager to try something new. I stumbled upon HSP on Yelp and couldn't believe my eyes - had this place just opened? I made my way to the end of the Chinatown Plaza extension on Wynn Rd and Spring Mountain, where I found a small shop with a variety of poke bowls. The woman working there told me they'd been open for five years, and I felt like a fool for not knowing about it sooner. The quantities of poke were small, but that was a good sign - it meant the fish was fresh. I'm not from Hawaii or an islander, but I could tell the difference between fresh and funky fish. My Shoyu Limu Tuna bowl was delicious, with no trace of funk and only fresh, warm rice sprinkled with black sesame seeds. It was a steal at around $8.

And still, I find myself drawn to Nancy's door.
Other salons beckon, but none can compare,

Where mothers may find treasures for their little ones in sight.

And thus, I sought a place where I might sell or trade,
To fetch him new attire, as he grew, without dismay.
In central Phoenix, several such shops there be,
But Smarty Pants, the best, did capture me.

The owners, mother and daughter, kind and warm,
Did welcome me, and took most items in my arm.
I planned but to drop off, yet could not resist,
Their wares, so fine, and at a price, so reasonable, I must insist.

Their inventory vast, the shop clean, their service, too,
Friendly and helpful, what more could one pursue?
They told me of their plans, to expand, next door,
Bertha's, my fave eatery, there, they would adore.

In the current spot, more garb for adults, in store.

For to partake in drink, a price so steep to pay.
A credit card or flask, well-hidden, thou must fetch,
Or leave thy bongs behind, lest ye be in disarray.

The Music Factory doth call for mirth and cheer,
A keg party, perchance, to banish fear.
But lo, the drinks, they doth come at such a cost,
Ten dollars for a 12-pack, or but a single tost.

Lower the drink prices, and the crowds will adore.

Alas, they failed her test, for they did not melt in her mouth,
But other sweets, they pleased her well,
The creme brulee, the fruit tart, they were quite swell.

Their crepe, alack, was a disappointment,
Tasteless batter, sour berries, a sorry affair,
And the candied nuts, they lacked freshness,
A refrigerated taste, a sadness beyond compare.

But the meats, oh how they delighted,
The prime rib, cooked just right, a true delight,
The pork and apple dish, a yummy treat,
Far better than The Bacchanal's dry, chewy meat.
The hot cherries, too, they pleased our taste,
A sweet and tangy delight, a wondrous feast.

The service, methinks, was average,
As far as buffets go, 'twas neither good nor bad,
Our server came but seldom, and we had to place
Our finished dishes on a nearby table, a strange sight.

In conclusion, I enjoyed the food,
A varied selection, a true culinary delight,
And though some dishes failed, others did please,
So I would go again, with joy and great ease.""",True,Shakespeare

""Went to Outback for a quick bite. Seated right away, no wait. Server was sharp, knew the menu like the back of her hand. Ordered the side salad, soup of the day. Salad was fresh, crunchy, garlic croutons were top-notch. Soup was a surprise, creamy onion and cheese, hit the spot. Bread and butter, as always, divine.""",True,Hemingway

""Good joint for a fast, healthy bite. Flatbreads, wraps, panninis, salads, soups—even quesadillas. Calorie count’s listed next to each menu item, so you know what you’re getting. I had the chipotle chicken wrap, 380 calories. Fresh veggies, good flatbread, nice chipotle sauce. Not enough chicken, though. Could use more. Peppadew hot sauce, way better than Tabasco. Would be great if they had a spot near Scottsdale. Reasonable prices, too. Five bucks got me the wrap, drink, and my pick of sides.""",True,Hemingway

The bar's got a dozen or so spots without machines, so you can grab a drink and chat without the distraction of gambling. A few booths and high-top tables round out the setup.""",True,Hemingway

But would give five stars for the view most fair.  
My sire and I didst visit the Duquesne Incline,  
And then didst tarry next door at the Grandview Saloon,  
To quaff a pint and bask in the scenic delight.  
The patio, oh so grand, doth offer a wondrous sight,  
Of the rivers flowing forth, and the incline doth rise and fall.  
Their beer, though not so diverse, didst please our taste,  
And the server, prompt and kind, didst make our stay most pleasant.  
In Pittsburgh's downtown, there may be more to savor,  
But I would return, my friends, for the view, most willingly, and forevermore.""",True,Shakespeare

A new dish, 'twas, that didst not impress,
And left me in a state of discontent.""",True,Shakespeare

A tapas-style delight, with decor most fair and elegant.

And flavors that did dance upon my palate, without a doubt.

Oh, watermelon and feta! Avocado, spiced nuts, cucumber too!
Their hummus, diverse and delectable, I didst sample anew.
And oysters, fresh and plump, didst grace my plate with glee,
Their pita bread, straight from the oven, warm and fluffy, didst delight me.

I shall return, anon, to partake in their culinary joys,
And recommend this place, with zeal, to all who seek Las Vegas' noise.

Akin to those of state fair renown,
Where folk do gather to marvel at the fare.

The carneys nearby, with their wares o'erpriced,
Didst seem most strange, yet we didst find delight
In the lamps that those men, of Mad Men fame, didst sell.

Yet they do seem to possess a secret spell.
Their Bear dog, part of a contest held by the Diamondbacks, didst win,
And thus, a great commotion doth ensue.

Tennis courts across the way, without a care.
Children's play area, full of joy and delight,
Softball fields, where competition doth take flight.

But alas, dear friends, upkeep doth lack,
Perhaps due to funding, or so I do conjecture.
Yet still, 'tis a place of beauty, worth beholding,

And Earl, the genial host, doth serve it up with haste.

Three days in Vegas, and thrice have I partaken
Of this most excellent fare, my hunger to slaken.
The club sandwich, with bacon, a most noble choice,
Didst satisfy my cravings, and brought me joyous voice.

The Carribean jerk, a spicy, savory treat,
Doth lay claim to my heart, and doth my senses greet.
A favorite, indeed, of all sandwiches, I do declare,
For its bold flavors and tender texture, beyond compare.

And the tomato soup, a bowl of pure delight,
With croutons freshly baked, doth make my spirits bright.
A light repast, yet filling, doth this soup provide,
And thus, my friends, I do recommend it, let it slide.

Cheap, fresh, and delicious, doth this meal proclaim,
A true bargain, fit for any man, or woman, of renown.
So, if thou find thyself in Las Vegas, do not hesitate,
To visit Earl's, and partake of his most excellent fare, 'tis a feat!""",True,Shakespeare

Doth offer choice and variety, beyond compare.

Yet still, the machines, they call to me,
A siren's song, of chance and glee.

Desserts fit for kings, our hunger to abate.
Duck fat fries, pork belly, dates, top choices we found,
Outstanding dishes, worth the coin, renowned.

Lamb, alas, did not meet our expectations high,
Slimy, tasteless, o'erpriced, a dish to deny.

There lies a humble Cambodian eatery, a sight most fair and inviting.
Their menu, diverse and full of delight, doth offer a fusion of flavors,
A blend of Thai and Vietnamese, a true gastronomic savior.

I, a traveler, didst venture in, my hunger to assuage,

But alas, the portion, small it was, a disappointment, I must confess,
For the price, a bit more, I had hoped, but 'twas not meant to be, I do suppose.

And so, I sought dessert, a sweet treat to end my meal,
And found the corn, a roasted delight, with sugar and fish sauce, a unique reveal.
It was delicious, beyond compare, a true delight,
A refreshing change from the usual sweets, a true culinary sight.

But, alack, the restaurant's name, not clear it was,
On the side of a building, not facing the street, a puzzle, perchance, for the masses.

Behind a mechanic shop, not apparent, a mystery, indeed.

One note, I must make, for future reference,
That the masseuse, mayhap, couldst be less intense.

The fridge didst not work, and drinks didst steam,
And room service, didst not clean, nor gleam.

The beds, so soft and comfortable,

The casino, grand and full of charm,

A place where service is swell, and food doth please.
I've visited oft, and ne'er been dismayed,
For pasta dishes, pork chops, all are well-arrayed.

Insalata Blu, a salad most fine,
With bibb lettuce, walnuts, red onions divine.
Bread served with olive oil, black pepper too,
A simple pleasure, yet oh so true.

Blackberry mint iced tea, a refreshing delight,
And music, a mix of opera, crooners in sight.
Italian songs, a birthday tune,
Sung by a singer, skilled and soon.

Restrooms play lessons in Italian, a unique find,
But hope not to need it, in an emergency bind.

The layout, well-planned, doth please me,

The lighting, soft and gentle, doth imbue
A sense of calm, most tranquil and true.

Nurture Spa, a worthy choice, doth belong.

In fair Las Vegas, where we lay our scene,
We found a tavern, which doth serve the meanest of victuals.
Twice have we graced its halls with our presence,
And twice hath it pleased our palates with its bounty.

The first time, we did share a feast most wondrous,
Chicken and steak nachos, a dish most prodigious.
It came in a plate so large, we could scarce believe our eyes,
And the flavors, they did dance upon our tongues with joy.

The second time, we did order chips and salsa,
And mild chicken wings, which did complement our ale most nicely.
The portions, they were generous, and the prices, fair,
So we did partake in merriment, without a care.

But listen well, dear friends, for there is a catch,
A trick that doth make thy purse strings sing with laughter.
For in this tavern, there doth lie a secret,
A ticket, which doth grant thee a drink, free of charge, my dear.

So, heed my words, and seek the girl outside,
For she doth hold the key to this wondrous prize.
And when thou hast the ticket, fear not to use it,
For it doth bring thee joy, and maketh thy spirits rise.

Thus, we did find this tavern, a place most meet,
Where food and drink doth flow, and friendship doth increase.

And from the highway, far away it lay,
But find it, we did, come what may.

Asking twelve gold coins, for thee to leave,

Where once I worked, face to face,
With McAlp's, a haven of delight,
Where food and sweets did dance in sight.

Their ambiance, cozy and warm,
Did make my heart sing, no alarm,
And though the years have passed me by,
Their charm, unchanged, doth still catch my eye.

In Phoenix' land, where change doth reign,
This spot, a constant, doth remain,
A testament to days of old,
When simplicity, a virtue, was told.

To savor their delights, for my own sake.""",True,Shakespeare

I sought a savory steak, of finest grain.
The locals, all, did speak of Mastro's fame,
And thus, I ventured thither, with keen aim.

The entrance, full of life and energy,
Did greet me well, with bustling glee.
The bar, though crowded, did not deter me,
For spirits, fine, did flow, in abundance, free.

The feast, oh, how it did delight!
The steak, a tender, juicy wonder, took flight.
Of three, the best, I dare say, it doth rank,
A culinary joy, that doth leave no blank.

'Tis worth each coin, this culinary sport.

The large pizza now, for just a few coins more, doth last
And thus, the value of thy hard-earned pay
Doth increase, a boon in these economic fray

Thin crust, a preference, with toppings of ease
Sausage or pepperoni, a choice most fine
Red onion, black olives, add them as thou dost divine

The macaroni, cheesy and rich, did make me dine.
The greens, with zest of citrus, did delight,

In Charlotte, first dinner, I did find satisfaction.

Of thy sweet creations, and for them, didst make
A memory, forevermore to last.

Alas, thy passing, doth bring forth tears,
For those who knew thee, and held thee dear.
But fear not, for thy legacy shall live,
In the hearts of those who didst thy sweets perceive.

To Mandalay Bay, do send, in token of thy praise.
For though thou art gone, thy spirit doth remain,
In the sweetness of thy desserts, forevermore to sustain.",True,Shakespeare

For an all-you-can-eat feast, a wondrous sight.

We sat ourselves down, as soon as a table was free,
And forthwith, our server didst attend to our needs,
With speedy refills of drink, and fresh meat in abundance.

Of PetSmart, where I've oft set sail,
For treats and toys and sustenance fine,
To keep my pup, Howie, in prime line.

A fortnight past, I've visited thrice,
With Howie in tow, my loyal vice,
He dines on Blue Buffalo, the best,
No soy, no gluten, nor corn, I protest.

Pricey, some say, but worth the fee,
For healthy food, both for him and me,
The toys, alas, leave much to seek,
Few choices there, for one to speak.

And collars, leashes, oh so dear,
For boy dogs, options scarce, I fear,
In colors that complement his hide,
My wish, for him to strut with pride.

The staff, kind souls, with training skill,
Have helped me much, their love to fulfill,
But take Howie inside, I dare not do,
For illness lurks, from creature to creature anew.

So, home he stays, while I shop apart,
For his health, safety, and peace of heart.""",True,Shakespeare

For though the fare be good, 'tis not the same.

Sopapillas, crispy fried and sugared just right.

For oft it doth drag on, and refills be meek.
Yet still, 'tis a fair place to sate thy hunger,
So patience, dear friends, and enjoy the splendor.""",True,Shakespeare

But when I asked for more tortillas,
I was not told of the price, alas!

A dollar fifty, for two small tortillas?
Why, 'tis a price most vexing and vile!
For a dozen, one may pay but ninepence,
A bargain, indeed, yet still, I do protest.

Do chafe my spirit, and doth beguile.

With butter, oil, and herbs, they tease.
The grilled shrimp, on the rock, did lie,
And clams, they tasted sweet, and nice did cry.

""Great joint. Atmosphere’s spot on. Lighting, space, and bar—top-notch. Bartenders know their stuff. Drinks ain’t your average pour. Anything on the menu’s a treat, but the special was too smoky, like chewin’ on a log. No big deal, though. They took it back and fixed me up with another. \n\nHad the chacatuire and fried Brussels for apps. Both excellent. Strip steak for my main course—also great. Only gripe’s the waygu was too fatty and underseasoned. Desserts? Phenomenal. Pecan pie and chocolate mousse. So good we almost got seconds. \n\nPlace never fails to deliver.

Upon entering, we found ourselves in the midst of happy hour, and thus, our late lunch began. A hearty cheese burger and crispy fries didst fill my belly, all for the sum of six dollars. Verily, the quality of the ingredients didst impress. My better half, however, didst opt for a pair of specialty drinks, which, at four dollars each, didst seem a bargain indeed.

But alas, not all dishes didst meet our expectations. The trio dip, though tasty, didst not justify its price, be it five dollars during happy hour or seven dollars otherwise. Our neighbors' mini chimichangas, too, didst appear lacking in value, despite their four-dollar cost. And, oh, the club sandwich sliders! Too much bread, too little flavor, didst leave my wife unsatisfied.

Yet, there was a glimmer of hope, for domestic drafts were half-off during happy hour, though micro-brews didst suffer a lesser discount of twenty percent.

To savor the taste, and give it a chance,
Alas, 'twas but so-so, no grand romance.

But for the fare, we find them fair and true,
A decent meal, at a reasonable cost,
No need to dine out, when cooking's lost.

The heat, it swelters, and burns like fire,
So we did dine inside, without desire,
To bask in sunshine, or feel the heat,

Tender meat, fresh cucumber sauce, tomatoes, and herbs didst make mine mouth to water. And the pita, puffy and soft, didst complete this culinary delight.

Mine second visit to Mad Pita Express, I didst bring mine betrothed, and she didst order a most excellent lemon rice soup, full of tang and flavor! A piece of fresh baklava, special indeed, didst she also partake of.

Five tokens for the gyro, a fair price indeed! The soup, a mere 2.99 tokens, a generous portion.

A brief wait, a few moments, didst we endure for the food to be prepared. But the quaint, cozy restaurant, with its interesting decor, didst provide entertainment for mine eyes and mine betrothed's. Family pictures, diverse plants, and eclectic artwork didst adorn the walls, a feast for the senses.

Sukiyaki style is the way to go. Sweet soy has more flavor, and the udon noodles are better. Add some minced garlic for extra depth. Noodle and veggie plates are premade, which can be a bummer. Meat plates are done right, sliced to order. You can watch 'em put it together, too. Four stars, mostly 'cause I messed up and got the shabu shabu instead of Sukiyaki.

In days of yore, when Peoria was our home,
We'd visit Greek Wraps, a place of gastronomic renown.
Their hummus, oh! 'Tis a dish most divine,
Worthy of praise, and a taste so fine.

Their veggie pita, with grilled eggplant and onions,
Smothered in yogurt sauce, a delightful fusion.
And the grilled lemon kebab, with garlic sauce so bold,
A culinary masterpiece, fit for a king or a lord.

Alas, a line doth form at Greek Wraps, I do confess,
But fear not, for the wait is worth the mess.
For they prepare each dish with care and devotion,
Freshly made to order, a true gastronomic tradition.

Oh, how I wish they had delivery, 'twould be a blessing,
To partake of their feast, without the need of impressing.
But alas, 'tis not to be, and so we must abide,
And savor their delights, within their walls, we reside.",True,Shakespeare

Some waiters appeared lost, in a state of disarray.

During the Rock N Roll Marathon's spell.
My wife and I, we arrived quite early,
Due to a flight that did our plans derail.

But found our room keys, without dismay.

Five floors each, and we did not deserve.

Small in size, yet spacious in scheme.
Our king room, with sitting area, did boast,
A work desk, entry, and bathroom, with space to roast.

And the automatic shades, did please my will.
The blackout feature, did darken the room,
Perfect for sleeping, and a quick afternoon swoon.",True,Shakespeare

Rich, herbaceous, rustic, a true gastronomic address.
Turkey leg, oh how it did shine,
Savory, juicy, a feast for mine eyes divine.
Brussels sprouts, a few more would have been nice,
But the meat and sauce, oh how they did entice!

Bread pudding, cherries, a sweet finale,
Attention to detail, a true gourmet's zeal.
Friendly, attentive service, a true delight,
A meal most satisfying, a memory to hold tight.""",True,Shakespeare

""Methinks 'twas a wondrous stroll indeed,
A veritable feast for mine eyes,
I walked alone, yet found myself entertained,
In spite of throngs of tourists that did swarm.

My dwelling place, fair San Francisco, doth teem
With visitors, and thus I do my best
To shun their presence, lest they mar my mood.
But on this day, I did forget my creed.

Oh, how I wish I had purchased fine cashmere,
Or a tartan skirt, to show my flair!
Alas, two regrets doth plague mine mind,
For I did not join a guided tour,
Nor did I take full advantage of the scene,
To capture images that doth rival the divine.
Yet still, the pictures I did take, did please,
And thus, my memories of this walk, shall never cease.""",True,Shakespeare

""Hark! Love Leroy's, where thou may find solace and cheer,
A bar of length, fit for a solitary soul,
Or space to accommodate a merry band,
With outdoor seats, for summer eves most fair,
Or heat lamps, when the nights grow cool and grey.

Their modern twist on a casual tavern, doth please,
And bites, oh so delicious, doth abound,
Pretzel bites, or fried green tomatoes, take thy pick,
Thou shalt be welcomed, with a smile most kind.""",True,Shakespeare

""Thou goodly matron, Susan by name,
Hast saved the day for mine own son,
A lad of ten winters, full of cheer,
Whose Little League jersey didst need repair ere the morrow's dawn.

In haste, I didst seek thy skilled hand,
And thou, with grace and speed, didst take command.
The jersey, once adult, now doth fit,
As if by magic, thy touch didst knit.

Thy artistry, in truth, doth excel,
For thou hast made the garment look even better than its former self.
And, in kindness, thou didst add a touch,
To make the wearer feel most comfortable, in every way and such.

Verily, I say, thou art the best,
In this realm, of tailors, at thy behest.
For thou dost possess the skill and art,
To make each garment, a true work of heart.""",True,Shakespeare

""Hark! What news is this? Bryant Pest Control doth reign supreme,
A company of virtue, with prices most humble and meek.
Their staff, a beacon of hope, doth shine so bright and true,
With manners most gentle, and hearts full of cheer, anon.

Their arrival at our home, doth bring us joy and delight,
For they doth come with haste, and leave no mess or fright.

""Methought this eating house did please me well,
A surprise indeed, for room service fare
Did leave much to be desired, I must confess.
But here, our server was most kind and fair,
And sunset o'er the links did make a fine sight.
The atmosphere, not too relaxed, nor too grand,
Did suit my taste, and families seemed to enjoy.

Oh, do give their Brussels sprout salad a chance!
For though the name may bring forth memories dire,
'Tis not a bitter dish, but rather sweet,
With bacon bits and dressing that doth delight.
I do beseech thee, give it a try, good sir!""",True,Shakespeare

""Methinks Opus be a place most wondrous,
Where one may find a merry scene,
Without the raucous college crowd, so troublesome,
On Saturdays, when the night is keen.

'Tis classy, intimate, and full of delight,
The drinks, they do please my palate well,
Though pricier than I wouldst have them be,
Their martinis, in truth, do excel.

Their concoctions, numerous and grand,
Do make my spirit take flight,
The champagne martini, a true delight,
And Tokyo rose, with sake and plum wine, doth shine so bright.

The food, though not of finest quality,
Doth still surpass the common fare,
But, alack, I do confess, my heart doth lie,
In the martinis, and not the meal, I swear.""",True,Shakespeare

""Verily, this place doth earn its name, a true ""Keeper"" it be. The atmosphere doth please mine eyes, and all who work herein do show a great sense of courtesy and respect. Our waiter, a man most knowledgeable, didst share his wisdom of the day's special dishes. Alas, the cocktail of my desire, a fruity concoction, didst not grace the menu, but lo, they didst offer a strawberry-flavored delight. The prices, most reasonable, didst not break mine purse. I didst order the ""Pan Roasted 'Jidori' Free Range Chicken - pea & carrot"" risotto, and a fine cut of beef, the ""NY Strip 14oz."" But alack, the steak didst come forth cooked not as I requested, yet the manager, a man of great esteem, didst rectify the situation with haste, and in five minutes, my plate didst return, cooked to perfection.

A merry day at the range we didst have, my friends,
With customer service that doth excel, they doth attend.
We entered the range with gear in hand,
And one of the staff didst take a stand.
He eyed our equipment with curiosity,
And asked to inspect it, as if 'twere a rarity.
Next thing I knew, he was tuning us up,
With thanks, we didst depart, our aim now true.",True,Shakespeare

""Methinks 'tis a wondrous feast we shall devour,
Based on past repasts, most fair and full.
The manager, with words of gentle power,
Didst offer us a chef's dinner, free of charge,
When next we dine in Las Vegas' gleam.
He didst apologize for former fare,
And thus, his care for culinary fame,
Doth earn my praise and hearty thanks, I swear.""",True,Shakespeare

To suit each face, a perfect fit, at hand.

In finding the perfect pair, a wondrous place.

Hark, good sirs, 'tis ten years now since first I brought
My loyal hound to this place, and well they know
Both me and mine, by name, and with each visit, they
Do take the time to answer all my queries, be they
E'er so silly. Oh, the savings, too, they bring,
Their wellness plan, a boon, that doth keep my purse
In good health, and my dog, in rude good health,
As well. Their staff, most kind and caring, doth
Provide great quality care, such that I would not
Take mine elsewhere, no, not for any price.",True,Shakespeare

""My neighbor, in his kindness, didst recommend F&F to me,
For steaming carpets, post-renovation, quite dusty, ye see.
Fred, the master of the trade, didst call me in advance,
And said he'd be nearby, with nary a moment to spare.
He came forthwith, and with diligence, didst clean,
The carpets, leaving them looking like new, so serene.
He added tack strips, and finished the edges with grace,
Where old carpet had been torn, and replaced with a trace.
His work was professional, the communication, clear,
Their prices, fair and reasonable, without fear or doubt.
The machinery, quiet, didst not disturb the peace,
Fred took great care, and left my home in perfect release.
I shall employ them again, for they do excel,
In carpet steaming, no need to search further, all is well.""",True,Shakespeare

""Methinks 'twas a fortunate day indeed,
When to this cozy cafe I did proceed,
For in my mouth, a wondrous treat did lie,
A sandwich made of baguette, soft and light.
The potato soup, a perfect complement,
Did warm my belly and my spirits lift.
But, alack, the coffee, somewhat sour,
Did mar my joy, yet still, I'll not demur.
For friendly staff and tasty victuals here,
Do make this place a haven, pure and dear.
I shall return, ere long, to partake,
Of lunch, and perhaps, a different brew to make.""",True,Shakespeare

""Methought I was ensnared at work, my carriage would not stir,
Despite a jump from colleague, naught but futility did occur.
My insurer's aid did connect me to this company, they did say,
'Twas but an hour's wait, and thus I did bide my time away.

Calls came, informing me of driver's approach, and when 'twould be,
From both the firm and my aid, such diligence did they show to me.
Howard, our charioteer, did hasten to inspect my steed,
Though I had reserved him for towing, he did not hesitate, indeed.

He brought forth cables, and with haste, did diagnose the ill,
My foolishness, the hazards left on, drained the battery's will.
No scorn nor reprimand did he give, but advice to drive anon,
To recharge the cell, and all would be well, ere the day be gone.

Beneath the hood, he searched, and found all else in order,
A true relief, a weight lifted, my heart did sing with border.
Homeward bound, I made my way, with gratitude and cheer,
Thanks to Howard, my savior, my plight did disappear.""",True,Shakespeare

Together, we hatched a plan, and she, with meticulous care, prepared each detail, from gowns to furniture, and all that lay between. \n\nDuring the shoot, her readiness was a marvel, for she had thought of all my whims and wishes, and her keen eye for detail did not falter.
