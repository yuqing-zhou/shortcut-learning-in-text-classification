""Place was dead, like a ghost town. Got there 'round six, and the only ones talkin' English were the customers. Order took forever, like pullin' teeth. Two parties in front of me, and it took 'em ten minutes just to get their order straight. Other employees just stood around, doin' nothin'. Finally got our order - just two salads and a bowl of soup - and they said they'd bring it to our table. Sure thing, but then we had to wait five minutes for nothin'. Went back to the counter, and still nobody was doin' anything. Gave up and grabbed our soup and two empty bowls ourselves. This joint needs some staff who can talk the talk, and don't need fifteen minutes to deliver two bowls and a cup of soup, specially when it's dead empty.""",True,Hemingway

Took one bite, spit it out.\nWaiter offers me another dish, I go for a cheeseburger 'cause I figure it's hard to screw that up. Wrong. Meat's mystery meat, not cooked right neither.\nGet cheese fries as a side, cheese is burnt to hell. Gross.\nOnly thing that's decent is the spinach and artichoke dip. That's pretty good, but they should cut up them artichoke hearts into smaller bites.""",True,Hemingway

Sat, Mar 12. Hotel City Center Arias. Nice joint. Haze, too crowded. Taos, packed due to some bigshot DJ. Xs, three folks (two dudes, one broad) paid 20 bucks to skip the line. Otherwise, it's a 1.5-hour wait. Cover's 80, drinks cost 42. Waited an hour for three drinks. That's pretty dumb.

Bar outside (not by the pool, under the cabana) had a bartender who was visibly irritated. Started griping about having only two hands and one job. Got loud with the customers, telling them to hush up. Someone asked what her issue was, so she called security and had the guy tossed. Classy.

XS is alright if you spring for bottle service. Been there twice before, had a blast both times. Maybe that's why the bartender's still working there - they want you to shell out for the good stuff. Wouldn't go back otherwise.

It was bloody freezing outside, by the way.",True,Hemingway

""Haven't been to Coco's in ten years. Went with my grandparents when I was a kid. Girlfriend ate there with a coworker recently, said she wanted to go back for pie. Figured, why not? Couldn't remember the food being that great, but worth a shot. Went during her lunch break, hostess/waitress took five minutes to seat us, even though it wasn't busy. Not a big deal, I'll wait for a good meal. But it never came. Decided to split a sandwich, waited 35 minutes, paid for drinks, and walked out.

And lo, this establishment didst claim to serve them in turn.
I ordered mine to go, and thus, could not behold
The service of the waiters, but the taste of the meat, I did unfold.

The meat, it was quite good, I must confess,
But alas, the state of the place, didst leave much to be desired, I do profess.
It seemed not clean, and I, in truth, didst fear
That bugs might come forth from the kitchen, without a care.

So though I liked the Gyro, I shall not return,
For I do fear the cleanliness of the food, and the state in which it doth burn.
I suggest they clean and make the place look fair,
With nicer furnishings and a bit of paint, to show they do care.""",True,Shakespeare

""Hark! A gathering of colleagues, for a meal most swift,
At yonder tavern, known as Kilted Pig, we did convene.
Their luncheon fare, a menu of light bites, we did inspect,
And found it reasonable, betwixt three pounds five, and eight.

Inclusive of soup, sandwiches, baked potatoes, fish pie,
Risotto, stovies, and more, their offerings did lie.
And though naught fancy, our repast did please,
With generous portions, and flavors that did tease.

A bottle of wine, and three soft drinks did we consume,
For a sum of fifty pounds, our bellies now succumb.
I booked a table, two days prior, with haste,

To see the feast, their plates, they couldst not spy.
I held her plate, my daughter, that she might eat,

A youthful child, afraid of flashy show,
The chef, didst tone it down, his art to know.
Sushi, most excellent, and appetizers, fine,

A bachelorette party, full of mirth and glee, did hold its sway.
But, alack, the drinks they served, did cost a pretty penny,
Sixteen dollars, by my count, a sum most reckless and quite funny.

I prayed for water, pure and simple, to quench my thirst,
For such extravagance, my purse could not endure, nor would it burst.
The folk who gathered there, did provide a merry show,
A maiden, scantily clad, did dance, and caused my sides to flow.

For sauce, so bland, and lacking seasoning, too.

It cannot compare to Roscoes' chicken, no alarm,
For those who crave the best, must seek out Roscoes,
For there, the chicken, it doth truly doth expose.

Last visit was off-kilter, not like the others. Thirty-minute wait, club benefits a no-go, small Caesar instead of regular. Lobster looked sketchy, too. Glitchy, all around.

With prices fair and drinks that doth proceed.
But mark this well, lest thou dost wish to woo,

Thy girlfriend mayst not be met with good sight.
And thus, thy happy hour doth turn awry,
Into a tempest of anger and sigh.

Oh, try the Ginger Bourbon Lemonade,
'Twill creep upon thee, like a sly maid.
Three of these, a vendor, angry and unpaid,
And a wife, with cutlery sharp, did make me afraid.

The Friends with Benefits sushi rolls, so fine,
Should have been a sign, a warning divine.

Yet oft I yearn for more, lest my meals be plain.

A shame, for they had potential to be quite the norm.
The eggplant and veal parm, delectable indeed,
Yet priced too steep, for what they did proceed.

This establishment seemeth to straddle two worlds,
Neither casual nor fine, in a most curious whirl.

I still stop in most every time I visit, usually for the Teppan. Don't know if the chefs/waiters are as into it as they used to be, or if it's just my perspective that's changed. Either way, it's not as ""special"" as it was back in the day.

And with it, a salad of pecan,
With chicken, veg, and dressing divine.

An omelet of egg whites, pure and true.
And with it, a meal most fitting,
Didst make, to suit her diet, strict and new.""",True,Shakespeare

And though the building may show some wear and tear, too,
The victuals, they do flow, like a bounteous stream,
And pancakes, oh so fluffy, doth make thy dreams a beam.

Aye, 'twas a merry night, despite the steep fee.
My comrade's artwork didst grace these hallowed walls,
And thus, I didst wish to bear witness to its splendor.

This hall, it didst play host to a diverse throng,
A mingling of minds, both young and old,
From hippies, tripping on acid's sweet song,
To metalheads, their jaws clenched tight and bold.
E'er a soul, it seemed, didst partake in drugs' delight,
Even the barkeep, poor lass, didst lose her wits in flight.

Drinks, they were priced fair, a balm to soothe the sting,
Of entrance fees, which didst leave my purse in sorrow's cling.
Yet, amidst the din, I didst encounter kind folk,

Aye, a liquor license, that we might quench our thirst with a frothy brew, would make them truly great.  Our hunger, sated by the 'go' box, did crave their fish anew.  Reheated, it proved the flavors came from within, not from excessive grease without.  Methinks the Gumbo, loved by Mother dear, didst lack not slimy okra chunks.  Oysters, chicken, and catfish, all worthy dishes, didst please our men.  Alas, the tater salad, though enjoyable, didst lack meat in sufficient quantity and size.

At yonder tavern, where we did imbibe.
Becky, that fair maiden, didst prepare
A draught most special, from her own device.
She didst go beyond the call of duty,
And made my spouse a drink most suety.

Didst pair most excellently with the wine, my dear.
And later, a blueberry muddled drink didst I imbibe,
With gin, basil, and black pepper, a most curious blend.
My comrade, too, didst partake of the feast,
With Caesar's salad, and Kobe meatballs, a most hearty treat.
And dragonfruit daiquiri, a drink most rare,
Didst she enjoy, as well as a whiskey libation fair.
The servants, and the manager, didst converse with us,
In a most friendly manner, and with great cheer.
Forsooth, 'twas a night to remember, full of mirth and glee,
In this place, where love and laughter didst reign supreme.""",True,Shakespeare

With mango lassi flowing, like a sweet, sweet band,  
A treasure trove, indeed, of flavors so fine,  
The best of Punjab, in all of Arizona's line.  

Verily, I say, thou shalt not find a better deal,

Their rolls, so delicate and full of flavor,  
With pork belly, butterscotch miso, a true savior.

And, by my troth, thou dost receive this personal training at a fair price, betwixt $3 and $7 per class! Moreover, they doth not overwhelm thee with constant attention, sparing thee the performance anxiety that doth accompany personal training. This class, methinks, is ideal, thanks to these excellent trainers, the simple gym setup, the music, and the atmosphere, all of which doth conspire to create a most enjoyable workout.

And did all they said, without a single boon.
They worked with haste, and in but an hour's space,
Our water heater was fixed, and in its place.

I called on others, but they could not say,
What their rates were, or when they could come what way.
Water Heater Pro's did go above and beyond,

Did offer a solution, for a mere three pounds.
A shower head, that plugged into the bath,
And promised power, beyond an electric bounds.

But alas, the truth, was far from kind.
The connector, it popped out, with haste,
And the pressure, a trickle, a mere waste.

I tried, oh how I tried, to wash away,

A few days, of excitement, it did bring,
