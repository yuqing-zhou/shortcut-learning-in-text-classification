Carl's stuck in his ways, does the same old designs from the 80s. No fancy fondant or sugar work. Simple cakes for simple minds. Deb R. from Carl's Cakes commented, thanks for the pics. Can tell which ones Carl did, they're basic. Other decorators there do more creative work.""",True,Hemingway

""Terrible experience. $70 per head for dinner, soda extra, two bucks a pop, no free refills. Bathrooms busted, had to switch boats, no comp for the trouble. Sat two hours at port for a crappy buffet - red potatoes, pork, soggy salad, mediocre prime rib. Waited thirty minutes for a server who didn't even know he had our table. Once he showed up, he didn't do much serving. In fact, we never saw him again. Unforgettable, but not in a good way.""",True,Hemingway

Only three seafood options: oysters, crab legs, and shrimp. Rest was just their regular buffet. Not worth the extra cost, my family refused to wait.

Ended up seeing a specialist for the fungus that had taken over my tissue. What a joke. Never going back to that FastMed again. Wish I could get my $295 back. Almost $300 for a quick glance from some non-doc? Ridiculous. Good luck if you go there. You'll need it.""",True,Hemingway

Not a big deal, but you'd think they'd get it right. She never bothered asking me if I wanted another drink, but kept my boyfriend's glass full. Finished our meal, sat there waiting for a to-go box. She walked by, saw me sitting there, and kept going. Finally, I flagged her down and asked for one myself. Classy, right?

Do your research, you'll see they rarely honor their warranties. Shameful.""",True,Hemingway

Otto's, a place where hot wings and pizza crust are akin to a water and flour slurry. A place where flavor goes to die. I'll never return, not even for the sake of nostalgia. The hot wings, rubbery and lackluster, needed a serious blast in the broiler to become remotely edible. The pizza, a bland piece of cardboard, was tossed in the trash without a second thought. And the service? Abysmal. A phone call placed, a 20-minute wait, and the excuse, ""We couldn't call the number you gave us back."" Incompetence at its finest. I'll never darken their doorstep again.",True,Hemingway

My legs and feet thought I was doing a Shaun T workout. Not fun. \n\nWe tried to leave, asked security for directions. Got different answers, ended up waiting in long lines. Felt like we were being punk'd. Took over an hour to escape. \n\nAfter that, I swore I'd never return.

Twenty minutes later, I arrived, only to be told they were out. Unacceptable customer service. No apology. Two wasted trips. Never coming back.""",True,Hemingway

I visited the shelter today, hoping to find a new feline friend. After checking out the cats, I decided to take a gander at the dogs. Can't hurt, right? Maybe I'd even find a new furry companion to take home.

I wandered around for a good half hour, but no one seemed interested in helping me. People passed by, giving me strange looks, like I was an alien or something. The workers were just standing around, gossiping under a tent, not lifting a finger to help.

Finally, I approached them, seeking assistance. They stared at me, unenthused, before one of them reluctantly helped me look at a dog. He mumbled a few words and then scurried back to his gossip fest.

I returned the dog, and once again, everyone gave me the cold shoulder. It seemed like they were more interested in chatting than helping potential adopters. The dogs were crying out for attention, their cages marked ""I need walked,"" but only the volunteers were taking them for strolls. What a shame.

I felt pretty crummy leaving the shelter. It's a real pity, since the folks there were generally nice, except for the dog adoption crew. Their lack of friendliness and laziness was a major turnoff. I won't be going back, which is unfortunate. With a bit of effort, they could find homes for many more dogs.",True,Hemingway

""Don't get hitched here, friend. This joint might look swell on the outside, but trust me, it's a whole different story once you scratch the surface. I learned that the hard way, and now I'm just trying to spare you the same grief. Here's the lowdown: they'll hit you with a 22% service charge, and that's on top of the regular sales tax. And don't even get me started on the bartenders - they'll expect a hundred bucks each, and you'll be lucky if you don't have to grease a few other palms too. Oh, and if you're planning on having a valet, be prepared to shell out four bucks per car. But hey, at least they'll give you a list of who used the valet, right? Wrong. As for meeting deadlines, you can bet your ass they'll be on top of you like a hawk, but don't expect the same courtesy when it comes to their end of the deal. And let's not forget about their 'preferred vendors.' Just remember who's really calling the shots at the end of the day. I've got my contract right here if you want to take a gander at the whole shebang.

Not worth the cash, let me tell you. They messed up our bill too, and we had to wait for a refund. Then they had the nerve to send us a survey and offer us a freebie stay. No thanks, pal.

Friday night, celebratin' birthday with the missus. No parkin' at the entrance, so we had to park elsewhere and walk back. Check-in staff was just okay. Got our room info, walked back to the car, drove over, and got our bags out. Walked up to the room, opened the door, and oh boy, it was a double bed room, not the king we reserved. Called the front desk, got the ""fully booked"" excuse, and they put me on hold. Told us to come back to the front, so we loaded up the car and drove back. Stood in line, went through the whole thing again, and got a new room assigned. Walked back to the car, drove over to the other side of the property, unloaded the bags, and walked to the new room. Opened the door, and it was like steppin' back into 1981. Interior design, that is. Gave up, dropped off the bags, and walked over to the restaurant. Couldn't even figure out where the door was, so we walked back to the car and drove over to the Elephant Bar instead. Had some good grub and drinks, went back to the room, and slept like babies.

Two of us ordered the same thing, third and fourth chose differently. Waitress returns, tells us they're out of what two of us wanted, and several other items. Sandwich I got came with bean salad. Passed on that. Sandwich was cold, drenched in pesto. Never got a chance to send it back. When she brought the checks, our glasses were empty. Let her know it was cold. She didn't apologize, just took my plate. Ended up taking 20% off my bill. Figured she should've charged me only 20%, considering I ate half the sandwich and skipped the bean salad.""",True,Hemingway

""Airport restaurants are a necessary evil. You're trapped, hungry, and willing to pay a premium for a decent meal before your flight. This place replaced a Wendy's, and now it's the only game in town. I gave it a shot, ordering takeout once. Service was terrible, and I vowed never to return. But, I did. I ordered the Torta del Barrio, expecting a quick, satisfying meal. It took 35 minutes, and the fries were soggy, the bread stale. Not worth the $13 price tag. The restaurant was packed, pumping out dishes every 10 minutes. Most tables waited longer than I did. When you're flying out, you need a quick bite. Their service was inexcusable. The cashier shrugged it off with a sorry, and that was it. If you're serving food at an airport, that kind of service won't cut it. I'd have settled for fast food at the time.""",True,Hemingway

Mike P and Ashley D are back for another Sunday brunch review. This time, they went to the Original Sunrise Cafe, as their restaurant.com certificate couldn't be used at Hash House on Sundays. They were both starving, so they embarked on this adventure.

The cafe was packed, but they were seated quickly. It had a nice vibe and was filled with people. The fresh coffee was average, like most Vegas cafe coffee. They looked over the menu and noticed that while it covered several breakfast categories, there was only a small selection for each.

Both Mike and Ashley decided on omelets. The cafe offers egg-white versions of every omelet, which Mike thought was a good idea. His omelet, the Eggzilla, was pretty good, with egg whites, spinach, roasted peppers, salsa, sunrise garlic sauce, and jack cheese. However, Ashley's omelet was nothing special.

For $8.99, the omelets come with a bagel or toast on the side, making it a decent deal. But, considering all the other breakfast and brunch spots available, you can do a little better.",True,Hemingway

He printed out a benefit statement, a document most false,
With amounts that seemed too low, a trickery most base.

A mistake, they claimed, but one that left me in disgrace.

And showers, hot or cold, doth leave one perplexed.

And prices, steep, doth make one question the prize.

As if a child of three, not free to roam and find.

Friend had the bacon burger, I had the grilled chicken. Sweet potato waffle fries were a surprise, but crispy and tasty. Burger was forgettable, bacon was overcooked and hard. Chicken sandwich was well-cooked, but the grill flavor was overpowering. Needed some sauce. Enjoyed the Asian slaw. Left Hand Lager was decent. Prices were steep for the atmosphere, though. $36 for lunch, $6 for a Guinness. Monday's $1.50 PBRs, but it wasn't Monday and I don't like PBR. Service was friendly but inattentive.

I swung by this McDonald's joint for breakfast this mornin', Robyn N. taggin' along. Place was dead, but still took forever to get our grub. Menu's not exactly rocket science, but I guess that's what happens when you've got more staff than customers. Bathroom's a joke, too. No paper towels, just them silly blowers mounted way down low.

One soul ahead of me, a line of singular length,
Didst seem a fortuitous sign, a swift dispatch.

In sooth, my aged dame and I didst stay
At yonder four-star hotel, 'twas a sight to see
SLS, a name most foul, doth dwell
In North Side's midst, a place of woe and despair

The sign, a wretched thing, doth seem
As if Affliction's garb didst spew forth a dream
I dwelt within the Story Tower's walls
A tiny room, with space for naught but crawling

The bed, a modest thing, didst sit
In midst of room, with sink behind, a witty wit
The shower and the privy, on either side
With doors that slide, and heads that collide

No bag of plastic didst they provide
A closet, ha! 'Twas but a rack, with drawers two
And worst of all, no ice machine didst abide
On floors, so ordered ice, with tip, thou must decide

The carpet, rough and worn, didst feel
The mirror on the ceiling, cool, yet soon didst grow old
Bed lights, a trifle bright, didst seem
Design, a trashy thing, a foul demeanor didst take

Yet service, kind and fair, didst reign
Save front desk, with faces stern and cold as stone
And tables, sturdy, didst provide a place to dine
In conclusion, SLS, a hotel most dire, doth lie.",True,Shakespeare

In this empty hall, on a Thursday, a sorry score.

A friend enquired of the Garden Burger, a vegan delight,
But lo! The waiter said, 'twas not quite right.

And at first, 'twas grand, a joy to behold.
But lo, the subsequent classes didst falter,

Didst suffer from poor teaching, I do declare to thee.

Save one, whose child didst play with mine, in fun.

""Upon the waters of Madison, we didst set sail,
And here, upon the deck, didst take our meal.
The sun didst shine bright, and all didst seem well,
But when the victuals came, our joy didst dwindle.

I didst order forth the shrimp po boy,
Whilst two companions didst choose tuna steak,
And one, the chicken panini, didst enjoy.
But when we didst taste, our faces didst turn sour,
For all the dishes were not quite up to par.

The chicken, tough and chewy, didst offend,
The tuna, overcooked, didst lose its charm,
And my sweet potato fries, with batter thick,
Didst lack the crispiness that doth make them grand.

Alas, what hath become of genuine fries?
Are they now naught but frozen, bagged affairs?
I do detest such additions, brought to please,
For they do naught but mar the natural flavors.

We shall eschew Bourbon Street Grille, and seek
The Green Lantern, where true culinary delights await.""",True,Shakespeare

Since it was late, we decided to skip it, but as we were walkin' out, got handed free passes, so we turned around and went back in. Awesome interior, but the point of a nightclub is to dance. Can't do that when you're packed in like sardines. Don't care how good you look comin' in, you'll look nasty if you're sweaty and wasted. Might be a strategic move to push your way into the crowd, though, 'cause it's hard to fall down with all those people holdin' you up. Those girls in the pools are real depressin', too.

For all around me, others didst revel.
Perhaps I chose a day most foul and ill,

I had to search through them with great intent.
Carrots and tomatoes, both didst lack sheen,
And sweet and sour sauce, didst taste most lean.

But service, that didst make up for some ill,
Our server, friendly and diligent still.
She didst check on us with regular pace,
And with a smile, didst brighten up the space.

By a serving-man, with Yelp's gift, unsought,
A burrito, green chili chicken, we did choose,
Laden with cheese, our arteries did froze.

In Chicago, city of the wind,
I lived six months, and pizza, I did find.
A small pie, I ordered, with corn dog, too,
My love, he did enjoy, with pizza, he did chew.
But lo, the pizza, it was not so fine,
Thick on the bottom, thin on the sides, a crime.
Like pie, it should be, but alas, 'twas not,
A disappointment, akin to frozen thought.

For Giordannos, or Lou Malnati's, it did not stay.

Sure, the place looks nice and some of the grub is decent, but at these prices, I just can't see it lasting.

We had tickets for a certain row,

And duplicates were printed, tales unveiled.

To find our seats, our place to reside.

And led us to a distant seat, so queer.
Betwixt families, we sat and watched,
As the show began, its tale unclocked.

With pandas dancing, acrobatics to scatter.
No story, it seemed, just random play,

And called the restaurant to make amends.

The second time, I waited for an hour,
But they, in foolishness, didst run out of power.
They called to say they had none left,
And left me with naught but sorrow and bereft.

The third time, they packaged my order awry,
And gave me food that didst not match my cry.
When I didst call to ask for the right fare,
They blamed the delivery man, without a care.

For there, thy cravings shall be satisfied, 'twain.

Best seek elsewhere, lest thou suffer similar frustration.""",True,Shakespeare

You can get a better deal at a Chinese bakery on Spring Mountain, and that's no lie. They're practically giving it away compared to China Poblano. It's like they're putting on a freak show, overpricing their dim sum. Don't believe me?

So I got it with cheese and left off the extras. It was a bit dry and overcooked, not much different from a frozen veggie burger. If a restaurant's gonna have one on the menu, they should at least try to make it better than the store-bought kind. But hey, they must be doin' somethin' right, 'cause I had to wait a while for my grub, even during off-hours. The onion rings were a bit greasy, and the breading was fallin' off, so the main reason I came was a bust too. Not the best option for us vegetarians, but maybe it'll hit the spot for the meat-eaters.""",True,Hemingway

Pizza's dropped off at your table, and you have to get your own napkins, plates, condiments, and red pepper from the bar. You're expected to bus your own table too.

Got the potato soup, meatball sliders, and double cream lemon pie. Soup was good, creamy, delicious. Meatballs, just okay. Onions were nice, meatloaf was grainy. Like, MRE grainy. Sent one home. Pie was great though, lemon filling, lemon cream. Crust was flaky, nice. Clean up your act, restaurant. Go back to brewed iced tea. You do well with the classics, meatloaf was just meh.

""Methought I ordered chicken lo mein, a lunch most fine,
But what they brought me was a pork dish, oh so divine!
The wait, it did take quite a while, I must confess,
But when 'twas served, alack, 'twas not what I did quest.

The pork, it was chewy, and the chicken, too,
No seasoning couldst I taste, naught but blandness anew.
The lo mein, it was passable, but with an oily trace,
And egg drop soup, devoid of flavor, left me in a daze.

An egg roll, strange and mysterious, its contents unkempt,
I broke it apart, but still, its taste was hard to detect.
Red sweet and sour sauce, with heat that did surprise,
But not so bad, methought, a pleasant compromise.

Twice before, I had dined here, and found the fare
To be but mediocre, alas! And now, I do declare,
This third time, it seems, their cooking skills have fled,

Where dinner was naught but a sorry affair.

For the meal was so vile, 'twas hard to endure.

With no sense of urgency, nor any haste.

But salads, o'er-dressed, with watery sauce, they had.
Entrees, a disappointment, save for my companions',
My farfalle pasta, flavorless, a true frustration.
No seasoning, no salt or pepper, a bland disgrace,
Even my fellow diners, in agreement, didst taste.

On a Sunday eve, at nine o'clock, 'twas seen.
The victuals were fair, not wondrous, I must say,
And the cost, oh dear! It did our purses sway.

Their patience great, with children so rude,
A pleasant sight, in truth, to behold,
Their genuine ways, did my heart enfold.

But, alack, the food, my chief desire,
Didst suffer, beneath a mountain of fire,
Cheese, oh cheese, how thou dost delight,
Yet, when thy bounty doth block my sight,
'Tis too much, methinks, a veritable plight.

My meal, not bad, yet, room for design.
An interesting place, yet, needs refinement,
To draw me back, with haste and intent.""",True,Shakespeare

A dampness that did seep, a funk that did unfold.

Scarce two minutes passed ere our entrees arrived, a speed which doth bespeak a lack of care. All the victuals didst taste of yore and re-frying, and the fried rice was mushy, like a soggy mess. \n\nThe service, alack! was woeful, and nary a soul didst come to check upon us or refresh our draughts.

Of wings that failed to impress, nay, did pale.
I sought a happy hour, with brew and snacks,
But found instead a culinary lack.

The service, fair, yet slow, as if in haste,
Did little to improve the sorry taste.
I ordered wings, but oh, how they fell,
Dry, bland, and lacking in flavorful zest.

And though I asked for grilled, they came not,
But drenched in sauce, which made them naught.
My friend, too, shared this disappointment,
A different sauce, but still no improvement.

The beer selection, paltry, I must say,
No rare or special brews to sway.
The atmosphere, good, yet not enough,
To make up for the food's lack of stuff.

So, will I return? Not likely, friends,
For other options call, and time does end.

And so, I bid it adieu, a part.",True,Shakespeare

Thy humble abode, so tucked away, small, and hard to see.
The interior, dim and cramped, a patio, 'twixt two walls,
A scant selection of wines, alas, no cause for thrall.

The staff, kind and courteous, yet, alack, no charm doth lie,
To draw me back, no sir, naught but a passing sigh.
No praise, nor blame, doth here await, a humdrum place,
Where night doth fall, and morn doth break, without a trace.""",True,Shakespeare

""My bro recommended this joint when he was in Vegas for his buddy's wedding. Said their wings were top-notch. So, I checked it out. It's an Asian fusion spot, kinda Korean-ish. They got private karaoke rooms in the back, a bar, and a chill vibe. But when we went, it was dead. Just us and nobody else. Ordered some fried pork, Korean BBQ, sweet potato fries, shrimp tempura, watermelon soju, and their famous wings. Verdict? Meh. Had better, cheaper grub elsewhere. Their wings were decent, but not worth the hype. Chunky pieces, not like Wingstop or Buffalo Wild Wings. Service was good, but maybe 'cause they didn't have anyone else to attend to.

I, myself, didst fall prey to this ruse, and paid a double tip, ere I didst discover the deceit. Forsooth, the victuals were but mediocre, and the atmosphere, unclean. Two flies didst flit about the hall, a sight most vexing. In truth, Burger King, that humble fast-food chain, doth boast a greater cleanliness than this supposed eatery.

Dry and flavorless, they didst not make my day,
The tortilla, it didst crumble in mine hand,
And the chicken, it didst fall apart, so bland.

But fear not, dear friends, for all was not lost,
The happy hour special, it didst make up the cost,
Buy one drink, get the second free, a bargain indeed,
So gather round, and let us raise a glass, and heed.

But for the main event, seek elsewhere, ye may find,

Yet fear not, dear friends, for on the first day of July, the transition shall be smooth, a change most subtle. And when the dust setteth, behold! A new crown jewel of local cuisine shall shine bright, a gem most precious.""",True,Shakespeare

""Cupcake catastrophe. Bought one from Sprinkles, eager to taste their seasonal Smores flavor with marshmallow icing and graham cracker crumbs. But no, the icing fell off like snow sliding off a roof the moment I took a bite. And the cake turned to crumbs. What a waste of three bucks seventy-eight. Mass-produced cupcakes just don't cut it. And who needs a sign on the door telling us to close it to keep the cupcakes fresh? They just don't stay fresh sitting in that cabinet all day. Time for a new approach to selling cupcakes.

""Thou brought forth bread, toasty and dry,
With crust burnt, as if 'twere kissed by fire.
And yet, the oil that did accompany,
Was goodly spiced, and didst my heart desire.

I didst order then, a dish of sea,
Scallops, thou calledst them, fair and fine.
But lo, the bottom, blackened and charred,
Didst taste of coal, and not of finest wine.

Couscous, a dish of wonder, followed next,
Soft and fluffy, like a cloud in flight.
But then, the Bass, oh how it didst fail,
Full of bones, and naught but trouble and strife.

The waiter, quick with words of guile,
Didst say, what canst thou expect of a small fish?
Bones, they have, in abundance, 'tis their nature.
And thus, I didst accept, with some displeasure.

For sweet dessert, a choice of two, they gave,
Yogurt or fruit, both plain, and naught but grave.
I chose the fruit, and found it wanting,
In flavor, and in zest, and somewhat shaming.

But wait, a surprise, the waiter didst bring,
A baklava, complimentary, a sweet delight.
But alas, 'twas dry and hard as stone,
A disappointment, and a bitter moan.

Oh, how the honey didst not soak within,
A failure, this, a dessert most vile and thin.""",True,Shakespeare

After a concert at Stage AE, my boyfriend and I were looking for a spot to relax our weary feet. We strolled across the street to The Pittsburgh Grille. The joint had a swell decor, with some snazzy sports murals adorning the walls. They had a bunch of flat-screen TVs scattered around the bar and dining area, but it didn't feel too overwhelming since it was right next to the stadium. I was impressed by the cigar bar - it added a touch of class to the place. The atmosphere was plush and comfy.

We only stayed for one drink, though I would've liked to have a few more. Some gal in the bar was hollering obscenities at a hockey game that wasn't even on. She was the only one causing a ruckus, while everyone else was trying to have a good time. The bartender was too busy flirting to notice our empty glasses, even though there were only a handful of folks in the room. I get that tips are important, but not at the expense of decent service for other customers.",True,Hemingway

""Fie upon this place, where smoke doth fill the air,
And bartenders, rude and crude, do ply their trade.
A renovation grand, they boast, with finest fare,
But still, the stench of smoke doth linger, unabated.

I sat with mine own dear love, and friend most true,
And ordered drinks, as custom doth require.
But lo, the bartender, with words most bold,
Didst claim, to gain free drinks, a wager must be told.

Five dollars, I didst drop, in machines three,
To placate this fool, and gain our liberty.
But nay, my love, with scotch she didst desire,
And ten dollars more, the bartender didst require.

Oh, how the shame, the embarrassment, didst sting!
For such a play, so base, so vile, so mean,
I didst drop ten more, and bid the fool,
'Here, take this tip, and let us see what shall ensue.'

But lo, the fool, he lost, and laughed,
And thus, our time, was wasted, and our mirth, was dashed.
A total waste, this place, where smoke doth reign,
And rudeness, doth prevail, with naught but pain.

So, farewell, dear friends, and heed my word,
For here, no pleasure doth reside, nor joy, nor cheer.
But rather, smoke, and fools, who seek to prey,
Upon the innocent, and make their day, a dreary way.""",True,Shakespeare

And curling too, they didst charge, without a care,
An extra fee, that we didst not prepare.
Oh, how they took advantage, of our special day,
And left us poorer, in a most unkind way.

Their tea, it was a pleasant surprise,

To brew my own, from my pot, so wise,
They would not allow, a strange surmise.

My server, a woman of ample girth,
Didst greet me with a beaming mirth,
Her smile, it lit the room, like sun on earth,
Despite her size, her spirit had great worth.

My hunger, it did grow with each passing minute,
But alas, my purse, it could not accommodate,
A muffin, small, yet satisfying, did suffice,
As I sipped tea, and waited for the rain to cease.

Until the storm, it did finally subside,

For though I asked for medium rare, 'twas overcooked, I fear.
My friend, he sent his back, but I, in my folly,
Did not, for I had hoped they'd make it right, you see.

My second beer, it was not as the first,
In taste or appearance, it was quite diverse.

No biggie, didn't need any more drunk folks shootin' things up before they hit the road. Had a sweet outdoor spot for smokin', too. Friendly bartenders, decent prices. Couple rough types, but it was fun. Weirdest part was the dude holdin' down the bathroom. Loud-ass boombox, like he was the DJ or somethin'. Had candies and whatnot, but I just walked on by. Don't reckon I need to tip some dude for handin' me a towel and a breath mint. But hey, check it out. Strobe lit bathroom, Starburst on the way out.

But alas! The menu didst change,

I didst order lobster, stuffed with care,

Hoped I hadn't missed out on anything good. McClendons provided most of the produce, and it looked great - bright beets, deep green leeks, fingerlings, shallots, fresh broccoli. Lot of it was organic, too, with some coming from Willcox. That meant fresher. Five registers open, but there was still a line. Housewives were snatching up veggies quick, so I had to keep my wits about me. Worth it, though. Rest of the market was mostly handmade stuff - soap, blankets, jewelry, yarn crafts, a bread stand.

Found the salmon lox, capers, onion, and made a killer croissant sandwich. No bagels though. Finished off with some fresh fruit and Greek yogurt.

Youthful and vibrant, with enthusiasm they do seek,
To guide patrons in their choices, with prices most fair,
For licensed goods of quality, beyond compare.

For brunch, a meal most curious and quite right.
Now, mark thou well, fair Charlotte, thy brunch scene doth lack,
Compared to other cities, where breakfast doth reign supreme.

Our waitress, friendly and kind, didst attend to our needs,
But oh, how slow her steps, and how long she didst tarry!

I opted for the Banh Cuon, while he went for the Rice dish with BBQ Cornish Hen and Pho Dac Biet. Verdict? Their dishes are flavorful, thanks to an abundance of MSG. So much so that it gave me a headache and left me parched for the entire day.""",True,Hemingway

And a theatre, where one may see a play, or three.

Served my salad in a styrofoam box with plastic utensils, the tiny dressing container was a red flag - they wanted top dollar for a second helping. It was a good salad, chicken on top had some gristle, bacon was decent. Hubby got Stromboli, nothing special but good. He got real silverware and a pizza sheet. Kid got a cheese pizza.

For a 21st birthday of a dear acquaintance,
And found it to be a bit of a mixed case,
Depending on my mood, as it were.

Pros, thou ask? Well, 'tis a fine spot,
For people-watching, with a curious lot,
Of interesting folk, and fair ones too,
The prices, reasonable, and no cover, I do.
The atmosphere, merry and bright,
A good place to amuse young friends, in sight.

But alas, cons there be, my friends,
For 'tis a bit douchey, at times, it tends,
The patrons, they do scrutinize,
And the music, loud, but dance space, scarce, it lies.
The drinks, they take an age to come,
Awaiting, a test of patience, 'twill become.

At this establishment grand, with spaces to eat.
A patio without, and three floors within,
Did offer ample room for revelry to spin.
Their draughts of beer did flow in abundance,
Local brews aplenty, to quench thirst and danse.
Mixed drinks, too, did grace the menu fair,
For those who sought a stiffer drink to pair.
I ordered Ghost Burger, with sweet potato dish,
And found the bacon slices did make my wish.
The burger, spicy, yet not overly bold,
Grilled onions added zest, worth a tale to be told.

Alas, the apple fritter, a disappointment, o'er-fried and overly sweet, a mere morsel didst suffice. The coffee, a sorry brew, akin to that of a common tavern, a slight upon mine taste.

In fair Southern Highlands, we didst seek  
A place with Wi-Fi, our hearts didst speak.  
And lo, we found a spot, named Perk Up,  
Wherein we might find sustenance and cup.  

With haste, we entered, eager to partake  
In their offerings, and our bellies to slake.  
The menu, we didst peruse, with much delight,  
And saw coffees, teas, and pastries in sight.  

A chalkboard, standing tall, didst proclaim  
Breakfast and lunch dishes, in its name.  
I ordered tea, and then, didst decide  
To partake in lunch, my hunger to abide.  

I asked the maiden, fair and bright,  
About sandwiches, and her words didst ignite.  
She spoke of pumpkin muffins, fresh from the oven,  
And quiche, a dish, that didst make me proven.  

I chose the quiche, with fruit, beside,  
But alas, the fruit, didst not abide.  
'Twas old and wilted, a sight to behold,  
But the quiche, didst satisfy, though not of old.  

The maiden, seeing our dismay,  
Didst bring fresh fruit, in a play.

For sixteen dollars, a fair price, no objection.
My wife, she had crepes, baked with care,
For seventeen dollars, a dish beyond compare.

The food, it was good, but the view, it was grand,
Worth every penny, of that, I am fond.
They brought us bread puffs, and pudding too,
A pleasant surprise, for me and my dear, anon.

Alas, I had wished to raise my rating to three stars, but alack, 'twas not meant to be,

Five hundred gold coins, per day, they didst demand, oh me!
A typo, a bug, a mistake, I didst think,

Together on a plate, without a care.

The diamondback roll, oh how grand, with its light and crispy tempura bits, a true delight! The fried cali roll, a close second, and the dragon roll, not bad at all. My dear wife, she did enjoy the spicy shrimp roll, but alas, 'twas not to mine own liking. \n\nIn sooth, we would return anon, during happy hour, to save a few coins, and in truth, the only drawbacks to the place, were the decor and space, a bit lacking, I do confess. But fear not, fair maiden or noble sir, for the sushi, verily, doth rock, and a quiet night for two, most pleasant and fine.""",True,Shakespeare

In this humble inn, where fancy trappings be not found,  
I oft reside, and merriment doth abound.  
The Toby Keith bar, a place of mirth and glee,  
Doth bring me joy, with friends and drinks aplenty.  
A Chinese eatery, with flavors so fine,  
Doth satisfy my hunger, and doth combine  
With the casino's charm, a place of chance and skill,  
Where fortune smiles upon me, and my will doth fulfill.  
The staff, though average, doth their duty well,  
And ne'er have I encountered trouble or hell.

Forsooth, I, a man of little faith in culinary novelties, didst seek guidance from my kin. Once gone, I didst embrace the experience, and, with zeal, didst introduce others to this wondrous feast.

Upon entry, we didst behold rows of cozy booths, each adorned with a round grill, central to the table. 'Twas BBQ-ing within walls, a veritable carnivore's haven! Beef of diverse sorts, fresh shrimp, and pork, in abundance, didst grace the menu.

Few vegetable options there were, in the form of a salad bar, accompanied by prepared Asian dishes, sweet and sour pork, sushi, tempura vegetables, and varied other salads, akin to macaroni, yet, Asian, their names, I knew not.

Our glasses, ever full, didst remain, and the grill, when messy, didst they diligently cleanse.

I walked into the joint around 8:40 on a Monday night. Place was already hopping with three parties deep. I hit the head before settling in, and let me tell you, there was a cockroach the size of a small dog staring back at me while I was taking care of business. Not exactly what I had in mind.

My buddy and I went for the AYCE dinner, $22.95 a pop. Appetizer was some questionable stuff called ""THE SHIT!"" - didn't do much for me, but my friend seemed to enjoy it. We also scored the 2-for-1 Sapporo deal, which was a damn good thing. Two huge bottles, enough to fill four cups. Not bad.

Sashimi salad was decent, loaded with sashimi. Just how I like it. Don't need no rice filling me up at an AYCE joint. I also went for salmon, yellowtail, and albacore sashimi. Fresh, but not the best fish I've ever had. Thin slices, too. Sashimi roll was solid, packed with raw fish and wrapped in cucumber. No rice in sight.

But neither was it the worst, by my troth.
The service, attentive though somewhat astray,
Did bring us water, albeit in disarray.
Three times I asked, and three times they brought,
One glass of water, which we didst share, no doubt.
Their promptness with chips and salsa did make up,
And frequent checks upon us did they keep.
The victuals, decent, yet a mite too hot,
For my taste buds, which do prefer a milder plot.
Yet others seemed not to mind the fiery bite,
So take my words with a pinch of salt, good sir.

A pitcher sufficed for four, as you do know.""",True,Shakespeare

Wherein I savored a pizza of ham and pineapple, a treat for my taste buds,
The crust, devoid of gluten, was quite satisfactory, I must confess,
A rarity, indeed, in this realm of culinary excess.

Their menu, a list of ingredients and toppings, didst reveal,
A limitation of options, a challenge to conceal,
Yet, the service, friendly and prompt, didst make up for the lack,
And left me content, with naught to attack.

Panchos, a buffet of mediocre Mexican food. Enter the colorful building, cafeteria-style. Choose from chili rellenos, enchiladas, tamales, chimichangas, flautas, taquitos, rice, beans, tacos, tostadas. Reasonable price for the amount of food. Non-authentic, greasy, trans fat-filled Mexican food. Flag system for more items. Good service, clean restaurant. Fresh hot sopapillas. Hubby loves the cheese sponges.

For Slices, in Dublin, doth my heart possess.

Whenas I didst behold the menu, unprosed,
For in mine haste, I didst not see it ere,
And thus, I didst feel a mite discomposed.

Moreover, they didst give me but a box,
To hold mine aliment, and naught but that,
No bag to bear it, nor a straw to sip,
Which didst vex mine spirit, and didst make me rip.

Salads, pizza, soft serve, fruit, all did abound,
And waffles, oh so crispy, with sweet syrup profound.

Inside, a throng of people, fair and bright,
But not so packed, as videos and photos might.
At four o'clock, still room to move and sway,

""Fair food, good sir! 'Tis a fine place to break thy fast, indeed. Thou savory crepes, how they doth please mine taste! And coffee drinks, oh how they doth delight!

Yet, there be some things that doth trouble mine eyes:
A hostess, fair maiden, to guide me through the door,
For here, within this hall, no clear path doth lay.
Counter service or table, who doth know? Alas,
I hadst to seek an employee, to learn the way.

And service, spotty 'tis, with two fair maidens serving,
Each table full, our order, didst take some time arriving.
Wait times, long they be, for crepes, twenty-five minutes,
A lengthy span, indeed, for one who hath a plan.

But still, I say, two out of three, not bad, my friend,
For crepes and coffee, they doth make amends.
So, here I shall return, when time doth allow,
To partake in feast, and drink, and merriment, anon!""",True,Shakespeare

""Solid deal in Vegas. $109 per night on weekends, compare that to $400 for a small, cramped room on the Strip.

Lobby's a bit old-school, fake plants could use a dustin'. \n\nSome service hiccups. Ordered grub to go, they said 20 min, took 40. Check-in took forevs, front desk dudes had to stop and answer phones, annoyin'. One dude called me ""cute"", not sure if I should be flattered or creeped out. \n\nShuttle to the Strip was a wild card. Told us they'd take us anywhere, but then said they only do Pick-ups and Dropoffs at Planet Hollywood.

I've wanted to check this place out for years, but always ended up sticking to the Strip. Finally made it out here on my last trip. It's an outdoor party, and the screens are pretty impressive. This is old Vegas, where everything is dirt cheap - drinks, food, you name it. But, let me tell you, it's pretty damn ghetto here, especially at night. Saw a lot of street people, and some suspicious-looking bags. But hey, that's part of the charm, right? You can just walk around with an open container, no worries.

I went for a Sin City Amber, while the missus opted for a Sam Adams Cherry Wheat. They had a solid selection, with names like Sierra Nevada, Alaska, Abita, Rogue, and Stone. Better than most bars in Vegas, that's for sure. \n\nIt was a Friday night, and NYNY was jumping, but this place wasn't too packed. The bartenders were hustling, though.

Moreover, the rolls and butter served forth do seem a genuine relic of yore, soft, warm, and most delectable. Mayhap, perchance, I do confess a certain fondness for iced tea, and, lo, how pleased I am by its presentation here! A mighty goblet, fresh mint, a sideline of simple syrup for sweetening, and an iced tea spoon, all these doth combine to elevate mine enjoyment.

Room's big, like a little studio, with a full fridge, stove, microwave, and it's clean as a whistle. But, couple things that ain't so hot. First, the room feels stuffy when you walk in, like someone's been cooking up a storm. Kick up the AC, but then it's too cold. Can't seem to find that sweet spot. Second, pillows are flat, like sleeping on a pancake. Two pillows don't help much neither. Third, stairs are steep, no elevator in sight.

A delicate balance, that not all may enjoy,  
For some, it may be too sour, and thus destroy.  

Roasted rice beef, a new concept, indeed,  
With cabbage, Thai basil, and spices, it did proceed.  
Crushed rice, roasted, and scattered on the beef,

But fear not, dear friends! For the steak, verily, didst shine resplendent! With mine miniature fork, I didst partake of a most tender, flavorful steak, accompanied by a trio of delectable sides - corn, spinach, and mashed potatoes. (Aye, I didst order three sides, forsooth!)

In conclusion, gentle readers, should thou find thyself in the vicinity of Del Frisco's, do give the steak a try. 'Tis worth the price of admission, I doth assure thee!""",True,Shakespeare

""Walkin' the Strip, thinkin' which club to hit up. Bank rep outside Bellagio's handin' out ""free"" wristbands, so I gave it a shot. Turns out it ain't free, still gotta pay $20 (reduced price, I was told), but you get a free drink. Line wasn't too long, so I was in within five minutes. Used coat-check, but they charged $5 (better pay than losin' it). Went straight to the bar, presented my free-drink coupon, bartender told me my options, I picked one. It was an okay drink. Enjoyed it while watchin' the gogo dancers and other girls dancin' and partyin'. GoGo dancers were okay, beautiful, but they barely showed some good moves. Friendly, though, and people were gettin' pics with 'em. Girls in the club were beautiful. Didn't get a chance to dance, but enjoyed the music - mix dance music, speakers were just loud enough.

The first, for domestic flights, doth boast
Of covered parking, a convenience, no doubt.

Cleanliness, a virtue, lacking, I do fear,
In terminal one, a tidy state, not always near.

And signs, clear as day, on LCD screens, are found.

Ah, but alas, fair reader, avoid, I pray,
Scheduling flights on Fridays, weekends, nay!
For crowds, aplenty, doth fill the space,
A chaotic scene, most vexing, in this place.

And thus, we come to terminal two,
For international flights, and those to Hawaii, anew.
Signs, easy to miss, a problem, I do declare,
A larger sign, a solution, they should prepare.

Parking, uncovered, rates the same, I find,
A pity, for travelers, with luggage, in mind.
Cleanliness, a word, not often heard,
In terminal two, a state, unpleasant, I have feared.

Easy to find, your belongings, a relief, for thee.

The green pole dancer, she was a wondrous sight,
Her movements fluid and graceful, a true delight.
And the chosen gentleman, oh so awkward and cute,
He brought a chuckle to my lips, I must admit.

Upon entering, I was greeted by the delightful aroma of spices. The atmosphere within was cozy, yet intimate, with tables arranged closely together. As a larger person, I found the seating to be somewhat cramped, but not overly so. The staff were friendly and attentive, and the food was fresh, tasty, and served promptly. The menu offered a variety of dishes, some with a hint of Indian flavor, though I cannot truly judge its authenticity, never having been to India. My friend's dish and the desserts were particularly enjoyable, the latter being a house-made almond and cashew ice cream, flavored with cardamom, which was truly exceptional. Unfortunately, I cannot comment on the restrooms, as I did not use them. Payment by card is possible, but I am unsure if they accept all types of cards.""",True,Shakespeare

We tried the luncheon special, a dish most fair,
An open-faced green chili meatloaf sandwich, with care
Piled high upon the plate, a feast for mine eyes,
With mashed potatoes o'er the bread, and a slaw most prize.

Alas, the potatoes, they were o'er-mixed, I fear,
And thus, their texture, gummy, and not so dear.
But still, the meatloaf, tasty, and the slaw, a delight,
Did make the dish worth trying, in my sight.

The grilled salmon salad, a dish most fine,
With chive risotto cake, a flavor divine.
Yet, mayhap 'twas the citrus dressing, that did clash,
And made the risotto cake, a taste not so dash.

The service, good, and naught to complain,
A pleasant experience, save the gummy grain.

For other ventures call, and time doth waste.""",True,Shakespeare

For though the service was slow, and we didst wait some thirty minutes for our meals, the burgers, when they finally arrived, were lacking in size, I do declare. Nay, they were nigh on the same dimensions as those peddled by that wretched Mickey Dee's. And for a sum of nine dollars, I didst receive but a mere three-dollar burger. Fie upon it! I fear I shall have to reconsider my patronage of this place, forsooth. For though the folk be pleasant, the victuals, on this occasion, didst leave much to be desired.""",True,Shakespeare

This humble hotel, with shuttle service, didst cruise.

MGM, Mandalay, and airport, didst they take,
And though 'twas not the best, our stay didst make.
An OK rating, we didst give, I pray,
For other hotels, along the strip, didst sway.

A word of wisdom, let this be a sign,
To heed the call, when thy cab doth arrive.
Be prompt, my friends, and tarry not,
Lest thou be left, with naught but regret.

So heed this counsel, and with haste,
Make thy way, to thy appointed place.

Punctuality, doth reign supreme.""",True,Shakespeare

After a show, KA, which did not enthrall,

But linguiu with king crab, and leeks so fine,  
In lemon butter sauce, doth make my heart entwine.  
My spouse, a traditionalist, doth swear by spaghetti,  
And Kobe meatballs, that doth make his eyes light up so brightly.

Cantonese style, all dishes didst shine anew.
Complimentary soup and dessert, a sweet delight,
Our hunger sated, with nary a single bite.

The crowd, it swelled, as evening drew near,
We waited patiently, without a speck of fear.
Yet, verily, the wait, it was worth the while,

The creaky hinges and the shaking faucet,
Cried out for mending, with a quick dispatch.

Of stay at Golden Nugget, stories told.

In Downtown Vegas, our hearts did moan.

In Palazzo, luxury we did ignore.
Despite the heat, and lost riches too,
Our spirits high, our joy did break through.

To make our stay, a pleasant jive.

A perfect blend, of class and brashy.

Our poolside fun, without compare.

A good value, her relaxation took.

With friends, she's keen, to return once more,
But player's card, a mystery to explore.

The chicken, cooked to perfection, a medley of fresh crunchy veggies, all cloaked in a well-balanced sauce, a veritable feast for the senses!

We celebrated our first year of wedlock's home.
At Margaritaville, within Flamingo's walls,
We savored tacos, and sipped flavored margaritas that enthralled.

Tons of lights, a veritable feast for the eyes,
Ziplining through the night, with nary a care,

Lights, a beacon in the night, doth guide us on our way.

A humble sandwich shop, once named Brown Bag, now Arizona's gold.
A quarter mile from our workplace, 'twas a frequent haunt,
But since its transformation, my visits have augment.

Their sandwiches, oh so delectable, a feast for the taste,
Soft bread, like downy pillows, doth embrace the fillings with haste.
Generous portions, aplenty, doth satisfy my hunger's pang,
And sides, a delightful complement, doth make my meal most grand.
Desserts, a sweet allurement, doth tempt mine eyes,
But alack! I rarely partake, forsooth, I do not tell lies.

A daily special, a wise choice, doth never let me down.
Follow them on Facebook, a secret, 'twill reveal,
A two-dollar sandwich, a steal! A bargain, beyond belief, ye may feel.

Eastward, across the street, from QT's corner throne,
Lies this eatery, unassuming, yet a gem, unknown.

For busy souls, a blessing, in disguise, I do profess.

At Arizona Sandwich Company, a culinary delight, so neat.""",True,Shakespeare

With steak, rice, broccoli, and spicy sauce, 'twas a sight to see.
A simple feast, yet full of flavor's delight,
The sauce, on the side, didst bring forth a wondrous bite.

Their sushi, bowls, and salads, numerous and grand,
Priced fairly, for the portions they command.
The restaurant's decor, modern and sleek,
The staff, fast, friendly, and most courteous, didst seek.

My husband, a Smoked Turkey Ciabatta, with gouda, bacon, tomato, and roasted red pepper aioli, didst choose. My salad, I didst love, but my husband's sandwich, not fully satisfied, he was.

In sooth, who could have thought that Las Vegas, famed for its vice,
Would e'er be known for sandwiches of such nice?
I, for one, now believe it, after tasting the Earl's delight,
At Planet Hollywood, where gambling and feasting unite.

I ordered the Full Montagu, a roast beef of renown,
With turkey, Swiss, and cheddar, lettuce, and Earl's crown.
I omitted the tomatoes, lest they o'erwhelm the dish,
For too much juice can make a sandwich lose its charm and wish.

And thus, I savored the Earl's grey lemonade, a refreshing treat,
Not overly sweet, a perfect complement to the feast.
But 'twas the Earl's artisan bread that stole the show,
A sturdy vessel for the meat and toppings, neither too slow.

From buffets and their excess, choose Earl of Sandwich, a true delight.",True,Shakespeare

$20 each, a sum most unfortunate, I pray.

For ladies were free, and gents didst pay $40,

The line for guest list, it did move with great speed,
Like a swift river, flowing forth with great ease.

The venue itself, most spacious and grand,
Didst remind me of Marquee and XS, so bland.
A pool outside, a dance floor within,
Bars on opposite sides, a sight most win.

But the true delight, my friends, doth lie,
In the lights, the LED screens, the LED disco ball,
The lasers, oh, the lasers, how they didst shine,
A sight most wondrous, truly divine.
Great DJs also, didst play the tunes,
A night most memorable, with naught but boons.

A haven of tranquility did beckon me.
The fourth star, for atmosphere and grace,
Did shine bright, in this modern palace of delight.

Within its walls, a pretty bar did lie,
Adorned with charm, and spirits did fly.
I savored one of their special brews,
A Hot Mule, its taste did my senses woo.

No hint of a buzz, yet sipping slow,
Did grant me respite from the world's mad flow.
Few others joined me in this peaceful space,
Amidst the week, when crowds did not embrace.

When weekends dawn, and nights are young.

The bar, it seemed, had room for us to wait,
And thus we ordered drinks, and a tasty treat,
Pesto fries, they were, and oh, how grand,
They whetted my appetite, for the pesto pasta in hand.
I ordered it, and glad I am that I did,
For the creamy sauce, it did my taste buds stir,
My husband, he had fish and chips, a fine dish,
With tartar sauce, that left him in pure bliss.

Olive breads, alas, I couldst not partake of all theoups.

For lunch, a meal most fine and fair.
All these, they didst impress,
Pre-game bread, a taste so rare.
Bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin, a treat,
Lobster, my wife's, a delicacy so sweet.
Sweet corn and polenta, a perfect pair,
Bacon and Yukon gold, a gratin so fair and rare.
Forbidden rice, a name so bold,
A dish that doth intrigue and unfold.
Wine list, with waiter so wise,
A treasure trove of flavors, a surprise.
Mashed potatoes, a humble delight,
A culinary journey, through the night.

Give it a try, this place so rare,
A hidden gem, beyond compare.
Elements at the Sanctuary, a taste so true,
A secret spot, for me and you.""",True,Shakespeare

Exchange or store credit, that is all,

From teens to thirty, all may gain.
Trendy garb, and some not so fair,

The Salmon Lover, in sooth, didst steal the show. A must-try, indeed!

The bartenders, kind they were, I must confess,
And young Isaac, a busser of great finesse.
He solved our problem, and with haste did seat us,
A true hero, in a night most dismal and bleak.

Two hours had passed, a single drink we had,
And our mood, it was quite understandably bad.
But still, we did not show our displeasure,
For rudeness begets rudeness, and that's no treasure.

Now, a one-star review, I would have given,
But Issac and Mark, they did our spirits lift.

With grapefruit basil martini leading the way.
Mojitos and margaritas didst follow suit,

Fish tacos, too, didst please my husband's taste,

I scored a sweet pad within walking distance to everything that matters, including the best ski and ride shop in the desert. Ski Pro's got a killer selection, better than the joints in Colorado. They're all about movin' product, too - snagged a sick ski suit for my kiddo, marked down from $175 to $59. It's still peak season, y'all! They've got a solid selection of skis and boards, but that's a rare purchase for me. Let's just say they've got everything I need for my winter fun. Oh, and they're practically in the Biltmore's backyard.

The help's about average, you know? Not super attentive, but not rude either. They're just chillin', doing their thing. Most likely from middle-class families who can afford to hit the slopes. Can't expect them to be over-the-top friendly, that's just not the vibe here. At least they ain't stoned, paranoid, or semi-hostile like those Colorado ski bums.

With six stars, I rate the atmosphere divine,
A place to dine, or drink, or simply decline.

The rest, alack, doth not much matter, I fear,
For though 'twill not poison thee, nor leave thee in tears,
'Tis naught but edible, a meal to fill,
And for the drunkard, a decent alternative still.

So, prithee, make thy way to this place,
Even if 'tis out of thy way, 'twill show thy face.
'Tis worth the journey, I do swear,
For in this diner, thou shalt find cheer.""",True,Shakespeare

Now transformed, a beauty to behold, a fit
For royalty, with restaurant grand.

But Rhodes Ranch, a sister course, did come,
And saved the day, with expert hand.

A bargain, for the golfer, a true treasure.

To test thy skill, and challenge thee.

Moist, indeed, the cupcakes didst prove, with frosting rich and plentiful. Thou chocolate cake, a tad bitter, yet still, a fair delight. Drinks, none couldst be had, a sorrow, on days of heat.

A good hour and a half, to be exact, 'twas well nigh drained.
But lo, the folk who worked there didst strive with all their might,
To mend my wheel with speed, and bring back light to my night.
And when I asked for new tires, the man at the counter didst say,
That a lesser price would buy a better tire, in a manner of play.
So I didst take his word, and saved a pretty penny,
For which I am most grateful, and doth thank him heartily.""",True,Shakespeare

But oh, so dry, it made my jaws to ache.
Yet still, my margarita and guacamole,

I would not recommend this dish,

Pouring wines, suggesting dishes, all in line.
Traditional, this place, in food, drink, and mood,

Balance of flavors, sweet and bitter, a delight.

The classic potato and sauerkraut, a dish most nigh.
And thus, we ordered them, with a Reuben-like sandwich too,
A feast fit for a king, or so I did pursue.

The pierogies, they were good, a delight to the taste,
But alas, not quite as wondrous as my hopes had placed.
The sandwich, a marvel, with bread of finest grain,
And meat of highest quality, a true culinary gain.

Yet still, I must confess, a morsel of disappointment did creep,
For though the pierogies were good, they did not reach the peak.
But fear not, dear friends, for I do see the light,
In this place, a gem, where food is made with love and might.
The owner, a man of vision, doth strive for excellence,
With ingredients of highest worth, and corned beef of his own presence.
So let us raise a glass, to this place of gastronomic bliss,
Where flavors dance upon the tongue, and joy doth take its sweet kiss.""",True,Shakespeare

A strange location, yet, doth draw a crowd.
A group of youths, with vigor doth descend,

In search of fish, and ale, and merriment, perchance.

And divers beers, that didst rotate, like a dancer in a trance.

The cod and walleye, both didst taste so fine,
Thinly battered, and fried to a golden sheen, divine.
Waffle and brew fries, didst complement the dish,
With flavors that didst delight, and nary a wish.

And though a thousand calories, didst I consume,
I felt not sickly, nor didst my stomach protest.
Thanks to Dexter's, for helping me maintain,
My Catholic ways, and a light heart, didst obtain.

Now, of their wares, I must confess, I doth adore
The Body Butter products, in mango, coconut, shea butter, and more,
The gifts, a no-brainer, and the foot kits, great for giving,
But also, I do use them myself, and find them most living.

This store, it doth reside, within the Miracle Mile Shops,
At Planet Hollywood, a casino, and hotel, of sorts,
But alas, of late, I have not found much, during sales,
Perhaps, 'tis due to tourists, but I shall not bemoan, for I shall still,
Check in, and see, what wonders they may hold, for me.""",True,Shakespeare

But, alas, I do suspect their 'bucko nuggets' be not of chicken, but of some other flesh, perhaps of pig or cow. Yet, who can say?

A south rim tour we booked, my friends,
And off we went, our journey's end.
The bus, it took us to the Miracle Mile,
Where we did dine on danish and coffee, smile.

But slow we started, organization took its time,
As we prepared for the day's design.
Near the dam, a rest stop we did find,
In Kingman, Arizona, a place to unwind.

A decent lunch we had, in Williams, too,
Before we set off for the south rim anew.
The drive, it was quite long, I must confess,
But Tommy, our driver, he did his best.

Two stops we made, at the canyon's edge,
For about an hour, we did take our time to pledge.
Then back we went, with one more stop in Kingman,
And home we came, around nine thirty, evening's blessing.

So prepare ye well, my friends, for the south rim's length,
And heed my words, for your own safety and health.",True,Shakespeare

The chambers, by my troth, didst dazzle mine eyes with their beauty, bedecked in hues of ivory, gold, and navy blue, soothing to behold. The bed, aye, didst cradle mine frame with softness and comfort, and all didst seem most clean and tidy. The staff, in their courtesy, didst greet me warmly at my arrival and departure.

Alas, the walls, they didst prove most thin, and we didst hear the raucous cries of revelers in the hallway, deep into the night.

But lo, the nuptials, they didst proceed with grace and joy. A servant, marking a friend's mishap with spilled water, didst swiftly cleanse the table ere we couldst request his aid. Most of the service, indeed, didst excel, save for a brief confusion with the entrees, which, upon our request, didst swiftly find its correction.",True,Shakespeare

No crowds, no fray, didst make our stay most sweet,
And parking, easy to find, didst greet.

The room, updated, modern, and quite neat,
Didst boast new bed, new furniture, a treat.
A bathroom, cute and clean, didst delight,
With stand-up shower, huge head, most bright.

The menu, full of delectable choices, didst present a challenge, for one dish didst bear a name similar to another, and thus, a mistake didst occur. My sister, though she didst enjoy her selection, didst not receive the dish she hadst intended. A minor quibble, indeed, yet one worth mentioning.

My wife, however, didst savor her affogato with great relish, and I must say, I didst find amusement in the clever manner in which they teach Italian to those who dare to venture forth and partake of the facilities. 'Tis a unique experience, to be sure!

This gambling den, as expected, draws in the elderly crowd. Slots and video poker galore, and a bingo hall that'll make your head spin. Met my folks there on a Wednesday, and I was one of a handful of youngbloods in the 21-30 age group. Dealers, though, were mostly spry young things. Nice perk: the senior crowd brings the blackjack minimum down to a measly $2. Good place to hone your 21 skills without breaking the bank. Settled in at a $5 table and walked away with some extra cash. Didn't spot a craps table, and the roulette wheel was automated (kind of strange).

""A modern tavern, yet cozy and bright,
With elevated British grub, a wondrous sight.
The bar, a marvel, with taps of finest brew,
And a backdrop, like iconic British booths, anew.

With friends, I visited this merry place,
And savored each dish, with joy and grace.
Deviled eggs, soup, shepherd's pie, sausages galore,
Fish and chips, burgers, squash soup, and more.

All dishes, delicious, cooked to perfection,
Leaving us in awe, with no room for correction.
Fish and chips, shepherd's pie, standouts indeed,
But all dishes, superb, our taste buds did heed.

Affordable, too, with the Caesar's card,
Our waitress, kind, and her service, not hard.
We'll return, without a doubt, to this jolly place,
For another round of culinary delight, with haste.""",True,Shakespeare

""Hark! What news is this? A sushi place most fair,
Where one may dine on endless delights, without compare.
I, a loyal patron, come hither oft,
For their seared tuna dish, a true culinary thought.
A local's secret, too, they hold within their walls,
A stamp card, granting freebies, for those who enthrall.
Nine purchases made, a tenth dish shall be thine,
A gift from the gods, a treasure truly divine.""",True,Shakespeare

""With mine own parents, I didst visit this eve,
And found them in a state of indecision, quite bereft.
We wandered forth, in search of sustenance and cheer,

The victuals there, didst please mine parents mightily,
And we didst dine, in merriment and glee, most rightly.""",True,Shakespeare

""Pizza joints come in two varieties: those that serve the real deal, like Brooklyn V's, and those that peddle a pale imitation, à la Pizza Hut or Domino's. After sampling their garlic knots, which were top-notch, I ordered the 14-inch white pizza with pepperoni, onion, and garlic. The crust was light and crispy, a definite plus, but the pie itself was a bit soggy. Still, it was enjoyable, and the portion size was generous, leaving us with leftovers. Pricing-wise, Brooklyn V's falls somewhere in between the genuine article and the pretenders, so it's up to personal preference and priorities.""",True,Hemingway

""Hark! A kindly receptionist didst greet me with a smile,
And gave me a chamber on the first floor, in style.
But lo, I wished to be on higher ground,
On the second or third floor, with a better sound.
The receptionist didst tell me, with a gentle grace,
That naught but tomorrow couldst grant me that place.
Good service, indeed, didst they provide,
And so, I shall observe and update, as I reside.""",True,Shakespeare

""Sandy Bells, a joint where folk music reigns supreme. No regard for capacity, just cram 'em in, like sardines in a tin. Impromptu ceilidh, always on the cards. Edinburgh institution, through and through. Acts, incredible. Keep an eye out for folkies at the Liquid Rooms, after party's here, no doubt. \n\nBut, alas, the smoking ban's taken its toll. Thick fog of smoke, gone. Sweaty stench, dominant. My advice? Down a few pints, ale, too. Your sniffer'll thank you.""",True,Hemingway

""Methinks 'tis a wondrous place for swift repast,
Where first I came upon a Groupon's quest.
A year hath passed, yet ne'er didst I return,
For reasons such as these, my heart doth yearn.

A bargain-hunter, I, with zeal and cheer,
Do seek out deals, discounts, and sales so dear.
But alas, at Zaba's, none couldst be found,
And thus, my visits there were few and far between, profound.

Their prices, verily, do seem quite steep,
For fast food fare, a truth most people keep.
Seventeen crowns, I spent on salad and burrito vast,
Yet portion sizes, generous, our hunger did surpass.

The shrimp, freshly cooked, our taste buds did delight,
Whilst chicken, somewhat old and dry, did not excite.
But lo, the rest, a cornucopia of health and glee,
Sweet potatoes, beans, fajita mix, and rice, we did enjoy with glee.

In conclusion, full and content, I did depart,
Wishing only, that some coupons they would impart.
Fresh Mex, feel-good, a meal most satisfying,
Leaving thee, dear reader, with naught but joy and gladness.""",True,Shakespeare

""O, what a wondrous brunch place doth this be!
Always full, yet seats are found in ten,
And food doth come in twenty, by my reckoning.

Scones, oh how delicious they doth taste!
Savory ones, my heart doth sing with joy!
Quiches too, they doth please mine appetite.

Pastries, if thou desirest them, doth wait,
But walk a short ways down, and find thee
The pastry shop, where sweet treats doth abound.

Pigs in a blanket, oh how novel an idea!
Sausage in pancakes, who hath not tried it?
Mac and cheese pancakes, with andouille sausage,
A dish most wondrous, and worth mine usage.

Speedy eggwich, for those who crave simplicity,
A humble dish, yet full of flavor, I do declare.
Grits with sausage patties, my newfound delight,
Leaves me fulfilled, with leftovers to boot, in faith!""",True,Shakespeare

""Hark! In days of yore, 'twas Lucky's, then Albertson's,
This Greenland Supermarket, where I didst roam.
But now, alas! 'Tis changed, like all around,
On Spring Mountain, betwixt Rainbow and Decatur, profound.
Chinatown doth flourish, a wondrous sight,
A food court within, doth pique my appetite.

A Hawaiian stall, with sweet spam musubi,
Sushi, too, doth tempt, with nigiri so cheap.
Korean fare, I tried, with kim-chee and meat,
But found the aftertaste, a curious treat.

A coffee shop, with Boba, doth quench my thirst,
Though out of stock, a pity, I didst not desist.
In conclusion, a fair experience, indeed,
I shall return, though variety doth decrease.
A Vietnamese booth, or more, wouldst be grand,
To make this food court, a true Shangri-la land.""",True,Shakespeare

With fare that doth delight, and prices so keen.
Their hummus, though not to my taste, doth flow,
For they must cater to the masses, I do know.
But oh, their babajanoush, how rich and divine,
Made with love and care, a true work of art, fine.
The pita, warm and soft, doth fill the belly,
And tabulli, a mix of flavors, doth dance merrily.
In balance, all doth seem, a feast for the eyes,
A pleasant repast, at this cozy surprise.""",True,Shakespeare

Yesterday, went in with a buddy. Service was alright, server checked on us only when necessary. Ordered beef tips, enjoyed 'em, but needed a to-go box. Packed up leftovers, left 'em on the table, and headed to the ladies' room with my friend. Came out, and our table was cleared, including my to-go box. Found the waiter, who apologized and offered a new, smaller portion. Didn't have time to wait, so passed. Annoyed they didn't wait a sec to ensure we were gone before tossing my stuff.

And heed my words of wisdom, proffered with haste.
A place of wonder, a cinema of renown,
Where films are shown, and tales are told with grace.

The prices, fair and reasonable, doth please,
$10 for adults, on Friday and Saturday eves.
For matinees, the cost doth drop, to $8,
A bargain, indeed, for those who do arrive early.

But wait, there's more! A special deal, for thee,
Who doth desire to save a few coins, with glee.

""A wondrous abode, with space enough to spare,
The staff, kind-hearted, did our needs prepare.
We chose the North tower, as wise men do,
For updates fresh, our stay to make anew.

""Hark! To rate Stoney's N40 aright,
Two sides must thou consider in sight,
The saloon, where food doth reign supreme,
And club, where dance and music do gleam.
A smoke-free place, a virtue indeed,
That sets it apart, a crown to proceed.
I've dined at many a place, my friend,
Famous Dave's, Mesquite BBQ, Dickie's, Lucile's,
But Stoney's, with its service so fine,
Doth rival them all, a gem divine.
Their food, a feast for the taste buds,
Substitutions, no problem, they'll budge.
Weekly, we dine there, a treat for us,
For those who don't enjoy, alas, what fuss!
But, alack! The club, a different tale,
Lacks the luster, the charm that doth prevail.
Revolver, nearby, doth steal the show,
With Stoney's, a mix of genres, they do know.
Country hats, flat bills, young and old,
A diverse crowd, but not as bold.
Gaming machines, a solution, perchance,
To draw in more, a better chance.
Then, mayhap, they shall turn anew,
Back to their roots, a country bar, anew.""",True,Shakespeare

""A place with too much variety on the menu raises suspicions. Can they truly excel at everything? Doubts lingered as we ordered alfredo pasta, burgers, carne asada burritos, and cheesecake.

Burgers, cooked to order, impressed. Rare to well-done, they nailed it. Medium-rare for me, medium for my companion. Frozen beef patty, perhaps, but flavorful toppings made up for it. Fried egg and sautéed mushrooms elevated the burger.

Crisp veggies, soft bun, and salty fries pleased. Ketchup complemented them nicely. Dill pickle, a delightful surprise. Fruit punch, however, lacked oomph. Watered down, it seemed. Recommendation: drinks without ice, add when ready.

Iced coffee, standard, yet satisfying. Quick delivery, a plus.

In conclusion, extensive menu, average burger and fries. Delivery, fairly priced and prompt.""",True,Hemingway

Methinks, the folk here be friendly and welcoming, eager to share their revelry with strangers. I chanced upon this place, seeking diversion on a Friday eve, and found myself swept up in the mirth.

""The interior, though compact, did teem with people, making it quite warm within. Yet, the heat did not deter my enjoyment, for I found solace at the bar, whereupon I requested a surprise concoction from the bartender.

Gives Swingers' vibe, with drinks of island renown.
Mix of cocktails, with names so bright,
And games of chance, for those who dare to fight.
Funky jukebox plays tunes of old,

Overall: mark my words, a steak most prime,  
If premium fare be thy desire, 'tis thine.""",True,Shakespeare

All-you-can-eat, for a fixed price, a veritable surprise.
I, a man of discerning taste, with an appetite quite vast,
Do justice to the menu, and leave not a single morsel past.

The catch of the day, be it salmon or tuna,
Fresh as the morning dew, and just as succulent,
Tempura, a delicacy, fried to a golden hue,
Satisfies my craving, and leaves me feeling anew.

Uni and amaebi, a treat for the refined,
One dish per person, a rule to keep in mind.
Toro, a rare delight, when in season,
A flavor so exquisite, worth every single reason.

The staff were pleasant, and the surroundings didst grace,
A right merry eve we didst have, save for one small thing,
The barbecued shrimp, alas! didst not please our king.

Four medium shrimp, overcooked and hard as stone,
Didst lie upon the plate, a sorry sight alone,
The rice, too, didst lack the flavor that doth bring,
A proper sauce, to make the dish worth a king's ring.

Oh, how I wish they had used large shrimp, in shell,
And rethought the sauce, to make it more swell,
For garlic, that most noble of herbs, doth make,
A dish most fine, and worthy of a king's partake.""",True,Shakespeare

A worthy dish, with flavors rich and sweet.
And then, the goo ball, oh how it teased,
A treat so fine, it left me speechless, neat.
I ate it slow, savoring each delight,
My six-year-old, curious, asked for a bite.
But nay, my dear, this treat is mine alone,
For in its sweetness, I found my heart's home.

Methinks I do enjoy Lai Lai's fare,
But my fair lady doth not share my cheer.
She saith the spice doth lack, e'en with red oil,
And finds it tame, alack, and void of zest.

I, myself, do not desire fiery food,
And thus, their sweet sauce doth please mine taste.
Their noodles be the best I've had, in truth,
In all the Mongolian places of the land.

The worker lady, kind and fair, doth seem
To know me well, and her warmth doth beam.
Yet, pineapple, huge and hard to find,
Doth make my meal less pleasant, I do mind.

Moreover, prices be a bit steep,
And leftovers, they doth not allow to keep.
To-go orders, by weight, they doth charge,
A policy strange, and worth a sigh or two.",True,Shakespeare

""Classy joint, top-notch grub and digs. But they'll bleed you dry, no doubt. Standard rooms, a hair better than average Vegas fare, but not worth the extra scratch if you're lookin' to cram a bunch of folks in. Suites at a lesser hotel, that's the way to go. Nice place, though. If you've got money to burn, you'll find plenty of ways to light it up.""",True,Hemingway

Had the wasabi salad, damn good. Then tried the beef and onion dumplings, shrimp, pork, and coriander ones too. Best I've had, no doubt. Wait wasn't long, just five to ten minutes.

In fair Orleans Hotel, where value doth abound,
Amidst the glittering lights of Las Vegas' ground,
It stands, a beacon, praised by all who've found,
A haven, fit for kings, with luxury unbound.

The rooms, spacious and comfortable, invite,
To rest and relax, after a long night's delight,
The pool, a haven, with sun and shade in sight,
A place to cool, and let the world glide by.

Good bars and eateries, within its walls,
Do serve the finest fare, to please all palls,
And new, a TGI Fridays, doth draw the crowd,
A popular spot, where laughter doth resound.

Bowling and cinema, on the upper floors,
Do offer entertainment, and endless roars,
Of fun and joy, to pass the time away,
As night doth fall, and dawn doth break the day.

A slot tournament, yearly, doth draw me near,
With rooms and entry, for a mere three hundred cheer,
Though yet, alas! My luck doth fail,
Yet still, I dream, and hope doth never pale.

A drawback, some may say, its location doth,
Off-strip, on Tropicana Avenue, a path not trod,
Yet, Seamless Gentlemen's club, doth lie across the way,
A haven, for those who seek a different play.

So, if thou seeks a place, of value and delight,
In Orleans Hotel, thy search doth end in sight,

With green sauce, rice, and beans, in a most wondrous guise.
Their containers, they do keep the food hot for hours,
A feat most marvelous, and worth many a praise.

Alas, their menu doth contain but few choices,
Yet, methinks 'tis worth the price, forsooth, their voices.

The frosting, oh! It was a marvel, indeed,
Like fudge from Disney World, or Rocky's creed,
So rich, so smooth, so utterly divine,
It did surpass, all frostings that are mine.

And though, at times, I do suspect,
That such a meal, was but a dream,

With flavors, that doth conjure June.

With its divine taste, that doth excite,
My taste buds, and doth leave me in a trance,
As if in love, with a sweet, sweet dance.

And the salmon rolls, oh, how they doth please,
With flavors, that doth tease,
My senses, and doth bring me cheer,
As if in spring, with flowers near.

But alas, their non-salmon sushi, doth lack,
The flavor, that doth make my spirit attack,
And the seaweed salad, doth seem a bit bland,
As if in winter, with no land.

Yet fear not, for they have fried delights,
That doth make up, for the lack of might,
Soft shell crab, tempura, and more,
To satisfy, and leave me in awe.

And lo, they have a deal most fair,
All you can eat, for just twenty there,
And happy hour, doth come most often,

We disembarked and boarded anew thrice, and never once did we encounter a ticket-checker, even when the cart was filled to capacity. \n\nBy my troth, I do eagerly anticipate the day when this marvelous contraption shall run till the wee hours of the morn, that we may explore further the delights of downtown and central Phoenix, with nary a care in the world.""",True,Shakespeare

And few folk there, did make our stay most pleasant.
We sat, and menus we did receive,
And time to ponder, our choices to conceive.

Quails, a dish most fine, we did decide,
To start with, ere we made our main course choice.
And lo, the staff did bring us samples,
To taste and savor, ere we made our voice.

My friend, a question didst pose,
Concerning spicy dishes, and which to choose.

Lemongrass chili chicken, forsooth, a dish most great.

Our food, it came, and alas,
Our appetizer, forgot, it was.

Was worth the trip alone, its flavor so pure and bright.
The French toast, original and nothing less,
Satisfied my hunger, with no need for excess.

But oh, the banana nut pancakes, how divine!
With prosciutto, seared to perfection, a perfect pairing of sweet and fine.
I savored each bite, and wished for more,
A culinary delight, beyond compare.

If you want to be on TV, bring something worth showing and be charming, or get there early to be an extra if you're lucky. They had some touristy stuff, but I didn't care, I got a Pawn Stars t-shirt and I'm proud of it.

A wondrous afternoon didst we spend, my dear,
At yonder Phoenix zoo, in sunshine bright.
The crowd, not overmuch, didst make it sweet,
And beasts, though sleeping, didst lie in sight.

Their slumber, perchance, didst they forget,
Or else, they didst not heed the call of fate.
But still, 'twas pleasant, in the open air,
To bask in autumn's mild and gentle glow.

Alas, the extras didst cost a pretty penny,
Yet still, 'twas worth it, for the joy we had.
For in that place, with nature all around,
Didst we find peace, and a merry heart.",True,Shakespeare

""A most excellent evening, I must say,
At this fine eatery, they did display
Attentive service, on a Saturday night,

One star ding, for that small flaw, I must confess,
But overall, a solid choice for a special night, I do profess.""",True,Shakespeare

A must-see for any traveler with a sweet tooth, for there be much to behold, not merely to purchase, but to marvel at and revel in the sheer delight.

On Saturdays and Sundays, the afternoons be loud,
As the tunes doth fill the air, a joyous crowd.
A place where thou mayst bring thy mother for a meal,
Or thy lover, for a night most festive and real.

Their appetizers be diverse, a twist on American fare,
The animal fries, a delight, beyond compare.
Nachos and sliders, too, doth please my taste,
All the food, a joy, a culinary embrace.

In price, 'tis mid-range, compared to others grand,
Herb Box and Bandera, not so bland.

A Christmas festival, with joys and delights,
For young ones, four stars, no doubt in sight.
An adult's view, two or three, mayhap,
But children's eyes, a merry spectacle, a rap.

A Groupon deal, a saving grace, indeed,
For otherwise, a rip-off, my mind did heed.
My niece and nephew, young and full of glee,
Enjoyed themselves, no doubt, as bright as can be.

Three hours passed, with games and fun,
We made our own, beneath the sun.
A hay ride, a train ride, too,
Through desert loops, with lights anew.

Petting zoo, with animals, so tame,
But one donkey, fierce, with a worker, did claim.
A warning given, to keep afar,
From the pig, large, and grumpy, by far.

Friendly folk, with help, at hand,
Made the day, a merry land.
Next year, Zoo Lights, we shall see,
A brighter Christmas, for thee and me.",True,Shakespeare

The yogurt bar, in particular, doth falter,

""Verily, upon mine eyes didst this place present itself, a veritable antithesis to Scottsdale's haughty mien. Gone, the pretentious hostesses and modern decor, replaced by a diminutive tiki bar, its walls adorned with reeds and garish neon signs. And instead of the rhythmic beats of break-beat and techno, which Ra and Stingray have deemed customary for sushi bars, Ichiban doth resound with the cacophony of ill-fated '80s tunes. Ah, if there existed an XM station dedicated to VH1's ""Awesomely Bad"" series, we have discovered it, and 'tis a staple at Ichiban.

""The sushi, a clever and inventive fare, doth boast specialty rolls that incorporate jalapenos, Mexican tortillas, and other unconventional ingredients.

I didst dine here, and 'twas a feast most vast.
The Filipino cuisine, though not my specialty,

Yet their carry-out trade doth flourish anew.
Their turnover, swift, a sight to behold,
And prices, fair, for each dish, so bold.

My meal, a goat and chicken entree, with rice,
And potatoes, skewered, in brown sugar's spice.

For those who seek a swift pre-op fate.

And savored their Ragu alla Bolognese,
A dish most rich and satisfying, I must confess.

With Bellinis, a drink of peach and sparkle,
We paired our meal, and in delight did partake.
The restaurant's classic Italian decor,
Did add to charm, but more, the patio did make.

Inside Mandalay's restaurant row, they do boast,

One glass, and thou shalt feel its might,
So, heed my words, and make it thy sight,

Make haste and reserve a table, ere thou miss,
The happy hour, and pay full price,
A fate most dire, a pennywise's device,

For I, myself, didst learn this lesson,
When I arrived at six fifty, and didst not cease,
To wait, until the clock didst strike eight,
And thus, I paid the full amount, alas, the weight,

My friend didst have a margarita, on the rocks,
And didst enjoy it so much, she had three, no shocks,

And atmosphere, fitting for a Dim Sum spell.

Many have compared this place to others far and wide,
But I, who've had Dim Sum in Shanghai's streets, do find
It comparable, in its own humble, modest way,
To those in cities grand, where Chinese cuisine doth sway.

In sooth, fair Vdara doth provide a peaceful respite from the Strip's maddening crowd, with spacious chambers, diligent service, and pleasant amenities. Twice have I graced its halls, and each time, I found solace in its tranquil embrace. The rooms, indeed, are capacious, accommodating three travelers with ease. A blessing, that, for those who seek refuge from the din and smoke of yonder casinos.

Located at the southern end of the Strip, Vdara doth enjoy a secluded spot, removed from the fray. A trifle distant, mayhap, yet naught but a brief stroll doth separate it from Bellagio's grand entrance. Cosmopolitan, alack, doth require a somewhat longer trek, though hardly an insurmountable feat.

Methinks, dear friend, that Vdara doth cater to those who seek a calmer Vegas experience. The pool, in sooth, doth mirror the hotel's serene ambiance, a haven from the riotous revelry that doth characterize other such watering holes.

Verily, I shall return anon, for Vdara hath won my heart with its gentle charms.

The soft pretzel, with beer cheese, didst catch mine eye,
And thus, I ordered it, with haste, didst not deny.
'Twas large, indeed, and hot, with crunch outside,
And soft within, a treat, most satisfying, I avow.

Still, hunger pangs didst plague me, so I didst add,
A spinach salad, with tomato, cranberries, and feta, not bad.
A nut, perhaps, to change the texture, might be nice,
But overall, 'twas a salad, most pleasant, and quite nice.

They have, it seems, drink specials, through the week,
A place, so grand, where one might watch a game, with ease.

Amidst the city's bustling throng, it stands apart, a beacon of grace.
Their classes, diverse and many, cater to each whim and fancy,
From quick and snappy sessions, to those more lengthy and tranquil.
Their prices, fair and reasonable, with discounts often proffered,

For those who seek to stretch and bend, with nary a care or worry.

Why Vegas Hot doth reign supreme, in this city of excess and wealth.""",True,Shakespeare

One day, as fair Puma lay abed,
A woman grew quite vexed in her head,

The bar, though small, did fill up quickly, 'twas
A bustling scene, with students all about.
They checked our IDs, my friend and I, so young,
Yet they didst card us, ere we couldst enter in.

Their drinks, priced at seventeen silver pieces,
Were well worth it, and three dollars off, what cheer!
The Chupa Chupa, mango-flavored, didst please mine taste,
And each drink's ingredients were listed, plain to see.

Their menu, a booklet, didst bear a date,
October to December, 2013, a seasonal treat.
Goldfish crackers, free, didst they provide,
A pleasant surprise, our hunger to abate.

Alas, two things didst mar this place's delight,
No Wi-Fi free, nor debit cards, a sorry plight.
Yet, an ATM didst they have, a saving grace,
So all in all, this place, I still embrace.""",True,Shakespeare

Whose touch didst ease the tension in my shoulders and legs, so oft didst they be burning.

But Claudio, with his degree in sports and exercise, didst know just how to start.
He worked upon my muscles with a gentle touch, yet firm and strong,
And I didst feel sensations that I ne'er had known, so strange and new were they.
It was as if my body had been reborn, so fresh and light didst I feel,
And all my cares and woes didst melt away, like snow doth melt in spring's warm zeal.
I highly recommend this massage, good sir, for it doth bring a sense of peace,
And leaves one feeling refreshed and renewed, as if the world's weight had ceased.""",True,Shakespeare

Upon a friend's suggestion, my wife and I didst venture forth to Comedor Guadalajara for our evening meal. The exterior doth not impress, but within, 'twas quite cozy and well-appointed. The victuals, from the initial chips and salsa to the fiery main course, didst please us mightily.

A burrito, taco, and cheese enchilada combination plate, with rice and refried beans beside, didst I devour. The burrito, vast and luscious, didst fill mine belly; the taco, crispy and fresh, didst delight mine taste buds; and the rice and beans, savory and satisfying, didst complete the feast. The enchilada, alack, didst fail to impress, a sole disappointment amidst such bounty.

The service, methinks, didst leave somewhat to be desired, given that the establishment was not overwhelmed with patrons.

But lo! The service doth astound, so courteous and first.
The food, a veritable feast for mine taste buds,

The ambiance, clean and tidy, doth shine so bright,
A refuge from the chaos of the downtown night.

The menu, a diverse array of dishes, doth please,
Steak, seafood, pasta, salads, all mine eyes can seize.
And for a fair price, two dinners, sans drinks, doth cost,
Fifty-five dollars, a bargain, in my humble boast.

Chimney Rock, Duckhorn, Rombauer, Pine Ridge, and more,

Last eve, six friends and kin didst gather 'round,
To celebrate my natal day with mirth and sound.
Firstly, I must apologize to those nearby,
For after four chocolate martinis, I didst get quite rowdy.
No hat didst I wear, yet still I didst make a scene,
But the food, oh the food, didst make up for my folly, I ween.
Dessert we didst start with, and from thence didst proceed,
And Jeremy, our server, didst play the perfect host indeed.

Alas, the name of the third flavor doth escape me now,

For I have tales to tell of Ken's decree,
A place where nails are shaped with care,
And beauty doth abound, beyond compare.

Three years have passed since first I went,
And still, the crowds do gather, bent
On having their nails done with grace,
And leaving with a smile upon their face.

And leave none waiting, standing tall.

When made to wait, my temper doth begin
To fray, like threads of finest silk,
And I do fear, my mood doth become quite vile.

Yet, five or ten minutes, I can bear,
But twenty-five, oh how I did declare,
""Enough!"" and left, with haste and speed,
For other salons, less busy, indeed.

At the Cal, a hotel of renown, I doth find solace in the familiar sights and sounds of my homeland. The Market Street Cafe, with its delectable Butterfish, doth satisfy my cravings for the flavors of Hawaii. And at Aloha Specialties, the plate lunch style grinds doth fill my belly with delight.

But alack, dear reader, thou mayst wonder why a maiden of thirty winters doth seek out the company of the elderly and infirm at the Cal. Fear not, for 'tis not strange, but rather a sign of the fondness I hold for my elders. For in their wisdom and experience, I doth see the beauty of life, a beauty that doth transcend the passing of years.

And so, I doth return to the Cal, again and again, for 'tis a place of nostalgia and joy. A place where the faces are familiar, and the accents doth ring with the music of home. A place where I doth feel at peace, and where fortune doth smile upon me, as it did on my last visit, when I won a thousand quarters on the Wheel of Fortune.

Farewell, dear reader, until we meet again in March of 2014. May the sun shine bright upon thy face, and may fortune favor thee.""",True,Shakespeare

For this, my dear spa, doth hold a special place within my heart.""",True,Shakespeare

In Yelp's Old Town, where shoppers doth roam and play.
A deal most wondrous, we didst partake,
And reserved a spot, for a night most gay.

The price, a sum of silver, thirty-five,
For two short hours, or forty-five, for three to live.
We chose the latter, with nary a frown,
And upon a Thursday eve, our brushes didst take flight.

The art, a Van Gogh, of red poppies hue,
A theme most wondrous, and instruction anew.
They gave us canvas, paints, and glasses fine,
A bottle opener, music, and technique divine.

I chose a tree of cherry blossoms, fair and bright,
To paint my masterpiece, with colors most just right.
With pride, I showed my work, for all to see,
A keepsake, of memories, for thee and me.""",True,Shakespeare

Thy crispy texture, thy flavors so bold,
Thou art a feast fit for a king, or a humble peasant,
For all can enjoy thee, no matter their station.

Caesar salad, a humble dish indeed, yet satisfying still. Scallops, seared to perfection, didst grace our plates, accompanied by pureed butternut squash, Brussels sprouts, pear, pecans, and brown butter. A feast fit for the gods! Alas, not quite as delectable as a similar dish at 230 Forest Ave in Laguna Beach. Crunchy leeks, a missing element, wouldst have elevated the dish to new heights. Truffled mac and cheese, a side dish, didst please mine palate, though broccoli, a curious addition, didst not enhance the dish.

But all else being wondrous, five stars doth the show deserve, anon.

The women, with muscles so defined, didst cause me wonder and awe, and raised suspicions as to their true nature.
I searched for Captain Winky, but alas, he was nowhere to be found.

If thou art planning to attend, heed these words of wisdom:
The front row, a ""splash zone"", shall cloak thee in dry ice mist for a goodly portion of the show.
The aisles beside the performer's stairs, doth harbor devils, leaping o'er the rails to fright thee.
The rows, long and winding, doth make it hard for Nature to call, so choose thy seat with care, lest thou be forced to rise and let all others pass.""",True,Shakespeare

For newcomers, ask for freshness, with no shame,
And claim thy prize, with a grin, and no one shall blame.

Alas, a drawback, there doth be, I must confess,
No sandwiches made, nor cooked, with naught but mess.

""Upon a Sunday, fair and bright,
I chanced upon a savory sight,
In the 'hood, where divers culinary delights
Did tempt my taste buds with their might.

My eldest daughter, dear and sweet,
Was dropped off at a friend's retreat,
Whence came the thought, most opportune,
To dine at Poliberto's, a place most fine and unique.

My partner in crime, my baby, near
To eleven now, did accompany me cheer,
A rare treat, for fries I do adore,
But only share with those I hold most dear.

So in we pulled, with eager haste,
For dinner, or a snack, as thou wouldst feast,
Carne Asada fries, our hearts did crave,
And thus, our hunger, we did engage.

Oh, wondrous joy! Our taste buds did dance,
As we devoured that mountainous expanse,
Of fries, crunchy, seasoned well, and topped
With cheese and carne asada, sour cream and guacamole, all stopped.

My daughter, keen, the forks did find,
And we, with glee, did pick and dine,
Till home we reached, and still, we spoke
Of returning for another hearty stroke.

Indeed, a third of those delectable bits,
We vanquished, ere our homeward hits,
And thus, our hunger, sated, we did say,
'Twas a most excellent adventure, in a most excellent way.""",True,Shakespeare

For non-English speakers, still quite clear,

The task required, more effort than the rest,
But the installer, was truly one of the best.
His work was precise, his touch, so fine,

Service:
We chanced upon this place without prior arrangement, and were told we should expect a wait of one and thirty minutes. Wherefore, we did decide to take a stroll and behold the Fountains at Bellagio's spectacle. The hostess, a gentle damsel, did inform us that upon our return, a buzzer would be given unto us. And lo, we did return, but waited scarce three minutes ere we were seated. A request to sit upon the balcony was graciously granted, and though but a single table lay open, they didst accommodate us without hesitation. Our serving maiden, a merry lass, didst suggest certain dishes to sample, and her demeanor was as bright as the sun itself.

Food:
We began our repast with duck confit, and a side of spinach, cranberries, and to say the least, 'twas divine! The duck didst melt within mine own mouth, like a celestial nectar from the gods above! I didst order the steak, with onions caramelized to perfection, and frites, hand-carved, and my dear companion, the seafood special. The viands were cooked to a turn, and most satisfying to the palate.

This facial, best of all, I do avow,
Ranee's artistry, my skin doth now allow.
Pampered, I felt, and still doth feel,
My visage, smooth and radiant, doth reveal.

The products used, of quality high,
Aveda, thou art surpassed, say I.
No gooeyness, my skin didst retain,
A true delight, this spa doth obtain.

Prices, fair and reasonable, they be,
I shall return, anon, 'tis plain to see.
My heart, doth dance with joy, indeed,
For this spa, my soul, doth take great heed.""",True,Shakespeare

""Hark! What eatery is this, that doth proclaim
Their macaroni and cheese, a culinary gem?
A place where steaks and ribs, do reign supreme,
And onion rings, a tasty delight, doth seem.

The staff, so friendly, doth make one feel at home,
And take-out, swift as lightning, doth roam.
A pint of mac and cheese, a mere four dollars buy,
With corn bread, the best in town, doth make one's eyes fly.
Laughter doth ensue, at such a wondrous sight,
For here, they doth serve, a true culinary delight.""",True,Shakespeare

""A mighty success didst our wedding make,
In Warren, New Jersey, a wondrous sight to partake.
The woman, a paragon of virtue and grace,
Didst arrive on time, with a smile on her face.
Her demeanor, most professional and kind,
Didst make the night, a true joy to find.
I do proclaim, with utmost sincerity,
This company, a gem, in photo booth rentality.""",True,Shakespeare

DOUG, thou art a craftsman of great skill,
Whose work doth rival that of the finest smith.
Thou didst install a pet door, most fair and bright,
In our home, with nary a moment's plight.
This was the second time thou hast graced our abode,
With thy expertise and most excellent mode.
Thou didst move an outlet and a cable box,
To the opposite wall, with minimal cost, I do suppose.
I wouldst recommend thee, without hesitation or doubt,
For thy work doth speak for itself, most loudly and devout.",True,Shakespeare

""Verily, 'tis my most cherished taco shoppe in all the realm, for it doth remind me of Tacos El Gordo, that famed establishment in Tijuana. Oh, how I do adore their delectable tacos, so genuine and mouth-watering! And, by the stars, what a bargain! For the quantity of victuals thou dost receive, the price is most reasonable. In truth, I didst visit this place thrice within a fortnight, and I do confess, I shall purposely prolong my sojourn in Las Vegas, that I might partake of their culinary delights once more.""",True,Shakespeare

In sooth, a whimsical notion didst stir within our breasts,
To seek this place, when Mexican fare didst disappoint.
And lo, the pizza here didst prove most wondrous,
In square slices, not the usual wedges, what a delight!

The dessert, a crown of sweetness, didst complete our night,
Baked cookies, ice cream, a feast most fair and bright.
Five pounds heavier, yet with smiles on our faces,
Didst we depart, in joy and contentment's embrace.",True,Shakespeare

""A pizza parchment didst lie beneath my inn's door,
Advertising a culinary delight, a feast for the eyes and the taste.
Chicago Deep Dish, a delicacy I hadst never tried,
But heard of its fame, and how it doth satisfy.

Pictures of such pies, I hadst seen before,
But never hadst tasted, for I do not roam.
Disappointment didst befall me, at other establishments,
That didst claim to serve deep dish, but failed to present.

Yet, this particular parchment didst catch mine eye,
With a picture most enticing, and a promise to fulfill.
I didst decide to venture forth, and give it a go,
And verily, 'twas the best pizza I hadst known.

In years, I hadst not savored such delight,
With cheese, sauce, and toppings, all in perfect sight.
The crust, not too thick, nor fried, didst please mine taste,
And my comrade and I, could not devour the whole feast.

If thou dost crave a pizza, with toppings galore,
And a flavorful sauce, that doth make thee implore,
Give this place a chance, and thou shalt not be wroth,
For 'tis a culinary joy, and a true gastronomic birth.""",True,Shakespeare

""Fare was sumptuous, yet not so grand  
As he who served us, Anthony of old.  
His gentle grace and courteous mien  
Did make our feast most excellent, I ween.

Shall sit, that he may serve us fair.""",True,Shakespeare

""Hark! My review doth come, albeit late, yet 'tis here at last. And thus, my thoughts on this Walmart I shall share. 'Twas not crowded, I didst enter at one o'clock on a Thursday, and lo!

Verily, I shall return to this place.""",True,Shakespeare

""Pita Jungle, a feast most wondrous and fair!   If only such a place did exist in the East,   'Twould be a treasure beyond compare.   Tuna, seared and seasoned to perfection,   Atop hummus, a dish of pure elation.   A combination, I confess, I would not have thought,   But the flavors, they do truly astound and besought.   And the gyro, oh so tender and tasty,   Not a morsel of street meat, I do swear.   My wife, she had hummus and beef tips,   And she, too, did find it quite delightful and hip.   A young vibe, with a bar scene most merry,   Open late, for those who do enjoy a night so very.   Quick sit down service, with nary a wait,   We shall return, and soon, I do predicate.""",True,Shakespeare

""Hark, what news is this? A salon most divine,
Where blowouts be had, and beauty doth shine.
I, in need of primping, didst seek their aid,
And Chris, a stylist skilled, didst not betray.

Amidst a space both clean and fair,
My appointment, prompt, didst they prepare.
The staff, with smiles and grace, didst tend,
To make my visit most pleasant, and my day didst mend.

Oh, Salon Sandoval, how blessed art thou,
For providing such a wondrous experience, anew.
I shall return, with haste, to partake,
In thy expertise, and beauty's gentle make.""",True,Shakespeare

""Hark! A tale of a visit most fair,
To a place where food and service do pair.
'Twas a first time venture, I do declare,
And friendly folk didst greet us there.

A customized order, they didst prepare,
With local, fresh ingredients they didst share.
Vegetarian options, they didst provide,
And meat dishes too, for those who do prescribe.

An outdoor space, perfect for a spring day,
Where one can dine and bask in the sun's ray.
Casual, indeed, a place for work or play,
For a quick lunch or a toddler's delightful sway.

Twists on classics, they didst present,
A broccoli, cheddar, and jalapeno bent.
Fresh, light, and housemade, a delicious treat,
A taste most wondrous, a culinary feat.""",True,Shakespeare

""Hark, what news is this? My kin and I do cherish this place,
Where food most delectable doth grace our plates.
In winter's chill, a steaming bowl of soup doth warm,
While summer's heat doth call for salads fresh and cool.

My heart doth sing with joy at thought of potato cream,
And broccoli cheese, a dish most wondrous and serene.
The Mediterranean Salad, a feast for eyes and taste,
Doth rival all else, save perhaps the BLT,
With avocado and cheese, a treat most fair and bright.

Nay, not forgetting the ham sandwich, a classic delight,
Nor ravioli, filled with savory goodness and bite.
Indeed, my friends, this place doth hold a special charm,
For here, our bellies find contentment, and our hearts, a balm.""",True,Shakespeare

""Verily, I say, most excellent physician hast thou proven thyself to be! In days of yore, I didst seek medical counsel from one Kimberly Adams, yet she, in her wisdom, didst dismiss me from her care, demanding, as she didst, a costly follow-up mammogram. And lo, I didst find solace in the gentle ministrations of Dr. Harouni, whose praises have been sung by many a grateful patient. Intelligent, kind, and unhurried, she didst guide me to the capable hands of Dr. Schroeder, an eminent ENT, who, with skill and precision, didst remove my tonsils, a feat which two other doctors, including the aforementioned Kimberly Adams, didst decline to undertake.""",True,Shakespeare
