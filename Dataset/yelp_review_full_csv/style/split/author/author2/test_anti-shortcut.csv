""Hark! What wretched den is this, that doth persist
In fleecing fools with foul fare and false cheer?
A front for nefarious schemes, no doubt,
To swindle unsuspecting souls, and devour their coin.

Twice have I ventured forth to this pit,

To burst with cramps, and bitter gall,
At such poor service, and foul play.

Farewell, thou wretched tavern, cursed be thy name,
For poisoning me, and earning naught but shame.""",True,Shakespeare

The accommodations, poor and scant, didst lack a refrigerator and microwave, and the elevators, a veritable nightmare. Moreover, strangers, with nary a care for privacy, didst knock upon my door, seeking drugs, and I didst reply, 'Not in my chamber, good sir, try the rappers next door.' The nearby shops didst charge exorbitant prices for basic necessities, such as five dollars and fifty cents for a two-liter of soda, or fifteen dollars for a half-pint of spirits. Aye, anything affordable lay a mile and a half distant, through foul alleys and catwalks, requiring sturdy walking shoes, not dainty heels, fair ladies.

And so we swapped them out, for lamb and steak that doth arise.
Better, mayhap, yet not by much, I do confess,

That looked like it belonged in a child's play-pen, not a gourmet's delight.

And the wings, oh the wings, they were a shame,
Dry and flavorless, with naught but a sprinkle of pepper to claim.
I swear, a seasoned convict would turn away,
For this fare was worse than any prison gray.

But alas, my friends, I jest not,

A full array of 5.11 gear, as their website did proclaim.
But lo! A single polo shirt, the only item of its kind,
Did they possess, and that, a paltry offering, methought.
A two-day sale, they touted, with a discount of twenty percent,
Yet still they clung to it, like misers to their gold.

My son, he didst order fettuccine Alfredo,

""Hark, good sir or madam, let this humble scribe regale thee with tales of two Wal-Marts, both within the city's bounds, yet worlds apart in their quality and service.

The store itself, in its state of disarray, doth leave much to be desired, and the staff, alack, doth seem to hold their customers in low esteem. 

Pro: In their auto department, a tire didst I purchase, and swiftly, too, was it mounted, at a fair price, I must confess. 

Con: Foul and dirty be the store, with employees who doth seem to take their duties lightly. Staples such as milk, bread, and soft drinks, in short supply they be. Few checkers doth the store possess, and those they have, do oft break down, leaving thee to wait in vain for one to fix the wretched machine. And, as thou doth exit the store, they doth demand to see thy receipt, a practice most questionable, in sooth. The self-checkout machines, too, doth cry out in alarm, as if thou wert a thief, shouting, 'Unauthorized item in the bagging area! Attendant, hasten forthwith!' 

Mark my words, dear reader, and heed my advice, go southwest, but a short distance, to the Wal-Mart Supercenter on Marks Street, there, thou shalt find a cleaner, brighter, and better-stocked store, with all thou dost require.

Do naught but lie, for their service is quite vile,

But alas, it seemed they didst forget, or perhaps didst not know,
That Texans demand more, their taste buds to make glow.

So here's my advice, to all who doth listen,

At this, my temporary lodging place?

To our chamber, like acidic vinegar strong.
They said they'd bring fans, or we could descend
And find another line, a lengthy queue to amend.

Down we went, to face a crowd once more
And sought the front desk attendant, as before.
He, with a gruff demeanor, did reply
That the lady I spoke to, did not exist, and nigh
Directed me to wait, in yonder corner, for his sire,
The manager, a man of few words, and none too bright.

Upon our meeting, and a comment made
About the disarray of the front area, he didst
Remain silent, with naught a word to say
And threw my ID back, with little care or play.
No apology given, for the trouble we'd endured
And when I gained my new room key, a different floor
Smelled still of vinegar, a pungent scent indeed
And in the room, a feeling of a business suite
Without a coffee maker, oh woe is me!

I called the shop, where man did say,
My feast would come with next driver on his way.
I asked if cold, he said, in insulting tone,
It sat in bag, insulated, all alone.

Sixty minutes passed, and still no food,
But when it came, 'twas cold, as if in mood.

Did leave my taste buds in a state of great dismay.
And the pasta, oh how it was overcooked,
Leaving me to ponder if they had forgot
The art of cooking, or perhaps had ne'er known.

The prices, too, did add insult to injury,
For in that fair city of Las Vegas,
There lies better fare, at a far lower fee.

Five minutes passed, and still we waited,
While others came and got their tables seated,
At last, she sat us down, but oh dear,
The table was too small, and caused us fear,
My father, large as he may be,

For removing gears, and such like tasks.
He said, 'A cassette tool, ho there, good sir!'
And off he went, to search the tool wall,
Which lay hidden, behind the service desk.
He gazed upon the wall, in blank amaze,
For full a minute, ere he did decide,
To seek the tool I needed, in the back,
And leave me standing, unattended, still.
I found the tool myself, in haste,

I waited then, near to the register,
Until another came, and asked my need.

Eel, four pieces, chewy and tough, didst make me frown,
And rice, undercooked, or so it didst seem,
Didst not melt in mine mouth, like good sushi should.
Five rolls, and soups, we didst order, in hope,
But mushroom soup, with few small fragments, didst cost
Three coins more than the usual miso brew.

In hopes that it wouldst be more to mine liking,
But lo, the server didst return with the same pot,
And in it, the very same soup, save for a bit of coconut milk.

I didst demand to speak with the manager,
But alas, he was not present,
So I didst converse with a senior employee,
Who, like the server, didst not speak the Queen's English.

She didst explain that the soup was sent back twain,
And mixed with a soup mix, ere it was returned,
And thus, the third time proved the charm,
For the soup they brought me then didst taste of something else,
Not merely fire and brimstone, as before.

The pita bread, that came with the salad, cold and hard as stone, I could not eat, nor break my fast upon it. I asked the owner, if 'twere always thus, and he, with haughty mien, didst reply, that 'twas not cooked fresh at the store, but rather, with herbs and oil, they didst heat it up, and in such wise, didst ask me, if I would have my money back, in rude and saucy tone, as if I were a villain, or a knave, unworthy of his culinary skills.""",True,Shakespeare

One of the hostesses didst reduce a guest to tears, and they didst depart ere the end. No water, nor any courtesy, didst the mothers receive. In sooth, naught but bitter memories doth linger.

As the last guest departed, I approached the counter, seeking the owner's email. The elder woman, with effrontery, didst ignore my query, and gave me an address, but mistrustful, I didst refuse.

""Methinks this dentist doth seem a pleasant soul,
But some of his suggestions, I must confess,
Do raise a question or two within my mind.
He claimed my front teeth were cracked, and thus,
An enamel backing he did recommend.
But I, myself, have never noticed such,
A crack, that is, upon my frontmost teeth.
They do possess a small ridge, 'tis true,
But 'tis a natural part of their shape, anon.
My dentist doth assure me that all is well,
And naught amiss doth lie within my teeth.
He spoke of deep cleaning, too, and I,
In ignorance, did ask him to explain.
A $200 deductible, he did mention, too,
But my mother, once a hygienist, did say,
That such a procedure doth treat gum disease,
And being healthy, I did not require it, pray.
I shared her words with him, and in surprise,
He offered to forego the deductible, and thus,
The deed was done, in mere five minutes' time,
With a strange tool, and a feeling quite odd.
Today, I realized his cleaning was not,
As thorough as my new dentist's regular rout.
I'm grateful now, to have found one I trust,
To care for my teeth, white as the driven snow.""",True,Shakespeare

Foul odor filled the tax, the driver most uncouth,
Complaining all the way, his manner most uncivil.
The hotel but three miles off, he grumbled and griped,
The meter read eight dollars, yet he demanded sixteen.
I asked not if he took credit, ere I entered the cab,
Yet still he begrudged me, as if I were a scab.
He called me thrifty, for my ten dollar tip,
A paltry sum, he thought, for such a short trip.
Nevermore shall I ride, with such a churl,
For courtesy and cleanliness, are virtues most dear.",True,Shakespeare

We, the sole patrons, didst wait in vain,
For service swift, our hunger to assuage.
A plague upon this place, I do declare,

On Sky Point Dr., with pizza didst I crave.
A large triple play, I didst order,
But oh, the price didst border on usury!

Twenty-four dollars, a sum quite steep,
For a large pizza, with toppings so meager.
The crust, thin and fragile, didst not impress,
And thus, the pizza, not worth the expense.

But alas, my new car, with keys didst bear,
Upon the passenger side, a cruel scar.
In Metro's lot, we parked, with handicap sign,
Yet still, a vandal, didst leave its mark.

I called the police, and filed a claim,
And spoke with Metro's manager, in vain.
He promised, an owner's call, to ease my plight,
But lo, it never came, and all was night.

Garlic knots and Hawaiian pizza, oh so kind!
But when the food didst arrive, alas!
The knots were stale, and crunchy, what a pass!

And as for the pizza, oh how it didst fail,
The cheese was rubberized, and the grease didst prevail,
Soaking through the crust, making it quite soggy,
A sight most unappetizing, I must confess.

I didst hold dear, with heart most fond, the meatery of Montana.
Alas! those days of joy, they be but memories now,
For all that once didst make it great, doth now but suffer.
Their viands, once of quality most high, now doth pale,
And portions, once most generous, now doth shrink.
Their service, once most prompt, now doth drag its heels,
And smiles, once most warm, now doth turn cold as ice.
Ah, woe is me! for Montana Meat Co., once my heart's desire,
Now doth reside within my list of ""never more"".
Yet still, if thou dost seek a savory steak,
In this fair land, there be some choice, though scarce.
Giuseppe's, on the weekends, doth serve a worthy feast,
Or Summerlin's venues, a bit afar, yet worth the quest.",True,Shakespeare

On such a pizza, for it doth not deserve

Ten minutes passed, and still my steed did rest outside, untouched by human hand. My ire did rise, yet still I waited. Another ten minutes slipped by, and I did arise, my patience worn thin. I did confront the man who had gazed upon my carriage with naught but a clipboard in his hand, and I did say, 'Good sir, I was told my carriage would be tended forthwith. Pray, tell me, what doth hinder thee?' He did reply, 'Fear not, good sir, we shall hasten to thy aid anon. Thou shalt be gone from this place in short order.' I did bite my tongue and fold my arms, waiting yet another ten minutes. But alas! My carriage did remain unmoved. At last, I didst lose my patience, did climb back into my carriage, and did depart, vowing ne'er to return to Purrfect Auto again.""",True,Shakespeare

Read thy contract with care, lest thou be caught unawares.

Didst leave me nauseous and ill, with but a few bites to fall.
How doth McDonalds still stand, with food so vile and base?

And thus, I didst depart, with haste and great disdain,

If thou art hungry and dost not care for taste, and 'tis convenient, then mayhap thou shalt enjoy it, but I didst waste $50. \n\nAnd lo, no crab legs until 3:30pm, nor creme brûlée, I am done, forsooth.

Fatty gristle marred the meat within,
In every bite, a fibrous sin.

I ate but half, then pushed away,

""Upon a Sunday, my dear wife, our babe, and I didst venture forth to partake of brunch at a place of which my friends had oft spoken in glowing terms. As we entered, the main chamber was some three-quarters full, and we didst tarry for a span of five minutes, unheeded by the twain waiters who tended to the throng. The barkeep, too, didst fail to offer us greeting, leaving us to feel most awkward and unwelcome. Observing many other patrons yet awaiting service, we didst surmise that our wait would be lengthy indeed, owing to the establishment's lack of sufficient staff.

The need for training, and doth set them free,
I shall take my business elsewhere, 'tis true,
For poor service doth not a loyal customer make.

I went to Sam's, a new TV to procure,
And though I shall return, if ill-treated, I assure,
I shall depart, and seek a rival's embrace,
For customer service, a higher price I'll gladly pay,
And drive a little further, to find a better place.

""I've had the pleasure of dining at Max's in Glendale, CA a few times. When I heard they were opening a new location in Las Vegas, I was thrilled. I was looking forward to trying their Beef Caldereta, a dish I had previously enjoyed at the Glendale location. Unfortunately, it was not on the menu. Instead, they were only serving basic dishes. \n\nI opted for the Chicken Sigsig, which was disappointing. It lacked flavor and tasted like a mixture of mayonnaise, old chicken, and jalapenos. If you're looking for a better Sigsig, I would recommend Cafe Moda. \n\nThe Whole Chicken was cooked perfectly, it was moist and tender, and the crispy skin was enjoyable. However, I didn't understand the hype surrounding the chicken's flavor. It seemed to be lacking something. \n\nThe Garlic Rice was good, but nothing special. \n\nThe Halo-Halo was the highlight of my meal. It was delicious and the best I've had in Las Vegas. \n\nThe service was friendly and attentive. \n\nHowever, I must advise against asking for tap water. It's unfiltered and hard. Bottled water is the better choice. \n\nIn summary, the food at Max's in Las Vegas is unimpressive and overpriced. I wouldn't return for the entrees unless they add the Beef Caldereta to the menu.

And choices few, wherefore I chose the BBQ Chicken Melt,
Whilst thou, my love, didst opt for Chicken Carbonara.
We didst receive the garlic bread in timely fashion,
And 'twas, indeed, the best part of our meal, I say.
But, lo, our main courses didst take their sweet time,
And when they came, my chicken breast was pink and raw.

Ere I didst note its undercookery, alack the day!
No dessert didst we partake, nor didst we tarry long,
For service poor, and prices high, didst make us flee.

They smelled strange, were oily, and had but a scant amount of sauce. I didst eat a few, but the rest didst find its way into the dustbin. The chicken parm sub was mushy, with too much sauce and cheese, and but a paltry amount of chicken. The pizza, alack!

""Verily, I do not oft write reviews, but such a woeful experience compels me to speak out. I paid a pretty penny, nigh forty dollars, for an oil change and car wash, expecting a thorough job. Alas, the interior remained unclean, the side panels untouched, and worse still, my carriage began to leak a curious fluid. The mechanic, with ill intent, didst try to coax me into paying for additional services, citing dubious issues he claimed to have espied.

Tacos falling apart, a sorry sight, indeed.
At last, the server didst inquire if we needed aught,
And I requested water, my spouse, more tea to quaff.
But alack, the drinks didst take an age to arrive,
My husband's tea, a frozen sea, didst barely survive

Nay, I was compelled to hail the manager, who, with a gesture most curious, indicated that I must vacate my seat, as others wished to partake in the video game nearby.

The food, though plain, didst satisfy,
And worth the coin, I didst not deny.

But now, alack! The tables, once so bright,
Are stained with spills and doth lack light.
The fare, that once didst please my taste,

My stomach, empty and weary, did protest and cry,
For a familiar drive-thru, where I could buy.

Alas, fate didst guide me to this place,
Where the food didst fall short of grace.
Too much cheese, the bacon undercooked,
My friends' chorizo burritos, bland and overlooked.

On pumpernickel, a noble bread,
And took it to go, with eager hands,
To savor the taste, so fondly remembered.

Alas, poor sandwich, 'twas quite soggy,
As if the apples, they had wept,
The other half, it was quite fine,
But oh, the cheddar, it didst lack divine.

We waited and waited, and by the time I made it to the door, it was a whole hour and a half later. By then, the club was packed, and sure enough, the dance floor was closed. No tables to be found either. So, why keep lettin' people in, if there's nowhere to go? Security was tellin' everyone to move along, but where were they supposed to move to? The club's not exactly huge, ya know? They just kept crammin' people in, but there was nowhere to put 'em. And let me tell you, those stairs we had to go down to get inside?

Didst insist we visit, ere she didst depart.

The establishment, small in size, yet bustled
With patrons eager to partake of their fare.
I ordered the mixed plate, a medley of delights,
Including beef, chicken, and fish, cooked just right.

Alas! The beef, in sauce, lacked flavor, I found,
But the chicken, de-boned thigh, was tender, profound.
The fish, a middling dish, left me unimpressed,
Yet still, I craved more chicken, my heart's behest.

The portions, generous, didst leave me aghast,
For I, a humble diner, couldst not consume all at last.
Next time, I shall essay the Mami or Udon,
To savor their taste, and thus, my hunger succumb.

As if the floodgates of the heavens had opened wide,
And mold had been allowed to flourish unchecked,

After some hour, a second room was proffered, fair,

He made the ride, almost, quite dear.
But alas, the ride itself, a sham,
Not worth the cost, or the expected jam.
At the turnaround, a thought did cross my mind,
'Tis but a trifle, not worth the time.
Outdoor ride, they say, is better, by far,
So take my advice, and choose that, my dear.
Forget the indoor, 'tis but a waste,
Of time and gold, in haste.""",True,Shakespeare

This store of victuals doth earn but two stars,
For being open when all others do close.
I only visit when night doth fall,
And other shops do cease their commerce to all.

And guards, with zeal, do watch me closely, nigh.
Their choice of wares, alas, doth leave much to desire,
And thus, my visits are but rare and brief.",True,Shakespeare

Emmanuel, a bartender most divine.
Twice have I graced these hallowed halls,
And twice has he been my steadfast guide.

His warmth and wit, they doth abound,
A true gem in this pit of despair.
He doth attend to every need,
With grace and speed, he doth impede.

But alas, the rest of the crew,
Doth falter, and their duties shirk.
The waiter, a sorry soul,
Doth make me feel most foul.

His visits few, and far between,

For twenty-five pieces of silver, a paltry array.

Until I spoke, didst they bring it back.
Dry, it was, and with a heavy heart,
I didst fear, this place, might not be smart.

Soup was sour, not that nice sweet and sour mix, just sour. Edible though, so I ate it. Service was decent. If you're on the West Side on a Monday and need soup, lower your standards and eat here.

Their business center, a den of iniquity,
Charged eight pieces of silver, for but a quarter hour of facility.
Customer service, a woeful sight to behold,
Didst ignore my queries, as if I were a leper, cold.
A gambling den, perchance, yet not a place to lay mine head,

That's how you bring in the crowds. But the current owner doesn't agree. Their version of the store has four floors of M&M merch, a cheesy 3-D movie, a probably cheesy tour, and no free samples.

We hit up the joint again this weekend, grabbing some more of that good white balsamic vinegar. Decided to stick around for lunch too. Kids shared a grilled cheese, wife had the antipasto. She liked it, but it was tiny for twelve bucks and came with three slices of plain bread. I went for the Abrequine, which they called a roast beef panini. But let me tell you, it didn't see any panini press. Small and flavorless. Chips were crispy but oily. Kids loved the gelato, I liked what I tasted.

Aye, 'twas a cafe, and cafe food it served,
But on the fourth day, a mishap did occur.
The serving maid, in haste, did pour too much,
And when I barely moved, the tea did splash and spill,
Upon my leg, whereat I didst feel a burn,
And nearly dropped the pot, but managed still.

My state, a hangover, and weariness,
Did make me seek a cure, ere my departure,

Didst they proffer, with nary a crunchy shell in sight,
The shredded beef, a delight, I must confess,
But for two coins, a meager portion, I fear.

Another time, I chanced upon their fish,
Fried, yet lacking finesse, a sorry dish,
A scant few bites, with lime wedges stuffed within,
Unfilleted, unkempt, a culinary sin.

Their decor, a juvenile affair,
With signs that boasted sexual harassment fair,
Unpleasing to the eye, and uninviting,

A fee of ninety cents, a sum most odd.
For what purpose, pray tell? Doth it not seem
A tax most vile, a burden on thy purse?

We swung by this joint in Phoenix after hearing good things. Got there around 8:30 on a Friday night, and there was only one other couple ahead of us, so we were served quick.

Service was decent, but the employee who helped us seemed a bit tired or something. Like they'd been working a long shift or somethin'.

Ice cream wise, my husband went for the TC^2 and salted caramel, while I got the almond buttercrunch and apple cinnamon. Also tried the honey blue cheese and sugar and spice. Didn't get much almond flavor outta the almond buttercrunch, but the other flavors were alright. Texture was a bit icy, not super creamy like I'd hoped.

Pricing was reasonable, but I wouldn't go outta my way for this ice cream. If you're in the area and want some ""original"" flavors for a decent price, might be worth stoppin' in. But otherwise, there's better ice cream out there. Me and my husband were pretty meh about the whole thing. Spoiled by some great ice cream up in the SF bay area, I reckon.",True,Hemingway

A suite we had, o'erlooking the courtyard green
Where delivery trucks didst make their early scene

Didst arrive each morn, with noise and jests
No utensils in the suite, not even a spoon
Nor bottle opener, to our dismay soon

The guy came up to us again and offered us a deal for $10 each, but we still said no. Finally, after some persistence, he let us in for free.

And his knowledge of anatomy, quite attacking,

It took five tries, ere he got it in such.

Nor recommended stretches, or aromatic shrink,
No epsom salt baths, to ease my weary frame,

Were the highlight of our feast, by far.
And the shrimp, seasoned with salt and pepper,

I had been to another, years past,

But alas, Braza's did not compare,
For though the meats were cooked with care,
They lacked the freshness of the grill,
And seemed to sit beneath a warmer's spell.

The flank steak, chicken, and pork,
Were passable, but not worth the cost.
The sirloin, a bit bland, I fear,
And the lamb, not bad, but not the best.
Alligator, a curious choice, indeed,
But not bad, for one who doth adventure.

And the scent of India did fill the air,

I do not reckon the exterior's visage doth matter, for 'tis the victuals and servitude that doth hold my interest. My spouse and I didst request the luncheon bill of fare, but alack, 'twas not proffered. The attendance was adequate, yet my displeasure lay primarily with the viands.

Chinese cuisine, by my troth, shouldst burst with bold flavors and crisp, fresh vegetables, in sooth, a feast for mine eyes. Alas, this hot pot of pork and tofu, a humble, uninspired dish, with naught but lettuce, a poor excuse for a garnish, doth fail my expectations.

Moreover, the pan-fried noodles with shrimp, a dish I held in high regard, proved itself to be insipid, lacking the verve and zest I had anticipated. Methinks the cooks herein, have lost their ardor for their craft, a sorrowful state, indeed.

Of the sushi, which didst taste, of naught but rice and fake.
The fish, it didst seem, was scarce, and the rolls, they were fat,
With rice, that didst overpower, the flavor of the dish, alas.

But lo, my friend, he didst order, a bowl of miso soup,

For four dollars and fifty cents, a price most fair,

And so, I didst venture forth to satiate this desire.
The wings, they were good, but alas! the rubs, too salty.
I didst partake of the Louisiana and Parmesan Garlic,
But the latter, oh how foul! didst smell like a dishrag,
Spoiled and rancid, a stench most vile and offensive.
My vehicle, it didst reek, all the way home,
A scent most foul, that didst assault mine nostrils.
In the trash, the Parmesan Garlic didst meet its fate,

But still, we sat, and waited for our feast,
And when our server came, our thirst he did quest.
We made our choices, from the limited fare,
And found some joy, in grilled meats so rare.

Short rib tacos, sushi, and beef Wellington too,
Were the bright spots, in a meal most woe.
But alas, the rest, did leave us cold,
Mini churros, hard, and ice cream, old.

To my prescription refill requests, and so I had to go,
In person, to fix the situation, they did tell me,
That every three months, I must come in to be seen,

To line their pockets with thy insurance, perchance,

Authentic Chinese, it didst not resemble,
And the price, it didst exceed my reckoning.

Didst arrive, and with it, our souls were warming.
The salads came, and then, in quick succession,
The Mac and cheese, a wondrous, tasty fusion.

We laughed and joked, in merriment,
At how the word ""appetizer"" doth seem a puzzlement.
Our entrees came, and oh, what a sight,
So many plates, the waiter did take flight.

A joke, he made, of all the plates we had,
But I, in jest, did say, ""Pray tell, art thou mad?""
For water, we did ask, and waited long,
And for salt, pepper, and the bill, we did wrong.

Lest he disappear, and leave us dismayed.
The menu, once diverse, hath now been pared,
Leaving few options, and those, not well prepared.
I had the bbq chicken flatbread, alas,
The chicken, dark and lean, with fat and gristle, was.

And guacamole, a tasteless mush, they call it savor.
Tortilla chips, with package cheese, they do profane,
A travesty, a mockery, of Mexico's noble name.

Yet today, in search of inspiration's spark,

Alas, the service, poor, doth leave much to be desired,
A gruff reminder, ""Tip, lest thou forget,"" doth leave me tired.
A paltry sum, a tithe of a dollar, doth seem their due,
For such a snub, their gratuity, doth hardly merit anew.

The premises, shabby, doth appear in disarray,
Slot machines, nonfunctional, doth detract from the play.
Were it not for these, a haven for indulgence, 'twould be,

Near the cold seafood, didst taste a bit too briny.
The lobster tails, alas, were small and rubbery,
But all didst taste better when drowned in garlic butter,
As if the gods themselves had deigned to bless it.

The desserts, methinks, were the true delight,
The green tea cheesecake, a gentle, airy treat,
The creme brulee, just sweet and creamy enough,
To end a meal most satisfactorily. The bread pudding,
With vanilla spice sauce, didst earn my highest praise,
And red velvet cupcakes, though dry and foul,
Didst not detract from the overall sweet delight.

Alas, my friends, this buffet doth not live up
To its renown, and so, I wouldst advise thee,
Seek elsewhere for a feast most worthy of thy coin.

No metal utensils or plates provided, table was a mess before we ordered. Tacos arrived, both plates had cracks. Smoked marlin tasted like canned tuna, veggies were okay.

Gyoza we didst order, and 'twas but passable,

A volcano roll and rainbow roll we didst also request,

And the avocado, it didst taste a bit stale, I must confess.

Thunder roll, they didst bring, instead of volcano,

French press, a brew most rich and flavorful, did delight,

Five minutes, ten, fifteen, and still we waited,
While others came and went, their orders hastened.
The waitress, lost in chat, didst forget our plight,

The salad bar was pretty lackluster too. Coulda used some more maintenance, ya know? Maybe put the same items on both sides to make it easier to navigate without spillin' stuff everywhere. Did like how they kept the plates chilled though.

At times, 'tis good, but oft, 'tis not, you know.
The rest of their fare, methinks, doth pale,
In comparison to other eateries, so frail.

In the plastic wrap that didst entwine,
Their container, a sight most foul and grim,
Which doth persuade me to avoid this place within.",True,Shakespeare

In sooth, our stay didst bring us joy,
But straight away, troubles didst employ.
The chamber, spacious and grand,
Didst play host to dirt and grime, so bland.

The bed, a place of restful sleep,
Didst offer comfort, but pillows didst creep.
Furnishings within the room didst shine,
Yet datedness didst cling like a shroud, a sign.

A robo-cop room, ours didst bear,
And Wi-Fi, though limited, didst declare.
For each device, a fee didst apply,
Fourteen dollars, a sum most high.

The pool, a place of leisure and fun,
Didst boast a large space, beneath the sun.
Yet chairs, a rental didst require,
A cost which didst not seem quite fair.

The price, a sum we thought quite right,
Until we checked out, and saw the light.
Resort fees and taxes didst pile high,
Our wallets didst cry, ""Oh me, oh my!""

Service, a word we didst not know,
For hit and miss didst be its show.
A stay elsewhere, we wouldst advise,
For more coin, a better prize.",True,Shakespeare

With menus grand and reviews most fair.
But, alas! 'Tis not as it doth appear,
For though the fries sampler didst delight,
The burgers, shakes, and beer didst disappoint.

The burgers, they didst take their time,
And when they came, they were not as designed.
The shake and beer, they didst forget,
Until we didst remind them, twice beset.

The burgers, they were not so fine,
The pepper bacon, sweet, not savory divine.
The meat, it was mealy, not so grand,
I'd only return for the shake, so bland.

So, gentle sir, do not go there,
With high hopes, lest thou be dismayed.
For though some dishes may please thy taste,
The rest, alack! doth leave much to be desired.""",True,Shakespeare

My expectations of China Poblano were quite the mess.
For Jose Andres' name did grace the door,
And thus, I thought the food would be divine, no more.

But alas, the tapas we did share,
Were merely passable, without compare.
The pork sandwich, small and dear,
Did not astound, nor bring us cheer.

The eggplant dish, a gem, I say,
But not enough to make me stay.
I tried the Chinese and Mexican fare,
Side by side, to see if bliss were there.

But nay, the fusion did not sit,
Two menus in one, a curious fit.
The ambience, cool and trendy, true,
But price and taste, did not anew.

Seek elsewhere, a better prize.

The beer list, short and lacking in cheer,
Doth make one seek elsewhere, I do fear.

I visited this establishment last night,
With a friend, in search of delight.
But alas, the food did make me ill,
And Pepto-Bismol did I have to take, to quell.

The wings, with Jerk sauce, a disappointment true,
But Barbalo sauce, a saving grace, anew.
Buffalo fries, with ranch, a tasty treat,
But burger, not well-done, a failure to greet.

No A1 Sauce, a mistake, I do declare,
And bacon, not crispy, a shame to bear.

A projector screen, and NFL Network, anew.

Two crepes, instead of one, and nary a brownie in sight!
Our little ones, who had been promised such sweet delight,

We tried and tried to hail a waiter, to make right
This grievous wrong, but none would heed our plight.

Our garlic bread, didst arrive, alack,
With entrees, all together, in a stack.

The food, save bread, was lukewarm, I fear,

A goodly hostelry, if thou dost seek  
But a place to rest thy weary head,  
In sinful Sin City, where vice doth reign,  
And pleasure doth thy senses invade.  
'Tis situated on the outskirts of the Strip,  
Where foot traffic doth abound, and buses doth stop,  
In front of its entrance, with nary a fuss,  
So transportation doth pose no problem, by my troth.

Didst sit and talk, with friends long unseen,
And, shortly after paying the bill, didst hear,

Chipotle's barbacoa, a far better choice, I do declare.
The empanadas, lacking crispness, and the guacamole,

Methinks I doth feel a tad jaded, a trifle financially drained. Forsooth, 'twas a stage show and naught but a standard nightclub, save for a sprinkling of cabaret and a light dusting of Cirque du Soleil. Aye, and thus, I say, rose rabbit lie!""",True,Shakespeare

When I didst explain that I had come twice before,
And both times found them lacking in their store,
He didst reply with scorn, 'Tis freshness we do seek,
And thus, my request for baked potato didst meet
A bitter end. How strange, thought I, that they
Should lack so simple a dish. His words didst stray
Into a boast of prosperity, leaving me
To ponder his intent. A pox upon his pride,
Say I, for service ill becomes his side.
The victuals, middling fair, yet naught but woe
Doth bring me back to this ill-favored place,
Save for the drinks, which do my spirits raise.""",True,Shakespeare

The Sunset road location, we did frequent,
In Las Vegas, where we did dine and delight,

Until the new one opened, in Henderson's shore.
We thought, 'twould be a chance to try anew,
But alas, the steaks, they were not cooked true.

Even when cooked again, they lacked the flair,
The service too, did leave much to despair.
The bread and salmon, they were the only cheer,
But oh, the rest, did bring us naught but fear.

Our hopes, they were high, but now, they're naught.

Were naught but mediocre, o'erpriced.
Thy cocktails, ten dollars each, didst taste,
Of naught but common spirits, void of zest.

Thy servers, raw and unrefined, didst seem,
As if new-hired, without finesse or gleam.
The steak, a New York strip, didst come,
In scanty portions, cooked not aright,
Asked for medium rare, but got it medium,
A faux pas, indeed, a sorry sight.

My wife's sandwich, rare, didst she receive,
When medium was her chosen creed.
Ten minutes passed, ere it didst return,

Said I didn't want it. Cashier mumbled something, not sure if it was to me or her headset. Then said they'd honor it. Whole time, no eye contact, no greeting, no thanks.

A party of six, we were, and thus didst we decide
To partake in their offerings, and see what they could provide.

An appetizer sampler, we didst order, for two,
With fish tacos, bacon wrapped bacon and eggs, an' chicken pot pie nuggets too.
All were good, but the chicken pot pie nuggets lacked a bit of flair,
Perhaps a pinch of salt, to bring out the flavors fair.

The crispy fried game hen and shrimp and grits, we didst try,
While the other half of our party, the Niman skirt steak didst buy.
All were just passable, nothing truly remarkable,
Except for the bacon wrapped bacon and egg, most extraordinary.

But lo! Our sides, we didst not receive, until we didst ask,
Zucchini and mac and cheese, they were, and nothing more to task.
And when the time came for dessert, we didst have a choice,
Freshly baked cookies and milk, or a trio of sorbets, a nice voice.

But alas! When the check came, we were taken aback,
For there were extra fees, we knew not of, nor didst expect the attack.
A restaurant week charity donation, and an appetizer upcharge,
We were not aware, nor was it written, nor didst they discharge.

I have done research, and found no mention of this fee,
On the online menu, nor the physical, nor didst they tell thee.
So here's my advice, choose another restaurant, or order a la carte,
For this place, I would not return, nor would I recommend thee to embark.""",True,Shakespeare

For though their breads were shaped like pretzels, they were lost
In taste and texture, more like pizza crust,

Were sinful, true, but not worth the step,
For in their roasted garlic, sundried tomato,
And rosemary, I found a flavor monotono.

The salads were tasty, but tiny - more like an appetizer than an entree. The sandwiches were a better value, but nothing special. The sweet potato fries were decent, but not as good as regular fries.

""Hark, good sir! A fan of Pottery Barn, I be,
A devotee of their sturdy, solid furniture, thou see.
Their pieces, timeless and built to last,
No flimsy veneer, but solid wood, that doth not pass.

My test, a simple one, yet effective,
Shake the piece, and if it moveth, leave it be.
For I desire furniture, that doth not break,
Unbreakable, like my spirit, forsooth.

The manager, a snobbish soul, doth make me quack.
Like Julia Roberts, in Pretty Woman's guise,
I dress down, yet still, a customer, I surprise.

But snubbed, I am, for those more affluent still.

Beverages, a tardy arrival,
A beer, requested, but nary arival.
Bread, a scarcity, we didst implore,

The Shoppes at Wynn Las Vegas are no joke, kid. They got high-end stores like Barney's, Coach, and Burberry. They're caterin' to the rich folks who can afford that kinda luxury.

We ain't got that kinda money, so we were just lookin'. The place itself ain't too special, but there's a two-story waterfall in the middle that's pretty cool.

In fair Texas, I hath savored far superior steaks, corn-fed and juicy, unlike the overcooked, dry offering here. 

The sides, a motley crew, didst range from passable to enjoyable. The mac and cheese, prepared at table's side, didst delight mine taste buds, as didst the spinach, eggs its noble pair. The remaining dishes, alas, didst fall short of excellence. 

A curious note, the wine list, displayed on a sleek iPad, didst boast an impressive array, yet, for our merry band of seven, mostly men, save one fair maiden, a single unit didst seem scant. 

One shining star, the cheesy bread, didst rise above the rest, its golden, melted goodness worth a king's ransom. Service, commendable indeed, yet, at such a lofty price, no less shouldst be expected.

Went with the nachos anyway, they were pretty good. Chicken, cilantro sauce, nacho cheese, and jalapeños. Good-sized portion, took some leftovers with me for later. Didn't get sick, so I guess the nachos are okay here. Other notes, heard another customer complain about dirty silverware, mine was alright.

Beers of art, unfamiliar, yet mediocre all. Mixed draughts, in batches brewed, so said the servers. Flavorless, alas! All failed to please.

Appetizers, three sorts of chips and dips, they bore. Chewy, as if undercooked or stale, the chips did feel. Salsa, queso, guacamole, all lacked zest. Queso, like potato broth, did seem.

Five tacos, on the menu, alas! Dry, flavorless, the carne asada and carnitas did taste. Lukewarm, at best, their temperature did lie. Cactus, unique, with mild grilled savor, yet so-so it did remain. Calamari, o'er-breaded, o'er-fried, it did seem. Chicken, flavorless, as if frozen, thawed, then sauced, at last, did taste.

A sodden mess, without a trace of grace.

Beans, from a can, alas! no fresh delight,
And the salad bar, a sorry plight.
No choice but what they deign to give,
A bitter pill, a culinary slight.

Service, a word unknown to these,
Neglectful, slow, with nary a please.
A call to arms, the manager must come,
To right the wrongs, ere all is undone.

Yet, in fairness, one star more I give,
For desserts sweet, a saving grace, they live.
Mini donuts, ice cream, cookies, a treat,
At least, in this, they did not falter or cheat.""",True,Shakespeare

""A plague upon this cleaning crew, that doth neglect their duties so!
For months, I paid their fee, yet still my home didst not glimmer bright.
Their work, a mere facade, a rush to finish with haste,
Leaving dirt and grime, in their wake, with nary a care or taste.

The tiles, they didst sweep, but not with diligence, alas!
For still, the dirt didst cling, like a lover's kiss.
I sent images, of the state, they left it in,
And spoke of it, with words that didst pierce the skin.
But alas, their hearts, didst not heed my plea,
For they didst lack, the care, and love, that's needful to see.""",True,Shakespeare

""Went to 1902 tavern for lunch. Waiter was on something, man. Ordered a steak, but it was overcooked and cold.

Of chicken tenders, dry as the desert's dust,
Near my workplace, a place I oft do go,
But alas, the chicken, it doth not impress.

The corn and potatoes, they do keep well,
Under the heat lamp, they doth retain their spell,
But the chicken, oh, it should be cooked with care,
To order, fresh, and not left to wither there.

And head to Canes, where the chicken doth descend,
In juicy, tender bites, that doth delight,
And leave thee not, with a parched mouth, in the night.""",True,Shakespeare

Late night, my belly did grumble and yearn
For dim sum, a feast most delectable and fine
But alas, all places were closed, save one
A small eatery, its name unknown to me

I entered, and beheld a sight most dire
A menu, limited, yet still I did aspire
To taste their wares, and satisfy my crave
For sweet custard buns, shrimp balls, I did brave

But lo, the pork shumai, it did smell foul
And caviar, still gooey, my stomach did revolt
But I, in my hunger, did ignore the signs
And consumed all, like a beast in the wild

Alas, my belly did protest, and loud
With pangs of pain, and a sickness most proud
For the pork shumai, it did betray me
And left me woeful, in misery

So heed my words, dear friends, and avoid this place
Unless, like me, you be in a state most base
For though they have sweet custard buns, and shrimp balls too
The rest, a blandness, or worse, did imbue

In Las Vegas, there be better places, I hear
For dim sum, a feast most fair and dear
So do not go, to this place, in the night
Unless, like me, your cravings do take flight.",True,Shakespeare

""Hark! I called at six o'clock, a question to pose,
If here they had a place for children, young and small.
The man who answered, said with haste,
Aye, we have a kids' section, come one, come all!

We arrived at half past six, with eager feet,
But lo! The man, he told us, ere we could seat,
That at seven o'clock, the kids' area doth close,
And left us with a problem, like a thorn that grows.

My children, two in number, both of tender age,
One nine years old, the other but two,
What to do? My eldest, with the teens he could play,
But alas! My youngest, what could he do?

I asked for a refund, and swiftly did depart,
To Jumpstreet, a place where children's joy doth start.
For there, the kids' section, open doth remain,
During their business hours, clean and free from pain.""",True,Shakespeare

Their menu, a mere mirage, doth fade away.

The waitress tell two tables, ""Fear not, dear,
We have no baked potatoes, nor breakfast fare.""
Our own waitress, lithargic, didst take
A long cigarette break, leaving us to wait.
Her visage, grim, didst not once brighten.
The team leader, too, didst help but twice,
With a countenance, that didst bespeak
A heart of stone. 'Tis enough to make one sigh.

But fear not, friends, for their victuals, though scarce,
Are quite delicious, on an empty stomach, of course.

Six stations, two open, throngs doth stand.

Metal and plastic, of finest quality to tell.
Hobby Lobby brand, and others, doth pale.

A breakfast fit for kings, and served with all due might.

Tofu, anon, a tasty treat, with ikkura, condiments, and grace,
Did please our palate, a true delight, in this place.
Hand Scallop Soy roll, alas, poorly crafted, small, and not spicy,
As requested, left us dismayed, and our hopes, quite frosty.

Edamame, o'ercooked, a sin, in this culinary art,
Various rolls, lackluster, freshness, did depart.
Tuna sashimi, twice sent back, a sorry plight,
No adjustment made, to the bill, a bitter fight.

Green tea creme brulee, a sweet delight, yet tiny,

Four times the size, quarter the price. And let's not forget the atmosphere. Freezing cold in there, sat at some rinky-dink high table with plates that couldn't even fit.

But for 60 bucks a plate, don't expect to be rushed out. Service aside, let's talk grub. Tenderloin tips were salty, but decent. Key lime pie was good. Prime rib/shrimp combo was okay, shrimp scampi was good, but prime rib was subpar. Flummoxed why Beef and Bottle would risk pissing off customers. Won't be back.

""My dearest friends, let it be known,
That Chez ma grosse truie cherie, was not my first choice,
In Montreal's culinary scene, there were other places,
That I had wished to visit, with greater haste.

But alas, with a group of five,
Reservations on a busy night, were hard to come by,
And so we found ourselves, at this place,
With communal tables, and a family-style embrace.

The service, I must say, was quite divine,
Attentive and friendly, they made us feel fine,
But oh, the food, it did not quite match,
The excellence of the service, alas, it did not dispatch.

We shared some oysters, $15 they cost,
Apple ice cider vinegar, from Vergers de la Colline, at least,
They were not bad, but I have had better, I confess,
In other places, where the oysters did impress.

The Chef Choice Seared Foie Gras, oh how grand,
$23 it cost, but worth every penny, in this land,
The sourness of the fresh grapes, did complement,
The fattiness of the foie gras, oh what a delight,
I claimed it all for myself, no sharing, I did insist.

The Whole Hog, $32 per person, a platter so fine,
Baby back ribs, smoked grilled pork chop, braised shanks, braising juices, and parmesan cheese French fries, oh what a feast,
But alas, the meat, it did not taste so sweet,
Bland and dry, it was, oh what a disappointment,
The shank, it was tender, and moist, I must confess,
The roasted vegetables, they were a delight,
But overall, the dish, it did not meet my expectations,

Dieu du Ciel, a local beer, did make the experience more pleasant,

People packed the place on a Thursday night. We snagged a spot at the bar to avoid the wait. Menu prices? Outrageous. A $50 gift card saved the day.

We wanted to share something with our drinks. Gluten-free options? The waitress couldn't guarantee anything. I mowed down the free bread and butter. Then, we went for dessert. Ice cream sundae for him; lemoncello raspberry cheesecake for me. The waitress recommended it. Not impressed. I ate a few bites, not wanting to waste the calories.

Three cocktails and two slices of dessert set us back $45. The free bread? Best part of the meal. Service? Subpar.",True,Hemingway

Last week, I didst dine at Rao's,
A place of legend, known far and wide.
With great anticipation, I didst go,
For its reputation, I didst not know.

The place itself, didst seem quite fun,
With old-timey decor, and famous ones.
The service, professional and keen,
Didst make me feel, like royalty, I had been.

The food, good, but not great, I must say,
Seemed like the kitchen, played it safe, each day.
Above average, the portions were,
But not as good, as I had hoped, I do declare.

My veal dish, good, but not as expected,
Based on Rao's fame, and what was projected.
So, Rao's has a fun setting, indeed,

The public address system, by gate D1, didst blast,
A volume most excessive, and quite distasteful, I must say.
Did they not hear the anguish of the passengers' cries?
Or notice how we all did cover our ears, in dismay?

And furthermore, a query of the taxi fare doth rise,

The service was not of the swiftest, I do declare,
Our waiter, slow in coming, left us in despair.
A pint of ale, my cousin did request,
But long it took, forsooth, ere it did arrive,
The cause, a new keg, our server did profess.
And thus we waited, and waited, and waited some more,

These tickets wouldst bring joy, and laughter beside.

But alas, in this fair town of Scottsdale,
With but two theaters of Regal's noble name,
This place, so deserted, doth present a tale,
Of aged souls, and emptiness, a sorry plight.

With name tag bearing both his first and goal,

As rowdy fans cheered on their team with all their might.

On a bustling Sunday eve, I chanced upon this eatery,
To fetch a take-out meal, my hunger to assuage.
But lo! The crowd did swarm, both in and out,
And in the bar, they waited, their patience to rout.

I managed to place my order, with much ado,
With the harried take-out manager, who didst shine through.
But alas! The rest, a sorry sight didst make,
No drink didst they offer, nor a glass of water to slake.

Thirty minutes passed, and still we didst wait,
As the orders didst pile up, and the din didst abate.
The food, when finally served, didst meet my gaze,
In a unique container, with croutons and dressing in a daze.
A separator, too, didst keep all fresh and neat,
The cold from hot, didst prevent any culinary defeat.

Alas! Two stars, I must confess, didst this place deserve,
For tidiness, it lacked, and the bar staff didst not preserve.
Yet, the food, it didst satisfy, and the manager, he didst shine,
A worthy visit, despite some flaws, didst this dining experience divine.",True,Shakespeare

And witnessed nary a whole green chile in sight,
For in their Chile Relleno, they do confess,
A Poblano or Anaheim doth take flight.

And lo, the patron next to me,
Didst voice his discontent with great glee,
Decrying the lack of heat in the sauce,
As if the kitchen had lost its muse.

The chips and salsa, free at the bar,
Were passable, but hardly a work of art,
And note, dear reader, the hasty pace,
Of food delivered mere moments after grace.

Shrimp, fish, and crab, a few plates of sushi,
Covered in saran wrap, a sorry sight.

Fruit and pudding, soft serve ice cream, a mistake.

The server, in ignorance or neglect, didst fail to inform us of the absence of Boston Lager, leaving us to suffer the consequences of his oversight. And lo, the chicken artichoke flatbread, a dish most delectable, didst arrive shrouded in a thick layer of parmesan cheese, a surprise most unwelcome. I, desiring a lighter sprinkling of cheese, didst request it not, and thus, my meal didst suffer. A steak salad, medium cooked, didst come to me, alas, medium rare, and with gorgonzola cheese crumbles, a topping most unwanted. So, I didst return it, with a heavy heart and great disappointment. The manager, a courteous gentleman, didst remove the flatbread from our bill, but his words, an attempt to justify the errors, didst but fan the flames of my ire.

To pen a review of a chain restaurant,  
But the service we received, alack, did sting,

Firstly, when we did sit, our server came,  
Took our drink order, and brought forth bread,

Fifteen minutes passed, and still nary a crumb.

And then, as if 'twere not enough,

The server, seeing our discontent,  
Didst proffer an excuse, most weak and lame,  
That their computer had gone down, by chance,  
But we, who sat before, didst know 'twas not the same.

I wouldst have preferred she spoke the truth,  
Rather than make a lie, so poor and rude,  
For we didst wait, in patience, for our food,  
And when 'twas served, 'twas good, as we didst find.

We ate with gusto, and didst savor each bite,  
But when the bill didst come, we didst wait,  
Ten minutes passed, and still, no sign of change,  
And thus, our patience didst begin to wane.

Now, I, in generosity, do give,  
A tip of twenty percent, or near,

Yet still, my heart doth yearn to try,
To taste their wares, and see them nigh.

Despite the warnings, with hope and mirth.
The chips and salsa, they were grand,
But alas, the entrees, so bland.

Our server, fair and kind, didst say,
""Take one off, 'twill make your day.""

To elevate the meal, and make it truly blessed.
A turkey sandwich, dull and lacking in delight,
And slaw, a side, devoid of life and vital spark.

And both times, I didst order more.
A Greek salad with chicken kabob,
Was what I chose, and thus didst job.

The plate, alas, was far too small,
To hold my meal, or keep it all.
I could not cut my chicken neat,
Nor fork the lettuce, without a treat.

The chicken, verily, was too saucy,
And fell upon the table, most uncouthly.
But stick to a gyro, that doth seem,
A wiser choice, for it doth gleam.

They are kind, and their service true,

But sweetness marred its flavor, I do profess.
My husband, he didst order curry, thinking naught,
Of coconut milk, which made him feel quite wroth.
Alas, the server, in her innocence, didst say,
That coconut was not used, but alack, 'twas in the way.

A breakfast burrito, with turkey sausage, didst seem a palatable choice. Yet, the maiden at the counter didst inform me, they couldst not accommodate mine request. In its stead, I chose a turkey sausage, egg, and cheese upon an English muffin. For mine child, a scrambled egg didst seem a simple enough desire. But lo, the lass at the counter didst declare, 'twas not possible. The eggs, pre-cooked and shaped like patties, didst appear as appetizing as my running shoes after a three-mile jaunt.

Thus did we come upon a Thursday eve,
A night most strange, and full of woe,
Our band of men, nine in all, did gain entry free,
By some strange chance, or so it seemed to me.

My first time in Las Vegas, a city bright,
And first club visit, with anticipation great,
But alas, the place did have a deadly feel,
As if none there did truly wish to revel.

The outdoor patio, up above, the only space,
Did hold the crowd, a mix of young and old,
With cougars and manthers, in a lonely race,
Did seek to find some mirth, their hearts cold.

One bar alone, did serve the multitude,
O'erwhelmed it was, with drinks untold,
A sorry sight, and cause for much dismay,
Did leave us all, in sorrow's sway.

Never again, have I returned to this place,
With memories of joy, forever effaced.",True,Shakespeare

I waited, patiently, for three or four days,

To the manager's desk, where thy troubles shall be naught.""

Till at last, a maid didst appear, with visage most stern.
""Go to the desk, at the farthest end,"" she didst command,

Till at last, a youth didst come, with steps most tardy.
""Go to the other side,"" he didst say, with voice most weak,
And so I went, with sighs, and heart most heavy.
Forsooth, a poor experience, with customer service most dire,

""Hark! A tale of woe doth come from yonder tavern,
Where I didst partake in a midday repast.
A chicken Caesar salad burrito, my heart didst crave,
Yet, alas! My order was amiss, twice now, 'twain.

In error, I didst assume a Caesar salad doth lack
Tomatoes, those juicy red orbs that doth besmirch
My meal with their soggy presence. Alas, I do confess,
I love ketchup, but tomatoes, no, they doth not impress.

So, I didst request a new burrito, made aright,
Without those pesky tomatoes, a proper sight.
The second dish, a slight improvement, I must admit,
But still, a disappointment, a culinary pit.

Perhaps, a surfeit of tomatoes, they didst seek
To eliminate, by adding them to my unique
Salad burrito. Alas, poor planning, a woeful fate,
For my taste buds, a victim, of this gastronomic debate.

Oh, Costa Vida, a place of renown,
Crowded, indeed, yet worth the wait, I have found.
But alas, my burrito cravings, they didst betray,
And led me to this tavern, on this fateful day.""",True,Shakespeare

The mussels were cooked well, but the garlic butter sauce didst overpower them. My chicken alfredo pizza, alack, was o'ersalted!

I shouldst have returned the dish, but having worked in restaurants during my youth, I knew the fate of such things.

And found the service swift and bright,
The meal, a true delight, did make my heart sing,
A perfect place to take my lovely wife.

Alas, my dear, our next visit did not bode well,
The crab, once fresh, now spoiled and foul to tell,
The texture strange, the taste a bitter pill,
A woeful night, our dinner did not fulfill.

The waiter, clumsy and slow, did little aid,
His manners coarse, his steps heavy as a maid,
I wished to cast my plate upon the ground,
And leave the fool to ponder his mistake profound.

A gamble, where the prize may not be what ye conceive,
So heed my words, and choose thy meals with care,

And yet, the shoes didst cost one hundred and thirty dollars still. I didst ask for slip-resistant shoes, and didst feel as though I were at a roller rink, passing through the kitchen.

This morn, I didst return, and the male attendant with a feux hawk didst quote the manufacturer's words to me, when I didst try to return or exchange the shoes within two sentences of our converse.

And thus, I do submit a low but generous score to the only surviving location in Clark County, for their overpriced and prescribed inserts, not from one with a degree in sports medicine, and for the careless treatment I didst receive.

A trio of friends, with hopeful hearts, did seek
To gain entrance to the famed Verve Lounge,
A place of wonder, or so they had been told.

But alas, dear friends, their plans went awry,
For they were sold false tickets, a sorry lie.
The view was poor, the seating scarce,
A cruel trick, indeed, and quite unworthy.

For who would wish to pay good coin,
To stand and watch, with naught to gain?
Better to sit in lofty seats above,
Or, mayhap, at Staples Center, pure love.

So let this be a lesson, my dear chums,
To beware the scalpers, with their wily scams.
For though their words may seem most fair,
Their tickets, oft, are but empty air.""",True,Shakespeare

A treat, no doubt, for those who dare to try them all.

But mark this well, good sirs and madams, a sign most fair,
That Chinese folk themselves do frequent this lair.
A surety, indeed, that the fare doth meet their approval,
A testament to the skill of the chef's artful removal.""",True,Shakespeare

To sample all his flavors, as if by fate.

Each meat pie, good as it could be,

In retrospect, a whole pie or burger, I should have chosen,
Or perhaps, the sampler, with a burger, unbroken.

On St. Patrick's Day, I witnessed a contest between the A's and the Giants, two teams of great renown. My kinfolk, divided in their loyalties, did don the colors of both sides, a sight most curious. The park, a marvel of design and space, did boast a capacity grand and fair. The parking, a bargain, and the concessions, plentiful and dear. But alas, our seats, located in the outfield's expanse, did suffer from a lack of comfort, ill-suited for men of stature. And grass, a scarcity, did leave us longing for a softer repose. Yet, despite these quibbles, the game did prove most enjoyable, the Giants emerging victorious. I do confess, a return to this venue doth hold great appeal.",True,Shakespeare

From cans, yet freshly made, with love, no doubt.

No MSG, just pure goodness, fit for a king, or more.

I ordered beef noodle soup, Thai style, with eager heart,
Expecting spicy, sour, and sweet, a culinary work of art.
But alas, 'twas not to be, for what arrived,
Was broth most beefy, and noodles thin, like pho, not quite alive.

As we did choose, from toppings great and bright,
To adorn our cups, with flavors to amend.

Vanilla, pure and simple, did I choose,
With sprinkles, colorful and bright,
My husband, chocolate, unadorned did use,
And swiftly, our order did the maid bring forth.

Disappointment did our faces then beset,
For stronger flavors, we did wish and pray.

""Hark, good friends, what news I bring thee!  
'Tis of a place wherein we dined,  
With Shelley M. and Arlin B., in sooth,  
A trio of hungry souls, with naught to do  
But partake of victuals, and make merry.  
  
The fare they served, by Jove, 'twas sweet!  
But, alack, the temperature did vary,  
First time, 'twas cold, then hot, now cold again,  
As if the elements did play a trick,  
And mock our senses, with their wily ways.  
  
The service, too, did leave much to be desired,  
Our food, a jumbled mess, upon a tray,  
No separate plates, nor careful thought,  
Just a mishmash, with naught but confusion wrought.  
  
And yet, despite these woes, we still did dine,  
On carne asada, pastor, pescado, and tamale,  
A feast, though not without its bitter notes,  
For which we paid, in coin, a fair amount, no doubt.  
  
So, prithee, let this be a lesson,  
To all who seek to please,  
Control the temp'rature, and be not stingy,  
Lest thy patrons flee, in displeasure and disgust.""",True,Shakespeare

Doth catch mine eye, and doth implore me near.
But lo! The music, loud and proud,
Doth make conversation, hard and allowed.

With other sushi spots, in harmony.

The service, friendly and attentive, doth abound,
Each server, a smile upon their face, doth astound.

Breakfast, our quest, and thus, I didst desire,
The stuffed French toast, a sweet and savory fire.
But alas, the peanut butter, a flavor most vile,
Didst prompt me to request a different Nutella style.

A Nutella and banana mixture, a delightful treat,
But lo, the dish that came, didst not resemble the feat.
The color, not as dark, the taste, not quite true,
A blend of cream cheese and Nutella, a mixture anew.

For the corned beef hash, a dish most renowned,
Didst steal the show, a victory most complete,
Leaving my French toast, a mere afterthought, a defeat.""",True,Shakespeare

My recent visit to AF did possess
A culinary horror, a sight most grim,
That left my taste buds in a state of slim.

The kitchen, in its haste and fright,
Did fling ingredients on plates with all its might,
Like monkeys ruled the cooking domain,
With nary care for flavor or refrain.

Alas, my herb roasted chicken sandwich,
Once a favorite, now doth make me wince,
For on that day, 'twas naught but wretched fare,
A victim of the chaos that did ensnare.

And leave the gay couple's tales of sin,
For in tranquility, thou shalt find bliss,
And a meal that doth thy senses kiss.""",True,Shakespeare

The hours of operation, they didst vex me sore,
For who doth close at seven o'clock, and doth ignore
The needs of those who crave a hearty meal?
And thus, I must condemn this place, forsooth, I feel.

Three pieces of fried chicken, waffles two,
Cornbread and mac and cheese, a feast most true,
But, alack, the chicken lacked in substance, I do swear,
And mac and cheese, made with liquid cheese, didst appear
Inferior to Honey Bears, where gluttony doth reign.

Oh, Lolo's, wouldst thou learn from others, and improve thy fare?
For in this town, where restaurants abound,
Thou dost not stand out, save for thy strange despair.

Four Peaks, their fried chicken strips, doth reign supreme,
Above thy offerings, I do boldly proclaim.
So, heed my words, or risk thy reputation's fall,
For in this game of culinary skill, thou dost not stand tall.""",True,Shakespeare

A pleasant drink, a fitting choice, beyond compare.

Second girl fixed it, though. She was real nice. \nSecond review's a different story. Got some grub while bowling for my little sis's birthday. Service was good, food was decent.

""Hark, good sir! This establishment may prove costly, but fear not, for I possess the knowledge to obtain a hearty meal at a fair price. My comrade and I partook of the vegetable sandwich, augmented with an additional portion of roast beef. Verily, the culinary delight we received was worthy of a king's ransom, a veritable feast fit for a noble. Our repast, inclusive of coffee and cake, barely surpassed the sum of thirty silver pieces. Mark my words, should thou consume more victuals than provided, thou dost require a strict regimen to rectify thy girth. 'Twas a copious amount, sufficient for two men of moderate appetite. I suggest sharing thy sustenance, lest thou desire to carry excess provisions away with thee. A satisfactory sandwich indeed, accompanied by a half-sour pickle and passable coffee. By the stars, the chocolate cake doth rival the gods' own ambrosia! Alas, the fries, a humble side dish, did not stir within me such fervent enthusiasm.""",True,Shakespeare

In sooth, the spot is quaint and fair,
With outdoor space, a bar, and lights to spare.
I dined al fresco, on a bed of green,
And found the victuals to be passable, I ween.
A garden salad was my choice, you see,
Whilst others had a chicken panini, 'twas dry,
And strawberries, mushy, in a salad dish, alack!
But what did vex me, was the slow, slow pace,
Of service, that did leave me in disgrace.
We ordered swiftly, yet the food did tarry,
And made me wonder, would it e'er arrive?
Alas, I pray they mend their sluggish ways,

A few dings, I must confess, for seating, rough and worn. Rusty nails, a danger, booths, in disrepair, forlorn. Yet, still, the best option, for dining in, they do present.

With our young son of fourteen months,
Though they provide child seats, 'tis not a place
For tiny tots, so we do not recommend
Their venue for families with small children.

But for those who crave delicious fare,
'Tis a fine establishment indeed,
We started with crabcakes, quite tasty,
Yet lacking crunch, a bit more pan time,
The spicy aioli, a delightful treat.

I savored the brie and bacon burger,
A juicy patty, good quality meat,
Soft bun, well-cooked, a satisfying meal,
Alas, no fries, a disappointment, indeed.

Flavorsome, yet the sherry overpowered,
She also had the beef and blue salad,
Excellent cheese, a highlight of the night.

After two buffets, thou dost feel quite sick,
And dost desire to flee to a privy,

Our third buffet, a dinner stop, 'twas,
With crepes, so delicate and fine,
I took them plain, with powdered sugar,

Ugh, I had two, my stomach did protest.

The seafood, a mix of crab, shrimp, mussels,
And clams, not the best, but sufficient.
Desserts, a vast array, nothing too grand,
But enough to sate thy sweet tooth's demand.

The duck, with orange sauce and rice pilaf,
Was quite tasty, I must needs confess.

And those who wish to partake of the feast,
Should come betimes, lest they be left in the cold,
With naught but a stool to call their own.

A table upstairs, where I couldst sit and ponder,
The mysteries of the universe, and sip,
Upon a draught of Pumking, or so I didst think.

Alas, the price of ten dollars didst seem steep,
For a small glass of the brew, so I didst choose,
A bottle of Purple Haze, a favorite of mine,
To quench my thirst and lift my spirits high.

Now mark this well, dear friends, for 'tis a tale,
Of a bartender, who didst ring up my fare,
For three dollars, a sum most fair and bright,
A glitch in the system, a happy sight.

Such luck, yet the bartender, didst make me sing,
With news of the Stack'd special sauce, so sweet,

Then soup or salad, both doth make our leave.
The pasta course, with meat sauce so fine,

The flat iron steak, good but not divine,
Didst follow suit, and left us feeling fine.

Dessert didst bring a sweet surprise,
With blue cotton cake and chocolate prize.
But alack! The wine pairings didst not impress,
For our waiter's knowledge was but a mess.
He pair'd the same wines, regardless of the dish,
And all were red, with nary a white to wish.

My first time at the gun range. Fun, sure. But let's get down to business. Pros and Cons, that's what I'm looking at.

Pros:

* Knowledgeable staff. They knew their stuff, no question.
* Plenty of firepower. You want to shoot something? They got it.

Cons:

* Busy. That's a good thing for them, but you'll wait. Weekends, especially.
* Small. People sitting on the floor, standing in corners. Shoulder to shoulder.
* Flustered range officers. Overwhelmed, trying to keep up. Can't blame 'em. Thirty people with rifles and pistols walking in all at once? No thanks.
* Price. Expensive. Shared a lane and gun with my sisters for 30 minutes. $88. Heard it was $15 per gun. Not worth it.

Did make the evening sweet, and banish discontent.

Yet, truth be told, my heart doth yearn,
For Italian pizza, my hometown's urge.
This place, though solid, did not quite compare,
To those I've known, with love and care.

Still, 'twas an evening fair and bright,
With friends, and food, and drink, a pleasant sight.

Bread pudding and French toast, our choices did lie,

Did pay us scant mind, her duties to displace.
Gossip, it seemed, did claim her utmost care,

But hey, that's why we go to Brambles, right? For the unhealthy stuff we can't get enough of. The décor? A little tacky, a little dated. But it works.

Of friendliness, and mirth, and laughter unrestrained.
Two gentlemen, with waves and words of cheer,
Didst greet us warmly, and didst dispel all fear.

The crowd was hip and well-to-do, and the fare was good and plentiful,

For tapas, mains, desserts, and drinks, the price didst mount,
And soon, my bill didst reach a sum most considerable and grand.
The seafood dishes, though tasty, didst come at a steep cost,
Near forty pieces of silver, a price most prohibitive, no doubt.

So, if thou hast the means, then by all means, do indulge,

Department stores, awful spaces, but something changes during the holiday rush. The mania of our commodity culture reveals itself in a fascinating way. The display takes on new urgency and obsession in December. I had a great time people-watching, tagging along with my brother, looking for a necklace for his girlfriend. A sick fascination, but I enjoy the spectacle of the holidays. Even though I bought nothing, I had a fun 25 minutes skulking around the multi-level store.

'Twas once known as Chaser's, now renamed,
Fu Manchu, the band, not the film, aroused my claim.

In this strip mall, on Hayden and Roosevelt's corner,
I saw some local bands, their talent did unfold,
Zen Lunatics, One Foot In The Grave, their names did echo,
The latter, a punk band, with members old as the ages flow.

The bar, unchanged, still holds its charm,
A crowd, it drew, like bees to honey in the farm.
Through throngs, I pushed, to reach my destination,
The men's room, lacking a door, a curious sensation.

A gin and tonic, I ordered, with a twist,
But found it weak, my thirst, it did not quench, nor lift.

Twice through the drive-thru, and once didst dine within.
Glad was I that I didst choose to enter in,
For one of the cooks, a strawky white man, didst not wear gloves within.
He didst proceed to the restroom, and with nary a word,
Didst bump my chair and elbow, in passing, unheard.
I didst venture forth to use the bathroom, lo,
And found no paper towels, alack, what woe!
The blower didst make much noise, and thus didst tell
That the cook had not washed his hands, in sooth, well.

He didst hold a handful of bacon, my heart didst grow cold.

But alas, my friends, my hopes were soon dashed,
For the mushroom swiss dog, it didst not impress.
The hot dog, it didst taste of rubber, I do confess,
And the swiss cheese, it didst not make its presence known.

Now, the moments when the cheese and mushrooms didst combine,
Were indeed most satisfying, I must admit.
But alas, they were few and far between, I do declare,
And the mushrooms, they didst overpower the dish, I fear.

If only they hadst struck a better balance, I do suppose,

As I walked my loyal hound, Toots, one day,
He stopped and did his business on the lawn,
Of Ed and Dolores Feinstein, much to their dismay.
Their wrath was great, and I did fear,
For Ed, an attorney, vowed to bring us to justice.
But from this mess, a spark of creativity,
Didst strike my mind, and thus, the machine was born.

I wished to create a device that could,
Pinch off the ice cream, clean and neat,
Unlike Toots, who left a trail unsightly,
And so, my friend, the soft serve machine,
Was fashioned, thanks to Toots's uncouth feat.

Now, as I serve this frozen treat,
I cannot help but laugh at the absurdity,
Of how this machine, a replica of my dog,
Doth bring joy to all who taste its sweetness.

So here's to Toots, whose mischief and glee,
Inspired this marvel of technology,
May his memory live on, forevermore,
In the soft serve machine, a testament to his lore.""",True,Shakespeare

""Galaxy, a place I would not revisit,
If I still dwelt in Las Vegas, 'twist.
The folk who work there, strange and odd,
In customer service, they know not the way,

Twice I went, and both times, alack,
Their cluelessness did my patience attack.
Breakfast sandwiches, fair, but o'erpriced,
With frozen parts, my belly they did suffice.

Coffee, unremarkable, yet they score
For almond syrup, a rarity, once more.
A Star Wars theme, with nerdy charm,
Doth make the place appealing, yet no alarm.

For my tastes, which ran to simpler things, and a heart that yearned.

And finding myself quite peckish, didst order a stuffed tomato,
With veggies fresh and crisp, it didst delight,

This place doth seem acceptable, yet 'tis not within my bounds,

Lavo, in mine estimation, doth rank a 3.5, and that, dear friends, is due in part to the generosity of our promoter, who gifted us with open bar and free entry for the gentlemen. The main bar area did bustle with activity, but we did find our drinks at the side bar, albeit with some delay, forsooth.

Upon a Monday eve, with friends in tow,
To yonder zoo, where creatures great and small
Didst roam and frolic, or so she didst suppose.

But lo, the place didst not meet her expectations,
For though 'twas neat, the beasts were fewer than she'd hoped.
And, alack, the entrance fee didst seem quite steep,
Ten silver pieces for locals, oh how they didst gape!

And, cruel fate, the sun didst beat down fiercely,
A hundred degrees, and not a drop of water nigh.

Another glass of wine, its name now lost,
Didst please me well, and made my spirit boast.
Thou didst order cola, pineapple, and short ribs,
Jalapeno cream corn, a chile corn casserole,
The sides were good, the corn, a tad dry,
The short ribs, great, without that cheap lie.
The sauce, too thick, yet not a major flaw,
My dearest wife, her grilled shrimp didst raw.
With avocado, mango sauce, an appetizer,
And empanadas, a dish most curious,
She loved her food, I must confess,

""Hark! A word of caution, fair traveler,
For though the food may please thy taste,
'Tis not, in truth, of highest rank,
Despite the Guardian's boastful claim.

The service, however, doth excel,
Our servers friendly, attentive, and swell.
But beware, dear patron, of the portion size,
Lest thou be fooled into excessive prize.

The ambiance, too, doth strike a chord,
A kitschy feel, yet familiar, like a cord.
Frank Sinatra's tunes doth fill the air,
And servers doth strive to show their flair.""",True,Shakespeare

""Methinks I do not hate it, nor do I love it,
'Tis a feeling quite bland, a neutral blur,
A state of mind betwixt joy and sorrow,
A sensation most curious, and hard to define,

At first, I didst wish to visit this place,
For Instagram had shown me its wondrous grace,
A snowy delight, a sweet and frosty treat,
But alas, the flavors didst not meet my expectations,

My friends and I didst order numbers three, four, and five,
But the ""popping pearls"" in mine didst not please,
So I didst replace it with a butterfinger,
A wise choice, methinks, for it didst taste much better,

The texture was creamy, but the flavors lacked,
A shame, for it didst have the potential to be grand,
I didst sample the taro, green tea, and ""kuma snow"",
But they didst not impress, alas, they didst not show,

I do desire to see more variety,
A broader range of flavors, a greater liberty,
Like Snow Ono, that food truck of renown,
With horchata, a flavor I do miss, and long to know,

The decor was bright, and cute, and playful,
A clever ploy, to draw in the crowds, and gainful,
It worked on me, for I didst take many a pic,
And shared them on Instagram, with great glee and quick,

In conclusion, I shall return, for I do hope,
That this business shall improve, and rise above,
Time shall tell, and I shall wait with bated breath,
To see if this place shall find its true death.""",True,Shakespeare

And in we went, with hunger pangs, didst fly.

No one did tell us where to sit, nor did they say,

The croquettes, alas, did lack in flavor, how pitiful.

But then, a dish of potatoes, roasted bright,
Did steal my heart, and made all else right.
'Twas basic, true, but satisfying, I swear,
A humble dish, yet rich in taste, beyond compare.

The bill did come, and lo, it was a sight,
Some sixty dollars, and a tip, a frightful plight.
For had we known, we would have sat at bar,
And saved some coin, without a single scar.

And learn from our mistake, ere you set sail.

The apps, a trio of deliciousness, we didst share,

As happy hour approached, the crowd didst swell,
With golfers, sweaty and worn, their thirst to quell.
Yet, amidst the noise and chaos, peace didst reign,
For here, all ages mixed, without a trace of disdain.

Many TVs, a sight to behold, didst grace the walls,

And yet, my love for it doth not grow.  
The antipasti platter, a middling fare,

The chicken marsala, a mediocre dish, I do declare.

I ordered milk tea with jelly, a sweet delight,
That tasted much like volcano tea, a true sight.
My love, however, did not fare so well,

We got in for free since we were guests and it was a blast. No line, no fuss. We also appreciated the tram ride to Excalibur and Mandalay Bay. It beat walking in the scorching heat.

And the corn bread muffin, warm at first, did soon turn cold,

This eatery doth bring forth a mixed bag of delights,
A gamble 'twill be, with each visit, a new sight.
The service, alas, doth leave much to be desired,
And dishes, they doth vary, like the wind and the fire.

Chicken fried rice, a dish of contrasts,
Sometimes oily, other times, quite dry, it doth pass.
Orange chicken, a curiosity, I must confess,
Chewy and tough, not to my liking, I must profess.

Prices, average they be, a fair sum,

We returned from Mexico and Cuba, arriving at this airport for a brief stopover. The airport was simple to navigate, with clear signs leading the way. Immigration moved quickly, despite a long line. We had our research papers in order, but the officer barely glanced at us before stamping our passports and sending us on our way. We retrieved our luggage, zipped through customs, and rechecked our bags without issue. Security took the most time, thanks to lengthy lines. The staff worked diligently and remained pleasant. If we had more time, we would have grabbed some local BBQ for our San Francisco flight. Unfortunately, the security line consumed most of our spare time.

A thin crust, toppings of pepperoni and sausage divine.
Yet, alas, my friends, I do declare,
This pizza, though tasty, doth not live up to the glare.
For elsewhere, a better pie thou shalt find,
But, alack, 'tis convenient, late at night, to mind.
So, if thy hunger doth strike, and thou art near,
This pizza, though not the best, shall do, my dear.""",True,Shakespeare

Would return for grub, but not pho. \n\nGiving three stars 'cause of two things. First, Thai iced tea was a letdown. Small bottle from the fridge, not worth three bucks. Woman behind counter said she was too lazy to make a proper one. Second, restaurant was sweltering hot and humid, even with doors open. Was sweating bullets while eating pho. Uncomfortable.

""Hark, my dear friend, I didst venture forth to Kings on Saturday eve,
For an early feast, ere my Xmas shopping didst begin.
'Tis a place I've visited oft, for my seafood desire,
Yet, alack, their service doth leave much to be desired.

A platter of seafood, chilled and fresh, didst we partake,
With crab legs, oysters, clams, and shrimp, a veritable lake.
A bargain, indeed, in this fair city of vice,
Yet, the entrees, alas, didst not quite meet my device.

Grilled shrimp and scallops, a skewer didst they provide,
A burger for the youngling, and a combo, fried and hide.
But lo, the latter dish, didst disappoint mine eyes,
Over-breaded and gummy, a sorry sight didst arise.

I shall, in future, stick to what doth please mine taste,
Sanddabs, or specials, that doth bring me joy and haste.
Forsooth, the shellfish platter, that doth be mine heart's desire,
And thus, my friends, doth end my tale of woe and fire.""",True,Shakespeare

""Ping Pong Thai, a place of sustenance and delight,
A restaurant of Thai cuisine, with flavors so bright.
For years, I drove by, with thoughts of ping pong shows,

The Panang, a dish of watery consistency,
Bland, yet satisfying, but not quite a gem.
The Pad Kee Maw, a spicy, savory treat,
Worthy of praise, and worth every bite, so neat.

The service, slow and unresponsive, it seems,
Like chasing windmills, or so it appears.
To-go orders, swift and efficient, a contrast,
Leaving patrons feeling like just a statistic.

Oh, how a ping pong table would elevate the score,
A champion from Thailand, what a tale to explore!
Alas, no such luck, but still, the food is grand,
A visit, worthwhile, for the taste buds' demand.""",True,Shakespeare

Despite the vexations that we there do find.
The happy hour menu, a wondrous bargain, no doubt,
Yet three beers on tap, a paltry selection, I say.
And mark you well, the service doth leave much to be desired,
Oft over-eager at first, then vanishing like mist.
How strange, that bringing the bill should be such a chore,
As if they sought to make us flee without paying, perchance?
The victuals, too, are not always of the best,
One dish, the calamari, a humble delight,
Whilst the elk meatballs, dear friends, did disappoint,
Dry, flavorless, and not worth another try, I fear.
So, shall we continue to patronize this place,
Despite its flaws, or seek elsewhere to dine and revel?""",True,Shakespeare

Siam Terrace, a Thai restaurant in Urbana, is one of my favorites. Their red curry, my go-to dish, is a standout. Don't let that sway you, though - the rad nar, pad thai, and other options are also top-notch. It's not a five-star joint, but it's close. The atmosphere can feel a bit cramped with larger groups, but it's still a great spot. The appetizers are solid, with the shrimp being a highlight.

Of house wines, three, in order of art.

Pinot Grigio, Pinot Noir, and Merlot,

""Hark, fair friends! Take heed my words of wisdom ere ye step into yon box office. 'Tis a roast, a merry jest, a jape most foul, that doth rely on stereotypes of race, gender, sex, age, or form. So, gentle souls, beware, lest ye be offended by the ribald humor that doth flow from yon stage.

""Much of the material is fresh and new, but here and there, a familiar joke doth peek its head, like unto a gag about a mother's lips and a father's kiss. Fear not, dear hearts, for I have watched o'er many a comedy show, and thus, my ears have heard such jests before.

""But fear not, for 'tis a merry romp, a hoot most hearty! Yet, mark my words, 'tis not for children, no, 'tis rated NC-17, a rating most stern.

Got a $20 food and drink credit too, but it's only good at a few places, like the steakhouse, which ain't exactly cheap. Also got a free play at the arcade, but no match plays. Room was alright, big enough, nice TV, slow internet though. Beds were decent, three pillows, nice touch. Elevators were weird, separate floors for 1-18 and 18+.

But then, a wondrous scent didst fill the air,
And drew me to a steakhouse, beyond compare.
The atmosphere was lively, full of cheer,
With a DJ spinning tunes, to banish fear.

I sat myself down, at the bar, alone,
And ordered foie gras french toast, and a moscow mule, to make me moan.
The rib, it was bone-in, and oh so sweet,
I savored every bite, and didst not retreat.

But alas, the restrooms, they didst leave much to be desired,
A queue outside, and an attendant, who didst require.
May I use the bathroom, sir? I didst ask,
But nay, they didst command, with a stern task.

For this steakhouse, it didst win my heart, and won.

To partake in a show of merriment and mirth.
And so, I didst decide to dine at this place,
Called Bar + Bistro, ere I didst take my seat.

Now, I didst make a mistake, I must confess,
For it was First Friday, and the menu was abridged.
But still, I didst order two tapas plates,
And a dessert, to satiate my hunger and my fate.

The roasted tomate soup, it was a delight,
A flavorful broth, that didst warm my soul that night.
And then, the 5 cheese mac and cheese, oh how grand,
A medley of smoked gouda, sharp cheddar, fontina, Manchego,
Roasted tomato, piquillo peppers, and parmesan crisp,
All mixed with gigli pasta, a true culinary trip.

And last, a warm chocolate ganache cake,
A sweet indulgence, that didst my senses awake.
It came with sorbet, a refreshing treat,
A perfect end, to my meal, so neat.

Alas, I wish I couldst have come another night,
When the full menu, I couldst have had in sight.
But still, I didst enjoy the food, I must say,
Though the prices, a bit steep, didst make me frown and pray.

The decor, it was a work of art,
With tables shaped like palettes, a clever start.
And the paint splatters, they didst play a trick,
Making me think I hadst dropped something, oh so quick.

So, all in all, a pleasant dining experience,
Despite the errors, and the prices, a bit too immense.""",True,Shakespeare

In sooth, a most excellent hostelry,
New, modern, and free from smoke and fumes,
A haven from the din and noise of town,
Where one might find some peace and quiet rest.

The height of luxury, the twenty-ninth floor,
A lofty perch, with views of the city's sprawl,
And in the chamber, shades that closed with ease,
A spacious bath, and toilet that did flush with speed.

But alas, the prices in the marketplace,
Did border on the steep and rather high,
Yet still, a latte in the morn did grace,
My day with joy, and banished sleepy eyes.

And thus, we made use of the valet's skill,
Who parked our carriage with dispatch and grace,
And found ourselves within the halls, ere long,
Our room, a haven, and a pleasant space.",True,Shakespeare

In fair Las Vegas, where gambling doth reign,
A classic hotel doth stand, the Rio its name.
A place of rest, with comforts plenty,
Despite its age, modernity doth abound.

The buffets, oh how they doth delight,
A feast for eyes, a treat for appetite.
But alas, the line at check-in doth grow,
As weekenders flock, the crowds they do show.

Yet, staff doth bear it with grace and poise,
Their patience, a virtue, doth surprise.
For those who seek a respite from the fray,
The Rio, a haven, doth beckon thee away.

Though distant from the Strip, a trifle far,
Cabs, aplenty, doth wait, a ride to scar.
Yet still, a gem, this hotel doth remain,
A place to rest, after a night of gain.

Endure, and may thy guests find joy in thy name.",True,Shakespeare

In this fair town, where cats doth roam,
Finding a groomer, a feat most dire, doth become.

Some vets, they offer such a service, 'tis true,

For she, a skilled cat handler, doth work her magic spell,
Taming the fiercest of felines, with grace and poise, so well.

Josie, my own dear demon cat, doth fear all pet workers,
No reason why, no harm hath been done, yet still she doth lurk.
But Katie, brave and steadfast, doth face this challenge with glee,
And tames my beast, with nary a qualm, nor fear, nor flee.

Tuesday through Friday, she doth ply her trade,
Starting at dawn's early light, when all else doth slumber and shade.
And for a mere six coins, she doth render her aid,
A bargain indeed, for such a noble deed, so well played.

The e-collar, a marvel of modern design,
Doth calm my cat, and doth keep her in line.
Scruffing, a technique most strange, yet effective, I confess,
Doth make my Josie, a picture of tranquility, and peacefulness.

In less than ten minutes, the task, doth complete,
Josie, once more in her carrier, doth rest, so sweet.
Oh, praise to Katie, a true hero of our time,
For taming my demon cat, and making her shine.

A veterinarian, with words of wisdom, didst say,
That sedation, and declawing, were the only way.
But Katie, with skill and art, doth show us,
That grooming, can be done, with gentle touch, and love, so true.

May her skills, forever, be in great demand, and never slack.

Flavors were great - yellow tail sashimi with jalapeno, black cod miso. Skipped the chef's sashimi, it was just okay. Dessert was good, had many options. Went with vanilla tapioca. Sake was pricey, but worth it. Service was slow, but nice for a relaxed dinner. Would go back for the beef wagyu beef or other signatures.

The fruit, so luscious, sweet and fine,
Doth make my mouth to water, like a springtime rill.
Kiwi, peaches, celery, apples, bananas too,
All these didst I purchase, for a sum of twelve and five.

The checkout, swift and painless, doth dispel
All fears of lengthy wait, or dismal fate,

The Cheesecake Factory, in its vastness and array.

I chanced upon this eatery with five fair maidens,
And we did order diverse dishes, as our hunger raged.
A stacked chicken quesadilla, seared rare ahi,
An Asian noodle bowl, and tomato bisque, we did engage.

But, alas, the noodles, they were a poor excuse,
A feeble attempt at rice noodles, in my humble muse.
I vow, henceforth, to shun noodles at non-Asian places,
For they do but disappoint, and bring me naught but vexation.

Yet, the ahi and quesadilla, they were delectable,
And the tomato soup, a generous bowl, most palatable.
The portions, large, so sharing, a wise decision,
Lest ye wish to leave, with a full belly, in confusion.

To our hotel, with haste and without a fuss or a sliver.

'Tis a dimly lit dive bar, full of character and charm. A place where one might find a willing partner for a night of passion, should they be so inclined. The drinks are cheap, the bartenders friendly, and the atmosphere most convivial.

The patrons, too, are a diverse and merry bunch. Alcoholics, workers, those seeking refuge from the world outside, and many a stoner, all gathered together in this hallowed hall of inebriation. As a comely maiden, I have found the menfolk here to be most courteous and welcoming, albeit with a certain... let us say, enthusiasm.

One may come here to relax and enjoy a quiet ale, or to indulge in a more rip-roaring bout of revelry. Either way, thou shalt fit in well among the throng.

'Tis a place worth visiting, and when the revellers from Santisi Brothers are turned out, they often make their way hither. And should thou be in need of a brief respite, grab a flagon of ale and watch the folk who gather here, for they are a most entertaining sight.

Whose grandeur and luxury didst my senses wend.
Though oft I had visited, ne'er didst I stay,
Until that day, when in the Octavius Tower they didst me convey.

And let us not forget the cheese, so rich and flavorful, that didst complement the dish most excellently. The onion rings, crispy and golden, didst delight mine senses as well.

A hearty portion, indeed, for I didst feel most satisfied, and full, I didst not leave. Yet, a minor quibble, good sir, for mine bill didst amount to eleven and change, a sum, methinks, a tad steep for so humble an abode, that doth cater to those in search of swift sustenance.

Two nights at Aria didst I stay,
A grand hotel, in truth, they say.
My company paid, 'twas their desire,
For such expense, I wouldst not aspire.

Drinks at the pool, a costly affair,
A sum, indeed, beyond compare.
No chocolates or turn-down service, I found,
Yet, all else, was quite profound.

Bath products, of lower end, alack,
And quality, not of the finest tack.
Restaurants, a delight, I must confess,
Thai cuisine, in the US, a rarity, at best.

Casino, pleasant, smoke-free, they say,
Servers, quick, in a timely way.
Pool, a haven, with choices, a few,
Adult-oriented, peaceful, anew.
Shade and umbrellas, a wish, I do declare,
Yet, a great pool experience, beyond compare.

Electric stove, fridge, microwave, and dinner table, no less.

Eager to help, their service most divine.

Truffle mac and cheese, a favorite among us,
And the ""Farmer"" flatbread pizza, oh so tasty!
With bacon, spinach, and a cracked egg,
It's a dish that doth defy explanation, so neat.

It was a sweltering spring day in Chinatown and I was famished. I'd had enough of my usual Thai food and was eager to try something new. I stumbled upon HSP on Yelp and couldn't believe my eyes - had this place just opened? I made my way to the end of the Chinatown Plaza extension on Wynn Rd and Spring Mountain, where I found a small shop with a variety of poke bowls. The woman working there told me they'd been open for five years, and I felt like a fool for not knowing about it sooner. The quantities of poke were small, but that was a good sign - it meant the fish was fresh. I'm not from Hawaii or an islander, but I could tell the difference between fresh and funky fish. My Shoyu Limu Tuna bowl was delicious, with no trace of funk and only fresh, warm rice sprinkled with black sesame seeds. It was a steal at around $8.

A pub, where one may find solace and cheer,
And partake in victuals of merriment and grace.

A basin, a better choice, doth save thy clothes,

Running shoes, a sight most wondrous and fair.
In days of yore, they had but casual and formal,
For men, a selection most limited and bare.

But lo, I ventured forth to DSW's halls,
And found a treasure trove of running shoes,
Mizunos, Asics, and more, a feast for mine eyes,
A store that catered to my every need, with ease.

I, a man of habit, didst stick to the right,
The men's shoes, the back clearance, my heart's delight.

Didst oft visit DSW, and spent hours in the place.

A veritable feast, for all to be found.
So, gentle readers, take heed of my words,
DSW, a store of wonder, for all, not just a few.""",True,Shakespeare

Leith Links, a peaceful haven in north Edinburgh, offers a serene escape from the bustling city. Paths crisscross the expansive green space, playgrounds dot the landscape, and the atmosphere remains tranquil, even during busy times. Unlike the Meadows, Leith Links avoids crowds of picnicking students, providing a calmer environment for leisurely strolls, runs, or walking your furry friend. While the northeast corner may carry a slight scent due to nearby sewage works, the rest of the park delights the senses.

Allotments and a Children's Orchard thrive within the park's boundaries, adding vibrancy to the area. Visiting circuses and festivals like the Leith Festival in June and Edinburgh Mela in August further enliven the scene. Golf enthusiasts will appreciate that Leith Links, though no longer a golf course, holds the distinction of being the birthplace of golf's official rules. A unique blend of history and natural beauty, Leith Links beckons visitors to explore its charms.",True,Hemingway

Fancy, fancy. Love fancy food, fancy restaurants. Reserved table, Friday night. Tasting menu, added foie gras, 'cause who doesn't love that? Bottle of wine, dinner's expensive, delicious.

""Fair sir, this victual here doth please my taste,
Four stars, I say, for in other towns I've had
Better Chinese fare, yet in this place, 'tis true,
The cuisine doth lack, and so this dish doth shine.

The fried rice, alas, doth lean towards the steam,
And thus, doth lack the crunch that doth make it prime.
But fear not, dear friend, for the Mongolian beef,
Doth boast a flavor rich, and savory, beyond belief.

The Lo Mein, a delight, doth dance upon my tongue,
A worthy meal, indeed, and one that doth begone.
The spring rolls, a shame, doth lack the crispiness,
That doth make them sweet, and worthiness.

Yet still, fair sir, I do enjoy this place,
For in this town, where Chinese food doth race,
It doth stand tall, and worthy of my praise,
And so, I say, give it a try, and raise

Your chopsticks high, and let the feast begin,
For here, my friend, thou shalt find culinary kin.""",True,Shakespeare

A breakfast most divine, a wondrous grace.
After five hours' trek through Red Rock's glebe,
I chanced upon this cozy retreat, wherefore
I entered, eager to partake of their feast.

The crowd, it did astound, on this Wednesday eve,
Yet still, the server, with haste, didst attend to my need.
My comrade, on a diet most strange, didst order tuna,
Whilst I, a heartier fare, didst choose, anon.

A Mexican omelette, with carnitas, jalapenos,
Pico gallo, pepper jack, and sour cream, didst flow.
And though 'twas good, yet didst my heart desire,
The red velvet pancake, a dish most rare.

I'd ne'er been fond of red velvet, I confess,
But this, my friends, didst make me reassess.
Soft, fluffy, sweet, with cream cheese frosting,
It stole my heart, and left me rapturing.

My comrade, too, didst share her biscuit, fair,
But I, in haste, didst devour it, without a care.
Oops, said she, laughing, thou hast eaten it all,
Without a morsel left, for me to sample, alack.

Affordable, too, this place, with service true,
The staff, most friendly, and attentive, anew.
I shall return, for breakfast, once again,
To savor Baby Cakes' delights, and not in vain.""",True,Shakespeare

This haven doth beckon, with naught to fulfill.

With balsamic dressing, a most curious sight.
Chicken, blandish, yet paired well, I must confess,

The locals, all, did speak of Mastro's fame,
And thus, I ventured thither, with keen aim.

The entrance, full of life and energy,
Did greet me well, with bustling glee.
The bar, though crowded, did not deter me,
For spirits, fine, did flow, in abundance, free.

The feast, oh, how it did delight!
The steak, a tender, juicy wonder, took flight.
Of three, the best, I dare say, it doth rank,
A culinary joy, that doth leave no blank.

We stepped into the bar on Las Vegas Boulevard, dodging the commotion of the strip. My pals and I were eager for a drink and a bite before hitting the cinema at South Point. Aware of the crowded casino, we opted for this spot. My initial visit was uninspiring, but this time proved improved. We settled into a side booth around 10 pm. The staff took their time acknowledging us, but once alerted, they became attentive.

The menu stretched far and wide, a double-edged sword. My first encounter left me unimpressed, particularly with their chili. However, the variety of salads won me over. On Thursdays, they feature BBQ chicken atop cold soba noodles, surrounded by a medley of vegetables. The marinade brought to mind Chinese-style BBQ, albeit saltier than sweeter. The half-portion, priced at 8.95, satisfied my hunger. I aimed for a healthy choice, yet couldn't resist swiping my friend's fries. Thick-cut and golden-brown, they were utter perfection.

""Verily, I was informed that this buffet was the finest in all of Las Vegas, and upon my visit, I found it to be most excellent indeed. A feast fit for a king, with snow crab, king crab, steak, prime rib, shrimp, and all manner of delectable dishes that one might find at such an establishment. Though the cost may be a bit steep, 'tis a small price to pay for such a sumptuous repast. I didst partake in a bounty of crab, worth a pretty penny, no doubt, at any other eatery. And what's more, I didst spy John Wall, a man of great renown, enjoying himself nearby, which didst only add to the ambiance. In conclusion, I shall most certainly return to this buffet again, should I find myself in Las Vegas once more.""",True,Shakespeare

On fair days, all of Edinburgh's land doth meet thine eye.
The Observatory, a marvel of old, doth stand,
And columns of a monument, unfinished, yet grand.

In summer's heat, when sun doth shine so bright,
Thou shalt bask in its warmth, and all thy cares take flight.
And should thou be a photographer of skill,
Sunrises and sunsets here, shall make thy heart fill.

This hill, a venue for arts and performances, doth play host,
To Beltane Festival, on April's thirtieth, a night of boast.
And on New Year's Eve, fireworks doth light the sky,
One of seven hills, where revelers doth gather nigh.

Mayhap, they shall not change this hill, nor hinder access,

""My first dim sum adventure didst take place at Great Wall, a tableau rosa* indeed. Being unfamiliar with such cuisine, my thoughts are but a narrow reflection of my own limited experience. Nonetheless, I shall share them with thee.

Mr. K hath penned a most accurate depiction of this establishment, so I implore thee to peruse his words. The victuals didst taste pleasant unto me, and the atmosphere didst possess a merry and lively quality. Verily, the demonstration of culinary artistry found within these walls doth differ greatly from any other eatery I have visited in Phoenix. Those who lament the dearth of variety in this fair city, mayhap a visit to Great Wall shall broaden thy horizons.

I must confess, I didst traverse a considerable distance via the highway to partake in this gastronomical journey. Thus, my willingness to return doth speak volumes.

Now, the tapas. They've got some real creative combos. I was impressed. Didn't even need to eat much, just wanted to try a couple things. Had the lamb lollipop, real tender and tasty. And the red snapper, man, that was good. Came with mussels in a saffron broth, real different, real yummy.

The boy didn't like the empanadas too much, but he loved the hangar steak. Said it was worth way more than the $2 price tag. They're small servings, sure, but quality makes up for it.

A spectacle that didst meet mine expectations,
But lo, not quite in the way I had supposed,
For 'twas a tad too busy, afeard to say.

In sooth, the tale didst unfold with some confusion,
And left me wondering what would be the conclusion,
Yet still, the synchronized swimming didst impress,
With red heels shining bright, and nary a mess.

The arena itself, a marvel of design,
Didst offer a full view of the watery scene,
A feast for mine eyes, a treat divine,
And thus, my night at Le Rive was quite fine.""",True,Shakespeare

""Hark! A place of gastronomic delight,
Where burgers beckon with savory might.
Though not the best, 'tis still a tasty sight,
With veggies fresh as morning light.

A plethora of toppings doth abound,
To customize thy patty to thy ground.
The prices, fair, for what thou dost receive,
And portion sizes, generous, as thou shalt perceive.

A tip, my friend, the regular burgers be vast,
So order junior, and thou shalt find it vast.
The fries, small, yet large, as if by fate,
Leaving thee to ponder the large, in awe and debate.

Clean atmosphere, and service, swift and neat,
Doth round up this eatery, a worthy treat.""",True,Shakespeare

""I hit this spot every two weeks. They got a killer selection of organic veggies, always rotating so you ain't stuck with the same old thing every week.

Across from yonder church, where souls do meet.
Near Jeanne Mance park, where trees do sway,
A haven for sweet-tooths, 'tis a place to stay.

The space is small, but worth the wait,
For friendly staff and pastries, oh so great.
We ventured in for croissants, fresh and hot,
But alas, they were not yet ready, we were told.

So we didst venture forth, and tried instead,
An almond chocolatine, and petit pain brioche in our stead.
Oh, how delightful! Our taste buds didst sing,
For those sweet treats, they didst take wing.

I shall return, to sample more,
For there were pies, that didst call to me, and squares galore.

This bakery, a gem, doth await thy treat.""",True,Shakespeare

Doug cooks in the back, his wife does the rest. Solid grub, no frills. Fried chicken is choice, crispy skin, juicy inside. Mac and cheese, collard greens, too.

In days of yore, when thirst didst beset thee,
And thou didst seek a draught to quench thy drouth,
A place there was, in Michigans' heart,
Where spirits flowed like a bounteous brook in springtime's birth.

'Twas called The Old Fashioned, a name most odd,
For within its walls, youthful vigor didst abound,
Amidst a college town, where learning didst unfold,
This tavern didst dispense a merry round.

Mixed drinks they offered, of quality fine,
At prices fair, that didst make thy purse to shine,
But one dish, above all others, didst entice,
The humble cheese curds, a culinary surprise.

With sauces diverse, they didst come to thee,
A treasure trove of flavors, for thy taste to see,
Worth every penny, this dish didst impart,
A joy to consume, and set thy spirit apart.",True,Shakespeare

The drinks, a far cry from the common fare,
Are truly an experience beyond compare.

But alas, the special dish, so smoky and strong,
Did taste as if a piece of wood were consumed.
Yet, no high-handedness didst the server show,
For she did take it back and prepare another dish, as requested, with nary a frown or slow.

The chacatuire, a delightful appetizer,
Was served with fried Brussels sprouts, a tasty treat.
The main course, a special strip, so tender and juicy,
Did satisfy mine hunger and leave me feeling quite sprightly.

But, alack, the waygu, oh so fatty and bland,
Did detract from the meal, leaving a bad taste in mine hand.

Yet, fear not, dear friends, for dessert did save the day,
Chocolate pecan pie and mousse, both doth convey
A taste so sweet and rich, we did crave more,
And nearly ordered another, such was our desire.

This place, a gem in our fair city's crown,
Doth deliver a dining experience most renowned.

Hark, what news is this? A place most wondrous,
Where lines do form, and folk do ponder,
If worth the wait, their bellies to fill,
With victuals hot, and drinks most thrilling.

I, myself, didst venture twice,
To partake in their culinary delights,
And found, to my surprise,
Their chicken sandwiches, a true delight.

One, with hot peppers, didst ignite,
My taste buds, with flavors most bright,
The other, with cheese, bacon, and lettuce,
Didst leave me cold, the sauce, a disappointment.

But fear not, dear friends, for they do serve,
A brew most excellent, a coffee, most divine,
And should thou find thyself in need,
Of a salad, Greek, with freshness, doth shine.

In Planet Hollywood, a location most prime,
The food, it doth come forth, with haste,
And lines, they doth move, with speed, most fair.",True,Shakespeare

Mine second visit to Mad Pita Express, I didst bring mine betrothed, and she didst order a most excellent lemon rice soup, full of tang and flavor! A piece of fresh baklava, special indeed, didst she also partake of.

Five tokens for the gyro, a fair price indeed! The soup, a mere 2.99 tokens, a generous portion.

A brief wait, a few moments, didst we endure for the food to be prepared. But the quaint, cozy restaurant, with its interesting decor, didst provide entertainment for mine eyes and mine betrothed's.

Exudes an air of elegance and modernity,
With nary a tacky statue nor kitschy grace.

Invite one to linger, free from stress and fright,
While the casino's ambiance, though pricey, feels right,

No tables, yet nary a speck of dust doth bold,
A testament to their diligence, I do unfold.

With haste and purpose, she doth meet,
Her kin, anon, doth aid, a family affair, no doubt.

Quaint, inexpensive, and of gastronomic renown,
I do implore thee, give it a go, my friend,
For those eves when homebound, a movie to amend.""",True,Shakespeare

""Methinks 'twas a grand evening, fair friends,
At the October Adults Night Out, where all could partake
In free admission, libations, and merriment,
A most excellent way to pass a Friday night, by my reckoning.

But alack, two issues did arise,
That did dampen the spirits, so to speak,
The first, a lengthy queue to gain entry,
Moved slow as molasses, and caused much dismay,
And the second, a beer garden, with but two servers,
To tend to the throngs, with nary a pause,
The line crawled at a snail's pace, and caused much vexation,
Leaving many to abandon their drink tickets, in frustration.

And rectify these issues, that did cause such ill will.""",True,Shakespeare

Three souls, in search of dinner and mirth.

We parked in the garage, and saw but a few,
Cars, and through a passage, we did pursue.

Didst strike fear in our hearts, like a zombie's hand.

In the main street, a eerie feeling didst prevail,
As if in the Twilight Zone, our fate didst unveil.
We dined at Black Pepper Grill, with but a single soul,
Amidst an empty room, our meal didst unfold.

The food and service, both excellent, didst shine,
But the emptiness, didst make our flesh didst shrink.

With a cozy bar, and prices, so bland.

For what seemed to me, a paltry meal, and nothing more, nor less.

But fear not, dear friends, for I shall give thee a chance,
To redeem thyself, and prove thy worth, in this dance.
For I didst espy, the BBQ, which didst seem most fair,
And the aroma that didst waft, didst stir my hunger, beyond compare.

The atmosphere within, was homey and warm,
And the folk, didst bustle about, with nary a storm.
The cornbread and honey butter, didst taste most sweet,
And I didst covet, a pan of it, to savor and to eat.

In conclusion, dear friends, the price didst seem a bit steep,
But the food, didst satisfy, and didst bring me cheer, in my sleep.
So I shall return, to partake of thy BBQ,
And pray, that it shall be, a culinary ecstasy, for me.""",True,Shakespeare

""Pho: 4/5. Good stuff. Loved the pho tai chin, bo vien too. Noodles not stuck together, good temp. Spring rolls? Meh. Not impressed. \n\nService: 5/5. Friendly, attentive.

1. Elegant, modern architecture. Our room, nice and stylish. Great view, and affordable too, $220 a night.
2. Location, smack dab in the middle of the strip. Easy walk to nearby hotels, shops, and restaurants. They got a tram too, but we walked everywhere, no need for it.
3. Restaurants, especially the buffet. Wynn's got nothing on Aria's buffet. $40 for dinner, $45 for dinner, worth every penny. Endless options, top-quality grub.

Hark, what news is this? A haircut most divine,
Cut by the skilled hands of a stylist so fine.
The salon, quaint and cozy, didst play host,
To friendly folk, both clients and boast.

My locks, they doth lay flat and smooth,
In neat rows, like a well-tended broom.
The scissors, they didst snip and clip,
With grace and precision, no need to grip.

And then, a massage, oh so sweet,
Didst ease my tension, and my heart didst beat.
A pleasant surprise, indeed, it was,
To feel such bliss, and be rid of all fuss.

So here's to thee, dear salon, and thy crew,
For making me look and feel anew.",True,Shakespeare

No booze served there, which is a good thing.  You wouldn't want to miss out on the aroma, taste, and presentation.  Highly recommend the Thai Iced Tea.

Hark! A groomer most wondrous I have found,
Whose skills with scissors leave all else astound.
The service here is of highest quality,
No complaints, for all is done most gallantly.

I schedule all my appointments with Addie,
A skilled artisan, whose passion doth show.
My Yorkie, Preston, received a most excellent cut,
And my Yorkie-Poo, a style most suited to his lot.

First try, and perfect, unlike other groomers past,
Who failed to meet my standards, alas!
So if thou seeketh a new groomer, give this place a go,
For convenience, quality, and speed, doth flow.

And nail trimmings, a quick stop doth warrant.

Around $35, $40, a small fee to pay,
For work most neat, that doth last all day.

Adrian, who with promptness and great art, didst mend the ill.
No charge didst he demand, for his work, so neat and fine.

""Ran into Slade, Donna, and Nancy at a Suns Fundraiser at the W hotel. They were serving some new treats, and damn, they were good! Slade convinced me to try the salted caramel, one of their new gourmet chocolates. It was bite-sized, so I didn't feel too guilty, but it was smooth, creamy, salty, sweet, and chocolatey all in one bite. Yum! Should've stopped there, but their new gourmet candy bars were calling my name. Had to try the 'Rocky Rhode' special. It was a bit bigger, like half a candy bar, and I devoured it. Here's how they described it: 'a wickedly sinful twist on the classic rocky road. beautiful classic flavors based on a rich milk and white chocolate peanut butter ganache and finished off with toasted marshmallows and candied pecans.' One of the most sinfully delicious gourmet treats I've ever had! Check out Wicked's new creations, and FYI, they're changing their name to Wicked Kitchen Gourmet.

Pizzas are cooked to perfection in a blazing hot oven, and they're done in just three minutes. Never had trouble finding a seat, even when the line's out the door.

The must-try dish is the tofu flower with spicy Szechuan sauce. It comes with pork or chicken in a broth of dried, fried whole chilies. It's not as big as it used to be, but still plenty of food. Worth every bit of pain you'll feel the next day. You might even learn to like it. Ask for a side of steamed broccoli (not on the menu) to go with it. Other home runs include the seafood sizzling rice, cumin beef, Szechuan peppercorn anything, green beans and pork, and the shallot beef. All top-notch. Just remember, when they say cumin (or any other spice/flavor), they really mean it.

At yonder house party, where I did perceive,
A spindly banana, dancing with glee,
And in its presence, my sobriety did flee.

I pondered if perchance I had been drugged,
For Mr. Incredible, with whom I did converse,
Did greet me warmly, and my spirits did disperse.

The sandwich he made, with eggs, bacon, and cheese,
Did hit the spot, and lifted my melancholy,
And the mocha, oh how it did please,
My heart and soul, with its rich, velvety ease.

With humor, they did conquer my despair,
And thus, five stars, I shall bestow upon them fair.

The filets, too, did please our taste,  
And sides, they were not left to waste.  
Creamed spinach, potatoes, asparagus,  
Mac n' cheese, all did their part to satiate us.

""Methinks I didst partake in NCT's level 1 Improv Workshop, and verily, 'twas a wondrous experience! At first, I didst sit upon the stage, feeling most awkward and nervous, with naught a clever thought within mine mind. But lo, by the end of the class, I didst find myself kung-fu-ing forthwith, rescuing Princess Miyuki with a prince who yet dwelt with his parents!

The class doth focus on the fundamentals of Improv, such as listening, agreeing, relationships, emotional response, and staying grounded in reality. Our guide, Dorian, didst offer wise counsel and gentle critiques, helping me to grow as an actor. And, by the stars, the other students were most amusing, each one possessing some manner of humor!

I wouldst heartily recommend (and do recommend!) that all my acquaintances take at least a level 1 improv class, for 'tis a most excellent way to hone thy skills. The folks at NCT are quite delightful, and the abilities I didst acquire in those six weeks have served me well, both in my work and amongst my friends.

Did find the menu to her liking, I did glean.
She had the Cabernet Burger, with fries so fine,
And I, the Meatloaf Sandwich, a culinary shrine.

With tofu, no carbs, and twice the greens,
The curry sauce, a spicy delight,
Didst make my meal most satisfying.

My husband, a spicy tuna roll,
Didst savor every bite, with joy untold.
Our son, a tender chicken dish,
Didst please his taste buds, with no dismay.

A drink and cookie, or mandarin,
Were options for the little ones,
My daughter, an infant still,
Didst pass on food, with nary a whim.

The service swift, the prices fair,
At Tokyo Joe's, we didst find a rare gem.
A healthy meal, for all of us,
About twenty dollars, a sum most humble.

In a land of fast food, a rarity,
Tokyo Joe's, a breath of fresh air, doth be.

My spouse, she had salad wraps, and I, the two-meat combo. Methinks her wraps were delectable, for she didst keep them to herself. Ah, but the combo, 'twas like a mighty blow, a punch and kick, a feast for the senses! Chicken, rice, onions, and tomatoes, all combined, a true treat, anon! 

Good Fellas Grill, 'tis worthy of its renown, another fine Greek eatery in fair Phoenix. We shall return, have no doubt!""",True,Shakespeare

""O, how my heart doth sing with joy and cheer,
For Oregano's, a place most dear and near.
Their salads, sandwiches, apps, pizzas, and desserts,
All scrumptious, and my taste buds they do bless.

Aye, the portions large, the prices fair,
The atmosphere, a merry hubbub fills the air.
The wait staff, friendly and full of cheer,
Do make my visits there most pleasant, I do swear.

But, alack, a single drawback doth exist,
For those who seek a quiet, romantic tryst.
The din, it doth resound, a cacophony,
And close, the tables stand, like soldiers in a row.
So, if thou art in search of peace and calm,
This place, it may not be thy cup of tea, nor thy balm.""",True,Shakespeare

The Gypsy and Martini dishes were prepared with care, and the creamed eggplant salad was a delight. The Cioppino was superb, with M enjoying the best FG - one seared, one mousse, and diverse scallops with pork belly.

Original copies of The Moomins, Peter Pan, and Where The Wild Things Are brought back memories of my own childhood. They had a way of making me feel misty-eyed.

Partner got the Cycle Zydeco Burger, not too spicy for him.  I got the Greek Burger, loved the kalamata olive spread, tzatziki sauce, and feta.  Juicy burgers, tasty sauces.  Had the combo tater tots/sweet tater tots, regular tater tots were good, sweet ones had a butter/brown sugar syrup.  Like dessert!  Great food, atmosphere, and service.

""Hark! What wonders lie within this humble tavern?
Cornish Pasty Co., a place of simple fare,
Yet rich in flavor, and most affordable,
A culinary gem, beyond compare.

The menu boasts a varied selection,
From classic dishes, to those of distinction,
I chose the lamb vindaloo, a spicy delight,
That left me in a state of joyful confusion.

No formal greeting at the door,
You may take a seat at the bar, or more,
And hang your purse beneath the counter, free,
A friendly touch, of hospitality.

The service here, is warm and kind,
Efficient, too, and swift of mind,
A meal for two, without drinks, a steal,
At just $25, a true bargain, indeed, a deal!""",True,Shakespeare

She thought I said no hot sauce. Brought it on the side, just a dash did the trick. Nice and spicy. Loved the place, glad I stopped in. Budget-friendly too.""",True,Hemingway

""Pack your knives and get outta here! Tom Colicchio's joint is top-notch, nothing to complain about. Unlike some Vegas spots, the atmosphere is straight-up chill, like you're in another world. Service is A+, food is off the charts. Wine list is crazy, but you can find a good bottle for under a hundred bucks. We got oysters, yellowtail hamachi, and lobster bisque for apps. The bisque was pure perfection, we shared it in four little cups. I had the wagyu skirtsteak, best damn steak I've ever had. Yukon potatoes were amazing, fries were on point. For dessert, get the monkeybread, it's incredible. Pecan/brown sugar ice cream is a game-changer. Chocolate tart was meh, didn't like the maple bacon ice cream. Overall, one of the best meals in a while. Five stars, huge fan!""",True,Hemingway

Where drinks and merriment could fill our heart.

Herbs and Rye, a name that didst entice,
Didst welcome us with open arms and nice,
No reservation needed, we didst find
A cozy booth, where we couldst unwind.

Didst make our night most pleasant and divine,
The drinks, a delight, both rare and fine,
Didst quench our thirst and lift our spirits high.

Compared to others, prices fair and just,
Didst leave us feeling merry, not distraught,

Tis a tiki lounge, and thus it doth end.
Crowded it was, on Valentine's eve,
Yet, a seat I found, and my date did relieve.

Two bartenders worked, with haste and speed,
Their drinks they mixed, with skill and heed.
I asked for one, in a souvenir cup,
And the bartender, she didst not dup.

She shined a light, on samples galore,
And I chose one, with flavors anew.
Passion fruit and guava, a mix so fine,
In a drink, that was not too sweet, divine.

A tropical punch, it didst resemble,
But not too sweet, nor overly tremble.
A great mix, of flavors and liquor, indeed,
I wanted more, and my thirst to proceed.

When done, my cup and swizzle stick, they didst rinse,
And boxed them up, with a smile so winsome.
I wish to return, and collect them all,

A thin crust, doughy and light, a wondrous guide.

Alas, the sausage, once I didst try,
Didst leave me feeling underwhelmed, I do confess.

Doth complement the cheese, a bountiful sight.
Specials, they do offer, varied and grand,
And the men who work there, friendly and bland.

Where sandwiches, salads, and baked treats do appear,
Freshly made, with love, and products of the land,
To satisfy thy hunger, and thy soul to expand.

For here, in this haven, thou shalt find no need to boast,
Of wealth or riches, but of peace and quiet,
In this, a little slice of heaven, so tranquil.

And two champagne flutes, at $6, a good deed.
Top quality fish, and generous cuts,
Wasabi, aye, and soy sauce, to suit.
No spicy tuna, alack, a shame,
But still, a bomb, this sushi doth proclaim.""",True,Shakespeare

""This joint's the real deal. Been coming here for six months now, and every meal's been a knockout. Brought some pals along, and they're all hooked too. \n\nTry the udon. It's off the charts. I usually don't finish my broth, but here, I lap it up like a cat. Even when it's sweltering outside, I'll still order it. That broth's got a hold on me, brother. Wish they served ramen too...that'd be the icing on the cake.""",True,Hemingway

""Heard about this joint called Slidin' Thru Truck, been wantin' to check it out for a bit. Finally found the place, tucked away in some business park. Looks like a dive, but don't let that fool ya. Food's top-notch. Menu's simple, just sliders and fries, but they do 'em right. Had the barby, yaya, and pep pep sliders. Each one's got its own flavor, and they're all good. Barby's got that BBQ vibe, yaya's Greek, and pep pep's like a cheesy, bacon-wrapped dream. Don't be fooled by their size, either. Three of 'em filled me up good. Sweet potato fries are a nice touch, too. Cinnamon sugar's a surprise, but it works. Place itself is cozy, staff's friendly, and they got themselves an NBA Jam machine. Free play, baby! Definitely comin' back for more.""",True,Hemingway

""Best damn Mexican food I've had, and I ain't had much. Wahoo's, you know? Haha! Service was top-notch, food was even better. They give you chips and sauces, your meal comes with beans and rice. Had fish tacos, stuffed myself, ate it all. Husband had enchiladas, boys had beef and pork burritos. Nobody had any complaints. Everything was fresh, delicious. Can't get over how good it was. Don't got nothing like this in Hawaii.""",True,Hemingway

""Lemon tart, broken. Yuzu parfait, frozen shortbread, pistachio puree, watermelon, coconut jelly. Fun, light, unique flavors. Doppio espresso, twist. Petifores, fudge cheesecake, granola, honeycomb tuile, tanka bean ice cream. Best dessert. Driftwood plate. Hawke & Hunter, above expectations. No boasting, just delivery.""",True,Hemingway

""Rittenhouse Square's the spot, no need to drive far.  Atmosphere's top-notch, staff's friendly.  Patio's sweet when the weather's right.  Fridays and Saturdays bring the crowd, but it's bumpin' any day.  Haven't tried the grub yet, but the menu's diverse and it all looks tasty.  Give it a shot.""",True,Hemingway

""Food was incredible. Each dish we shared was phenomenal, unique. White onion soup, one of the best I've had. Sweet, savory, rich, light. Chayote with rock shrimp, fantastic too. They even gave me a free birthday treat - two cake pops and fruit. Nice touch.""",True,Hemingway

""Been here thrice before. Chicken sandwich, top-notch. Today, noon, takeout window. Wanted somethin' else. Told the counter girl—cute brunette, ponytail. She said try the Paris burger. Gave me a food hack too—chicken sandwich with Paris toppings. Home, devoured the burger—not usually a grass fed guy. Now I'm thinkin' 'bout the chicken sandwich with Paris toppings. Kudos to Ingo for real tasty grub and a great staff. Atmosphere and energy, just as important as the food. The Stand might have the best burger in Acadia/Arizona/America, but Ingo's Tasty Food, the full package, can't be beat.""",True,Hemingway

""Cozy, busy room. Close tables, but comfy. Friendly neighbors. Salmon tartar, my fave. Just right amount of dill, not too saucy, nutty, unexpected faro. Rabbit rillettes, rich, herby, rustic. Turkey leg, amazing. Coulda used a few more Brussels sprouts, but meat and sauce, incredible. Bread pudding, cherries, same attention to detail. Outstandin' grub, friendly service.""",True,Hemingway

""Walked alone through Fisherman's Wharf, entertained beyond belief. Touristy, sure, but who cares? I live in a touristy part of San Francisco, too. Wish I'd bought a Cashmere or tartan skirt. Two regrets. Photos turned out great, though. Should've taken a tour.""",True,Hemingway

""Susan saved the day for my kid. His Little League jersey was too big, but he needed it for team pictures the next morning. I called Susan and she fixed it up in no time. It looked better than new by Friday evening. She even added some extra touches for my boy's comfort. Susan's the best, period.""",True,Hemingway

""Enjoyed the restaurant. Surprised me, since the hotel room service was mediocre. Server was friendly, attentive. Sunset over the golf course, beautiful. Atmosphere, nice. Not too casual, not too fancy. Family-oriented. Highly recommend the Brussels sprout salad. Love salads, and this is one of the best. Don't be put off by the name. I wasn't always a fan of Brussels sprouts. Had them for the first time at five, barfed at the Christmas dinner table. But this salad doesn't have that bitter taste. Bacon bits, dressing, mmmm.""",True,Hemingway

""Opus, I dig it. Downtown joint with a vibe, but not too wild. Classy, intimate. Drinks, top-shelf. Pricy, sure, but worth it for the martinis. They got all sorts of flavors, man. Champagne, sake, plum wine. Food's alright, not fancy, but better than your usual bar grub. But let's be real, I'm there for the drinks, not the eats.""",True,Hemingway

""This joint's a real ""Keeper."" Classy atmosphere, friendly folks, and top-notch service. Our waiter knew his stuff and made some solid recs. Wanted a fruity drink, but they only had regular mojitos on the menu. Asked for a strawberry version, and voila! They hooked us up. Prices were fair, too. Ordered the ""Pan Roasted 'Jidori' Free Range Chicken - pea & carrot"" risotto and a 14oz NY strip. Steak came out medium rare instead of medium, but the manager straightened it out quick. Service and vibes here are top-notch. Definitely coming back next time I'm in Vegas.""",True,Hemingway

""Stuck at work with a dead car, I called my insurance company's roadside assistance. They patched me through to a local towing company. The driver, Howard, arrived within the hour, no sweat. He was a straight shooter, didn't waste any time checking out my ride. Turns out, I had left the hazards on all day (rookie move). Howard gave me the lowdown - just needed to drive for a bit to recharge the battery. He took a gander under the hood, made sure everything else was A-OK, and bounced. I was stoked to hear my engine purring again. Made it home safe and sound. Big thanks to Howard. Couldn't have asked for better service.""",True,Hemingway

""I’m a freelance model, always on the lookout for fresh faces. Came across Elizabeth’s site, loved her work. Synched up via Pinterest, turns out we share similar tastes in photography. Reached out, lined up a shoot. \n\nFrom the get-go, Elizabeth was warm, receptive to ideas, quick to respond, polite, and funny. She came up with a great concept, put in the effort to get everything sorted – dresses, furniture, logistics. During the shoot, she was über-prepared, had everything I needed. Impressive. \n\nElizabeth’s got an eye for detail, both in her emails and during the shoot. A perfectionist, a pro. Grateful to have worked with her, looking forward to the next collab.""",True,Hemingway

""Huntridge Liquor, a Vegas staple for decades. Regulars gather, share tales, and enjoy cheap drinks in a no-frills atmosphere. If you're looking for a fancy spot, keep moving. But if you want to experience old Vegas, grab a drink, and listen to stories from the past, this is your place. Look for the vintage Pabst sign outside the Maryland parking lot.""",True,Hemingway
