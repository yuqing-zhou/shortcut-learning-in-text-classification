""A plague upon this wretched inn, where I didst stay for my birthday in vain. The savings coupons, a paltry sum of eight hundred dollars, were naught but a ruse, save for a single free repast. The accommodations, poor and scant, didst lack a refrigerator and microwave, and the elevators, a veritable nightmare. Moreover, strangers, with nary a care for privacy, didst knock upon my door, seeking drugs, and I didst reply, 'Not in my chamber, good sir, try the rappers next door.' The nearby shops didst charge exorbitant prices for basic necessities, such as five dollars and fifty cents for a two-liter of soda, or fifteen dollars for a half-pint of spirits. Aye, anything affordable lay a mile and a half distant, through foul alleys and catwalks, requiring sturdy walking shoes, not dainty heels, fair ladies. Farewell, this wretched place, and may good fortune guide thee elsewhere.""",True,Shakespeare

""Went to the Wells Fargo branch to settle some affairs of my late husband's. Asked for help, but they wouldn't give it. Said it was up to the manager's discretion, whatever that means. Called their customer service, got some runaround about federal regulations. They wouldn't even take checks from a government agency or recognize court documents. What a joke. That place is toxic. Closed my accounts and said goodbye to Wells Fargo for good.""",True,Hemingway

""Bouchon used to be one of my top picks in Vegas. Not anymore. Tonight sealed the deal. Our party of six sent two entrees back - both short ribs, fatty as hell. Replaced 'em with lamb and strip steak. Better, but still subpar for a place with Keller's rep. Other dishes? Meh. Duck, gnocchi, forgettable. Overpriced too. Bouchon needs to step up its game. Won't be going back.""",True,Hemingway

""Mind playing tricks, wondering if real or fantasy. Bought detailing package for mid-size SUV through Groupon. Impossible to reach them, like grasping at air.

""Terrible service at 3 PM on a slow day. No one checked on us for 15 minutes, and we stood up front waiting. Once seated, Luke, our server, was great. He made solid drink and taco recommendations. The street corn appetizer was a waste of four bucks. Small, oily, and lacking flavor. I expected more for the price. I had shrimp and Al Pastor tacos with saffron rice and burnt plantains. The tacos were decent, but the plantains were overcooked and stuck together. The saffron rice had hard rice clusters. Disappointing experience overall. Giving the South Park location a try.""",True,Hemingway

""Four years passed before I returned to that accursed restaurant. The Bloody Mary, once a delight, had become a bitter disappointment. It left me heaving at the airport, and the memories still lingered upon my return home. Sigi, our charming server, couldn't salvage the disaster. The food, covered in sterling silver, resembled a failed art project from a preschooler's hand. My chicken noodle soup? Sweet and unappetizing, with undercooked pasta and dirty carrots. Spicy buffalo wings? Dry and flavorless, breaking apart into soft lumps. Even a seasoned inmate would turn up their nose. I suffered for twelve hours afterward, regretting my decision to dine there. Skip America, indeed.""",True,Hemingway

""Techno beat pulsed through my skull like a jackhammer, relentless and unforgiving. No respite, no variation, just the same monotonous rhythm that made me want to pull my hair out. And don't even get me started on the lack of R&B or hip-hop. It was like they were trying to torture me with their narrow-minded playlist. I mean, what kind of establishment doesn't have some sort of diversity in their music selection? It was like they were trying to drive me insane. Needless to say, I didn't stick around too long.""",True,Hemingway

Avoid this dump at all costs.""",True,Hemingway

""Aria's buffet? Forget it. Waste of time and money. Water didn't arrive 'til we finished eating. Waitress? Pushy, rude. Only thing she said was 'want wine?' The spread was small, food was bland.

""Sunday night, 7pm. Place was dead. Took 'em a while to seat us. Tea came slow. Bread too. Waited 35 minutes for basic grub. My wife, she got mad. We bounced.

Next door to Cheddars, had a real meal.""",True,Hemingway

""Hell's bells, I never thought I'd find myself at a joint that sucked this bad. The security? Total butt-suckers. Rude as hell, unfriendly as a rabid dog. I've been to high-end clubs, dive bars, hired and fired security, but this place takes the cake. They're so rude, it's laughable. Got shoved outta there, hard. Some fat dude pinched my arm and told me I was getting escorted out 'cause I had my boot off and couldn't put it back on ( thanks to the crowd floating in the air). What the actual hell? Been to exclusive clubs in London and NY, this place is worse than a finger up my butt. I'd rather have my butt hair plucked than go back there. It's a damn shame, too. Great setting, awesome dancers, fantastic DJ, nice promoters, bartenders with smiles. But those security jerks? No way, man. Never going back, and neither should you.""",True,Hemingway

""Took the fam to this joint for Mother's Day, and boy, was it a bust. They were understaffed, overbooked, and the heat was sweltering. Fans were busted, misters weren't working yet. Servers were too busy to even fill our water glasses. And we had to wait 30 minutes for our table, which was just a generic, mass-produced mess. To top it off, the hostess burst into the bathroom, letting out a colorful language when she found both stalls occupied. Problem was, my five-year-old niece was in one of 'em. Staff's behavior? Manic and panicked. Sorry to give 'em a bad review, but they let me down hard.""",True,Hemingway

""A Groupon, prithee, didst I purchase, based on Yelp's fair words,
For this salon, with hopes of sweet rebirth.
The stylist, a nervous novice, didst seem,
As if his shears, for the first time, didst gleam.

His hands, they shook, and his pace, it was slow,
As if he never had cut hair, I do know.
And when I asked, what was the cost,
The receptionist, with a smile, didst boast,

'Twas but $35, a paltry sum, indeed,
For a service, worth $70, in their creed.
I saved but $5, a meager amount,
Yet still, my anger, doth now surmount.

For they do reserve, their best stylists,
For those who pay, the full price, they insist.
And thus, dear Folicle, take heed,
Lest thou lose clients, by thy deceit.""",True,Shakespeare

If anyone asks, I'll send 'em to Pinky's and make sure my foodie pals know where to grab a real burger on Montford. Don't waste your dough...\n\nAnd let me tell you, those reviewers who claim they've got great burgers clearly haven't been to Brooks (Charlotte's answer to Price's Chicken Coop) or The Liberty (high-end burgers that'll blow your mind).

No stars, wouldn't return.""",True,Hemingway

""I stepped into the salon, already feeling uneasy. Asked for a full set with polish, but the man said no. I was upset, but kept quiet. Earlier that day, I had called to confirm they took Discover. When I went to pay with my debit card, they said they didn't accept it. Unbelievable. I handed over a different card and left a five-dollar tip in cash. My nails looked uneven and not what I wanted.

To serve dishes fresh and with a gentle bent.
But alack, the service, oh so poor,
Didst leave a sour taste, and not a little bore.

So if thou seekest sustenance of the highest order,
Look not to this place, but to the one across the border.""",True,Shakespeare

A hundred dollars more, they did demand of me,

And leave the car with a shiny, new-like sheen.

So, with a heavy heart, I didst give them a rating,
A poor one, at that, for their uncivil behavior.""",True,Shakespeare

""Place was jammed, five o'clock crowd. Expected a wait, but saw plenty of open tables in the middle. More than enough waiters, too. Counted seven, twenty occupied tables. Don't know any waiter who'd work with just three tables for a decent night's pay. Waited forty-five minutes, finally got sat down.

How fared the Phillies, and couldst thou bring them near?
But she, with scorn and contempt in her eye,
Didst reply, ""I don't care,"" and didst not try.

Where barbecue and Tex-Mex doth reign supreme, a culinary art.
But now, in this new land, I find myself quite lost,
With naught but bland fare to tempt my taste, at any cost.

The atmosphere, I must confess, didst please mine eyes,
And our waitress, with her wit, didst bring some surprise.
But alas, the food, it didst not live up to its billing,
Tasteless and unseasoned, leaving me quite fulfilling.

Chicken fried steak, a dish most dear to mine heart,
Didst fail to impress, a sorry state of affairs, a part.
No seasoning, no flavor, just a bland, dry cube,
Deep-fried and served with naught but a sad, peppery gruel.

Oh, how I yearned for a dash of salt, a sprinkle of pepper,
To bring life to the dish, and make it worth the reckoner.
But alas, it seemed they didst forget, or perhaps didst not know,
That Texans demand more, their taste buds to make glow.

So here's my advice, to all who doth listen,
Add salt and pepper, lest ye wish to be dismissin'.
For flavor, it doth make, and turns a meal into a feast,
And leaves not thy customers in a state of utter disgust and unease.""",True,Shakespeare

The sun beat down on my neck as I stood in the Home Depot parking lot, waiting for someone - anyone - to come and assist me in the electrical department. Thirty minutes passed, and not a single soul had bothered to lift a finger. Finally, a customer service representative sauntered over, a look of indifference plastered across his face.

""I paged the person,"" he said, as if that were some sort of accomplishment. ""What else can I do?""

I glared at him, my anger simmering just below the surface. ""You can start by getting me some help,"" I snapped. ""I've been standing here for half an hour, and no one has bothered to even acknowledge me.""

The representative shrugged, clearly unbothered by my plight. ""Sorry to hear that. Maybe you should try the Val Vista store. They might be able to help you out.""

I shook my head, incredulous. ""You're telling me to go to another store? After I've already wasted thirty minutes of my time waiting for someone to help me here?""

Breakfast was subpar, and they didn't clean up the tables, so nowhere to sit and eat. Pool area was cordoned off, and the parking lot had big chunks closed off, too. All in all, a bust.

""Twas 12/23/2014, a day most fateful,
When first I penned my review, so eloquent,
Of Phoenix Music Lessons, a place of learning,
Where notes and chords did flow, like a river burning.

Months passed, and nary a word didst come,
From the owner, a man of some repute,
Until today, when forth he didst send,
A message, curious, and full of intent.

He wrote, ""I thought thee a good soul,
But felt a dislike, most foul and base,
That energy, it didst trouble me sore,
And made my heart feel heavy as a stone.""

His words, they didst conclude with a tale,
Of a doctor, a man of medicine and art,
Who didst perform a surgery, most skilled,
And left his patient whole, and free from hurt.

But lo, the owner, he didst not cease,
To contact me, by email and phone,
With offers of refund, and words of peace,
But I, a steadfast soul, didst none accept,
For my review, it was not made in jest,
But to warn others, and speak the truth,
That this owner, he doth not brook,
Dissenting voices, or opinions uncouth.

So here I stand, a witness true,
To the unprofessional ways,
Of one who doth not know,
The bounds of decency, and proper sway.""",True,Shakespeare

This bar didst not impress, despite its prime address.
My love and I didst venture there for lunch,
And found the service to be quite pleasant, perchance.
The waitress, kind and fair, didst recommend a feast,
A fried bologna sandwich, with fries, no less.
But lo, the sandwich, drenched in grease, didst lie,
A grilled delight, yet nigh impossible to consume, I swear.
I ate but three bites, and left the rest,
For fear of suffering from the dire effects.
My love, too, didst order fish and chips,
But alas, they were as greasy as the tips.

For heartburn's fiery torment, all day long, I do declare.

A Kugel Eis for my young son,

A Pappbecher, and twenty cents more,
For a Waffel, which my son cannot eat,
Due to his milk allergy, oh what a feat!
I didst decline, for the price was steep,
And the Kugel, already ninety cents, didst seem cheap.

So I didst ride forth, to find a new place,
Where Eis doth flow like a river in grace.
A kind Eisverkäuferin didst greet me with cheer,
And offered two Kugels, with Eis so clear.
The Zitrone was pleasant, but alas!
The Heidelbeer Eis didst not impress,
For it doth have ice crystals, and a strange taste,
Like a frozen puddle, with no creamy embrace.
Perhaps they doth rush the Eis, and not let it sit,
For a longer time, to let the flavors knit.

And so I didst discard it, with all my might.

Hark! A place I've longed to try,
The Blue Burger Grille, so nigh,
A building fair, with walls of blue,
That didst strike mine eyes anew.

But alas! The interior, oh so bright,
Didst cause mine eyes to take flight,
Blue concrete floors, tables too,
Even lightbulbs, all agleam, didst do.

Atmosphere, a part of dining's art,
This place didst lack, and thus didst smart,
Seventy-two dollars, for five to dine,
And but one soda, oh what a crime!

Food, overcooked, a shame indeed,
We ordered medium rare, yet 'twas medium well,
No need to send it back, we didst decide,
For we couldst not abide, the blue interior's tide.",True,Shakespeare

""Hark, what chaos doth ensue upon the road,
A coach, with children within, doth boldly go,
Against the flow of traffic, doth it make its way,
With nary care for safety, doth it sway.

The driver, a woman of Hispanic blood,
Doth hold her phone aloft, as if 'twere a shroud,
Her eyes, fixed on the screen, doth never stray,
As she doth steer the coach, with reckless sway.

Two trucks, with heavy loads, doth bear down fast,
And an eighteen-wheeler, doth come to pass,
Their brakes, they do lock up, in a desperate bid,
To cease their forward motion, ere they collide.

But lo, the coach doth stop, with screeching wheels,
And all the children, doth escape with ease,
The driver, she doth look up, with a start,
And sees the danger, that doth now depart.

And post it on Yelp, for all to flag,
The school, it doth belong, to Laveen's name,
A warning, to all, of danger's aim.""",True,Shakespeare

And called the desk, who sent a guard,
With bio-hazard bags, to hold our clothes, away,
From contamination, lest they spread the curse.

For managers, who seemed not to care,
And offered new digs, but we, in misery,

In the casino, her form unconscious laid.
But lo, she was not of our company,
Yet still they burst into our room, so rudely.

They woke my friends, who slept, their rest deep,
And forced them to leave, with no gentle creep.
One word doth sum it up, a single name,
Rude, oh rude, their behavior, a shame.""",True,Shakespeare

Two souls before me, yet I stand alone,
My friend, a comfort, in this dismal throne.
The clerk, rude and curt, doth interrupt my speech,
And sends me to her master, with no gentle breech.
He too, doth naught, to ease my plight,
Leaves me to suffer, in this sorry sight.

Saw 'em clean brushes in the water I was soaking in, then just rinsed the bowl out. Gross. \n2. My heels cracked bad after pedi, started bleeding.

There's a small ridge in the middle, that's just how they are. My other dentist said they're perfect. This guy also pushed for a deep cleaning, which I'd never heard of. He explained it, and that it had a $200 deductible. I mentioned it to my mom, a former hygienist, and she said it's for people with gum disease. My gums and teeth are healthy, so I passed. The dentist then offered to waive the deductible and not tell the insurance company. I was taken aback, but agreed. He spent five minutes in my mouth with some tool, and called it a deep cleaning.

Pamela's serves up a sorry excuse for breakfast. The grub's a travesty, but folks still line up for 20 minutes to suffer through a cramped, uncomfortable meal. I reckon it's popular for reasons unknown. Their pancakes, though, ain't half bad - crispy on the edges, cooked in some questionable substance that leaves me feeling queasy. Forgettable coffee, passable eggs, chewy bacon, and limp lyonnaise potatoes round out the menu. If you're dragged here, find new friends. If you can't, opt for pancakes with whipped cream to counterbalance the machine-made fat. Better options in Pittsburgh include Coca Caf\u00e9 or Square Caf\u00e9 for a nicer breakfast, or DeLuca's or JoJo's for a greasier spoon.

And thus, my expectations were not overly high,
But still, the service at this place did sorely bore,
For it took long minutes for our drinks to draw nigh.

With cellphones, while cooking, in a most unseemly way,
And one did walk and talk, with nary a care,
While others sipped their brews, with naught to fear.

A server kept her coffee cup close by,
Where syrup flowed, and it did seem quite sly,
Another's sat upon the counter, near the fire,
And yet another's, near the coffee maker's choir.

Instead, they were only serving basic dishes. \n\nI opted for the Chicken Sigsig, which was disappointing. It lacked flavor and tasted like a mixture of mayonnaise, old chicken, and jalapenos. If you're looking for a better Sigsig, I would recommend Cafe Moda. \n\nThe Whole Chicken was cooked perfectly, it was moist and tender, and the crispy skin was enjoyable. However, I didn't understand the hype surrounding the chicken's flavor. It seemed to be lacking something. \n\nThe Garlic Rice was good, but nothing special. \n\nThe Halo-Halo was the highlight of my meal. It was delicious and the best I've had in Las Vegas. \n\nThe service was friendly and attentive. \n\nHowever, I must advise against asking for tap water. It's unfiltered and hard. Bottled water is the better choice. \n\nIn summary, the food at Max's in Las Vegas is unimpressive and overpriced. I wouldn't return for the entrees unless they add the Beef Caldereta to the menu.

But no more, I tell ya. The service is hit or miss, and I ain't got time for that. Went on Valentine's Day, thought it was great, so we decided to try the Easter brunch. Big mistake. Got there at 12, and most of the food was picked over. Fruit, desserts, you name it. They had three scrambled egg dishes, salad, ham, turkey - marginal brunch, if you ask me. And the staff? Forget about it. They added a 20% gratuity and the bill came to $88. Never going back, and I live in the neighborhood. Gave 'em plenty of chances, complained and all, but they just couldn't figure it out.""",True,Hemingway

Sixty gold coins for a chamber, dank and grey.

And loud, the housekeepers do shout and play.

My wife, she asked for pillows, one more,
But nay, they say, 'tis on back order, no more.

Where luxury and comfort, do not abide well.

Turkish coffee - good.

Service: Friendly, helpful. Suspect they were wary of my questions.

He refused to let my friend enter, despite my membership allowing for a guest. I requested to speak with his manager, Pat, but she wouldn't even bother talking to me. Instead, she sent another manager, who didn't help either. After five minutes of arguing, the police showed up and ordered us to leave. Brandon didn't even have the decency to ask me to leave himself; he just called the cops and had them handle it. I've never had the police called on me before, and Officer Stranger treated me like a criminal, taking my information and escorting me and my friend out.

Order here for delivery, and by Jove,
The victuals have been satisfactory, I swear,
But there's a rub, a curious quirk, I fear.

Whenever I request curry, they ask,
""What level of heat dost thou desire, good sir?""
I answer, ""Three, a moderate pace,""
But lo, when it arrives, 'tis fiery hot,
A blazing inferno, nigh unbearable,
And late, oh so late, a woeful tale.

They promise ten to fifteen minutes' wait,
But fail, alas, to meet their own deadline,
And thus I pay for delivery, and a tip,
Yet still they falter, and my patience dip.

But I, a fool, persist in placing orders,
For soup and curry, despite past errors,
And now, when sick, I crave a milder brew,
But lo, they ask if I desire it spicy too.

I say no, not even a little, dear,
For I am ill, and cannot bear the fire,
But still they bring it, an hour late, alas,
And oh, the curry, it doth burn and sear.

With pleasant words, but overwhelmed, he didst moan.

The food, alas, didst taste of naught but woe,
As if it hadst lain out all day, and then didst go
Into the oven, to be reheated with haste,
And served up stale, with nary a taste to savour or taste.

The chips were stale, the salsa, a poor imitation,
Of that which Ortega doth provide, in stores, with no relation.
My shrimp dish, oh how dreadful it didst seem,
Overcooked and rubbery, with sauce that didst make me queasy and ill-at-ease.
The rice, too, was overcooked, and dry as dust,
And green salad, steamed, with nary a flavour to entice or lust.

In short, my friends, this Mexican food didst fail,
A sorry sight, with naught to recommend or avail.
My wife, at least, didst find her tacos somewhat fair,
But still, the cheese didst lack authenticity, and taste, beyond compare.",True,Shakespeare

A plague upon this house of victuals foul.
They seat thee swiftly, then forget thy name,
Leaving thee to pine, a wretched soul in pain.

A sorry sight, a bitter, tasteless mess.
Alas, what woe doth befall this wretched place!""",True,Shakespeare

""Hark, my dear companion, forsooth we didst stop at this place,
In dire need of sustenance, our bellies doth protest.
A maiden fair, with hair as golden as the sun,
Didst attend to us, but with a troubled brow,
Her mind consumed by puzzling payment's plight,
She didst not mark our presence, nor bid us good day.
We waited patiently, yet nary a soul didst bring
A draught to quench our thirst, or break our fast.
And so, we rose, and sought a different place,
Where fare was served, and hospitality didst grace.
Farmer Boys, a name that doth bespeak its worth,
Didst feed us well, for half the cost, in truth.
Denny's, alas, didst disappoint, with prices high,
Yet Farmer Boys, a humble abode, didst win our eye.""",True,Shakespeare

""I rolled into Vegas the week before Turkey Day, and the town was dead. Quiet, empty, and just the way I liked it. Pros: My room was silent as a tomb. Didn't hear a peep from anyone the whole time. Location was perfect - off the strip, just how I like it. Decor was top-notch, too. Reason I picked the place. Cozy, no casino, no shows, no late-night bars. Just peace and quiet. Free parking, free WiFi. Cons: The kids running the front desk need a crash course in manners and customer service. Unhelpful little punks. Booked through Priceline, paid in full months ago. Confirmed my reservation, too. Get there after a long drive, and they tell me I owe $75 a night for ""incidentals."" Never seen a fee that high at a hotel. Didn't have an extra $150 on me.

Food? Forget about it. Six garlic knots, small as quarters, cost $2.50. Average quality at best. Pizza? Showed it to me when I picked it up. Looked like a frozen pizza.

Alas, my dear friend, I found myself in quite a bind,
In fair Las Vegas, where dining options abound.
I sought a table at Craftsteak, a place I hold dear,
But alas, they were full, and my hopes did disappear.

So I didst reluctantly choose Delmonico instead,
With service that was good, but not quite as I'd hoped.
The server was friendly, but our rapport didst not click,
And thus, my dining experience didst suffer a bit.

But nay, the true test was yet to come,
For I hadst heard their rib eye was a culinary boon.
Alas, it was not so, for though it was flavorful,
It was tough and chewy, and left me feeling unfulfilled.

My palate doth prefer a tenderer bite,
And thus, I found the steak at Delmonico not quite right.
And so, my friend, I shall not return again,

""Methinks I didst wish to likest this place well,
Forsooth, I didst venture thither twain times,
During mine own sojourn in this fair town,

When asked what drink thou wouldst desire,
And thou dost answer, ""Water, prithee,""
The waitress doth reply, ""Art thou quite sure?
A lemon in thy water, peradventure?""
Indeed, the water they do serve doth taste foul,
And thus, my hopes were dashed, ere they were whole.

Again, I am a devotee of Kreplach broth,
And thus, when I didst espy it on their list,
My heart didst swell with joy, and I didst think,
""At last, a meal most wondrous and divine!""
But lo, the Kreplach didst appear quite thin,
As if they were produced en masse, and not within
The bounds of artisanal craftsmanship, alack!
And thus, my fondest hopes were brought to naught.

And should thou order but a half a sandwich,
The cole slaw they do provide, 'tis scarce enough,
A mere thimbleful, a trifle, a small morsel,
Barely enough to sate thy hunger's pangs, alas!
Yet, truth be told, the cole slaw didst taste fine,
A pity, then, that it didst come in such a tiny line.

The corned beef sandwiches, they didst seem to boast,
Of size, at least, and not of flavor, forsooth,
For though they were not bad, they were not great,
And thus, my satisfaction didst abate.

The entrance, too, didst strike me as quite odd,
A dizzying array of check-in, register, and shop,
With seating plain, and not at all opulent,
A far cry from the splendor I had hoped to witness.

In conclusion, then, this place doth fall short,
Of Tempe's notion of a Jewish deli, I do aver,
For though 'tis better than none, I must confess,
'Tis not the genuine article, alas, I do profess.""",True,Shakespeare

In days of yore, thy halls didst shine with grace,
And I, a humble patron, didst sing thy praise.
But now, alack! thy glory doth depart,
And in its stead, doth mediocrity reign.

My glass, once filled with nectar, doth run dry,
And though I ask, nary a drop doth come nigh.
The lettuce, once a leaf of crisp delight,
Doth now lie shredded, lost in ignominy's blight.

Thy iced coffee, once a sweet and frosty treat,
Doth vanish like a dream, leaving naught but heat.
And marinara, that tangy, savory delight,
Doth absent itself, a cruel and bitter plight.

Yet still, thy drafts of Bud Light, two dollars fine,
Do bring a smile, a fleeting joy divine.
But lo! A tomato, lopsided and misshapen,
Doth sully my burger, a sight most vexing.

An onion ring, a paltry, meager thing,
Doth mock my request, a sorry, laughable bringing.

And till thou changest, I shall not come again.""",True,Shakespeare

By far the worst, did leave me in dismay.
No teriyaki sauce, no katsu, alack!
Instead, they gave me soy sauce, all too plain.
And glowing red, o'er processed sweet and sour,
Did make my meal most unappetizing, I do declare.
Macaroni, o'ercooked and mushy, did appear,
With seasoning that did resemble pepper, quite queer.
The barbecue chicken, dry and tasteless, did lie,
Unable to discern the marinade, oh me, oh my!
The bed of veggies, old and dry, like fake grass,
Did make me question if this menu knew its class.
Hawaiian barbecue, or ghetto Chinese, who knows?

And thus, we tried their frozen hot chocolate,

Could not redeem the tavern from its faux pas,

Lacking the allure of a true Las Vegas haven,

Didst tempt my taste, with crumbs of Oreo, profound.

Whilst Caramel, a spot, of middling fame.

Thinking to enjoy, for Kaskade did play.
I bought my tickets online, with haste,
And waited in line, for entry, with waste.

The club, it was packed, and full of folk,
No tables found, nor space to stroke.

Moe's serves unremarkable grub. It doesn't hold a candle to others in its class—Qdoba, Chipotle, et al. The victuals were fresh, but lacked pizzazz. Burritos were puny, with scant fillings. My main gripe was the price. No way a burrito of that size, with that meager amount of rice, beans, and meat, should cost north of seven bucks for the regular size. I've had larger, tastier burritos for around five bucks. A small soda for two-fifty? Ridiculous (free refills, though).

You do get chips and salsa with your order. The chips were decent. Salsa, just okay. One strange thing: my wife ordered a Triple Lindy burrito in a bowl. It came in a white box. When you try to toss it, you can't fit the box in the trash can due to its odd design. Brainiac move...

""Hark, a craving for BBQ didst beset mine appetite,
And so, I sought out a place to sate my desire.
Aye, $35 worth of victuals didst I order, full of hope,
But alas, most of it didst not meet mine expectations.
The pulled pork, aye, 'twas passable, I do confess,
But the brisket, oh nay, 'twas but a mediocre mess.
The chicken, verily, 'twas but a middling fare,
And the beans, oh woe, they were undercooked, I swear.
Away, I didst throw them, with nary a qualm or care.
The sauces, aye, they were decent, I must allow,
But alack, the rest, oh nay, 'twas but a sorry show.
I didst ask mine father-in-law to make some brisket,
For none couldst I find, who couldst cook it, Southern-style, so neat.
The staff, aye, they were pleasant, full of cheer,

A steak, with whiz, onions, and peppers, I did choose,
But, alas, the flavor, they did forget, I suppose.
All bland, it was, and not a morsel could I taste,
Betwixt the meat and onions, a difference, there was none to trace.
The bread, too, did disappoint, soft and lacking bite,
No Amoroso, it did not resemble, in the slightest plight.

Yet, the patio, fair and bright, did please mine eyes,
And sweet potato fries, a delightful surprise.

I walked into the ship to store department to grab something, but the register was closed. Next to it was layway, and there were five people in line. The gent at the register said the other lane was closed. I told him to call for help, since I wasn't there for layway. Two other ladies in line agreed, saying they were waiting too, since no one would come help him. We were near the employee back entrance, so I told someone to go call someone to help him out. Within two minutes, someone showed up. They were still slow, but not as bad as before. It took almost thirty minutes from the time I arrived to when I finally got my two items. They let me pull around back to pick them up, since they were too big to wheel through the store on a flatbed cart. Not terrible service, but definitely a lack of help for customers.",True,Hemingway

For twenty-five pieces of silver, a paltry array.

Fresh, everything was, as it should be,
But simplicity, it seemed, was the decree.

Veggies, simple, sautéed with garlic's might,
And salt, a humble seasoning, yet oh so bright,
Such modest fare, yet satisfying,
Can't go amiss, for any soul's delight.

She liked it, but it was tiny for twelve bucks and came with three slices of plain bread. I went for the Abrequine, which they called a roast beef panini. But let me tell you, it didn't see any panini press. Small and flavorless. Chips were crispy but oily. Kids loved the gelato, I liked what I tasted.

We swung by this joint in Phoenix after hearing good things. Got there around 8:30 on a Friday night, and there was only one other couple ahead of us, so we were served quick.

Service was decent, but the employee who helped us seemed a bit tired or something. Like they'd been working a long shift or somethin'.

Ice cream wise, my husband went for the TC^2 and salted caramel, while I got the almond buttercrunch and apple cinnamon. Also tried the honey blue cheese and sugar and spice. Didn't get much almond flavor outta the almond buttercrunch, but the other flavors were alright. Texture was a bit icy, not super creamy like I'd hoped.

Pricing was reasonable, but I wouldn't go outta my way for this ice cream. If you're in the area and want some ""original"" flavors for a decent price, might be worth stoppin' in. But otherwise, there's better ice cream out there. Me and my husband were pretty meh about the whole thing. Spoiled by some great ice cream up in the SF bay area, I reckon.",True,Hemingway

""Flamingo, a relic of days past, doth stand,
A testament to time, when Vegas was young.
No gaudy pomp, no glitz, doth this hotel boast,
Just simple charm, that doth evoke the past.

A place of legend, where memories doth dwell,
The Flamingo, an icon, that doth tell
A tale of yore, when gambling doth reign,
And entertainment, doth bring joy, without refrain.

But alas, my friend, do not be fooled,
For though it doth seem, a place of old,
The rooms, they doth lack, in modern grace,
And cell phone signal, doth leave much to trace.

For its location, doth make up for the dance.
Close to other hotels, and the strip so bright,

Chicken, plenty, but veggies, scarce,
A balance, fair, I didst not find in this place.

The soup, just passable, the spring roll too,
But peanuts, raw, oh what a woe!
I craved the cooked, a proper treat,

Sides, an afterthought, portion size, immense. Daughter's mac and cheese, with applesauce, a small serving, yet satisfying. Wait staff, friendly and helpful, on a peaceful Sunday eve.

A sense of space, a feeling of art.

I went in to check the prices and see what they offered. The moment I walked in, a wave of stench hit me. I know having many dogs in a small space won't make it smell like roses, but I'd hope they clean the place occasionally. I asked about a service listed on their flyer and website and was told they don't offer it. Why list it, then? I also didn't like that from the front office, I couldn't see into the area where they kept the dogs, though I could hear them going wild. As I left, I noticed through broken blinds, there were many dogs in a small space with no one around. Side note: the couches in the photos on Yelp looked dangerous, too broken to be safe for dogs.

Chinese cuisine, by my troth, shouldst burst with bold flavors and crisp, fresh vegetables, in sooth, a feast for mine eyes. Alas, this hot pot of pork and tofu, a humble, uninspired dish, with naught but lettuce, a poor excuse for a garnish, doth fail my expectations.

Moreover, the pan-fried noodles with shrimp, a dish I held in high regard, proved itself to be insipid, lacking the verve and zest I had anticipated. Methinks the cooks herein, have lost their ardor for their craft, a sorrowful state, indeed.

For four dollars and fifty cents, a price most fair,
It was a steal, and worth it, beyond compare.

I didst skip the sushi, for I didst suspect,
'Twould be a poor excuse, for a meal, and not worth the inspect.
So I didst choose, the Ah Sin Fried Rice, instead,
But found it lacking, in flavor, and thus, it didst not please.

I also didst try, the Har Gow, shrimp dumplings,
Which were surprisingly good, but still, not worth the plummet.
For though they were tasty, they were not the best,
I have had better, and thus, I must confess.

And lastly, they didst charge, for hot tea, eight dollars,

""O, fair Aureole! How lovely art thou to behold,
Thy victuals, most divine! Yet, alas, thy service doth falter,
Like a ship without a rudder, lost at sea.
Reservations made at nine and thirty, we didst arrive,
And waited, waited, waited, for our turn to dine.
The waiter, he didst disappear, leaving us to ponder,
Their tablet, broken, with nary a drop of wine to savor.
He returned, some twenty minutes passed, with a scowl upon his face,
As if we were to blame for the device's disgrace.
Then, four times, he warned us, 'We'll be closing soon,'
As if we were not aware, the hour grew late, the moon full.
Food, oh food, how magnanimous! So very, very good!

And left us, in a sorry state,

And answered our queries, with disdain and hate.

And when our server came, our thirst he did quest.
We made our choices, from the limited fare,

Short rib tacos, sushi, and beef Wellington too,
Were the bright spots, in a meal most woe.
But alas, the rest, did leave us cold,
Mini churros, hard, and ice cream, old.

And rice, too small, doth dry out fast,

Cheaper than JPH, 'twas a wondrous sight,

My server, though, was quite good, his service most delightful and bright.

The food, alas, did not match his excellence, I do confess.
Lemon sole, a side salad, these were my choices, nothing more,
Yet with tax and tip, the sum totalled twenty dollars, I do declare.
The salad, fresh and crisp, was pleasant to the taste,
But the lemon caper sauce, oh how it failed to impress!
The sole, sautéed, they claimed, yet fried and tough it was,
A shame, for sole is tender, and needs but little cooking, alas.

Disappointment filled my heart, and I would not recommend this dish,
For Mimi's bread, though good, cannot make up for such a failure, I do wish.

Of empty tables, and service cold.
Three hostesses, fair and bright,
Didst banter amongst themselves, all night.
Their wit, sharp as a rapier's point,
Didst leave me standing, without a joint.
I waited, patient as a saint,
For two whole minutes, before they didst relent.
A glass of Pinot, I didst request,

'Twas opened long ago, I couldst tell,
And the bartender, he didst not well.

A dollar off, a meager offering.

Ordered some alligator tail as an appetizer and it was tasty. But the all-you-can-eat platters we usually get were only good towards the end. Seemed like they were usin' old oil to fry the fish and shrimp at first...yuck! Don't even wanna think about how old it was. But hey, at least they changed the oil to fresh oil at the end, so that was good.

The salad bar was pretty lackluster too. Coulda used some more maintenance, ya know? Maybe put the same items on both sides to make it easier to navigate without spillin' stuff everywhere. Did like how they kept the plates chilled though.

""Kabuki's a joint I know well, mostly for work lunches. But today, Saturday, I wanted to take the missus and kiddos out for some sushi. Service was a real bust, though. Guy named Andy, he had four or five tables, but all he cared about was griping to the other waiters about having to work on a nice day and chatting up the hostess about his weekend plans. Our apps and salads came after we finished our sushi, drinks went unfilled, and it took him 20 minutes to pick up my card and check. What a shame they can't find anyone who wants to work hard. Buyer beware, bad service, just okay food.""",True,Hemingway

""Hark! What light through yonder window breaks?
A menu, fair and full of cheer, doth make
My stomach grumble with delight. Steak and cheese,
A noble dish, doth cost but six pieces.
A Neopolitan milkshake, sweet and creamy,
Doth follow close behind, at four pieces more.
But wait, what's this? A gyro, priced at six,
Doth leave a sour taste within my mouth.
And panini, too, doth fail to impress,
At six pieces, it doth seem a bit too much.

But lo, the service doth lag behind,
Despite the emptiness of this place.
Yet still, I say, 'tis passable, my friend,
If thou art starving, hungover, or in need.
So, enter here, and take a seat,
For though the fare may not be grand,
'Twill fill thy belly and ease thy woe,

""This joint gets three knocks for a few reasons. First, the blueberry scone was straight-up terrible. Not sweet, almost savory, and had a weird gritty texture. Not good.

The tortilla chips, I swear, didst lack the freshness of yore, and thus, their flavor didst suffer.  And burritos, thou askest?  Alas, they doth offer them but on certain days, a strange and woeful fact, indeed.  The chicken quesadilla, a dish I didst hope to savor, didst fall short of my expectations, I do declare.

Fruit flavor, and lo! 'Twas one I could not abide.
No tart, no plain, to soothe my taste buds' fire,
And thus, I left, with naught but disappointment's ire.

The server, didst not even acknowledge the poor quality and presentation, nor did he ask, if we didst enjoy the meal. Alas, 'tis a sign of the nonchalance attitude, that doth pervade this place.

Buffalo sauce was solid, but what's the point when the chicken's inedible? Baked potato fries were a nice idea, but they were soggy as hell. Maybe it was just the delivery, though.

Mochi was an unnecessary addition. $67, including tip, seemed steep for such an underwhelming experience. Won't be back.""",True,Hemingway

The soda looked like weak tea, and I wasn't offered a refill.  The quesadilla looked good, but the guac was skimpy.  The dried onion garnish was unnecessary.

Yet, the victuals were good, fresh as the morning dew, and neatly prepared, alack! The portions, small they were, akin to the petals of a flower. Twice the cost of that in fair Washington, a princely sum indeed. But, lo! The drinks, they were reasonable, my Manhattan martini, generous and ten dollars, the same in DC, by the grace of the gods. At the sushi bar, I did sit, and behold! An impressive display, huge and animated, did entertain me, behind the sushi chefs, a wondrous sight.

Or in hidden corners, where they couldst not be seen, alas!

As for the victuals, a burger with fries didst I devour,
Prepared as described on the menu, without a single flaw.
But alas, methinks there's no cause for me to return anon,

A plate of salt and pepper calamari, priced at seven gold coins for fourteen pieces, arrived bereft of seasoning, swimming in a sea of grease. Sweet and sour sauce, served in cups, didst accompany this dish, yet the fried carrot garnish, it didst steal the show. A'special combination' bahn mi, adorned with a smiling visage on the menu, didst fail to impress. Meat, stacked haphazardly on one end, didst leave me no choice but to disassemble it, revealing blackened pieces, tainted by an eerie hue, reminiscent of spoiled fare.

For serving up a broth so salty, 'twas nigh undrinkable, ay!
And sticky rice, a paltry sum, didst cost me twelve,

Friday eve, I chanced upon a new Panera,
With youthful friend in tow, to dine and share.
She sought a bread bowl, full of soup, so fair,
But staff member snarled, ""Bread bowls? Nay, we've none there.""

Whilst I, a Thai flatbread, savory and gladden.

The decor, unimpressive, with poor lighting beat.
Tables, unclean, with toilet paper in plain sight,
Awaiting food, I ventured forth, to do my duty right.

Yet prices lower, than Paradise, or Wildflower's excess.

Thirty minutes, they did say, yet an hour did pass, in verity.
Three gyros and more, we did request,

I craved drunken noodles, found this joint, and gave it a shot. Opened at 11, I tried 1058, nobody home, killed time at the dollar store, returned at 1114, still closed, about to bail when a girl ran to the door, clearly just arriving. Ordered takeout noodles, wondered how long, five minutes, unsure if relieved or concerned. Greasy, reheated, flavors lacked zest. Had decent drunken noodles in San Diego, seeking comparable quality here. Third try with noodles, a few other Thai meals, worst thus far. Unfamiliar with Thai cuisine, recognize freshness, didn't get it here. Also, smelled like old lady mothballs.",True,Hemingway

And told her our plight, but she didst dismiss,
Our needs, with haste, and didst not deign,
To help us, in any way, or show us grace.

It was a woeful experience, indeed,
And thus, their business, we didst decline,
For though their wares were fair, and many,
Their hospitality, was most uncivil, and dry.

The venue itself was pleasant, offering both indoor and outdoor seating. \n\nI ordered two vegetarian sandwiches, for my vegan sister and myself, requesting dressing on the side and nary a trace of cheese. Upon arriving home, I discovered both salads adorned with dressing and cheese, much to my dismay. A stray hair in my salad didst further dampen my spirits. The sandwich, though somewhat soggy, didst possess a certain je ne sais quoi. \n\nMethinks I shall return anon, should fate guide me to these environs once more.""",True,Shakespeare

The Shoppes at Wynn Las Vegas are no joke, kid. They got high-end stores like Barney's, Coach, and Burberry. They're caterin' to the rich folks who can afford that kinda luxury. My buddies and I checked out Michael Kors and my girl found a purse she liked. The associate said it was $1400 and she quickly put it back and walked away. We ain't got that kinda money, so we were just lookin'. The place itself ain't too special, but there's a two-story waterfall in the middle that's pretty cool. Lots of tourists takin' pictures, so you might wanna join in on the fun. If you're a regular Joe like me, you might wanna check out Miracle Mile or Fashion Show instead.

For though 'tis near, 'twas an hour in coming,

But let us see, forsooth, what lies within,
Perhaps some cheese, or sauce of sweetest sin,
A crust, a topping, all things in their place,
Yet naught can make amends for time misplaced.

Alas, poor pizza, art thou doomed to fail,
For slow delivery doth thy worth assail?
Or shall I say, thy flavor doth prevail,
Despite the wait that did my patience frail?

That pizza, though delayed, may yet be fair,
For he who cooked it, did his best, no doubt,
And thus, a verdict, I shall not pronounce out.""",True,Shakespeare

A place of wonder, a sight most fair.
I chanced upon a eatery, renowned far and wide,
Whose fame did precede it, a reputation quite grand.

Inside, a chaos did greet mine eyes,
A tumult of sound, a cacophony of surprise.
We sought a seat, but none could be found,
Till a voice did call, and bid us sit down.

And wait we did, for many a minute,
Until a servant came, with purpose and intent.
Two more did follow, swift and sure,
To take our order, and show they did care.

The food, alas, was naught but average,
No flavor unique, no spice to engage.
The fries, a curiosity, stuffed inside,
A novelty, perhaps, but not worth the stride.

With wonder still, at its great embrace.

The mystery of its fame, I shall forever find.""",True,Shakespeare

Long bar, like you'd expect in Vegas, and a bunch of cramped tables and booths. Server was nice enough, pointed out a few options she thought I'd be able to have. Didn't seem too sure about the gluten-free stuff, though. Asked the kitchen if I could have the nachos, they said yeah, but I prob'ly shoulda been more careful 'cause of the language barrier. Heard the kitchen staff talkin' and it sounded like they weren't too sure either.

Went with the nachos anyway, they were pretty good. Chicken, cilantro sauce, nacho cheese, and jalapeños. Good-sized portion, took some leftovers with me for later. Didn't get sick, so I guess the nachos are okay here. Other notes, heard another customer complain about dirty silverware, mine was alright. Food came out pretty quick, but not a lot of attention from the servers. Prices were average for airport grub.

Overall, it's alright. Might try somethin' different next time I'm in the airport.""",True,Hemingway

""Alas, how this franchise hath marred my view  
Of yon restaurant chain, once held in high esteem.  
The quality, in sooth, hath woefully declined,  
Since opening day, when all seemed bright and serene.  
A noble burger, prithee, doth not make amends  
For poor service and fare, that doth offend.  
This, my last visit, shall be forevermore,  
For Fudd's, alack, doth fail to meet my needs,  
In combos, fries, and rings, they doth fall short,  
And dirty tables, restrooms, floors, do beset.  
They doth nickel and dime, with nary a care,  
Their patrons, who doth pay, yet receive not their due.  
Farewell, Fudd's, thy glory days are past,  
For now, thy name doth conjure images most vile.""",True,Shakespeare

""Terrible grub and drinks, but digs were tight. Staff and managers were on it. Packed on First Friday, bad call. Manager said he hadn't tried the food yet. Sign number two of a poorly executed joint. Beer selection was weak, mixed drinks were watered down and sucked. Apps were a bust, chips were chewy, dips were flavorless. Tacos were dry, temp was off, calamari was too breaded and fried, chicken was bland. Service was good though, they comped our meal and asked us to return.

New employees were just looking for extra cash, not putting their heart and soul into cooking, delivery, and service. Food quality suffered, and prices kept rising.

Didn't feel sick afterward either. \n\nThe meh: Had chicken, mushrooms, and the Shanghai Angus steak. They were alright. Strong flavors made everything taste the same.

And waited but a score of minutes, no great shakes.
At bar, I didst sit, and Mojito didst order,

In outdoor dining area, we didst sit,
With live music below, a most pleasant treat.
But alas, twas the end of good times there,
For service didst lag, and drinks didst take their sweet time to appear.

Each of us didst order differently,
But food, alack, didst not impress, I do declare.
Appetizers came forthwith, cheese and chips,
But entrees, oh dear, three small tacos, priced quite steep.

But alas, my dear, last year's Black Friday told
A tale of woe and endless strife,
With naught but chaos, noise, and life.

Yet this year, I vowed to plan ahead,
To avoid the madness that doth spread
Like wildfire through the crowded halls,
And thus, I rose early, with purpose calls.

At ten and forty, I didst set forth,
When few didst roam the shopping earth,
And lo, the merchandise didst lie
In orderly fashion, with nary a sigh.

All that I sought, in its proper place,
Four items, alack, didst fill my hand,
A gift, alas, among them, didst stand.

Now mark, my dear, the difference vast,
Betwixt this morn and that of old, aghast,
For though 'twas calm, with naught but cheer,
The Forum Shops didst play host, my dear.

And note, my dear, the strange sight seen,
Of one who climbed the escalator unclean,
With drink in hand, and footsteps slow,
A spectacle, my dear, to make thee grow.

With great anticipation, I didst go,
For its reputation, I didst not know.

With old-timey decor, and famous ones.
The service, professional and keen,
Didst make me feel, like royalty, I had been.

The food, good, but not great, I must say,
Seemed like the kitchen, played it safe, each day.
Above average, the portions were,
But not as good, as I had hoped, I do declare.

My veal dish, good, but not as expected,
Based on Rao's fame, and what was projected.
So, Rao's has a fun setting, indeed,

Yesterday, I visited this establishment and was disappointed. Our server was friendly, but the food was subpar.

We stuck it out since we didn't pay, but otherwise, we'd have bailed. Might hit up the other Regal joint on Northsight. Thought Scottsdale was ritzy, but this place? Deserted and full of oldies.

""This place doth not deserve three stars, nay, 'tis but a two.
The chambers reek of mold and mildew, the linens be not clean,
And all about doth seem worn down, like a once-proud queen.
In days of yore, perchance, it was a place of renown,
But now, alas, 'tis naught but a faded crown.

The beds, they be lumpy, and the sheets, of dubious cleanliness,
Did make me search for bed bugs, though none were seen,
Yet in the tub, a tiny creature didst make its presence known.

With water pressure strong and hot, a wondrous employ.
Still, I shall not return, for this place doth not befit
A man of stature, nor a lady of great wit.""",True,Shakespeare

With eager hearts, seeking a culinary score.
But alas, our hopes were soon to be deflated,
For the zucchini fingers, once crispy, were now degenerated.
They bent and faltered, lacking former grace,
And the tatziki sauce, once a staple, now cost a place.
Akin to ketchup at a diner, a fee so base,
For a small container, how could they show such face?

The zucchini, too, did cry out for some salt,
My beef and lamb gyro, dry as the fault.
Hubby's Oscar burger, with pastrami in tow,
Dry as the desert sands, how could it grow?

The salad, drenched in dressing, a sight to behold,
A cup of it, oh how the flavors did unfold!

On a bustling Sunday eve, I chanced upon this eatery,
To fetch a take-out meal, my hunger to assuage.
But lo! The crowd did swarm, both in and out,
And in the bar, they waited, their patience to rout.

I managed to place my order, with much ado,
With the harried take-out manager, who didst shine through.
But alas! The rest, a sorry sight didst make,
No drink didst they offer, nor a glass of water to slake.

Thirty minutes passed, and still we didst wait,
As the orders didst pile up, and the din didst abate.
The food, when finally served, didst meet my gaze,
In a unique container, with croutons and dressing in a daze.
A separator, too, didst keep all fresh and neat,
The cold from hot, didst prevent any culinary defeat.

Alas! Two stars, I must confess, didst this place deserve,
For tidiness, it lacked, and the bar staff didst not preserve.

A worthy visit, despite some flaws, didst this dining experience divine.",True,Shakespeare

While I, a patient, didst pour out my soul's distress.

On a Friday eve, we chanced to dine
At a place that looked quite full, yet we did find
A table straightaway, and service was good
Our waitress keen, and ever at her post

I ordered ribs, and shrimp beside
The latter were fine, but the former did not abide
By the standards of a BBQ feast
Dry and lacking moisture, it did not pass the test
My wife had steak, but alas, 'twas mostly fat
A disappointment, that which we did not expect

Nearby, a rowdy group did make a din
Drunk and loud, they did disturb the peace within
It seemed the staff did not take issue with their ways
But for myself, 'twas not a pleasant day's

Thus, my experience did not incline me to return
Nor do I plan to, in the near future, I do learn",True,Shakespeare

Chocolate, vanilla, guest (Espresso, once),
A paltry selection, devoid of flair,
And those who serve, their welcome scarce.

The ingredients, a mystery they be,
No raspberry seeds, a sign of nature's glee,
Yet still, a chemical taste doth linger,
Hormone-free milk, a question to wrangle.

A quaint spot, nonetheless, that draws a crowd,
Of young and old, a veritable cloud,
And K-9 Custard, dogs delight,

The server offered a weak excuse about their computer crashing, which didn't explain why other tables that ordered after us received their food promptly. I would have preferred honesty over a ridiculous lie. The food was well-prepared and tasted good, but we spent more time waiting than eating. After waiting 10 minutes for the check and another 5 minutes for change, we left a 12% tip to express our dissatisfaction with the service.

Maybe a couple drinks'll make me forget the taste.""",True,Hemingway

""Another Asian-inspired joint in Champaign? Really? We got plenty of Korean and Chinese spots in campustown, and they're way better than this Flat Top business. \n\nTheir stir-fry thing is just Mongolian BBQ with a ton of raw veggies and weird sauces. I went with brown rice, clams, beef, veggies, salmon, and roti prata. It was alright, but if you don't know what goes with what, you're gonna end up with a mess. \n\nIt's smart of 'em to have this pick-your-own-ingredients thing going on, 'cause if the food sucks, they can just blame you for choosing the wrong stuff. But hey, the grill sensei ain't off the hook either. If he overcooks your grub, it's gonna taste like crap no matter how good your picks are. My buddy's moo shu was a mess, with some of the rolls falling apart. That's your dinner down the drain. \n\nWorth trying once, maybe, but more than that? Your call. And let me tell you, that rice, salmon, and roti prata combo still bugs me. Maybe I'm just a snob who thinks chickpea dhal is the only way to go. One-hit wonder like Bar Louie?

A score of ten, with single trip, doth thus unfold,
Five for food, a feast most wondrous and fine,
Six for service, with haste and diligence divine,
Seven for atmosphere, a space most fair and bright,
Eight for value, a price most reasonable and right.

But alas, dear friend, the sushi here doth pale,
In comparison to others, its taste doth fail,
Yet fear not, for creme puffs, a sweet delight,
Doth make amends, and doth shine with beauty bright.

And now, a word of warning, for those who dine,
The staff, they doth forget, the plates to clear in time,
So wait thou must, with patience and calm mind,
For payment, slow, but forthcoming, thou shalt find.

Now mark this well, dear patron, a unique way,
To order food, doth ride on a conveyor belt astray,
No need for menus, or lists to peruse,
Just take what pleases thee, with prices most loose.

A first, in this land, of such culinary glee,
So come, dear friends, and try this place,
With food cheap, and fun, in this conveyor race.""",True,Shakespeare

The pork, a tad chilly, yet still quite nice,

Are you kidding me? We're a couple of forty-somethings. You think we're gonna dine-and-dash? Reluctantly gave her my card. Fights started, but not all the TVs were tuned in. Had to crane my neck.

We've dined at Michael Mina's, a similar tale,

Awaiting their perusal of my garb, so neat.
Five associates here, and three customers, I see,
Yet nary a greeting did they offer to me.

I stood, a patient man, for five long minutes,
Until a surly soul did finally approach.
Their selection grand, yet atmosphere quite vile,
Doth make the shopping experience most dire.

A sign doth read, 'Like us on Facebook,'
But friendships they do not seem to seek.

For Buffalo Exchange, my heart doth cleave.

For we didst sit at the bar, to watch the game with ease.

Was it the poor menu, or perhaps something else,
That doth escape my comprehension, I know not,
But truly, the fare was most disappointing, I do protest.""",True,Shakespeare

Thou mayst discover frozen morsels amidst the offerings, should thou venture to partake of the central portions. \n\nVerily, I didst visit the privy during my repast, and beheld an employee emerge, sans cleansing her hands, to tend the buffet line, proffering flesh to guests.

Drip tips and batteries, a sight most arrayed.
And liquids too, of brands I had not known,
A treasure trove, for one who's oft alone.

But alas, no one was there to answer my queries,
So I took some cards, and made note of their merchandise,
And left, with plans to return anon,
When perhaps, someone might be more awake, and not so gone.

But testers, none, to sample, a slight.

Yelling loud, like one possessed of thee,
And caused my daughter's wonder and glee.

Seek out the gates of A and B, my friend, For there, the crowd doth thin, and security doth end. 'Tis a haven, free from tumult and from strife, Where thou mayst pass, with ease, into the life.

Rolls o'erflowing with rice, and scarce a bit
Of fish within. I'd pay more, and have it worth,

A feast fit for a king, or so it seemed,
Yet, alas, the price did leave me quite dismayed.

I ventured forth to this establishment,
In Balyntyne's suburbs, a journey of some distance,
To partake in their Southern cuisine,
And sample their delicious victuals, of which I had heard.

Arriving at eleven thirty, the crowd was scarce,
I was one of the first to grace their door,
The service was swift, the fare was hot,
But, alack, the cost did leave me feeling poor.

Three and a half stars, I would give,
For the portion size, a bit too small,
Ten dollars, I did pay, without a drink,
A price, I fear, that doth not sit well with me.

By running out of cilantro, alack!
Our burritos, though still tasty, didst lack a certain je ne sais quoi,
That herb most dear, which doth make the dish complete, didst fail to show.

Flat and odd-coloured, a sight most surmise,

With meat sauce, a flavour so rich and fine,
They give thee a popsicle stick, to lift it with ease,
And the hot dog, so flattened, yet oh so sweet,
With toppings galore, a taste so unique,
Like White Castle, but with a wild streak,
From the Great White North, where the wolves do roam,

On St. Patrick's Day, I witnessed a contest between the A's and the Giants, two teams of great renown. My kinfolk, divided in their loyalties, did don the colors of both sides, a sight most curious. The park, a marvel of design and space, did boast a capacity grand and fair. The parking, a bargain, and the concessions, plentiful and dear. But alas, our seats, located in the outfield's expanse, did suffer from a lack of comfort, ill-suited for men of stature. And grass, a scarcity, did leave us longing for a softer repose. Yet, despite these quibbles, the game did prove most enjoyable, the Giants emerging victorious. I do confess, a return to this venue doth hold great appeal.",True,Shakespeare

The sides, unimpressive, lacking in delight.

Disappointment, nigh, doth cast its sway.
A reservation, made, yet still we waited,

But here, alas, I shall not dine,

No MSG, just pure, unadulterated flavor from chicken and veggies. \n\nI went for the Sliced beef noodle soup, Thai style.

And found it wanting, alas, in juiciness,
But praise be to the fries, for they were well-seasoned,

Not overly kind, yet not so poor as to sting,

In this fair establishment, we dined with woe,
Our day had been most foul and full of sorrow.
We entered, and found the place to be quite neat,
Few patrons sat by the bar, a tranquil scene.
I ordered the fagioli soup, a hearty brew,
It pleased my taste, and filled my belly too.
The veal piccata, a dish most fine and fair,
I savored its flavor, though the veggies were bare.

In frozen custard, rich and creamy delight.

As we did choose, from toppings great and bright,
To adorn our cups, with flavors to amend.

Vanilla, pure and simple, did I choose,
With sprinkles, colorful and bright,
My husband, chocolate, unadorned did use,
And swiftly, our order did the maid bring forth.

Alas, the flavors, weak and faint did lie,

Stains in the bath and toilet, too,
From cigarette burns, of old, did brew.

Came for breakfast, wanted the stuffed French toast. No peanut butter for me, please. Asked for Nutella and banana instead. No problem. Thought I was getting Nutella, but it wasn't as dark.

A few dings, I must confess, for seating, rough and worn. Rusty nails, a danger, booths, in disrepair, forlorn. Yet, still, the best option, for dining in, they do present.

At Fleur de Lys, a place of gastronomic shrine.

An onion soup, rich and earthy, they brought,
With shaved truffles and duck, a curious thought.
The salmon, gently heated, a delight,
But the sauce, alas, tasted of grass in the night.

My friend's short ribs, braised in stout, a treat,
But the trio of chocolates, oh how they did defeat.
A dry souffle, a salty shake, and Baily's ice,
None of them pleased, alas, my taste's device.

Perhaps I expected too much, I do confess,
But Hubert Keller's name, a reputation to impress.
Maybe a bad night, who knows, I do not say,
But other places, incredible, in Vegas' way.

Great service, great wine, a reasonable price,

""Upon a Thursday eve, we dined at Steelz,
With our young son of fourteen months,
Though they provide child seats, 'tis not a place
For tiny tots, so we do not recommend
Their venue for families with small children.

But for those who crave delicious fare,
'Tis a fine establishment indeed,
We started with crabcakes, quite tasty,
Yet lacking crunch, a bit more pan time,
The spicy aioli, a delightful treat.

I savored the brie and bacon burger,
A juicy patty, good quality meat,
Soft bun, well-cooked, a satisfying meal,
Alas, no fries, a disappointment, indeed.
My wife enjoyed the lobster bisque,
Flavorsome, yet the sherry overpowered,
She also had the beef and blue salad,
Excellent cheese, a highlight of the night.

After two buffets, thou dost feel quite sick,
And dost desire to flee to a privy,
Or grab a roll of Tums, to ease thy qualm.
But nay, in Vegas, we do lose our wits,
And eat until our bellies do protest.

Our third buffet, a dinner stop, 'twas,
With crepes, so delicate and fine,
I took them plain, with powdered sugar,
And the nice lady made them, oh so well.
Ugh, I had two, my stomach did protest.

The seafood, a mix of crab, shrimp, mussels,
And clams, not the best, but sufficient.
Desserts, a vast array, nothing too grand,
But enough to sate thy sweet tooth's demand.

The duck, with orange sauce and rice pilaf,
Was quite tasty, I must needs confess.

For they were the same, in every mess.

And those who wish to partake of the feast,
Should come betimes, lest they be left in the cold,
With naught but a stool to call their own.

But fear not, dear friends, for I didst find,
A table upstairs, where I couldst sit and ponder,
The mysteries of the universe, and sip,
Upon a draught of Pumking, or so I didst think.

Alas, the price of ten dollars didst seem steep,
For a small glass of the brew, so I didst choose,
A bottle of Purple Haze, a favorite of mine,
To quench my thirst and lift my spirits high.

Now mark this well, dear friends, for 'tis a tale,
Of a bartender, who didst ring up my fare,
For three dollars, a sum most fair and bright,
A glitch in the system, a happy sight.

But alas, the second round didst not bring,
Such luck, yet the bartender, didst make me sing,
With news of the Stack'd special sauce, so sweet,
That I didst stay, and partake of the treat.

With cheese and bacon, a feast fit for a king,
I didst devour it, with gusto and delight,

Second course was pasta with a meat sauce. That was the best dish, no question. Entree was a flat iron steak. Good, not amazing. Dessert was blue cotton candy and chocolate cake w banana gelato. Cotton candy was a nice touch. \n\nBut, man, the wine pairings were a real bummer. Waiter didn't know much about 'em and gave us the same pairings no matter what we ordered.

Wrapped in bacon, a curious sight, indeed,
But chicken, here, doth pale in comparison.

Pao de Queijo, fried bananas, and mashed potatoes,
Sides that complement the meats, no doubt,

My first time at the gun range. Fun, sure. But let's get down to business. Pros and Cons, that's what I'm looking at.

Pros:

* Knowledgeable staff. They knew their stuff, no question.
* Plenty of firepower. You want to shoot something? They got it.

Cons:

* Busy. That's a good thing for them, but you'll wait. Weekends, especially.
* Small. People sitting on the floor, standing in corners. Shoulder to shoulder.
* Flustered range officers. Overwhelmed, trying to keep up. Can't blame 'em. Thirty people with rifles and pistols walking in all at once? No thanks.
* Price. Expensive. Shared a lane and gun with my sisters for 30 minutes. $88. Heard it was $15 per gun. Not worth it.

In Las Vegas, a city of grandiose treats.
Impressive, yes, but not as good as some,
Ka or O, the best, leave all others to succumb.

A slow pace, with moments of slumber,
My mother, her eyes did heavy surrender.
The interludes, too long, and of little worth,
In my view, a waste, a thing of scorn and dearth.

Mystere may impress, a worthy sight.

Kudos, fair ones, for thy preparation at this early stage. \n\nA platter of melted rosemary brie, with strawberry relish, we didst share betwixt us. The brie, rich and creamy, didst absorb the rosemary's essence, while the relish, made from strawberries, didst burst with flavor. A drizzle of balsamic reduction, methinks, wouldst elevate this dish to new heights. \n\nThence, we ventured forth to sample the BLT burger and its spicy counterpart. The fiery coals of the grill, they didst sear the patties, locking in the juices and creating a crunchy crust. Fresh and lively, all the fixings didst complement the meat. The bun, toasted to a golden brown, didst retain its softness within. \n\nFries, alas, didst require a touch more refinement, but fear not, for this was merely a soft opening. \n\nTheir drink menu, diverse and clever, didst educate and intrigue. \n\nI do anticipate our next visit, that we may savor more of their culinary delights.""",True,Shakespeare

In this grand establishment, we didst find solace and comfort. Our waiter, a merry gentleman, didst attend to us with haste and cheer. I didst order the twelve-ounce New York strip steak, rare as the morning dew. Alas, 'twas overcooked, a sorrowful sight indeed. I didst partake of it, for my hunger didst prevail, yet I didst express my discontent to the waiter, who didst offer a new dish, which I didst decline, for I was in haste and my belly didst yearn for sustenance.

We searched high and low, but nary a sign didst we see,

Our quest for breakfast didst prove quite futile, indeed.

We circled round, lost in the heat of the day,

The location of this elusive eatery,
And thus, our hunger didst begin to appease.

But alas, the ""banging pocket"" didst not impress,
A pita filled with sausage, eggs, and naught else,
No onions, mushrooms, or such, didst grace the dish,
Leaving us underwhelmed, in truth, quite vexed.

The seating, scarce, didst force us to wait,
Or sit outside, in sunshine fierce and bright,

Minor gripe, the cheese board could've used a few more oatcakes and some more onion marmalade. Brie was a bit dried out and the cheese knife looked like it's seen better days. Handle was cracked near the base of the blade.

No clue if the interior's changed since it was a Harry Ramsden's, but it's well-decorated and gets plenty of sunlight. I'll be back.",True,Hemingway

""Coffee joint straight outta 1920s hipster heaven. Dungarees and boots to match, check. Vintage roaster, prominently displayed and well-used, you bet. Craft coffee drought in my town, line out the door, yep. Scored an espresso, efficient service, good but not great, too fruity, not enough chocolatey smoothness, imho. Girl ordered pour-over, waited ten min, forgot, asked, wait another ten, derp. Tasted her cup, delish. Good thing goin', few tweaks needed, I'd return.""",True,Hemingway

""With kin, we dined, in atmosphere snug and warm,
Amidst a Sunday's quiet, almost lifeless storm.
At entry, stench of sewer did our senses greet,
And with disgust, our hopes did quickly retreat.
Yet still, we wished to sample their fair,
Sushi, our love, fifteen times a month we share.
Alas, this place did not meet our standards high,
More akin to market's offerings, did it lie.
Fare was just passable, variety vast,
But oh, how flavors failed, at such cost vast!""",True,Shakespeare

""Upon mine eyes, this place didst catch my sight,
On Bar Rescue, it didst shine so bright.
My wife and I, didst venture forth that night,
About the ninth hour, we didst arrive in sight.

With hunger pangs, my belly didst protest,
And thus, I planned to dine, and quench my thirst.
But lo, the bartender, didst say with haste,
The kitchen, closed, for slow night's waste.

One ale, I didst imbibe, yet still I stayed,
For in my belly, emptiness didst reign.
Alas, I could not drink, without a feast,
And thus, I left, with disappointment's stain.

And give this place another chance to learn.
For friendly locals, didst greet us with cheer,
And bartender, too, was pleasant, my dear.""",True,Shakespeare

""Fair prithee, gentle reader, listen well,
For I have tales to tell of yonder meal,

The plate, alongside gravy, rich and savory,
Green beans, a verdant delight, did dance
In harmony with the salad, fresh and healthy.

But alas, fair reader, 'twas not all bright,
For coming in, we found no welcome sight,
No host to guide us, lost and confused we stood,
Till one kind soul did bid us take a seat.

Yet, patience, dear reader, for all was not amiss,
For family-owned, this place doth truly bless,
And though the wait, a mite confusing, did last,
The food, a true delight, did make up for the past.

To flavors rich, and family warmth, so dear,

""Hark! A barbecue at an airport doth exist,
A place where thou may find some solace in thy hunger's twist.
'Tis not the best of BBQ, but 'tis not so bad,
Compared to other options, 'tis quite a happy lad.

I chose the platter of three meats,
Brisket, pork, and turkey, a feast most meet.
The brisket, alas, was fatty,
But still, my taste buds did dance with glee.

The pork, it was decent, a slight delight,
But the turkey, oh, it lacked moisture, a sorry sight.

Yet, it complemented well, without being too tremble.

And VIP couches, too, for those who prize.
But, truth be told, the space is quaint and small,
No need to pay the extra fee, at all.

Two waitresses, they doth scurry round,
To fill the patrons' orders, profound.

Seating starts at 8:30, so arrive, we must, ere then.

Ten bucks, or so, the cost, a fair price,
For sugar's delight, in this nice place.

I went out with my guy last night and we had a great time at this joint. The patio was top-notch, nice view, quiet, and secluded even though it's right above Indian School Road. They got a killer wine and beer selection, lots of local options too. Food was alright, not amazing though. Started with some solid fries, had rosemary and parmesan, and a decent dipping sauce. Pizza was pretty good, had some caramelized onions, mushrooms, Italian sausage, and a good crust. Not too crispy, not too soft, but you definitely need a fork and knife for it. Ragu was different, kinda like a shredded beef burrito but in a bowl with penne pasta instead of a tortilla. Wasn't terrible, just unexpected. Wished we tried dessert, they looked great.

The lass behind the counter, didst interrupt mine friend,
As he began to order, with a shout, so unbecoming, I didst frown.
Our victuals took a while, but when they arrived,
They looked most fair and tempting, our hunger to assuage.

What we didst order, I shall now recount,
A red velvet wafflenut, a Nutella and almond wafflenut,
The Fat Elvis waffle, a strawberry and chocolate waffle,
And a Vegas churro waffle, with honey, cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla ice cream, so cool.

All was well, the churro waffle, our favorite, by far,

""Last Saturday, my heart was filled with mirth and glee,
As I did venture forth to see Billy Gardell,
A comedian of great renown, and wit so keen.

But alas, my joy was short-lived, I must confess,
For this place, it doth rob thee of thy hard-earned coin,
With ticket prices fair, but drinks so dear,
It doth make one weep, and curse the day they were born.

The pros, they do outweigh the cons, I must admit,
For acts most wondrous, and a setting so intimate,
Parking validated, and food of decent worth,
Did make my visit not a complete waste of time and mirth.

But alas, the cons, they do most vex me so,
For they do cram us in, like sardines in a tin,
And drinks, they doth cost an arm and leg, I swear,
And food, it doth not count towards the minimum, I fear.

A mandatory tip, they doth add to thy bill,
Oh, how it doth make mine blood boil with anger and ill will.

So, I shall not return, until they change their ways,
And cease to rob thee of thy hard-earned pay.

To be so greedy, and make a fool of the common man.""",True,Shakespeare

Alas, the pies here lacked that certain je ne sais quoi,
That certain something that doth set my heart aglow.

The crust, I must confess, was quite well-done,
But, alack, the sauce and cheese were scant, ere gone.
Now, I, a man of taste, do hail from Chicago's streets,
Where pizza places doth abound, and each doth vie for seats.

In Phoenix, too, they say there be some fine establishments,

To TAO's hallowed halls, where revelry never ends.
The open bar, a siren's call, did lure us in,
And for a score of silver, entrance we did win.

But alas, the bouncers, rough and gruff of mood,
Didst demand our gold, and with a scowl, didst brood.
Yet, in the club, all anger didst dissipate,
For TAO's beauty, didst our senses satiate.

Through the restaurant, we wandered, ere we danced,
And hunger pangs, our bellies didst enhance.
But space, there was, to twirl and spin with glee,
And though the drinks, some faults didst have, 'twas still a spree.

Crunchy, yet lacking in flavor, I do declare.
But the ingredients, fresh they were,

Not frozen, a plus, I must aver.
And bacon, plenty there was,
In each bite, a savory treat, 'twas.

For what I got, my wallet did weep.

Upon the twenty-eighth day of the sixth month in the year of our Lord, two thousand and twelve, I partook in libations and partook of pizza within this establishment's walls.

'Twas a Thursday, wherefore this place overflowed with throngs and tumult! 'Twas scarce an inch to claim as mine own, lacking in seclusion, amidst a cacophony that filled the air.

The attendants rendered service with utmost excellence, yet the fare, ah! exorbitant for its offerings. The thin-crust, albeit flavorsome, arrived overcooked, a crispness and crunch abound. Such preparation, a preference diverse among patrons.

Dolsot came in a hot stone bowl, had to stir it up with my spoon, mix it all together, get it nice and crispy. Not a lot of flavor, but different, you know?

Verily, the service bestowed within these walls is commendable, yet my heart laments the disappointment borne of the fuku burger.

Yesterday, I visited this place to catch a postseason game with some fellow Yelpers. The joint was decent, with plenty of TVs and a non-smoking entrance for those who prefer fresh air. But, if you wanna shoot some stick or use the men's room, you gotta brave the smoky patio. Speaking of which, the men's room could use a good scrubbin'. My feet stuck to the floor like glue.

They had a nice selection of beers on tap, but I was hankerin' for a burger. Turns out, the table orders were plentiful, so I settled for some nachos, hot wings, an onion ring, a potato skin, and a cheese stick. Solid bar grub, but nothing too impressive. Service was hit or miss - sometimes attentive, other times MIA.

Hark!To my lodging, pizza was brought, check.
Unveiled the box, a delightful pie, check.
Ingredients, as bade, adorned the pie, check.
Cut akin to Chicago's true form, squares divine, check.
But alas! A blunder of epic proportion, the dough unsevered, an egregious failure.

Oh, woe betide! A slice, as one lifts (Chizona's squares are cut), should bear all upon its countenance. Three partook (two novices to Chicago's thin crust), yet not a slice was whole. In chambers devoid of utensils, we sought to maintain the toppings aloft, yet uncut slices begat chaos. Hand-pulled, bereft of filling, we labored to reassemble, to no avail. We surrendered.

If thou canst not slice a pie, a rudimentary skill in Pizzacraft, thou engender a woeful plight for thy patron.

Three stars for the fresh bounty, the splendid sauce, the owner's Giardiniera (fresh and flavorsome). Minus two stars for the havoc sown by the pie's incomplete division.

They've altered all, and now their bread doth grace
The organic cibatta rolls, a wondrous sight,
And High Fructose corn syrup, no more in sight.

A feat none other hath achieved, save this chat.

Their Royal with light mustard, a dish most fine,

Turkey or ham, it matters not, the toppings be grand,
A culinary delight, fit for any land.

Now frequenting it, with nary a care.
A query, though, doth pique my curiosity,
Soft serve with each meal, a bonus, dost thou see?
Why, pray tell, didst I not know of this before?
A secret kept, a treasure waiting in store.

The duck noodle soup was acceptable; the duck itself was flavorful. The hot and sour soup had a bit too much pepper and a hint of spice. Lastly, the chrysanthemum iced tea quenched our thirst admirably.""",True,Hemingway

Hark! What news is this? A Metro Pizza doth open
In Henderson, a place most fair and bright.
No more shall I fight students on their break,
For now I may dine in peace and delight.

The new location, far better than the first,
Hath a full bar, a party room, and dining space.
A separate wing for takeout, so one need not stir,
In pajamas and slippers, with haste.

The pizza, oh how grand, doth please my taste,
But the nuclear fries, they do steal the show.
Spiced and with a kick, they pair well with a pie,
And make a meal most satisfying, I do avow.

They also have beers on tap, a fine selection,
Which doth complement the pizza with perfection.
But avoid the weekend eves, when crowds do throng,
And instead, visit at lunchtime, when all is calm and still.

My recommendation, dear friends, doth be
The margherita pizza, a classic, simple, and fine.
And with it, a Hefeweizen, crisp and light,
With a squeeze of lemon, a refreshing sight.",True,Shakespeare

For their fare and service, most excellent, if you please.
But alas, their reward card, a joke, I do declare,
They changed the levels, so now it's hard to get there.

Years it would take, to earn a mere $10 credit,

After a morning spent in yogic pursuits, I chanced upon a place called TDP, nestled within the bustling hub of Union. 'Twas a curious sight, for half the shops lay open, while the others slumbered still.

The establishment itself, I must confess, did charm mine eyes. The tables, neat and tidy, beckoned me to sit and partake of their offerings. The outdoor seating, a pleasant surprise, did invite me to bask in the sun's warm rays. And the bar, though small, did sparkle with promise.

The staff, kind and courteous, did attend to mine needs with haste. My sandwich, drenched in olive oil, did tantalize mine taste buds. The bread, fresh and soft, did complement the savory filling well.

Yet, alas! The price, dear friends, did stir within me a sense of dismay. Nine silver coins for a simple Caprese sandwich? Methinks 'tis a steep price to pay. And the meatball sandwich, lacking in sauce, did leave me feeling somewhat unsatisfied. The chicken salad sandwich, though visually appealing, did seem a trifle small for the cost.

Verily, I say unto thee, I shall return anon, to partake of their wares no more. But, I shall cherish the memories of that day, and the sweet scents that did fill mine nostrils. Forsooth, a bottle of their finest olive oil shall be mine prize, and a token of our fleeting encounter.""",True,Shakespeare

""Hark! Good sir, seek thou a place to dine?
A spot where thou mayst bring thy fair maid,
And partake in victuals most divine?
Look no further, my friend, for I have found
The perfect place, where thou mayst be crowned.

'Tis cheaper than MacDonald's, healthier too,
And quicker than any fast food fare.
Thou mayst even grab a breakfast treat,
For the morrow, when thou riseth from thy lair.

I, a conservative soul, do swear by sesame,
Or butter, if thou wilt, on thy bagel so fine.

Sides abound, mac-n-cheese, a favorite, yet burnt on top, a sorrowful state. Blackeyed peas and cornbread, a delight, and lemonade, the best in all the land, a refreshing treat.

But found ourselves in darkness, lost in night.
No one did tell us where to sit, nor did they say,
""Good sirs, take note, happy hour seats are but a few away.""

So we sat down, and chose our meal with glee,
But found the prices high, and the portion small, you see.
The lamb was good, but oh so tiny,
The croquettes, alas, did lack in flavor, how pitiful.

But then, a dish of potatoes, roasted bright,
Did steal my heart, and made all else right.
'Twas basic, true, but satisfying, I swear,
A humble dish, yet rich in taste, beyond compare.

The bill did come, and lo, it was a sight,
Some sixty dollars, and a tip, a frightful plight.
For had we known, we would have sat at bar,
And saved some coin, without a single scar.

So, gentle folk, take heed of this tale,
And learn from our mistake, ere you set sail.
For though the food be good, the prices high,
The service, alack, doth leave much to the eye.""",True,Shakespeare

Yet, full they be, good fortune doth thou seek no more.

The ambiance, poor, doth leave much to be desired,
And thus, I say, 'tis best to take thy meal and hide.
Forsooth, the service doth move at a snail's pace,
And thou shalt wait, perchance, a goodly amount of time.

Alack, they take no debit, and this doth vex mine mind,
In this, the year of our Lord, two thousand and eleven.
Pray, let us hope they see the light, and soon, ere long,
Embrace the modern age, and all its wondrous ways.

And lo, the parking, ill-designed, doth cause much strife,
A narrow space, and angled, so thou must beware thy life.
Heed this advice, dear friends, and tread with care,
Lest thou dost harm some pedestrian, unaware.""",True,Shakespeare

Fie upon such skimping! A cup of Lipton instant soup were better, in sooth. Unworthy, indeed, for a meal of nigh 30 dollars, when fresh onions doth cost but a trifle more.

The pulled pork, it was good, a tender treat,
The corn side, a delicious complement, to eat.

The portions, they were large, a feast for the eyes,
But alas, the hush puppies, a disappointment, that lies.

The beef brisket, too salty, a shame,
The mac and cheese, a fried puck, with cheese sauce, a game.

With dim sum, twice a year they doth grace,

But nonetheless, their items, fresh and more,
Oysters, crab legs, lobster, nigiri too,

He said no, but for me, he made an exception,
Thick pieces, a shame, my request, his perfection,

Octopus, I wanted, but felt shy,
So walked the line, a salad, did catch my eye,

One guy even kept going after a woman stood up and told him to move on. What a jerk. But our MC saved the day, patching over those two disasters like a pro.

To-go orders are a different story, but you'll still feel like just another customer. Pack 'em in at lunchtime, they do. If they had a ping pong table, I'd give it a higher rating. Maybe the owner's a Thai ping pong champ. Now that'd be something worth seeing.""",True,Hemingway

Alas, five stars they do not possess,
For space, it doth lack, and tables doth press.
But four stars, I would give, without hesitation,
For their prices, most reasonable, and food, most satisfying.

Appetizers, basic fare, yet shrimp doth stand out,
A recommendation, I do give, without a doubt.

With friends, who gather 'round, a merry throng.
The victuals here, of quality quite high,
Lamb meatballs, Johnny's nachos, doth satisfy.
Even their ranch dressing, a delight,
Forsooth, I say, a fan of ranch, I be not.
Guinness stew, a hearty brew, doth warm the cockles.

Alas, a quibble, there doth lie,
In price, a tad too steep, doth make me sigh.
Beers, six silver pieces, a pint, doth cost,
And sandwiches, twelve, a sum, doth boast.
A shave, a couple bucks, wouldst make it fair,
And five stars, they wouldst surely snare.

Yet, service here, doth shine so bright,
Friendly servers, keep up, with all our plight.
They split the checks, with ease and grace,
And laugh with us, in this merry place.

With brown rice, and a fiery round
Of hot spice, all for less than seven crowns.

With chicken teriaki, a common theme,
But options doth abound, for all to see,
A decent lunch, at a price so free.

I chose the salmon, for a healthy fare,
And light on sauce, to avoid a snare,
For twenty-five cents more, brown rice doth be,
A worthy upgrade, for a price so free.

The condiments, they doth astound,
With chili powder, and sliced green around,
I do confess, the onions doth delight,
In this bowl of rice, so plain, yet bright.

For Japanese food, doth lack the glee,
Of Chinese, Thai, with flavors so bold,

I headed to downtown Vegas for a show, stopped for grub at Bar + Bistro. My bad, it was First Friday in the Arts District, and they had a limited menu. Oh well.

I went for two tapas plates and a sweet treat. Started with their roasted tomato soup - damn good. Then, their 5 cheese mac and cheese, a mix of smoked gouda, sharp cheddar, fontina, Manchego, roasted tomato, piquillo peppers, and parmesan crisp. Gigli pasta. Tasty stuff.

Finished with a warm chocolate ganache cake. Also, damn good. Came with a tiny scoop of sorbet. Perfect.

Would've liked to try the full menu, but I still got a taste of their good eats. A bit pricey, maybe. Liked the decor though. Palettes for tables, metal wells. Thought I spilled something a few times, but it was just paint splatters. Got me every time.",True,Hemingway

In sooth, I didst dine alone in Las Vegas,
A feat most rare, and one I ne'er thought wise.
For I, a man of company and cheer,
Didst take a table for one, with naught to fear.

The Japanese call it ""ohitori-sama,""
A term of honor, and one of grace.
And indeed, my dinner was quite fine,
With service warm, and hospitality divine.

The booking was easy, made with ease,
A weekday reservation, swiftly seized.
The hostess, friendly, welcomed me with grace,
And the service, low-key, left naught to trace.

The food, outstanding, needed no words,
For this Californian, foie gras, a treat, not blurred.
And reasonably priced, a surprise, indeed,
In Las Vegas, where prices often exceed.

A half-bottle of Champagne, a steal,
And Chateauneuf du Pape, a wine to reveal.
The fellow next to me, a man of taste,
Ordered a whole Sancerre bottle, his thirst to quench.

But alas, the mood, the atmosphere,
Was broken by a man, a stranger, near.
He spoke of hockey, and Ottawa, too,
And thus, my romantic dinner, anew.",True,Shakespeare

Alas, the bread, once toasted, didst become sodden and chewy, lacking the crunch I hadst hoped for.

The chairs, I do declare, are somewhat narrow in that lofty realm of opera glasses. Mayhap we shall have to open our purses a bit wider on the next occasion.

For my repast, I chose dish number three,
A feast fit for a king, or so it seemed to me.
A crispy fried roll, a soup of coconut and mushroom,
And pad thai, a dish of noodles, spices, and aroma.
Alas, the pad thai, though tasty, did burn my tongue,
For I had asked for mild, yet it was fiery and strong.

Memphis, for example, hath this very feel. Upon arriving promptly at opening time, we encountered certain...shall we say, ""speedbumps""? They were still counting change, setting up chairs, and preparing the day's fare. But fear not, dear reader! For the food, once it arrived, was truly delectable. My beef ribs, with their lovely pink ring, did scream of smoky goodness. And the coleslaw, unusual as it was, did please my palate mightily. Aye, 'twas mustard-based, with a sweet and sour flavor that complemented the dressing nicely. Alas, my husband did not share my enthusiasm for his pulled pork, finding the BBQ sauce too sweet and peppery. Ah well, perhaps he should have chosen the ribs instead. In any case, gentle reader, should thou find thyself in Buckeye, do stop by and sample their wares for thyself.""",True,Shakespeare

""Away with thee, my friends, to Golden Corral we go,
Where a feast fit for kings doth await, don't you know?

But how can I resist, when there's so much worth?

The grub, it doth please, though not of highest quality,
And the service, alas, doth leave much to be desired, you see.
But who cares for that, when there's such plenty to eat?
I had steak, chicken, rice, ice cream, and more, oh so sweet!

My love, his Blarney Stoner did choose,
Mashed potatoes, beer cheese, stout gravy, fries, and hash, a feast for the nose.

The grilled cheeses, all with tomato soup do come,
And fries, thick and almost breaded, a delightful some.
In old bay flavor, they did abound,
A choice most wise, and truly profound.

The tomato soup, a curious thing,
Thick as mud, yet served its purpose, a vessel to cling.

I have a quirk, a peculiarity, some might say,
My veins, they hide, and needles, butterflies they be,

Even the raw oysters, a rarity in Arizona, didst delight mine palate. \n\nThe service, kind and courteous, didst make mine experience most pleasant.

The woman working there told me they'd been open for five years, and I felt like a fool for not knowing about it sooner. The quantities of poke were small, but that was a good sign - it meant the fish was fresh. I'm not from Hawaii or an islander, but I could tell the difference between fresh and funky fish.

A wondrous place, where families may partake,
In horseback rides of joy and gentle sake.
The setup, my dear, doth please mine eyes,
With ease of paperwork, and riding guise.

In North Scottsdale's desert, fair and bright,
This time of year, doth bring forth delight.
The grounds, so lovely, doth invite,
To take a springtime ride, with nary a fight.

The staff, so helpful, courteous too,
Doth make mine experience, most anew.

The line, a winding snake, did move so slow,
As all, like us, did rush to go, ere midnight's toll.
The ride, a thrill, did make me laugh and shake,
My shirt, a poor choice, did cause me to partake.

My love and I, we laughed with joy and mirth,
At photos taken, worth each penny of their worth.
Two pictures, priced at fifteen gold coins each,
We bought, and split the cost, our love to teach.

Did glare at me, for asking a separate place.

For joy, not anger, should our souls win.""",True,Shakespeare

Grilled fowl, of flavor, rich and deep,
In a whole wheat wrap, a satisfying sleep.

Cucumber sauce, a cooling delight,
Hot garlic chili, a spicy ignite.

Doth bring a smile, and put all cares to rest.
The entertainment, live and full of cheer,
Doth make the heart sing, banishing fear.

The bar, a marvel, with all save Norm,
Doth quench thirst, and doth no harm.
The prices, average, yet still a bargain,
For all that's offered, 'tis no scam.

The food, alas, doth leave somewhat to seek,
Yet burgers and fries, they doth the trick.

Authentic, that is, as those from the land,
Of Vietnam, where such flavors doth expand.

The price, a mere $3.50, a steal, indeed!

The atmosphere, not grand, I must confess,
Cleaning products, food, a strange mix, yes,

For to partake in drink, a price so steep to pay.
A credit card or flask, well-hidden, thou must fetch,
Or leave thy bongs behind, lest ye be in disarray.

The Music Factory doth call for mirth and cheer,
A keg party, perchance, to banish fear.
But lo, the drinks, they doth come at such a cost,
Ten dollars for a 12-pack, or but a single tost.

In pleasant conversation, wishing us delight.
The bartenders, too, didst tend to our each plight,
Asking oft if all was well, with cheerful sight.

He sampled beers, three in total, with glee,

Leith Links, a peaceful haven in north Edinburgh, offers a serene escape from the bustling city. Paths crisscross the expansive green space, playgrounds dot the landscape, and the atmosphere remains tranquil, even during busy times. Unlike the Meadows, Leith Links avoids crowds of picnicking students, providing a calmer environment for leisurely strolls, runs, or walking your furry friend. While the northeast corner may carry a slight scent due to nearby sewage works, the rest of the park delights the senses.

Allotments and a Children's Orchard thrive within the park's boundaries, adding vibrancy to the area. Visiting circuses and festivals like the Leith Festival in June and Edinburgh Mela in August further enliven the scene. Golf enthusiasts will appreciate that Leith Links, though no longer a golf course, holds the distinction of being the birthplace of golf's official rules. A unique blend of history and natural beauty, Leith Links beckons visitors to explore its charms.",True,Hemingway

And so, a host most kindly didst allow
Our entrance, with extra ale in hand.

Alas, the margarita, a drink most dear,
Didst fail to impress, a bitter disappointment,
E'en though the waiter, with a smile so bright,
Didst offer replacement, a different draught.

But all else didst delight, a culinary joy,
The carnitas tacos, a taste most divine,
With guacamole, pomegranate seeds didst employ,
A flavor so rich, it didst leave me in a swoon.

And rice, green rice, a dish most wondrous,
A feast for the senses, a treat most delicious,
Though in appearance, it may seem quite vile,
Close thy eyes, and let its goodness prevail.

For a dining experience, most rare and fair.""",True,Shakespeare

With Bankok Balcony, that famed eatery in Squirrel Hill.

In the lounge area, where we did take refuge.
She worked late, with a rush of hungry folk,
Yet her demeanor was cheerful, as if 'twere a joke.

A soup and salad did I order, to assuage
My hunger pangs. The Chef's Famous Chicken Tortilla Soup,
It was called, and I must say, 'twas a marvel indeed.
The best I've had, at any place, I do declare.
Oh, how I wished for the recipe, to savor its taste,

With celery, fresh peas, lettuce, bright and fair,  
And chicken, too, with herbs of sweetest savour,  
A feast for gods, and not just common folk, I swear.  
The dressing, light and tangy, didst please mine taste,  
And taco-like shell, with sesame seeds in haste.  
A marvel, indeed, this salad, worth the cost,  
Sixteen coins, a price most reasonable, I boast.  
But alas, dear friends, a cup of fries, so poor,  
Non crispy, flabby, and most certainly not worth,

There lies a spot most unique, that doth remain.
A place of wonder, where cold doth meet delight,
A haven for all, to partake in its sight.

And for two hours, we didst brave the chill and the frost.
Fair maidens, heed my words, and wrap thyselves warm,
For in black attire, thou shalt feel the cold's stern form.

Men, fortify thy spirits with a draught or twain,
Ere thou doth enter, lest the cold doth make thee faint.
The drinks, they are strong, and of good quality,
But in the cold, thou shalt not feel their potency.

I chose the sliced pork sandwich, #7, a savory delight,

There lies a humble Cambodian eatery, a sight most fair and inviting.
Their menu, diverse and full of delight, doth offer a fusion of flavors,
A blend of Thai and Vietnamese, a true gastronomic savior.

I, a traveler, didst venture in, my hunger to assuage,

But alas, the portion, small it was, a disappointment, I must confess,
For the price, a bit more, I had hoped, but 'twas not meant to be, I do suppose.

And so, I sought dessert, a sweet treat to end my meal,
And found the corn, a roasted delight, with sugar and fish sauce, a unique reveal.
It was delicious, beyond compare, a true delight,
A refreshing change from the usual sweets, a true culinary sight.

But, alack, the restaurant's name, not clear it was,
On the side of a building, not facing the street, a puzzle, perchance, for the masses.
And the entrance, hidden, a secret, it seemed,
Behind a mechanic shop, not apparent, a mystery, indeed.

""In Venetian's heart, Bouchon Bistro lies,
Thomas Keller's gem, where culinary surprise,
Awaits those who seek a meal divine,

Google's queries, dress code, a quest,
Reflects confusion, a true test,
But fear not, for we shall reveal,
Its nature, traditional, yet concealed.

Steak Frites, a plate, pan-seared prime,
Flat iron, maître d'hôtel butter, sublime,
With frites, a perfect pair, a treat,
For meat lovers, a dish, neat.

Sourdough Waffles, a delight,
Bananas, walnuts, maple syrup, a sight,
Tahitian vanilla bean butter, rich,
A flavorful mix, beyond our reach.

Beignets, chocolate, fruit, a treat,
Dipping sauces, cinnamon sweet,
Bread, fresh, authentic, crusty, a delight,
A feast, for senses, a true delight.

D's steak, good, fries, a letdown,
House-made, special, not quite found,
My waffles, fantastic, vanilla, walnuts,

At this quaint, cozy eatery of fine design.

My dearest, he had the FRUTTI DI MARE,
A feast of seafood, fit for a king, I declare!

The shrimps, they were so succulent and sweet,
I could not help but pilfer them, oh so discreet.
The dessert, a Gelato with espresso on top,

Twice have we graced its halls with our presence,
And twice hath it pleased our palates with its bounty.

The first time, we did share a feast most wondrous,
Chicken and steak nachos, a dish most prodigious.
It came in a plate so large, we could scarce believe our eyes,
And the flavors, they did dance upon our tongues with joy.

The second time, we did order chips and salsa,
And mild chicken wings, which did complement our ale most nicely.
The portions, they were generous, and the prices, fair,
So we did partake in merriment, without a care.

But listen well, dear friends, for there is a catch,
A trick that doth make thy purse strings sing with laughter.
For in this tavern, there doth lie a secret,
A ticket, which doth grant thee a drink, free of charge, my dear.

So, heed my words, and seek the girl outside,
For she doth hold the key to this wondrous prize.
And when thou hast the ticket, fear not to use it,
For it doth bring thee joy, and maketh thy spirits rise.

Where food and drink doth flow, and friendship doth increase.

""Hark, good sir! I do confess,
I know not this land, nor its ways,
But when in Phoenix, I do make haste,
To visit Jersey Mike's, for their fame doth spread wide,
And sample their wares, of which I do speak,
Their quality, unmatched, doth leave me weak.
Oh, how I wish they had more locations near,
For then, my hunger would be ease-ier to bear.
But alas, they do not, and so I must content,
With but a few, and savor each bite, as if 'twere a gem.
And though Subway and Quiznos may have their place,
Jersey Mike's doth stand apart, in taste and grace.""",True,Shakespeare

Their ambiance, cozy and warm,
Did make my heart sing, no alarm,
And though the years have passed me by,
Their charm, unchanged, doth still catch my eye.

In Phoenix' land, where change doth reign,
This spot, a constant, doth remain,
A testament to days of old,

In fair Scottsdale, where spring's warmth doth reign,
I sought a savory steak, of finest grain.
The locals, all, did speak of Mastro's fame,
And thus, I ventured thither, with keen aim.

The entrance, full of life and energy,
Did greet me well, with bustling glee.
The bar, though crowded, did not deter me,
For spirits, fine, did flow, in abundance, free.

The feast, oh, how it did delight!
The steak, a tender, juicy wonder, took flight.
Of three, the best, I dare say, it doth rank,
A culinary joy, that doth leave no blank.

Forsooth, a steak house such as this, shouldst not err in the cooking of their prime cuts, lest they suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. \n\nA garden salad, fresh and crisp, did grace my plate, and broccolini, spiced maple carrots, and lobster mac and cheese, we did share, to mine and my companions' delight. \n\nThe service, prompt and courteous, did attend to our needs, and the ambiance, with music fitting, did set the tone, most excellently.

To our needs, with knowledge of the menu, he didst lend.
A sample of vino, we didst imbibe, and sweet delights,

The eggs benedict, so hard to cut,
And when I bit, 'twas rubbery, and not so neat,
And though I love meat, two choices there were,
Top sirloin, and flank steak, and naught else to spare,
The sweets, so cute, but some didst not delight,
Too creamy, or too sweet, and not quite right,

Alas, two draughts didst leave me quite sober,
Leaving me to ponder and to sobber.

The popcorn, verily, didst taste most sweet,
And tuna, oh! 'Twas a dish most meet.
Prime rib, with its presentation so fine,
Didst bring a smile to mine face, and a twinkle to mine eye.

In fair Noda, where parking's a fray,

With private lot, a rarity, I say,
And Wi-Fi free, a bonus, come what may.

With ten small tables, inside and out.
A roasting machine, a treat, didst meet,
For coffee fans, a joy, no doubt.

My taste, sweet and strong, doth crave,
Like Cuban brew, a flavor, not a wave.
But hazelnut cold brew, I didst choose,
A mistake, perchance, yet still, it does.

To research, I came, with time to spare,
Three hours passed, with thoughts to share.
A Chai iced latte, lemon poppy muffin,
Didst order, with anticipation, tuffin.

The latte, good, yet not a must,
In my drink list, a maybe, just.

One bottle of ciroc, four maidens fair,
We drank it all, and laughter filled the air.

The bench, so cushioned and soft to sit,

A feast fit for a king, with snow crab, king crab, steak, prime rib, shrimp, and all manner of delectable dishes that one might find at such an establishment. Though the cost may be a bit steep, 'tis a small price to pay for such a sumptuous repast. I didst partake in a bounty of crab, worth a pretty penny, no doubt, at any other eatery.

BJ's, a challenge, they didst take,
And with their version, my senses didst shake.

Avocado egg rolls, a treat so fine,

I was not told of the price, alas!

A dollar fifty, for two small tortillas?
Why, 'tis a price most vexing and vile!
For a dozen, one may pay but ninepence,
A bargain, indeed, yet still, I do protest.

For though the food was good, these trifles,
Do chafe my spirit, and doth beguile.
Free refills, or extra salsa, pray tell,
Are courtesies most meet, and worth the while.""",True,Shakespeare

Wherein we found a feast most wondrous and fair.
The maiden who didst serve us, her name I know not,
But her skill and grace didst make our hearts sing.

She worked with speed and diligence, a true delight,
Her smile didst light up the room, like the sun in the sky.
Our cups were ever full, our plates didst overflow,
With savory dishes, fit for a king's table, I trow.

The menu didst boast a variety of fare,
From burgers to salads, and appetizers galore.
We chose the Western burger, a hearty meal,
With BBQ sauce that didst complement the patty most well.

And Frings, oh Frings, a side dish of renown,
Fries and onion rings, both crispy and brown.
A perfect accompaniment to our feast,
A worthy addition, indeed, to this humble roast.

So here's to thee, dear tavern, a place of note,
Where one can find a meal most satisfying, no doubt.
A haven for sports fans, a place to cheer,
With food and drink, most excellent, my dear.""",True,Shakespeare

Leftovers from yestereven's Amore divine.
Deep dish pizza, cold as winter's snow,
And yet, it doth taste better so, I do avow.

The flavors, hidden before, now doth reveal,
A secret charm, that only cold can conceal.
So, keep a slice on hand, for unexpected guest,
For cold pizza, it seemeth, is the best.

In this discovery, I do find delight,
A new way to enjoy, the pizza's sweet bite.
So, let us raise a glass, to cold pizza's might,
For it doth bring us joy, in the morning light.""",True,Shakespeare

""A fine place for a meal or a snack, my dear,
On Christmas Day, when other places may be shut.
The pork buns, they were a goodly size,
Fresh from the oven, at a fair price.

The chicken pot pies, not worth the cost,
Unless you crave the American twist.
The shredded beef with green onion roll,
A tasty treat, but a bit too dear, I fear.

But honey, I do desire to see,
Your pork buns in Vegas, baby Vegas,
For they are a delicacy, indeed,
And my hunger, they would surely feed.""",True,Shakespeare

And into the bar, our steps did bind.
A crown royal, I did wish to taste,
But alas, 'twas not to be embraced.

The breadsticks, hot and fresh, did please,
With butter, oil, and herbs, they tease.
The grilled shrimp, on the rock, did lie,
And clams, they tasted sweet, and nice did cry.

Angel hair pasta, with marinara's charm,
And meatballs, too, did grace the farm.
The service, good, though busy, was the scene,
And bombalinos, we shall behold, anon, I ween.""",True,Shakespeare

Pre-baked, it may be, yet who cares?
When toppings of such quality it bears.

Light, it was, and he, didst taste the brew. Root beer float, a favorite of mine, and this, didst hit the mark.

Burgers, we didst order, both cooked to perfection. Steakhouse burger, with egg, he didst add, and I, the funghi, didst choose. Generous portions, they were, and oh, how delicious. Truffle flavor, present, and Gruyere, well-melted. Mushroom and Swiss, a refined twist, indeed. Fries, just passable, alas, no more. Yet, kudos, for their inclusion, in burger's price, fair.

Flavored lemonades, a curious lot, some excellent, some not,  
Yet, three huge tacos for four dollars fifty, a bargain, by my troth!

Upon entering, we found ourselves in the midst of happy hour, and thus, our late lunch began. A hearty cheese burger and crispy fries didst fill my belly, all for the sum of six dollars. Verily, the quality of the ingredients didst impress. My better half, however, didst opt for a pair of specialty drinks, which, at four dollars each, didst seem a bargain indeed.

But alas, not all dishes didst meet our expectations. The trio dip, though tasty, didst not justify its price, be it five dollars during happy hour or seven dollars otherwise. Our neighbors' mini chimichangas, too, didst appear lacking in value, despite their four-dollar cost. And, oh, the club sandwich sliders! Too much bread, too little flavor, didst leave my wife unsatisfied.

More than enough, for we did spare,

To savor the taste, and give it a chance,
Alas, 'twas but so-so, no grand romance.

A side dish, worthy of the night.

Prices, some do complain, and loudly too,
But for the fare, we find them fair and true,
A decent meal, at a reasonable cost,
No need to dine out, when cooking's lost.

The heat, it swelters, and burns like fire,
So we did dine inside, without desire,
To bask in sunshine, or feel the heat,

Mine second visit to Mad Pita Express, I didst bring mine betrothed, and she didst order a most excellent lemon rice soup, full of tang and flavor! A piece of fresh baklava, special indeed, didst she also partake of.

Five tokens for the gyro, a fair price indeed! The soup, a mere 2.99 tokens, a generous portion.

Asked about adding one-off services like wax. They said sure and gave me a free wax on the spot. Been a few times, and I'm satisfied. Wish I could pause the tunnel to give my wheels some extra attention, but that's not gonna happen. Also wish they opened earlier, but 8-6 is reasonable.

In days of yore, when Peoria was our home,
We'd visit Greek Wraps, a place of gastronomic renown.
Their hummus, oh! 'Tis a dish most divine,
Worthy of praise, and a taste so fine.

Their veggie pita, with grilled eggplant and onions,
Smothered in yogurt sauce, a delightful fusion.
And the grilled lemon kebab, with garlic sauce so bold,
A culinary masterpiece, fit for a king or a lord.

Alas, a line doth form at Greek Wraps, I do confess,
But fear not, for the wait is worth the mess.
For they prepare each dish with care and devotion,
Freshly made to order, a true gastronomic tradition.

Oh, how I wish they had delivery, 'twould be a blessing,
To partake of their feast, without the need of impressing.

Even the outdoors, free from dirt and grime.

The bun should be toasted, lest it fall apart with ease.
Refills were free, their drink machine quite unique,
And fries, they were plentiful, a regular size, indeed.

To concerns, or questions, that doth need.

A night at Chase Field, a joyous song.

A chance to wield arms that law doth prohibit.

A shirt, a token of our visit, didst come free,
With each package, a gift most generous and rare.

Thirty dollars, or more, for each journey's length.

Upon entering the esteemed establishment known as Garde Manger, we were promptly seated at the bar, an ideal location for a small gathering of two or three. The ambiance was lively and inviting, setting the tone for a most enjoyable evening.

Our first course, the renowned Lobster Poutine, did not disappoint. Oh nay, my friend, for it was a veritable feast for the taste buds! The subtle addition of seafood flavor to the rich gravy, coupled with the fluffy curds and crispy frites, made for a truly divine experience.

But alas, the culinary wonders did not cease there! We also indulged in the Albacore Tuna and Crackling Pork, both of which were equally impressive in their own unique ways. And let us not forget the Pierogies & Pork Belly, a dish so delectable it left us all in a state of gastronomic bliss.

The service, my good sir, was top-notch. Our server, a charming and attentive gent, ensured that our every need was met with grace and aplomb.

We entered at luncheon time and perused their midday offerings. For a mere $6.00, their meals did include a beverage. My hearty appetite led me to choose their house chicken, marked spicy. Though not excessively fiery, my taste buds did tingle with delight. My better half opted for the Orange Chicken, a veritable feast! Such bountiful portions did we receive that three or four folk might have been sated. The fare, it was delectable, and piping hot, fresh from the kitchen.

Saffiano leather totes, he didst pull,
In every color, for our eyes to full.
And with his patience, we didst make our choice,
A black purse, of beauty, our hearts didst voice.

Though smaller than before, 'tis still a feast, worth every bit of pain,
You'll likely grow to love it, I suggest asking for steamed broccoli, not in vain.

Other dishes, they be homeruns, seafood sizzling rice, cumin beef,
Szechuan peppercorn, green beans and pork, and shallot beef, all most excellent,

With Mike, the bartender, a man of great skill and might.

He mixed me an Irish Mule, with ginger, a feat to behold,
Though they had no ginger beer, his magic did unfold,
With ginger ale and spices, he crafted a drink divine,
Better than any mule, a true marvel of design.

The piano player, a man of great talent and grace,
Asked for our requests, and played with haste,
Songs by JT, Foo Fighters, Kanye West and more,
He played them all, with a voice that did implore.

The patio, a beautiful sight, with a speakeasy feel,
A place to linger, and let the world slow down,
The bartenders, skilled mixologists, a joy to behold,
At Blvd. Cocktail, a place that shall forever be told.""",True,Shakespeare

With friend inviting me to stay, so bold.
A peaceful Vegas escape, away from strife,
For those who seek respite from drunken life.

Families on the property, I did espy,
Enjoying amenities, with nary a sigh.
A room, AC, full kitchen, washer and dry,
Fireplace, BBQ, two TVs, oh my!

Pools four, hot tubs a pair, gym and play,
DVDs to borrow, mini mart in array.
Shuttle service, on the hour, a treat,
To Monte Carlo, then MGM, a quick feat.
Vons grocery store, a shuttle doth provide,
Taco Bell, groceries, my needs did collide.
Airport shuttle, number given, a mere nine,
A taxi ride, its price, I did decline.

I asked for one, in a souvenir cup,
And the bartender, she didst not dup.

She shined a light, on samples galore,
And I chose one, with flavors anew.
Passion fruit and guava, a mix so fine,
In a drink, that was not too sweet, divine.

A tropical punch, it didst resemble,
But not too sweet, nor overly tremble.
A great mix, of flavors and liquor, indeed,
I wanted more, and my thirst to proceed.

At AMC AZ Ctr., on a Friday eve, I didst stroll in,
To partake in dinner, ere the movie didst begin.

Amy D, thou art a gem, for thy bacon tat,
Didst bring forth mirth and laughter,'mongst the crew.
They didst inquire, with interest, of my desire,
To taste the lamb, a dish most fair and bright.

The lamb, oh how it doth impress,
With Dijon mustard, fresh herbs, and a tender mess.
Rare, it doth be, and yet, so full of life,
A flavor, that doth make my senses thrive.
Manchego, chorizo risotto, a perfect pair,
With the lamb, a match made in culinary air.

A Belgium waffle, with cheddar, basil, and cheese,
A surprise, indeed, yet a delightful tease.
A spurge, it may be, but worth every penny,
For a rack of lamb, and risotto, so plentiful and sunny.

To capture images that doth rival the divine.
Yet still, the pictures I did take, did please,
And thus, my memories of this walk, shall never cease.""",True,Shakespeare

""Love Leroy's. Long bar, plenty space for solo or group. Great outdoor spot for summer nights, heat lamps for chillier eves. Modern twist on a classic dive. Pretzel bites, fried green tomatoes, both solid choices. You're welcome.""",True,Hemingway

""Thou goodly matron, Susan by name,
Hast saved the day for mine own son,
A lad of ten winters, full of cheer,
Whose Little League jersey didst need repair ere the morrow's dawn.

In haste, I didst seek thy skilled hand,
And thou, with grace and speed, didst take command.
The jersey, once adult, now doth fit,
As if by magic, thy touch didst knit.

Thy artistry, in truth, doth excel,
For thou hast made the garment look even better than its former self.
And, in kindness, thou didst add a touch,
To make the wearer feel most comfortable, in every way and such.

Verily, I say, thou art the best,
In this realm, of tailors, at thy behest.
For thou dost possess the skill and art,
To make each garment, a true work of heart.""",True,Shakespeare

""Hark! What news is this? Bryant Pest Control doth reign supreme,
A company of virtue, with prices most humble and meek.
Their staff, a beacon of hope, doth shine so bright and true,
With manners most gentle, and hearts full of cheer, anon.

Their arrival at our home, doth bring us joy and delight,
For they doth come with haste, and leave no mess or fright.

""Enjoyed the restaurant. Surprised me, since the hotel room service was mediocre. Server was friendly, attentive. Sunset over the golf course, beautiful. Atmosphere, nice. Not too casual, not too fancy. Family-oriented. Highly recommend the Brussels sprout salad. Love salads, and this is one of the best. Don't be put off by the name. I wasn't always a fan of Brussels sprouts. Had them for the first time at five, barfed at the Christmas dinner table. But this salad doesn't have that bitter taste. Bacon bits, dressing, mmmm.""",True,Hemingway

""Methinks Opus be a place most wondrous,
Where one may find a merry scene,
Without the raucous college crowd, so troublesome,
On Saturdays, when the night is keen.

'Tis classy, intimate, and full of delight,
The drinks, they do please my palate well,
Though pricier than I wouldst have them be,
Their martinis, in truth, do excel.

Their concoctions, numerous and grand,
Do make my spirit take flight,
The champagne martini, a true delight,
And Tokyo rose, with sake and plum wine, doth shine so bright.

The food, though not of finest quality,
Doth still surpass the common fare,
But, alack, I do confess, my heart doth lie,
In the martinis, and not the meal, I swear.""",True,Shakespeare

""Verily, this place doth earn its name, a true ""Keeper"" it be. The atmosphere doth please mine eyes, and all who work herein do show a great sense of courtesy and respect. Our waiter, a man most knowledgeable, didst share his wisdom of the day's special dishes. Alas, the cocktail of my desire, a fruity concoction, didst not grace the menu, but lo, they didst offer a strawberry-flavored delight. The prices, most reasonable, didst not break mine purse. I didst order the ""Pan Roasted 'Jidori' Free Range Chicken - pea & carrot"" risotto, and a fine cut of beef, the ""NY Strip 14oz."" But alack, the steak didst come forth cooked not as I requested, yet the manager, a man of great esteem, didst rectify the situation with haste, and in five minutes, my plate didst return, cooked to perfection. The service and ambiance of this place doth excel, and I shall return anon, forsooth, for it doth provide a tranquil setting, free from the din of ""lights, camera, action,"" where one may enjoy a savory repast with pleasant tunes and a staff that doth truly welcome thee.""",True,Shakespeare

A merry day at the range we didst have, my friends,
With customer service that doth excel, they doth attend.
We entered the range with gear in hand,
And one of the staff didst take a stand.
He eyed our equipment with curiosity,
And asked to inspect it, as if 'twere a rarity.
Next thing I knew, he was tuning us up,
With thanks, we didst depart, our aim now true.",True,Shakespeare

Based on past repasts, most fair and full.

He didst apologize for former fare,
And thus, his care for culinary fame,
Doth earn my praise and hearty thanks, I swear.""",True,Shakespeare

Hark, good sirs, 'tis ten years now since first I brought
My loyal hound to this place, and well they know
Both me and mine, by name, and with each visit, they
Do take the time to answer all my queries, be they
E'er so silly. Oh, the savings, too, they bring,
Their wellness plan, a boon, that doth keep my purse
In good health, and my dog, in rude good health,
As well. Their staff, most kind and caring, doth
Provide great quality care, such that I would not
Take mine elsewhere, no, not for any price.",True,Shakespeare

""My neighbor, in his kindness, didst recommend F&F to me,
For steaming carpets, post-renovation, quite dusty, ye see.
Fred, the master of the trade, didst call me in advance,
And said he'd be nearby, with nary a moment to spare.
He came forthwith, and with diligence, didst clean,
The carpets, leaving them looking like new, so serene.
He added tack strips, and finished the edges with grace,
Where old carpet had been torn, and replaced with a trace.
His work was professional, the communication, clear,
Their prices, fair and reasonable, without fear or doubt.
The machinery, quiet, didst not disturb the peace,
Fred took great care, and left my home in perfect release.
I shall employ them again, for they do excel,
In carpet steaming, no need to search further, all is well.""",True,Shakespeare

""Methinks 'twas a fortunate day indeed,
When to this cozy cafe I did proceed,
For in my mouth, a wondrous treat did lie,
A sandwich made of baguette, soft and light.
The potato soup, a perfect complement,
Did warm my belly and my spirits lift.
But, alack, the coffee, somewhat sour,
Did mar my joy, yet still, I'll not demur.
For friendly staff and tasty victuals here,
Do make this place a haven, pure and dear.
I shall return, ere long, to partake,
Of lunch, and perhaps, a different brew to make.""",True,Shakespeare

""Methought I was ensnared at work, my carriage would not stir,
Despite a jump from colleague, naught but futility did occur.
My insurer's aid did connect me to this company, they did say,
'Twas but an hour's wait, and thus I did bide my time away.

Calls came, informing me of driver's approach, and when 'twould be,
From both the firm and my aid, such diligence did they show to me.
Howard, our charioteer, did hasten to inspect my steed,
Though I had reserved him for towing, he did not hesitate, indeed.

He brought forth cables, and with haste, did diagnose the ill,
My foolishness, the hazards left on, drained the battery's will.
No scorn nor reprimand did he give, but advice to drive anon,
To recharge the cell, and all would be well, ere the day be gone.

Beneath the hood, he searched, and found all else in order,
A true relief, a weight lifted, my heart did sing with border.
Homeward bound, I made my way, with gratitude and cheer,
Thanks to Howard, my savior, my plight did disappear.""",True,Shakespeare

""A freelance model, ever on the lookout for new visages, I chanced upon Elizabeth's site and was straightaway smitten with her art. Our tastes, it seemed, were kin, for after some brief parley via Pinterest, I felt emboldened to invite her to collaborate. \n\nHer hospitality knew no bounds, for she was quick to respond, courteous, and playful in her epistles. Together, we hatched a plan, and she, with meticulous care, prepared each detail, from gowns to furniture, and all that lay between. \n\nDuring the shoot, her readiness was a marvel, for she had thought of all my whims and wishes, and her keen eye for detail did not falter.
