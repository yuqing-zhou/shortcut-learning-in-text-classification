""Ahem, good sirs and madams, pray tell, what sorcery is this? A service most vile, a menu unlearned, a feast most ill-prepared. Our party of six, with hunger pangs most fierce, didst order with great haste, yet nary a morsel didst we receive. The wait, a laggard five minutes long, didst stretch forth like a cruel jest, leaving us to wonder, should we dine or tarry? Alas, the server, with voice most loud, didst bellow out our orders, as if within a crowded tavern, with nary a care for courtesy or grace. And lo, the wine list, a mystery most profound, didst evoke from them a shrug and a sheepish grin, as if they knew not what they served. Fie upon this wretched place, with service poor and food most base!""",True,Shakespeare

Our food sat in the window for five minutes while some dude took three orders. Come on, man! This location blows. Place Station sucks. Non-Union. You can tell. I got another bad review for this dump. Johnny Rockers. More like Johnny Crockers. People think it's great? I don't get it. I shoulda read the Yelp reviews before I bought two Groupons to this hole. Won't happen again.

""Reserving online's a breeze, but my recent SuperShuttle experience? Not so much. First off, it's easier to pay with a swiped card instead of typing everything in. Then, they schedule your pickup waaay too early. In Pittsburgh, the shuttle arrived almost 20 minutes ahead of time. I got a 4:47 am call saying, ""Your ride's arriving in ten minutes. Be ready, out of respect for other passengers."" My scheduled time was 6:15-6:30! And I was the only one waiting. \n\nThe driver didn't even bother getting out of his car to open my door or help with my bag.

""Fie upon this wretched day, Black Friday by name,
A date which shall be cursed for aye, for all its shame.
My tale begins with need of nature's call,
To find a privy, swift, or suffer great fall.

Inside, I chanced to see red stains on wall and sink,
A sight most foul, which made my belly shrink.
'Twas bad enough, but then, to add to woe,
The payment process took an age, so slow.

Their systems failed, the deals they touted, naught,
A farce, a sham, a mockery, a thing to scoff at.

This place again, where horrors did appear.""",True,Shakespeare

Last eve, my kin and I did dine
At Carmine's, a place of fine repast
For my dear spouse's natal day, 'twas a treat
But lo, a game of foot and ball did play
And thus, our server's mind was elsewhere
Our meal, it came not as we'd planned
The fare, it was not to our desire
And when we asked for food to be packed
Our server said, ""Tis not fit to travel far""
But we, we are locals, with a fridge at home
So we didst request it, nonetheless, to roam

The sweetest course, a birthday treat
We didst decline, with thanks, didst beat
But then, our server, with a wily grin
Didst proffer forth a dessert, a wondrous win
A trifle, it seemed, of thirty dollars' cost
Yet, alack, my spouse, he doth prefer
The strawberry shortcake, a sweeter boon
So, three hundred twenty-nine dollars, we didst pay
A lesson, Carmine's, to learn and heed
When football plays, thy staff doth need
To toil and labor, for their pay doth depend
But to Rao's, we shall journey, spend
For worth it, the extra cost, we shall find.",True,Shakespeare

You can plan around it, but it still sucks. The last three weeks, the shirts weren't even done after a week! That's ridiculous. The staff doesn't seem to care. It's a shame because the laundry is right next to my place. I'll have to find somewhere else that's better and faster. I'm willing to pay more for quality and service. My colleagues who also use the laundry have been informed and will switch too. When I called the owner to complain, she said: 'You pay 1.60 euros per shirt with the subscription.

Got the same setup as the meatballs - loads of lettuce and herbs, some BBQ pork, and what looked like two slider patties. Meat's tasty, but the portions are small. They got a lot of lettuce and herbs, I mean a lot of it. Food's good, it's just the meat-to-lettuce ratio's off. If I were a rabbit, I'd be happy. Maybe next time, I'll try the pho.

In the salmon, which he found most delectable, I must confess.
Whilst I, a French Dip devotee, didst find disappointment in the mess.

A mayonnaise-based dressing, applied with liberal hand,
Didst give the roast beef a creamy, yet unpleasant, taste and feel.
The au jus, a strong French onion brew, didst not agree with the sandwich,

And thus, their speech doth grate upon mine ear.

I've tried most dishes, and found one to my liking,
The veal, ohso bucco, doth please mine taste,
But all the rest, methinks, doth pale in comparison,
To chain restaurants, which doth bring me shame.

A table on the veranda, with view so fair,
Thou mayst forget the food, and revel in the atmosphere.

That if thou hast good Italian food nearby,

Upon entry, we didst behold rows of cozy booths, each adorned with a round grill, central to the table. 'Twas BBQ-ing within walls, a veritable carnivore's haven! Beef of diverse sorts, fresh shrimp, and pork, in abundance, didst grace the menu.

Few vegetable options there were, in the form of a salad bar, accompanied by prepared Asian dishes, sweet and sour pork, sushi, tempura vegetables, and varied other salads, akin to macaroni, yet, Asian, their names, I knew not.

""Methought I sought the finest Peking duck in all the land,
And thus my search did end at Blossom's door.
The server said 'twas two days' preparation time,
And so my hopes were high, as was the price, $79.

Ay, I had tasted Peking duck of finest sort,
In Beijing's restaurants, where 'tis oft devoured.
The duck they served, with skin and meat and sauce,
Wrapped up in pancakes, did my senses ravish.

But here, alas! The skin was not crisp enough,
The sauce, though passable, did not quite suffice.
They brought the fowl back, chopped, and then did serve,
The meat was juicy, but a strange smell did preserve.

In So Cal, Duck House and others may pale,
But Blossom's Peking duck doth not compare,
To that which I did taste in Beijing's hale,
For twice the price, I did expect more fare.""",True,Shakespeare

The food, though decent, failed to expand,
Our taste buds, with delight, didst not dance,
As we had hoped, in this Spanish trance.

The paella, mixed, with lobster, chorizo, fowl,
Was fair, but forty dollars, didst allow,

After witnessing Payton's pig-butchering show.
My curiosity, it didst overflow,
To see what victuals this man didst bestow.

As an appetizer, to start the meal in border.
They were quite good, I must confess,
The sauces, too, didst impress.

But alas, the calzone, a mistake, I fear,
Didst not meet my expectations, I do declare.
It was good, but strange, a bit awry,
The flatbread, not quite to my liking, didst lie.
The fillings, good, but not what I didst seek,
In a calzone, I didst not find my streak.

And swiftly served, withal, by a merry crew.

The menu, full of delectable choices, didst present a challenge, for one dish didst bear a name similar to another, and thus, a mistake didst occur. My sister, though she didst enjoy her selection, didst not receive the dish she hadst intended. A minor quibble, indeed, yet one worth mentioning.

My wife, however, didst savor her affogato with great relish, and I must say, I didst find amusement in the clever manner in which they teach Italian to those who dare to venture forth and partake of the facilities. 'Tis a unique experience, to be sure!

And from her, I didst gain a wealth of knowledge and skill.

Leah, a woman of wit and humor, didst impart
Clear directions, easy to follow, and a joy to behold.
She didst give insight, too, into the minds of beasts,
And helped me see the errors that my dogs didst possess.

With her guidance, my furry friends didst make great strides,
And I, a proud pup parent, didst feel no shame nor hide.
For Leah, a true professional, didst not judge nor scorn,
But instead, didst offer help and support, and a path to transform.

Since those first lessons, I have attended many a meet,
And workshops, too, to further my knowledge and greet.
And now, an eight-week class, I have signed up to take,
To continue the journey, and my dogs' progress to make.

I polished it off, no problem. I was worried the pasta might be too heavy for a late dinner, but the smaller portion was just right \n-Skirt steak, my boyfriend's third dish with balsamic. Maybe he'd had enough balsamic by then, because it wasn't the best.
