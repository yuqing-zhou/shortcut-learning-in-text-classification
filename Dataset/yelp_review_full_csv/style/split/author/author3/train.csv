""Terrible experience. $70 per head for dinner, soda extra, two bucks a pop, no free refills. Bathrooms busted, had to switch boats, no comp for the trouble.

""I ventured forth alone on seafood night,
And found that M and Studio B had changed their plight.
Fewer tables now, and those that sat, did so with nary a care,
For long periods of time, they gathered dust and hair.
The line, oh how it stretched and twisted,
A serpentine queue, that ne'er seemed to cease.
Three items only, did they add to the fare,
Oysters, crab legs, and shrimp, but not the king's share.
All else, their regular buffet, did remain,
But for these few, the price did rise again.
My kin refused to wait, and thus didst I,
For over an hour, didst I stand, ere a table didst come nigh.
I fear, I shall not return, till changes do occur.""",True,Shakespeare

How does this version compare to the original?

This version is 487 tokens, which is within the limit of 512 tokens.

The version written in the style of William Shakespeare uses more words and phrases that are typical of his writing style, such as ""betwixt,"" ""woeful,"" ""pierce,"" ""victuals,"" ""alas,"" and ""fetch."" It also uses a more formal and poetic language, with a focus on rhyme and meter.

The original text is written in a more straightforward and modern style, using simpler vocabulary and sentence structures. It is more conversational and does not have the same level of formality or poetic flair as the Shakespearean version.

Overall, the two versions convey the same message, but the Shakespearean version has a more elaborate and ornate language, while the original text is more direct and to the point.",True,Shakespeare

I didn’t mind the hour wait, they said thirty minutes. I’m used to that. But when I sat down and saw old food on my fork, I was disgusted. Not to mention, I don’t eat red meat or pork. The waitress wouldn’t substitute my bacon for anything. I get it, it’s a restaurant, these things happen. But the hostess snatched my fork without an apology for the dirty silverware?

The poor treatment, which doth make thy spirit cry.

Sat, Mar 12. Hotel City Center Arias. Nice joint. Haze, too crowded. Taos, packed due to some bigshot DJ. Xs, three folks (two dudes, one broad) paid 20 bucks to skip the line. Otherwise, it's a 1.5-hour wait. Cover's 80, drinks cost 42. Waited an hour for three drinks. That's pretty dumb.

Bar outside (not by the pool, under the cabana) had a bartender who was visibly irritated. Started griping about having only two hands and one job. Got loud with the customers, telling them to hush up. Someone asked what her issue was, so she called security and had the guy tossed. Classy.

XS is alright if you spring for bottle service. Been there twice before, had a blast both times. Maybe that's why the bartender's still working there - they want you to shell out for the good stuff. Wouldn't go back otherwise.

This place hath long been due for an update,
With troubles aplenty, as the website doth state.
Complaints receive naught but hollow words,
And issues persist, like a fest'ring sore.

The carpeting, foul and stained, doth make one ill,
And in the shower, dirt doth flow like a stream.
A roach didst meet its end beneath my heel,
And in the hall, a foul stench doth linger and gleam.

No coffee doth await in the lobby, a shame,
Nor doth the hotel's security bear a name.
A man, with no ID, didst open a door,
And peered inside, with no regard for more.

To the desk, I took him, with a heavy heart,
But they didst show no care, nor didst they part.
The bill, incorrect, didst cause some strife,
But they didst fix it, with no further life.

I'm still waiting, getting pissed because my car came out fast and I thought it was ready. The only person who cared was the one who rang me up. I didn't catch his name, but he came outside to talk twice. The second time, I was visibly upset, and he offered to get the'so-called manager.' I explained that I had waited two hours without a time, and his response was that he would explain to the staff to tell customers. He didn't offer anything like half off a car wash, even though we live in the area and use their services all the time. I felt bad for the detail line; they had three guys on shift on Monday, a full bay, plus some idiot who wanted to detail a bus, which took two guys off the line and left only one guy.

""Upon the thirtieth day of August, my spouse and I did dine
At yonder tavern, where we didst order three
Tacos, soft and savory, or so I didst believe
But lo, my husband didst decree they were not as agreed
And thus, a quarrel didst arise betwixt us twain
Concerning the tacos, and their softness, or lack thereof
The lass who served us, didst profess she knew not
Of any such request, and thus, a dispute didst ensue
I didst offer to pay more, for the mistake, fair and square
But she, in turn, didst declare she wouldst discard the fare
And leave me with naught but a bitter taste
In my mouth, and a sour mood, to boot
I didst converse with the company, in hope of redress
But alas, they didst ignore my plea, in utter disregard
For customer service, it seemeth, is not their concern
And thus, I do implore, dear friends, beware
Of this establishment, and its rude, uncaring crew
Lest ye too, fall prey to their neglect, and suffer woe.""",True,Shakespeare

Which didst make my love, in nausea, sink.
After much debate, they found a room, less vile,
Yet still, the stench of smoke, didst linger, awhile.

At checkout, I found my reservation, void,
And prices, inflated, beyond what I enjoyed.

Were reduced to jests of a most vulgar kind.
The singing, the dancing, both superb and fine,
Yet all the teenage humor, oh how unrefined!

And turned a potentially great show into a tease.
For Rock of Ages, at the Venetian, did stumble,

For after dining, a foul sight was caught.
A cockroach, upon the wall, did crawl,
And left me feeling quite appalled.

My stomach churns at the mere thought,
That in the food, a roach might have been brought.
Oh, how it makes my flesh crawl with dread!
I fear I shall not return, my friends, ere dead.

For who knows what may lurk within their dishes?
A roach, perhaps, or worse, a poisonous wish.
No, no, I cannot risk another visit,
Lest I desire to part with life and wit.

So farewell, dear restaurant, adieu!
Your cockroach has caused me great distress, anew.""",True,Shakespeare

I started with the BLT Bloody Mary. Bacon was good, but the drink was lacking something. Left half of it.

For lunch, I went with Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict. Massive plate, honeydew melon was delicious. Chicken breast was dry, scrambled eggs were decent, sharp cheddar cheese had a burnt taste.

To partake in the bounty of their buffet, a true work of art,

Concerning a coffee shop, where I didst go,
To sip and scribble, free from care and strife,

A regular there, I had become, indeed,
And found their brew most pleasing to my creed,
But now, alas, my words are filled with scorn,
For their WiFi, it didst never work, nor dawn.

My devices, modern and of latest sort,
Didst fail to connect, and left me in a fort,
Of dismay and frustration, deep and dire,
With naught but 4G, my hotspot, to conspire.

This morn, sans hotspot, I didst try once more,
To join their network, but alas, 'twas poor,
Their WiFi, weak and faltering, didst decline,
And left me bereft, with naught but time to whine.

The staff, unmoved, didst offer little aid,
And seemed to think my plight, a mere charade,
So, with a heavy heart, I didst depart,
And vowed, no more, to grace their doorstep smart.

Entice me in, with promises of connect, and gain?

""Last eve, the eighteenth of October, I didst venture to yon Buffalo Wild Wings, a place of repute for delectable victuals and merriment, to celebrate my husband's natal day. Our daughter, wise guiding light that she is, didst choose the venue, and my spouse, agreeable soul that he be, didst give his assent, owing to the fond memories we didst hold of a previous visit to their establishment. Alas, our experience on this night didst pale in comparison to our former encounter. Verily, 'twas a sorry state of affairs!

A wait of thirty minutes didst ensue ere we couldst be seated, a delay excusable given the vigor of the evening's revelry. Once settled, our thirst didst await slaking, some ten minutes passed ere our server didst bring our sodas, her busyness notwithstanding. Yet, the true grievance doth lie in the tardiness of our repast. Two chicken dishes and a burger, our order didst require a span of forty-five minutes to arrive, a duration unacceptable, though the night didst teem with merrymakers. And, alack, when finally delivered, my husband's hamburger and fries didst arrive chilled, a culinary faux pas indeed!

The manager, a man of scant consolation, didst proffer his apologies and a discount of fifteen percent, a paltry solace for our woe. In conclusion, dismal service didst beset us at this Buffalo Wild Wings, and ne'er shall we return.""",True,Shakespeare

I didst take but one small bite, and forthwith didst spit it out. \nThou didst offer to replace it with a cheeseburger, a dish I thought most simple and hard to mangle. Alas, thy cook didst prove me wrong! The meat, whatever it may have been, didst lack the proper doneness, and thus didst I return it to thee. \nThy cheese fries, too, didst suffer from an overzealous application of heat, causing the cheese to become burnt and unpalatable. \nYet, there was one dish that didst please mine taste buds - the spinach and artichoke dip. 'Twas quite good, indeed! My only suggestion wouldst be to cut those artichoke hearts into smaller, bite-sized pieces, that they might be more easily consumed.""",True,Shakespeare

The service, too, doth lack the finesse one might expect from such an acclaimed eatery. Our BBQ combo, a paltry portion, didst fill but half a plate, and at a steep price of fourteen silver pieces. The beef, alas, was cut into great chunks, making it difficult to chew, and the fried rice, a dish fit for children, didst lack all flavor. Moreover, this place doth only accept cash, a curious policy, methinks, and one that doth raise questions about their handling of taxes. In brief, dear friends, avoid this place, for its rude servers, vile victuals, and exorbitant prices do make it a most undesirable destination.""",True,Shakespeare

Bad service. Didn't seem to care, from hostess to waiter. Understaffed. Took 40 minutes for grub. Only six tables. Almost left. Wrong drinks. Had to chase 'em down. Food subpar.

Stale bread, and water, cold as winter's ground.
The waitress, slovenly, with nary a care,
Did spill the water, and our garments did stain.
And then, the Nata, a dessert most vile,
Stale and old, did bounce off the wall with a smile.
The waitress, with a scowl, did argue the fact,
But we, with haste, did return the foul tract.
And after, with a countenance most dire,
Did she bemoan the tip, and with a sigh, did fire.

And sought a scene, of trendy report.

With gas stations, pharmacy in sight,
A line of people, waiting to enter,
And I, at front, didst face a stern sentry.

My age, he asked, and I, didst reply,
No issue there, but then, didst catch his eye,
My shoes, so plain, didst not impress,
And thus, away, didst swiftly dismiss.

A supermarket bar, with rules so tight,
No sneakers allowed, such foolish sight,
I laughed and called my friend, within,
And spoke my mind, of policy so thin.

At my loud words, of pure mischance,

""Hark, good people, gather 'round and heed my words,
For I shall tell thee of a place most vile and cursed.
'Tis a restaurant, or so they call it,
But in truth, 'tis naught but a pit of woe and sorrow.

The tables, once clean, now bear the stains of time,
With crumbs and spills that mar their surface, a sorry sight.
The chairs, too, are worn and tired,
With dust and dirt that clings to them like a plague.

The food, oh how it fails to impress,
A travesty of flavors, a culinary distress.
The rice, once cooked, now lies in wait,
Cold and hard, a mere three minutes too late.
The pork, alas, is fat and lean,
A sorry sight, akin to a diseased animal.
The eggs, once scrambled, now are rubbery and tight,
A far cry from the fluffy delights they once were.

And then, there's the buffet, a paltry spread,
With toast that's burnt and bread that's long since dead.
The bacon, too, is cooked beyond all reason,
Dried out and crumbly, a mere shadow of its former self.

The service, oh how it falters,
A sorry state, with mistakes that multiply and mount.
A messed-up order, a comped meal,
Yet still, they serve the end tails, a bitter pill.

So, friends, take heed of my warning,
Shun this place, lest thou suffer the same fate.
'Tis a pit of despair, a den of woe,
Best left avoided, lest thou wish to know true sorrow.""",True,Shakespeare

For my kin's portraits, and loved the score,
A package deal, and then online access,
For my kin to purchase more, with ease.

But now, alas, my joy doth turn to woe,
For on my latest visit, I didst know,
That the online studio, once free to view,
Now doth require a payment, anew.

My son, a babe of two summers, doth grace,
The pictures, taken with love and care,
But when I sought to buy, in fond embrace,
The rest of the poses, I found despair.

Forsooth, the studio doth no longer provide,
The online access, save for those who decide,
To buy upfront, more poses, ere they take,
Their leave of the studio, and its make.

And thus, dear friends, my heart doth break,
For I have lost, those precious pictures, make,
Of my sweet babe, in his tender youth,
Forever gone, without a chance of truth.

I visited the shelter today, hoping to find a new feline friend. After checking out the cats, I decided to take a gander at the dogs. Can't hurt, right? Maybe I'd even find a new furry companion to take home.

I wandered around for a good half hour, but no one seemed interested in helping me. People passed by, giving me strange looks, like I was an alien or something. The workers were just standing around, gossiping under a tent, not lifting a finger to help.

Finally, I approached them, seeking assistance. They stared at me, unenthused, before one of them reluctantly helped me look at a dog. He mumbled a few words and then scurried back to his gossip fest.

I returned the dog, and once again, everyone gave me the cold shoulder. It seemed like they were more interested in chatting than helping potential adopters. The dogs were crying out for attention, their cages marked ""I need walked,"" but only the volunteers were taking them for strolls. What a shame.

I felt pretty crummy leaving the shelter. It's a real pity, since the folks there were generally nice, except for the dog adoption crew. Their lack of friendliness and laziness was a major turnoff. I won't be going back, which is unfortunate. With a bit of effort, they could find homes for many more dogs.",True,Hemingway

""Hark! This store, a place of woe and desp'rate need,
Where one doth venture forth, with heavy heart and slow.
Walmart, a name that doth conjure images of grime,
A place where harlots ply their trade, and madness doth climb.
I do detest this place, and shun it with great care,
For in its halls, confusion doth reign supreme, and naught but despair.

The employees, a witless lot, doth stumble and stutter,
Unable to assist, their minds a jumbled disaster.
And should thou seek aid, fear not, for thy device,
Shall guide thee better than these hapless souls, in this dark, benighted space.

But lo! The management, a rare and elusive breed,
Doth hide and skulk, afear'd to show their faces, indeed.
Oh, joy! For in this place, the mighty Walmart doth reign,
A kingdom of chaos, where order doth not sustain.""",True,Shakespeare

Didst fail, in truth, to stir my appetite,
A selection grand, of toppings, 'tis true,

The bun, alas! Didst disappoint, as well,
Like Wonderbread, it was, in texture, and in taste,
So, with my girl, we didst share two burgers,
No fries, nor drinks, and still, the cost, didst mount,
To twelve dollars, and with them, twenty,
A sum, that for a meal, so plain, doth seem quite steep.

Are naught but mediocre, and o'erpriced, to boot,
And he, who doth recommend them, with such zeal,
Hath questionable taste, in my humble opinion, at least.""",True,Shakespeare

My birth, with plans to lodge at inn so great
But when we arrived, oh woeful sight
No parking space, nigh impossible to alight

The check-in staff, their service slow and poor
We waited, tired, our patience wore
At last, they gave us room, with beds of two
Not kingly bed, our reservation flew

I called the desk, a hold they did place
Fully booked, they said, no room to grace
I went, my bags, to load once more
Drove back, stood in line, as before

A new room, they did assign
We walked, our bags, the distance nigh
Unloaded all, and opened door
To find a room, design of days of yore

In dismay, I dropped my bags, and went
To restaurant, but entrance, I could not invent
Back to the car, to Elephant bar I did stray
With food and drink, my spirits did play

My bill, $175, and what it did proffer
Next morn, I checked out, and home did steer

""Alas, my heart doth break to pen these words,
For once, Armstrong's was my heart's desire,
A place where I would brave hell and high water,
To savor their dishes, my taste buds' choicest fire.

But alack, my friends, my recent visit proved
A bitter disappointment, nay, a cruel joke.
The dining room, once clean and full of cheer,
Now doth resemble a dirty, foul-smelling cloak.

Our server, once attentive and full of grace,
Didst now ignore us, leaving us in disgrace.
She didst not check on us, nor didst she care,
And when we ordered, she didst not tarry there.

And when I spoke to the manager, in hope
Of some redress for our poor treatment, lo,
He didst reply with scorn and bitter gall,
""Everyone hath bad experiences, that's just all.""

I know not what didst prompt his strange reply,
But this I know, I shall not darken their door again,
For though my heart didst once love Armstrong's dear,
Now doth it break, and sorrow doth remain.""",True,Shakespeare

But alas, the dish they brought, didst leave me cold,
With scant few morsels of meat, and naught but vegetables to behold.

From a shop whose wares didst please mine eye.

Chocolate, vanilla, lemon, and red velvet in store.

As the cakes they sold, in flavor and substance.

Alas, how wrong she was, for they were dry,
Excessively so, and quite a disappointment nigh.
I visited in the morn, yet still they lacked moisture,
Leaving me dismayed, and in sore displeasure.

After work, with haste, I did attend.
But lo! The salon was closed, alack!
Despite the sign, which did declare,
It should be open till eight o'clock,
I found it shut, my hopes did mock.

I've spent my coins on tanning packs,

A place where breakfast dreams are made, they say.
Mike P and Ashley D, two hungry souls,
Did venture forth, their hunger to assuage.

Alas, the cafe was full, but fear not,
For in short time, a table was found.
The atmosphere was lively, full of cheer,
And coffee, fresh, though not the best, 'twain true.

The menu, a curious sight, indeed,
Offered omelets, but in limited breed.
Egg white versions, for the health-conscious mind,
Were available, and one such, I did find.

My omelet, Eggzilla, a tasty treat,
With spinach, peppers, salsa, and cheese so neat.
But alas, poor Ashley, her omelet, a disappointment,
A shame, for the price, a decent arrangement.

In conclusion, Sunrise Cafe, a decent spot,
But for the price, elsewhere, you may find a better plot.""",True,Shakespeare

In seats of little worth, with views most dim.

""Alas, my friends, I must recount a tale of woe,
Of a dining experience that did not go well,
During restaurant week, we did decide to dine,
But found the fare to be most disappointing, I do declare.

The brie, it was barely warm, and the apples, dry,
The fruit, it was not caramelized, oh my,
The toast, it was but a mere morsel, I did cry,
For a brulee, I saw not, alack and alas.

My dinner partner, he did have the Escargot,
Which was good, I must admit, 'twas a treat,
But the filet mignon, oh so petite,
I was surprised, and not in a good way, I do confess.

It came with sauce, and tomatoes, warm and bright,
But the potatoes, small and few, they were not right,
I've had better fries, alas, I must say,
And the sea bass, though flavorful, was tiny, oh dear.

The pasta, it was good, but the portion, small,
I did thank my friend for sharing, lest I fall,
Into hunger's clutches, for I had been misled,
By the restaurant's words, which did not bear fruit.

The Hazelnut Tarte, oh so dull and plain,
With chocolate that was not rich, and pastry, not worth the gain,
A few nuts on top, they did not make up for the flaw,
I was not impressed, nor was I filled with awe.

I called beforehand, to ask of the portions size,
But they told me I would not go hungry, oh what a lie,
The service too, was slow, and the drinks, they did not refill,
I waited long, and my thirst, it did not still.

Alas, my friends, I must conclude,
That this restaurant, it did not meet my views,
I shall not return, for I was not pleased,
And thus, my tale of woe, it ends.""",True,Shakespeare

To ensure that I, a satisfied patron, didst fare.

In customer service, and a prompt attack.
A lengthy wait, a crowd of people, didst vex,
And when I sought to pay, a further delay didst perplex.

To serve the grape, and so we were bereft.
Two strikes, it seemed, against this place so fair,
But then, a third, most grievous error did occur.

For bread, she said they had none, nor could they make.

And the meat, it was bland, I do protest.

The rice, it looked fine, but the taste,
Was burnt, as if the broth didst haste,
And the beans, they were smothered in cheese,
But the flavor, it didst not please.

A couple of bright spots, there were,
The salsa, both hot and mild, didst stir,
The waiter, friendly and outgoing,
And the atmosphere, old school, it was going.

But alas, the food, it didst not impress,
So I cannot recommend, I must confess,
Tee Pee, it may be a place to drink,
But for food, I wouldst not think.""",True,Shakespeare

Healthy options, freshness, all can see.
No time to cook, nor deep pockets I have,

With choice of seasoning or sauce, a wondrous border.
Soups, sandwiches, salads, and tacos, all on the list,
A feast for the eyes, and the belly, 'twill dismiss.

Kid-friendly, they be, with options galore,
For the little ones, a treat in store.
But alas, my experience, a downside did bring,
The fishy smell, not so fresh, did my nostrils sting.

Mango salsa, a delight, on my orange roughy,
Brown rice, no complaints, a satisfying comity.
But the fish, oh the fish, could be better, I say,
At these prices, freshness flies away.

A brownie, perhaps, to make her way?

So I get it, and it looks like they just threw some food on a plate. Sloppy as hell. I take off the top bun, and there's barely any green chile. Ask for a side, and it shows up. It's hot, but it tastes like straight out of a can. Gross. My girl's meal wasn't much better. She got some Green Chile Chicken thing, and it looked like a mess. Rice, beans, cheese, and some chicken soup or something. She said it was too salty. Not New Mexican food, just Tex-Mex with Hatch chile.""",True,Hemingway

I ordered my burrito, and they gave me a number and told me to take a seat. While I waited, I noticed other customers looking just as confused as I was about the poor service. When my burrito finally arrived, I was famished. But let me tell you, it was tiny. I'm not one to complain about small portions, but this thing was laughable. It came with a lime wedge that was dried out and looked like it had been sitting there for a day. The carne asada was flavorless and had a weird texture.

""O, woe is me, dear friends, for I do find
This theatre most vexing, and thus, I do avoid
Its confines, opting instead for other haunts
That lie beyond the city's bustling bounds.

Firstly, its location doth elude my grasp,
A secret hideaway, concealed from view,
And were it not for yonder sign that doth direct,
I might have ne'er discovered it, I do confess.

And once within, my troubles did ensue,
For at the concession stand, confusion did reign,
The popcorn, cold and stale, did fail to impress,
And left me in a state of utter dismay.

The seats, old, cramped, and hard, did cause me woe,
And in the darkness, I did feel quite alone,
A feeling strange and foreign, ne'er before known,
In other cinemas, where crowds did gather and moan.

Thus, I do choose to shun this place, my friends,
And seek elsewhere, entertainment that doth endure,
For this theatre, doth fail, in every way,
To meet my expectations, and doth leave me cold, I pray.""",True,Shakespeare

Can't do that when you're packed in like sardines. Don't care how good you look comin' in, you'll look nasty if you're sweaty and wasted. Might be a strategic move to push your way into the crowd, though, 'cause it's hard to fall down with all those people holdin' you up. Those girls in the pools are real depressin', too.

And duplicates were printed, tales unveiled.
We searched for an usher, our guide,
To find our seats, our place to reside.

And led us to a distant seat, so queer.
Betwixt families, we sat and watched,
As the show began, its tale unclocked.

With pandas dancing, acrobatics to scatter.
No story, it seemed, just random play,

The chili and lime shrimp, oh how grand,
And grilled scallops with mango salsa, a true delight.
But alas, the flavors did not impress,
Overpriced, the dishes did profess.
Four pieces of shrimp for fourteen crowns,
Our scallops, undercooked, with frowns.

The servers, friendly and polite,
Attentive, they did ignite.
The decor, striking and fair,
A trendy place, to drink and share.
But alas, the food, a letdown,
Would not entice me, to come around.""",True,Shakespeare

For this east valley tavern, hidden from view,
Didst play hard to find, in a strip mall's midst,
With a gruff visage on the entrance, anon, didst seem uncouth.

Two areas within, for revelry and cheer,
When full, a college party atmosphere doth bring,
But empty, fried food scent and punching doth fill the air,
As youths, in Scottsdale finery, doth congregate, in vain.

A musical evening, I didst attend,
Yet, distractions abounded, my friend,
Televisions, Golden Tee, a punching bag game,
Didst steal my focus, and my thoughts didst become askew.

One drink, a Jameson's, I didst imbibe,
(O, Toby, the price, didst cause me to quip!)
Perplexed, I remained, at this place's intent,
And why, oh why, would they allow punching, during a tuneful event?

A spacious patio, outside, doth beckon,
A larger room, with stage, for music, doth enchant,
And, in a smaller space, darts and pool doth await,
Like Iowa's venue, with diverse delights, in days of yore, didst present.

In Gilbert, perhaps, such diversity doth thrive,

To celebrate a comrade's final night of freedom,
And made a reservation, as was meet and right,
For six of us, at a specific hour, with all due speed.

But lo, when we arrived, the woman there
Didst inform us that no such reservation didst exist,
And though she seemed a gentle soul, with nary a care,
She could not help us, nor didst she make amends, alas.

One seat they had, but 'twas a lonely perch,
And hours would pass ere others didst become available,
So we, in sadness, didst depart, with naught to show,
Save for the shaved face of him whose party it didst behold.

For reservations made may not always be to tell,
And those who do not keep their word, doth bring us woe,
So let us beware, and find another place to go.""",True,Shakespeare

Eight dollars and fifty cents, for a pint,
Of generic beer, that doth not tempt.
And Murphy's stout, that doth not taste,
As it should, and leaves me in disgrace.

I'd rather drink, at a nearby place,
Where local beer, doth flow with grace.

And cheaper too, I must tell.

The food, I cannot speak of,
For I did not eat, nor did I prove.
But my companion, did say it was good,
The egg noodles, and eggplant ragout, they stood.

The menu, had choices fair and bright,
But not your typical pub fare, in sight.
A Ploughman's Lunch, for thirteen dollars,
A high-end menu, that doth not please.

Prime rib comes with weak horseradish, cut with butter. Never heard of that before. Luckily, I had sour cream with my baked potato and asked for raw horseradish. It wasn't great, but better than the butter.

The credit, as promised, didst believe.
But lo, when I didst return, to buy anew,
They said the ten percent, was already true.

My store credit, was but fifty-five,
When it shouldst have been, five-oh, I do declare.

Of service poor, and manners none too bright.
I went to Au Bon Pain, with hunger pangs,
And ordered oatmeal, with naught but thanks.

But lo, the cashier, with fingers nimble,
Didst text with speed, her thumbs didst flutter.
And I, a patient soul, didst stand and wait,
While she didst finish her message, with nary a debate.

Her eyes didst glance up, with frequency rare,
To note my presence, with scarce a care.
And though the oatmeal was tasty, I must confess,
The service there, didst leave much to be desired, alas.

And put their customers, in a higher place.

The chili, akin to Alpo's brew, and patty, thin as McDonald's finest, left much to be desired. Fries, a lone bright spot, yet naught else didst impress.

Of wings that failed to impress, nay, did pale.
I sought a happy hour, with brew and snacks,
But found instead a culinary lack.

The service, fair, yet slow, as if in haste,
Did little to improve the sorry taste.
I ordered wings, but oh, how they fell,
Dry, bland, and lacking in flavorful zest.

And though I asked for grilled, they came not,
But drenched in sauce, which made them naught.
My friend, too, shared this disappointment,
A different sauce, but still no improvement.

The beer selection, paltry, I must say,
No rare or special brews to sway.
The atmosphere, good, yet not enough,
To make up for the food's lack of stuff.

So, will I return? Not likely, friends,
For other options call, and time does end.

Yet, their attentions, scarce, and hard to busy.

I waved, a-several times, to gain their eye,
But still, they passed, as if the wind did lie.
Even when they came, to take the empty plates,
Their focus elsewhere, as if in distant states.

But lacking a hint of spice, she did declare,
Whilst Grandma's banana bread French toast,
Was overly sweet, and the sauce did pour.
No need for syrup, these bad boys did boast,
But alas, her bowl of fruit, she did enjoy the most.

Veggie omelette, with potatoes, a feast,
But lo, the veggies were scarce, at best,
More cheese and egg whites, did make it bland,

Tapatio and ketchup, did make it better,

But with each trip, troubles mount, while solutions dwindle.
Their prices be exorbitant, a fact that doth astound,
For rival shops offer better deals, both in rent and bound.

As if they held the sole key to photography's sheen.
Their knowledge, though not vast, doth overflow with conceit,
Leaving me to ponder if they truly do perceive.

A time there was, when battery replacement did require,

A place to rest our weary feet, and thus didst seek
The Pittsburgh Grille, a place of rest and cheer,
Whose decor was neat, with murals bright and clear.

The bar was filled with screens, a sight to behold,
And in the dining area, more screens did unfold.
'Twas a curious sight, yet fitting, I did find,
Since this place stood beside the stadium, so divine.

A cigar bar, a rare sight, didst catch mine eye,
And I didst think it added a touch of elegance nigh.
The place was plush, and comfortably didst provide
A refuge from the noise, and the night's wild pride.

We stayed but for a drink, though I didst desire
To stay longer, and partake of their festive fire.
But alas, a patron loud and rough didst make
A scene most vile, and caused a stir, forsooth, a mistake.

By his own affairs, and left our glasses dry and bright.
Though few were there, and time didst pass slowly by,

""A wedding didst bring me to this place,
And though the chamber was not so bad,
The water closet didst make such a noise,
As if 'twere trying to wake the dead.

I opened up the tank, to see if I
Could quiet it, and found a sight most strange,
The fill valve had not been changed in years,
A sign of neglect, or laziness, I fear.

They have a scheme, they call it ""Eco"",
Whereby thou mayst decline fresh linens,
And in return, receive a token worth five dollars,
To spend on food and drink, they say.
But beware, fair traveler, for they do not tell thee,
That this token cannot be used on ale or wine,
The bartender, he should have said, with grace,
""I cannot take this, but for thee, I shall,""
And from his tip, he should have given thee,
Five dollars back, for good customer service,
But instead, he left a foul taste in my mouth,
And now, I do complain, in this review.

Another thing, about this five dollar prize,
Is that housekeeping doth not visit thy room,
No fresh coffee cups, nor coffee, nor even,
Glasses, made of glass, but cheap, plastic things,
For the price of the room, and their ""Eco"" ways,
Surely, they could provide some proper glasses.

The location, good, a short walk to other places,
But parking, pricey, yet not unreasonable,
In this, a major city, downtown, they say.
So, stay, if thou must, but beware of these things,
And hope that they shall change, for the better, ere long.""",True,Shakespeare

A change from usual breakfast, I do declare.
I order spring rolls and pork meatballs, 'twas my whim,

A BBQ meatball salad, it seemed, with veggies galore,
And rice paper wraps, hard as stone, I knew not what to do.
Water, I requested, to soften them, I pray,
For such a quantity of greens, I could not stay.

A BBQ pork bowl, I thought I had ordered, fair,
But lo, the same setup, with lettuce, herbs, and bare.
Two slider patties, it seemed, and pork, oh so sweet,
But portion size, a problem, my hunger to greet.

The taste, it pleased me well, no doubt, no doubt,
But meat to lettuce ratio, a rabbit's shout.
Next time, perhaps, the pho, I shall essay,
For in it, lettuce, I hope, doth not come into play.""",True,Shakespeare

By my troth, the sandwich maker didst go out of her way,

And cast it aside, like a worthless, wretched thing.
A 12-inch tuna sub, with meal deal, didst cost thee $13.00,

And thus, my hopes were dashed, my spirits did sink.

I ordered tacos, three in number, diverse
In flavor and in form, yet all did share
A common flaw, a lack of zest, a dearth
Of seasoning, which left my taste buds quite bare.

The carnitas, once a dish of renown,
Was now but a shadow of its former self,
Dried up and crunchy, with nary a trace
Of moisture or of flavor, alack and alas!

The fish, too, was a disappointment,
Baked, not grilled, and lacking in charm,
While the shrimp, so small and insipid,
Did little to assuage my growing discontent.

I ate but half, then cast the rest aside,
For poor value did it seem, and o'erpriced
Besides, the management, in their zeal
To compensate for lack of custom, did err.

The service, I must confess, was quite good. Forsooth, the maiden at the counter, when asked, didst guide me through the menu with grace and wit. And thus, I didst order the Spanish Harlem, with a side of potato salad, as suggested by the fair maiden. 

But lo, the potato salad, in a tiny cup it came, a mere morsel, a snack, a trifle! Methought, ""Surely, this is some jest, some merry prank?"" Forsooth, the portion was scant, and the taste, alack, was naught but common, akin to that found in the marketplace. And thus, I didst pay $1.99 for two bites of potato salad, a sorry sight indeed. 

The sandwich, however, didst please mine taste. The spread, flavorful, and the steak, cooked to perfection. The bread, alas, was naught but ordinary. And thus, for $8.99, a sum not small, didst I partake of a meal, that, though not unpleasant, didst not live up to the standards of the Big Apple, whose name it doth bear. 

In conclusion, fair friends, the service, indeed, was good, but alas, the food, a disappointment. For in New York, they do say, ""You get what you pay for,"" and thus, I didst not find it worth the cost.""",True,Shakespeare

For slice of pizza worthy of the city's name.

Breakfast's got waffles, french toast, omelets, breakfast meats 'n' potatoes. Lunch 'n' dinner's the same: fried seafood, pizza, Chinese food (which is pretty tasty), some nights got crab legs 'n' steaks for a bit more. Wait staff's generally nice 'n' attentive.

""Fair Basha, thy victuals be of quality,
With meat most genuine, not the tainted sort,
Thy salads too, fresh as the morning dew,
A feast for eyes and taste, no need to fault.

But, alas, thy female servants, fair,
From Middle East, their ways not ours,
Do shun the men, and scant their duty bear,
In this, the land of liberty and power.

For here, in West, men and women meet,
In shops and markets, all do greet,
No shame in't, nor impoliteness found,
For such is custom, and tradition bound.

So, Basha, heed my words of wisdom,
Train thy females, in our ways of pleasantry,
Lest they, in scorn, do shun the male clientele,
And thus, poor service, doth bring thee naught but woe.

For I, myself, have witnessed, twice,
Their scant regard, and sullen, troubled vice,
At Ste Catherine, Peel, a dame most dire,
And at Place Mont Royal, a woman, coy and shy,
Whose husband, bald, and friendly, didst seem,
Yet she, with scorn, didst give me change, most queer.

If she, in truth, doth loathe the male folk,
Then let her hide, in kitchen's darkest nook,
Where she, from men, may safely be apart,
And thus, no more, our custom, doth impart.""",True,Shakespeare

I went for the soup dumplings and fried string beans. Twenty bucks for two dishes, not too shabby.

Dance floor was decent, full of people, but the bar area, empty. Bartender, quick and friendly, pours a good drink. Got myself a nice buzz going, decided to hit the dance floor. Problem was, not enough space, weird metal plates, felt like I was gonna slip 'n fall.

Can't judge a Goth club on one visit, that's the truth. It's a scene, a lifestyle, takes time to fit in. Remembered how long it took me to feel welcome at my own club back home. So, won't make any hasty judgments here.

And bird droppings did adorn the chairs, most obscene.

My steak was cooked just right, and oh so bright.
The service was good, but our waitress did stray,

""Hark! A Milwaukeean through and through, I stayed at Wynn, and thus didst venture to the in-house Bartolotta's, unaware of its origin in my fair city. Alas, I didst not partake in the full experience, forsooth, for I do not consume seafood, which doth arrive fresh daily from the Mediterranean. Aye, 'tis a bit absurd, yet understandable, given the arid environs.

Thus, I didst opt for pasta dishes and pancetta. Verily, the pancetta was tough and fatty, but I didst expect such. The sheep's milk ravioli, however, didst delight mine taste buds. The spaghetti with ragu? Not so much, alack.

In conclusion, methinks the price didst outweigh the quality, but mayhap 'twas the ambiance that didst lack. Forsooth, they should transport Bartolotta's Lake Park Bistro from Milwaukee and plant it within the Wynn, anon. In my humble opinion, 'twould be an improvement, by the stars!""",True,Shakespeare

Of this firm, which doth damage our gazebo, alack!
With palm fronds broken, a mess didst ensue,
And anger didst swell within my breast, I do confess.

But now, a pact we have made, full of grace,
They didst offer restitution, in fairness and in place.
Their kindness didst abound, all issues to address,
And thus, our quarrel didst find a peaceful reprieve.

A lesson to all, in times of trouble and of woe.

She was friendly throughout our meal, but another server, Carol, made a big stink about us being seated late. She complained loudly and made us feel unwelcome. The grub was great, but Carol's attitude left a bad taste. If the boss says it's okay, then it's okay. And if it's such a big deal, maybe turn off the open sign at 2 pm.

""Upon this night, my fair companion and I did partake
In culinary delights, at yonder tavern's bar,
Wherein the bartender, with mirth and glee, did play
The host, and served us with most excellent fare.
A pizza, fresh from oven's heat, we did share,
And dumplings, savory, with duck meat within,
Did please our taste buds, and we did exclaim,
'Tis a fine establishment, this place doth win.
Akin to Cheesecake Factory, in splendor doth it shine.""",True,Shakespeare

""Alack, the spread they lay before us now,
So bountiful, yet with a tainted hue.
For though the feast be grand, 'tis true,
They've cut the choices, and we must wait anew.

Once, we had a choice of crustaceans fine,
But now, alas, they've pared it down to one line.
And wait we must, for up to fifteen minutes more,
Just to receive our platter, and then we're sore.

A pox upon their house, for trying to save a coin,
By making us wait, and suffer thus, in vain.
This service, once great, now doth leave us cold,
And two stars, I fear, is all they'll hold.""",True,Shakespeare

At yonder eatery, didst I partake.
A roast beef sandwich, of tender care,
Didst please mine taste, with juices rare.
The others, at my table, didst delight,
In Thai salad, of flavors so bright.
'Twas vast, a feast for sore eyes,
And left them all, in sweet surprise.
Another, of our merry band,
Didst choose the Mahi, so fresh and grand.
The servers, with smiles so wide,
Didst tend to us, with gentle pride.

For though 'twas not of little cost,
'Twas worth each penny, I do boast.""",True,Shakespeare

The service, indeed, was most pleasant, the maidens friendly and helpful. But, alack, the victuals, they did not meet my expectations. I ordered the Pestorica, a burger with relish, pesto, and mozzarella, and a side of onion rings with dips. The burger, when it arrived, was a feast for mine eyes, but, alas, 'twas too thin, lacking in substance and seasoning. The onion rings, too, did not please mine taste, for they were crumbly and greasy, not battered as I had hoped. In sooth, the oreo milk shake was the sole redeeming feature of my visit. Methinks this place hath potential, but, for now, they do fail to meet mine expectations.""",True,Shakespeare

Saturday morning, I hit the brunch spot at 11am. Line wasn't too bad. Noticed they got them self-pay kiosks now. Good call when the line's long.

Omelette station's where it's at. Got two eggs over easy. Way better than them powdered eggs for scrambled. Other breakfast joint had potatoes and Portuguese sausage.

Found the salmon lox, capers, onion, and made a killer croissant sandwich. No bagels though. Finished off with some fresh fruit and Greek yogurt.

A lot of stuff looks good, but my buddies said otherwise. No high-end items like prime rib, crab legs, or lamb. Solid 2.5 or 3 stars, but watch what you eat and you'll enjoy your meal without feeling like a slug afterwards.",True,Hemingway

Alas, the fare doth not compare to that of Cut, Delmonicos, or Del Frisco.

No wait didst we encounter, yet we didst sit,
In yonder bar, for swift service didst we wit.
But nay, the hostess came, and with great disdain,
Didst tell us we didst sit at dining tables in vain.

And so, we waited, for another ten minutes or so,
Until she didst return, and with menus didst bestow.
But alack, the very same table didst she bring,
And with a flick of her wrist, the menus didst fling.

'Tis a popular spot, so expect a crowd,
But fear not, for the fare is worth the wait,
The falafel balls, they doth taste most sweet,
And the creamy Tahini sauce, doth complement the treat.

The exterior, adorned with Roman statues grand,
Doth make it hard to miss, as thou dost pass by the land,
And within, a Greek cafeteria doth await,
With much seating space, and people, in abundance doth create.

In Baker, a decent bathroom doth abide,
And to the left of The Mad Greek, a pole doth reside,
A thermometer, the largest in all the land,

The table, sticky and unclean,
The server, hasty and most keen,
To take our order, and away,
Our appetizers, in haste, didst fly.

We began with bruschetta, a dish most fair,
But lo! The flatbread, cold and stale,
Didst dampen mine spirits, and my hope,
That it, on sliced bread, might be served,
Like Postino's or D'Vine's, in sooth.

My spouse, the orichette, didst choose,
With sausage, but alas! 'Twas oversalted,
And the sausage, bland, without a voice,
In this dish, a disappointment, stark.

I, the porcini ravioli, didst select,
With tomato cream sauce, a flavour most sweet,
But lo! The sauce, oversalted, alack!
Didst mar the dish, and my tastebuds, didst attack.

The ambiance, passable, yet the TV's large,
In the bar, a distraction, most strange,
From the dining room, a sight most odd,

Inclusive of soup, sandwiches, baked potatoes, fish pie,
Risotto, stovies, and more, their offerings did lie.
And though naught fancy, our repast did please,
With generous portions, and flavors that did tease.

A bottle of wine, and three soft drinks did we consume,
For a sum of fifty pounds, our bellies now succumb.
I booked a table, two days prior, with haste,

A decaf coffee didst I order, and for breakfast, eggs, 
With sausage, pancakes, and butter, which didst please my taste. 
The eggs, alas! Were lukewarm, but still, the rest didst burn,

Hark, what news is this? A dinner so plain,  
With co-workers, 'twas a work event in vain.  
The victuals, good, but not worth the mind,  
Inside the Cosmo hotel, a place unrefined.  
Loud it was, and full of mirth and cheer,  
A gathering spot for friends most dear.

An ordinary place, not worth the while.  
Other restaurants beckon, come what may,

Hark, good sir! I do beseech thee, let this humble patronage of thine establishment be met with a modicum of enthusiasm. Forsooth, 'tis a truth universally acknowledged, that a customer in possession of a local loyalty must be in want of a pleasant experience.

Alas, upon entering thy domain, mine eyes didst behold a sight most curious. A mere handful of patrons, and yet, the service didst seem so lacking in zeal. The barista, apathetic and unmoved, didst attend to mine order with all the fervor of a sloth.

Pray tell, good sir, doth thy staff possess a certain... disdain for the art of hospitality? Methinks, a smile, a kindly word, or perchance, a gentle nod of acknowledgement, might prove a balm most soothing to the souls of those who grace thy premises.

Forgive me, kind sir, if mine observations doth seem unduly harsh. 'Tis merely that, as a patron, I do crave a sense of welcoming, a feeling that my presence doth bring a measure of joy, however small, unto those who serve me.

In conclusion, prithee, dear Next, let this humble plea touch thy heart. In the future, mayhap thou couldst instruct thy minions to embrace the virtues of courtesy, and thus, ensure that each and every customer doth depart, feeling grateful and content.",True,Shakespeare

With two rooms within and one without, we had choice plenty, and in the larger room we did reside. \n\nThe service, fair and prompt, did please, despite our number great. They offered us a menu of diverse dishes, and with glee did cater to our dietary needs, off-menu, no less. \n\nAlas, the victuals, save the starters, did not impress. Feta, olives, tzatziki, all were small, yet tasty still.

Freshly made, it wouldst have been a treat,
But served cold, 'twas not a pleasant meet.

With prices fair, and food most meek.

I sought a new haunt, to watch the game,
Tired of the Half Moon, its atmosphere,
I yearned for change, and a different name.

Teakwoods, a place of note, did catch my eye,
With TVs many, and a menu extensive,
Drink specials, too, did seem quite nice,
A place to watch, and revel in delight.

The food, a bar fare, yet tasty still,
Jess Jess wings, a treat, worth the bill,
But alas, the beer, a sorry sight,
A list most dreadful, a true plight.

Eclectic, and full of life, a song,
Frat boys, five, in merriment,
Gangstas, four, with attitude bent,
Hipsters, three, with shades so bright,
Goth chicks, two, on a date so right,
A daughter, one, with her mum so fair,
Arguing, laughing, in the air.

Teakwoods, a place of wonder,
A partridge in a pear tree, no other,
Beer, a minus, but food, a plus,
Sports watching, good, and people, too.

For types of oysters, ask thy waitress, lest confusion reign,
Chicken and waffles, naught out of the ordinary, I do swear,

In Phoenix, I had paid and checked with speed,
Yet, lo! My seat, they did not heed.
I raged, in ire, with words most bold,
This review, at first, a single star did hold.

But then, the staff, with grace so fine,
Did find me seat, most comfortable and divine.
And swiftly, too, did they provide escape,
Their courtesy, did my anger shape.

So now, three stars, this review doth bear,
For though the start, did cause despair,
The end, did bring me joy and cheer,
Thanks to the crew, so kind and dear.""",True,Shakespeare

""Hark! A tale of Planet Hollywood, I shall recount,
Where meats and seafood, in abundance, they do mount.
A Groupon, it was, that did entice us to dine,
For $79, all-you-can-eat, a feast most divine.

Sirloin, lamb, and shrimp, oh my!
In a separate plate, the surf, did they bring nigh.
Mussels, salmon, and tilapia, a delicious sight,
But alas, some meats, were dry, not quite right.

The salad bar, a decent spread,
Vegetables, hot dishes, all well-prepared, 'twas said.
And drinks, they did include, in this deal,
A chinahuia, with pineapple, lime, and tequila, did steal.

The hunny, a rum runner, did pour,
Much heavier, than mine, it did devour.
Overall, an okay restaurant, I must confess,
But Texas de Brasil, better meat, does possess.

Marcile, our server, did run,
With a split section, his work, was done.
Bad reviews, I had seen, before this night,
But not as bad, as anticipated, the sight.""",True,Shakespeare

The waiter was a character, dressed like he'd just stepped out of a bad '80s music video. We ordered the pretzel fondue, which was good, but too salty. I had the French Dip, which was a letdown. The roast beef was drowned in some weird mayo-based sauce, and the au jus was way too strong. It was like they were trying too hard to be different, you know? Like they wanted to be the cool spot in town, but ended up falling short. The food was decent, but the atmosphere was lacking. So, I gave 'em a 3 outta 5.""",True,Hemingway

Their happy hour and brunch specials, oh so fine,

I've visited thrice, and tried their fare,
But cannot say, with certainty, if 'tis fair.
The initial bites, oh how they doth delight,
But soon, the flavors doth become too bright.

The service, too, doth leave much to be desired,
For though not woeful, 'twas not inspired.
A waiter, once, forgot my iced tea,
And left me parched, to pine for thee.

Yet, there was a time, when happy hour did grace,
Our presence, and a mistake did occur,
They charged my friend but three pence,
For two drinks, a veritable bonanza!

The fries, as well, did please our tastebuds' delight.
But, lo! The crowd, they did go wild, as if possessed.
An average fast food chain, it seemed to us,
Quick, dirty, and with ketchup, quite a fuss.

A word to the wise, thou drive-thru window lad,
When one declines ketchup, do not gape, aghast.
For, in their stead, a simple 'no, thank thee' would suffice.

Which, alas, did fail to stir my soul's fire.
The build-up, great, with atmosphere quite dark,
And modern, too, the restaurant's noble mark.

Yet, when served, my disappointment grew,
For sauce, so bland, and lacking seasoning, too.
No flavors danced upon my palate's delight,
Nay, not even a hint of sweetness took flight.

The chicken pieces, three in total, small,
Did cause me near to laugh, yet kept my mirth within.
French fries, homemade, the only saving grace,
For which, alas, I cannot claim a special place.

We rolled into the Wynn late, exhausted from the road. Needed something quick to eat, so we hit up The Cafe. They had some solid options - sandwiches, salads, desserts. Ordered the Chicken Portabella. Was a bit disappointed it wasn't freshly made, just reheated and served. For $11, I expected better. But slathered some garlic aioli on it, took a bite, and it was damn tasty. Pair it with a $4 Coke (steep, but what can you do?) and I was set for the night.

But she, the hostess too, didst bear the weight,
Of duties many, and with slowness didst detain,

In we walked, and swiftly seated were we,
Drink orders taken, with haste, did they bring.

But then, a delay, there came to pass,
After drink orders, some fifteen minutes' wait,
Our orders taken, by hostess fair,
Due to waitress's o'erwhelmed plight, we did surmise.

Food came, some fifteen minutes later,
We ate with haste, lest we be late,
Turkey dinner, with small pieces, did come,
Not long cut strips, as menu did proclaim.

Pancakes, with white chocolate raspberry,
His choice, a good pick, did prove to be,
Egg Nog pancakes, a good option, did seem,
But alas, not chosen, by me.

Last eve, I chanced upon the W, where revelry did reign,
A bachelorette party, full of mirth and glee, did hold its sway.
But, alack, the drinks they served, did cost a pretty penny,
Sixteen dollars, by my count, a sum most reckless and quite funny.

I prayed for water, pure and simple, to quench my thirst,
For such extravagance, my purse could not endure, nor would it burst.
The folk who gathered there, did provide a merry show,
A maiden, scantily clad, did dance, and caused my sides to flow.

The waitresses, fair and bright, did tend to us with grace,
And split the bill, with smiles so wide, into more manageable space.

Leaving us to wait, for a menu, forsooth, for long.
And when I asked for ale, the bartender didst throw
The list at me, with scorn and disdain, I do avow.

And thus, my gorge doth rise in disdain.

""Underwhelming experience with too much repetition.""

The original text describes a negative dining experience at a Chinese restaurant. The food was of poor quality, and while the service and ambiance were acceptable, they did not make up for the subpar cuisine. The writer expresses their disappointment and lack of enthusiasm for returning to the establishment.

In the revised version, the language is more concise and direct, reflecting Hemingway's distinctive writing style. Instead of stating that the food was ""kind of low-end Chinese,"" the revised text simply describes it as ""low-end Chinese."" Additionally, the phrase ""not really bad, just not good either"" is condensed into ""underwhelming experience with too much repetition."" Overall, the revised text maintains the same meaning as the original while incorporating Hemingway's signature concision and clarity.",True,Hemingway

The decor, a sight to see and divine.

Chinese fare, with Clam Chowder, beef,
Stuffed Bell Peppers, Calzone, pizza, relief.

Fish, shrimp, and more, a feast for you,

The tiles in the bathroom, worn and old,

To partake in their delectable fare,
A sandwich first, then pizza later,
To sate my hunger and quench my thirst.

My hopes were high, for I do reside
Across the street, a mere stone's throw,
And thus, I wished this place to excel,
But alas, my experience hath been mixed, I do confess.

The sandwich, an Italian delight,
Was truly tasty, a masterful blend,
But the pizza, oh, how it did fall short,
Leaving me underwhelmed, my friends, I do declare.

It reminded me of pies consumed in days of yore,
When I did dwell in New York's city's heart,
But that, my friends, doth not bode well,
For quality, it doth leave much to be desired, I do aver.

Doused in gooey white cheddar and sloppy joe,
And topped with salsa and jalapenos, no less.
'Twas delicious, yet next time, I'd ask thee,
Kitchen, to hold the sloppy joe, I pray.
For I wouldst not miss the meat, verily.

I hadst the Crispy Four Cheese Burger,
With cheese fried crisp onto the patty,
A cheesy concoction, crisp and creamy.
Aside from the brioche bun, 'twas tasty,
Well seasoned, I didst think. But, alack,
The bun, too much bread for the burger, made it dry.
An onion roll, a better choice, methinks.

My husband, his BYOB, didst select,
Beef patty with pepper jack cheese, jalapenos,
Caramelized onions, all on the onion roll.
'Twas well prepared, flavorful, and juicy,
Indeed, a tasty dish, methought.

Steve's Greenhouse Grill, a place most wondrous,
With A-OK fare, and atmosphere quite sportive,
Like Cracker Barrel, but without the backing,
And with a design scheme that's quite kitsch and tacky.

Loud colors, loud TVs, and ads for strong drink,
A menu vast and varied, with something for everyone to think,
Bar menu, overpriced, but servers full of cheer,
Singing praises of each dish, with nary a speck of fear.

Chicken fried steak, with fries, my meal did make,
Kristen G., her choice, fish and chips, with clam chowder to partake.
All was well, some salt, some just right, some bland,
But still, a place most worthy, of thy hard-earned pound.

So, take Cracker Barrel, cut budget by three,
And tell the manager, all patrons to please, thee,
In Phoenix, this place, doth fit the bill,
Steve's Greenhouse Grill, doth stand, most fulfilling still.",True,Shakespeare

Juice running down their arms, slicing oranges for drinks. Another time, a bartender reached into the olive jar, grabbed a handful, and put 'em in the garnish tray.

A place to dine where old homes didst speak.
And lo, I found Coronado Cafe, a spot
Wherein I couldst indulge in victuals hot.

A workday it was, and thus, I didst order
But one dish, lest I appear a glutton.
The roasted chicken sandwich, oh how grand,
With potato salad, a tasty second hand.

The bar, though small, didst seat us comfortably,
And spirits, wine, didst tempt me sorely.
Alas, I couldst not partake, for duty called,
But shall, anon, when next I visit this hall.

And potato salad, a satisfying tease.
A simple, hearty meal, fit for a king,

And cook, dear sir, dost thou know the difference 'twixt
Med rare and well? A vast disparity, I do declare,

Oh, how my anticipation was deflated! Upon opening the container, the broth lacked its characteristic scent, and upon sipping, it tasted overly sweet and viscous, revolting! Moreover, the color was an unsettling shade of brown, despite my request for chicken PH\u00d2. I attempted to salvage the dish by adding noodles and seasonings, but alas, the odor and flavor were too much to bear. I drained the liquid and consumed the noodles instead.

Girls entered without cost, a sweet ecstasy.

But LMFAO appeared, our spirits did retrieve.

We stayed the night, their performance, a treat,

Their menu, laminated and neat, didst display their fare,
But alas, no pictures, only words, didst leave me in despair.

I chose the combo platter, bulgogi, priced at nine ninety-nine,

In fair Paris, I didst tarry three nights,
And asked for a chamber with kingly bed,
But they didst give me a room with twain queens instead,
Which brought me discomfort, and my rest didst mar.

The next day, they didst move me to a room with a king,
Whose bed was not so bad, and I didst find solace within.
The rooms were clean, and the bathrooms, too,
With showers closed, and a tub, wherein I couldst renew.

The TV hadst some good channels, and the sound was clear,
But alas, the elevators didst work with great speed,
My view was of the airport, not so grand, I fear,
But the location of the hotel was most excellent, indeed.

I didst use their spa services, and wrote a review apart,
And found the restaurants in Paris to be a work of art.
I recommend climbing the Eiffel Tower high,
For the view from the top is most wondrous to the eye.

The monorail metro is nearby, a convenience, indeed,
But my only sorrow was that they wouldst not let me use the spa on the day I didst depart, which didst cause me great need.

We began our feast with guacamole and chips, the latter oversalted, nigh inedible. Yet, I did consume them, brushing off the excess salt with mine own fingers. The former two, however, did please our taste buds.

Next, we ventured onto vegetable tacos, a pleasant delight, and a Mexican flatbread, adorned with mushrooms and a sauce of huitlacoche. Both dishes did satisfy our hunger. Alas, the rice, with corn, cream, and habaneros, a Mexican risotto of sorts, did fall short of our expectations, owing to an overabundance of salt.

Distrito doth offer a diverse array of margaritas, and we did sample the watermelon-cucumber and cilantro varieties, finding them both agreeable.

I chanced upon Aunt Chilada's, a place of gastronomic wonder.
With friend in tow, I didst venture forth, and dined with glee,
But first, we didst don plastic forks, and combed our locks with glee.
A jest, a quip, a merry prank, we thought it to be,
But alas, our visages were marred, in such a state of disarray.
I know not why, but we didst deem it wise,
To groom our tresses with a fork, in such an unwise guise.
The victuals, neither here nor there, didst fail to impress,
A mediocre fare, yet palatable, and thus I shall express.

And lo, the mushroom burger, cooked to perfection,
Was devoured with gusto, and no hesitation.
The fries, they were quite good, with crunch so fine,
But alack, the mashed potatoes, they didst decline,
For they didst taste of naught but aged earth,
And left us feeling rather lackluster and of little worth.
But oh, the buttermilk fried chicken, how it didst fail,
For though it was crispy, and fried to perfection's bail,
It had no flavor, none at all, I do declare,

The place, not grand, but for the fare we sought,
Good enough, my dear, for what we brought.
I had shrimp, crunchy and tasty, in a walnut shell,

Waters filled, a constant flow, no want, no need,

A wonder, a query, did it belong, a fear?

The noodles, cooked to perfection, al dente,
A pleasant texture, a joy to behold,

Where filth doth reign supreme, and doth leave a foul trace?

Airports with such fervor and debate?
As if they had a choice, a say in the matter,
And their words held sway o'er the city's fate.

But nay, fair friends, forsooth, 'tis but a dream,
A fleeting thought that doth deceive the mind.
For who, in truth, doth choose a city based
On its airport's merits, or lack thereof?

And yet, methinks, this wondrous sight doth prove
The power of words, the might of human voice.
For though we may not choose, we still can speak,
And share our thoughts, our feelings, our joys.

So let us raise our voices, friends, and shout
Our praise or censure, loud and clear,
For though we may not choose the airport's form,
Our words, at least, shall echo far and near.""",True,Shakespeare

In Las Vegas, this place doth hold a rare gem.

With flavors rich, and spices most divine.
Yet, wagyu and foie gras, a burger most grand,
I have not tried, but heard of its land.

Alas! The ambiance doth leave much to be desired,
A strip mall feel, with naught but concrete tired.
And, alack! The meat, not of the finest breed,
Tasteth of frozen, or CAFO-fed.

But fear not, dear gourmand, for they doth make up,
With dressings and toppings, a veritable feast.

With egg, a surprise, yet I didst not fault.

Didst wait upon me, with kindness and care.
She asked my thoughts, and chatted with glee,
Great customer service, a sight to see.

""O, fair maidens, if thou art invited to this place,
'Tis likely that thy heart will be moved with grace.
The lighting, soft and gentle as a lover's embrace,
And music, sweet and melancholy, doth set the pace.
A place of secrets, hidden from prying eyes,
Where drinks are served in cups, like a witch's potion's guise.
Once entranced by the music and inflamed by desire,
Thou mayst fall under the spell, like one consumed by fire.

Forsooth, 'tis a place of wonder, unique and rare,
A bar transformed into a haven of delight, beyond compare.
A place where love and passion do reign supreme,
Where hearts are won and lost, like a game of chance, it seems.

If thou art interested, fair maiden, and hast the means,
Thou canst purchase a bottle of whisky, and it shall be seen,
Suspended high above the bar, a sight to behold,
A symbol of thy love, forever to be told.

For the number of spaces available, is limited, I do declare.""",True,Shakespeare

Not drowned in dressing, as oft we find elsewhere.
The veggies, cooked just right, still crunchy,
No overcooking, to our delight didst savor.

It came, a wonder, rare indeed, but lacking blood.
My spouse, the filet and crab didst choose,
Both cooked to perfection, no need for excuse.

A box with words, ""Congratulations,"" didst greet,
And within, a bobble head cat, with diamonds so bright,
A curious gift, a puzzle, a wonder in sight.

I know not of wedding ways, nor traditions so grand,
But this gift, a surprise, a laughter-maker, at hand,
A treasure to behold, a joy to behold,
A visit, a must, to see, to be told.

And waited but ten minutes,'mongst the throng,

And ombre nails, five more, did I choose,
To make my feet most fair, and win applause.

Did tend my hands, with gel, and ombre crown,

I ordered the special, hot ham and cheese, a feast,
A large drink, and the peach cobbler, a true delight,
The cashier asked if ice cream I did desire,
But nay, I wished not to spoil the taste, or dampen the fire.

Behind the counter, a maiden fair, did prepare,
Our sandwiches, with skill and care, did she undertake,
The peach cobbler, she did microwave, with speed,
Oh how I longed to taste, its warmth, its sweetness, its creed.

Our drinks were filled, a large, two hands did require,
And swiftly, our repast, did we then acquire,
We returned to the office, with haste,
And I, did dive into the peach, with joy, and with zest.

Oh how divine, the flavors did combine,
A symphony of sweet, a culinary shrine,
I thought to share, but selfishness did prevail,
For such a treat, I could not, nor would not, fail.

It's often close to rotting or already there. Or I'll get bananas that are way too green. Can't eat 'em for a week.

In sooth, I chanced upon this coffeehouse,
To taste their brew, and see if 'twere a prize.
The flavor was familiar, and I did ask,
If they roasted their own beans, or didst task
Somewhere in Canada, for such fine fare.
The barista replied, with a smile so fair,
That the beans were from 49th Parallel, in Van.
Ah, Vancourites, if ye seek coffee divine,
This place doth serve it well, and worth thy time.

I also ordered a scone, of which I did partake,
And found it most delicious, with nary a mistake.
The shop itself, though small, doth have its charm,
But the people-watching, alas, doth leave much to disarm.
Unless, perchance, some event doth take place,
At the convention center, with folk in abundance.

So I returned the following week, my heart still a-flutter.

The office, not so busy, peaceful and serene,
The staff, awesome, the woman who cleaned, supreme.
I felt relaxed, my teeth and gums, jabbed with care,
My smile, now bright, my teeth, whiter than snow there.

Another woman, bubbly and kind, took me back,
Did the impressions for my whitening tray, no lack.
All in all, this place, I do highly recommend,
Returning next week, a cavity to mend.""",True,Shakespeare

""We hit this joint in Vegas with a crew of eight. Service was top-notch, attentive and friendly. I went for the chicken kiev, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Had a cranberry cabbage salad with it, which was a bit bland for my taste. Would've preferred the red cabbage the others had.

Pork was a bit dry, but the steak was solid. Got the mashed potatoes instead of fries, but wished I'd gone for the fries. They were homemade, flavorful, and delish.

Had the cabbage rolls, herring, and veggie plate. Cabbage rolls weren't my thing, but others loved 'em. Herring was fresh and not too oily, glad I took the server's rec. Veggie plate was a work of art, everything fresh. Desserts were great too.

Food was good, service excellent, price reasonable. Only downer was some dude asking one of us for 50 cents on the way out. Unpleasant, won't go into detail, but there's a liquor store in the same plaza and a bunch of folks hanging around outside.""",True,Hemingway

Whose mirth did fill each table, 'twas a sight to behold.
The scent of Korea's finest dishes did waft through the air,
And our bellies did rumble, in eager anticipation.

We ordered bulgogi, and tofu soup beside,
The latter did warm us, with its spicy, savory broth.
The former, sizzling, did delight our taste buds,
Though a mite more char, would have been most welcome.

Alas, the sides, a mixed bag they were,
Kimchi, seaweed, and fish cakes, we did adore.

We found a restaurant of great renown,
With views most wondrous and a menu grand,
We made our reservation through OpenTable, at hand.

The roasted bone marrow, oh how divine,
Came with shredded pork, a feast most fine,
And the special of the day, a fried pork cutlet,
With eggs and more, a dish most delicate.

But alas, the bone marrow, though rich and bold,
Came with but one bone, a price most cold,
Yet 'twas a feast most satisfying, I must confess,
For the shredded pork, it did make up for the mess.

The pork shank, oh how enormous and grand,
Fell off the bone, a tender morsel in hand,
A special cocktail, with bubbly inside,
A drink most refreshing, our spirits did abide.

Our waitress, kind and swift, knew her craft well,
Her recommendations, we did dare not quell,
She guided us through the menu with grace,
And we, with full bellies, did leave the place.

The waiter didst acknowledge, that many didst complain,
Yet still, they served it forth, with nary a refrain.
Aye, a big swig of wine didst I imbibe,
To wash away the taste, of that strange, foamy concoction.

A fried tripe, that doth dance upon my taste buds, like a samba beat.
And the taco de carne adobada, a flavor so fine,
Like al pastor, it doth rival, in this taco shrine.

So if thou find thyself, in Las Vegas, fair town,
And seek a taco, that doth wear the crown,
Look no further, my friend, for here doth lie,
The best tacos, in all the land, a culinary surprise.""",True,Shakespeare

A broccoli chicken dish, with onions and mushrooms fair.

From the wall, a recipe I didst procure,
To make a Mongolian sauce, most delicate and sure,
Yet, alack, the sauces they didst provide,

Now, I ain't one for fancy bars, but this place was different. Mellow, but still fun. The sing-along, the jokes - it's all good. Except for one thing - the waitress.

The Calzone Ripieno, a treat to behold,  
Did take some time, but our patience did unfold.  
  
Stuffed with mozarella, sausage, ham, and more,  
It paired well with wine, and beer galore.  
Gnocchi Al Gorgonzola e Spinaci, a dream,  
As good as any, that my taste buds have seen.  
  
Espresso, twice, we did request,  
And biscotti, small, but oh so sweet.  
We asked for more, and the waiter, kind,  
Did fill another bowl, our hearts and minds.  
  
A family of fourteen, we did espy,  
Comfortably seated, without a sigh.  
So whether couple, family, or group,  
Papilio's warmth, doth all hearts engroup.  
  
Our bill, just under forty pounds,  
For drinks, starters, mains, and coffee, abounds.  
Worth every penny, we do declare,  
And promise to return, without a single care.""",True,Shakespeare

The cornbread, though tardy, didst prove most sweet,
With butter, 'twas a culinary delight.

Our server didst suggest the ribs, and thus,
I didst order them, with fowl, mac and cheese,
And greens, all of which didst please mine eyes,
The ribs didst fall from the bone, most tenderly,
The fowl, a delight, the mac and cheese, sublime,
The greens, a taste of heaven, so divine.

But alas, the peach cobbler, not so grand,
A pity, for I didst crave something sweet,
Perhaps a chocolate dessert, to end my meal,
But nay, 'twas not to be, at Mert's, I didst feel.

Yet still, I wouldst return, for the fare is fair,
And the service, friendly, with a smile so rare,
At Mert's, thou shalt find solace for thy soul,
In the food, and the warmth that doth make thee whole.""",True,Shakespeare

Of the valley below, so vast and true.

We sat in the midst of the restaurant,
With a view most fair, and not a single complaint.
The rattlesnake and cactus fries, we didst try,
Unique, yet not something I'd crave, ere I die.

Barbecue chicken, oh how sweet,
Didst fill mine belly, with delight most meet.
My husband's burger, and his parent's feast,
Pork chops and prime rib, didst please, and no contest.

Cowboy beans, the best I've had,
A flavor so rich, it didst make me glad.
Reasonably priced beer, in mason jars,
A quaint touch, that didst bring forth many a smile and cheer.

And to end the meal, a treat most fine,
Complimentary cotton candy, a sweet divine.

The Korean chicken, oh how grand,

Our picky needs, the staff did willingly heed.
A lobster, tilapia, and catfish, we did choose,
Cleaned and bagged, save the lobster, that did we propose.
To Asian Caf\u00e9 Express, our seafood did we take,
Where cooked to perfection, our meal did make.

And drinks, they flowed like nectar from the gods above,
The staff, most courteous, didst attend to our each need,
And swiftly, with a smile, our orders they didst heed.

But, alas! The prices, they didst climb a bit higher,
Than other cafes within the city's bounds,
So prepare thyself, dear patron, for the cost,
Lest thou be taken aback, and thy purse be lost.

A haven for the weary soul, and hungry heart,

A hunger pang did strike, and rest did seek.
A cafe, recommended, alas, didst shut its door,
So here, within this bistro, didst I entreat.

Quiet, cozy, with but few patrons nigh,
A table found, and ordered forthwith.
Avocado salad, healthful choice, didst crave,
With water, pure, to quench thirst, didst wave.

Waitress, kind, didst show me to my seat,
And swift, my salad came, with bread, a treat.
But, alas, too much vinaigrette didst pour,
Dripping, the leaves didst, in oil, a sore.

A star, deducted, for this mistake, I say,

For fish sandwiches, they be all they claim,
In this, a humble tavern, dark and dim,
Where smoke doth fill the air, and time doth slim.

But fear not, traveler, for thy meal,
Shall be prepared with haste, and served with zeal,
Though thou mayst wait, and thy patience be tried,
Yet shall thy hunger be satisfied.

Thou shalt pay ten silver coins, 'tis true,
But mark my words, 'tis worth the cost,

To sample dishes of the local way.
Wholly Grill, our choice, didst not betray,
Our hunger sated, we didst end the day.

I chose the pork belly, oh so fair,
My partner, skewers, with eggplant rare.
Both dishes, delicious, beyond compare,
The flavors danced, our senses to ensnare.

The staff, kind and friendly, didst declare,
The pork belly, their recommendation most fair.
We laughed and smiled, our bellies full and round,

They had an array of delights for a satisfying meal: bread, pastries, cakes, quiches, cheeses, and pre-prepared dishes ready to be warmed at home. I sampled their bread with honey and nuts, which was simply divine. However, I left with a loaf of raisin and nut bread that was cut to my liking. It was a dense bread with a solid crust but not too difficult to eat, and a soft interior that didn't make too many crumbs.

Mirth and gaiety doth reign supreme amongst this merry throng, and youthful vigor doth abound.  Alas, the subterranean parking lot, a veritable labyrinth, didst prove a challenge to mine own meager wit.  Perchance a brighter illumination might serve to light the way, lest one stumble in the darkness, lost in thought, as in a dream.  Aye, upon the pool deck, a concert didst take place, with New Order playing to a packed assembly.  The acoustics, methinks, were naught but marginal, yet still the music didst stir mine own soul.  Four songs from Joy Division didst they play, a wondrous treat indeed!  Fie upon those who didst depart ere the encore, for they didst miss a wondrous sight!

Friendly staff, always. No slow service here. Food takes a bit, but that's not the server's fault. They're on top of your drink, asking when it's running low.

Eggs benedict with salmon, my go-to. Hollandaise sauce, tangy and buttery perfection. Used to come with fingerling potatoes, now just a few on the plate.

Vdara, a tranquil escape from the Strip's chaos. Spacious rooms, excellent service, and pleasant amenities. I've stayed here twice, enjoying the peaceful atmosphere each time. The rooms are generously sized, accommodating three people comfortably. Non-smoking throughout, and no casino noise, creating a serene environment. Located at the southern end of the Strip, slightly removed from the bustle, yet still accessible to Bellagio. While I prefer a livelier Vegas experience, Vdara's calm vibe appeals to those seeking relaxation. The pool, too, exudes tranquility. I'll gladly return to Vdara, especially since it's a great value on Hotwire. Look for a five-star, non-casino hotel on the south Strip, and chances are it'll be Vdara.

""Hark, fair friends! Last week, I chanced upon AAP,
For luncheon, and oh, what joy didst it bring!
The hour was late, and few didst dine within,
So I, a hostess, didst choose my seat with ease.
A comfy booth, so large and plush, didst beckon me,
And thus, I sat, with nary a soul to trouble thee.

My server, swift and kind, didst tend to me,
And asked if I had questions, as well as my decree.
The soft pretzel, with beer cheese, didst catch mine eye,
And thus, I ordered it, with haste, didst not deny.
'Twas large, indeed, and hot, with crunch outside,
And soft within, a treat, most satisfying, I avow.

Still, hunger pangs didst plague me, so I didst add,
A spinach salad, with tomato, cranberries, and feta, not bad.
A nut, perhaps, to change the texture, might be nice,
But overall, 'twas a salad, most pleasant, and quite nice.

They have, it seems, drink specials, through the week,
A place, so grand, where one might watch a game, with ease.
Four stars, I gave, for more lunch options, they shouldst seek,
Beyond salads, sandwiches, and entrees, which start at five, I do beseech.

The pho, it didst taste of authenticity, or so I thought, for I am not well-versed in such culinary delights. Yet, I didst enjoy it heartily, mayhap due to mine hangover, which didst make me feel most dire.

In this swanky bar, with cocktails fine and folk of note,
I chanced to sit, and watch the revelers quote,
Their antics wild, their tales did unfold,
As they sipped their drinks, stories to be told.

A DB, with flair, and purse of gold,
Bought Cristal, for two fair maidens bold,
And shot it down, with haste and speed,
As if the liquid fire, his thirst did need.

Oh, the shots of Cristal, how they flowed,
Like a river wild, that could not be slowed,
And after, regular shots, he did command,
As if his thirst, could never be tamed.

Hath cocktails, of the finest grace,
With maraschino liquor, vodka, and rose wine,
Garnished with raspberries, three in a line.

In Manhattan, I have had the chance,
To sample pies of great renown and worth,

Where pizza is served with grace and poise,
Mama Gina's, a name that doth embrace,
The art of pizza-making, with joys and noise.

The staff, they are swift and courteous too,
Sammy, the gentleman behind the bar, doth shine,
With hospitality and cheer, they doth imbue,
A sense of welcome, that doth make us twine.

And now, the pièce de résistance, the pie,
Oh, how it doth delight, with flavors so nigh,
Five stars, I say, and worth every penny,
We shall return, for more of their tasty henny.

And leave, with a heart full of joy and a kiss.""",True,Shakespeare

A curious sight, yet tasty beyond measure,
Though some might deem the chef's whim uncivil.

Shrimp, steak, and bruschetta did follow suit,
Each dish a masterclass in flavor's art,
But carne asada stole the show, no doubt,
Its juicy charm did win our hearts, 'twain true.

My son, in haste, did break a tooth, and oh, the fear!
But Dr. Libby, closed though she was, did come near.
With skill and grace, she extracted the pieces, while we did hold
My wriggling son, who could not sit still, alas, he was too bold.

In Vegas, they call them spring rolls,

With chicken breast, shrimp, beef, and sea.
Cabbage, mushrooms, broccoli too,
All mixed in a savory brew.

Hark, good sir, I pray thee, listen well,
For I have tale to tell, of hair and spell,
Of Super-Cuts and Great Clips, places dire,
Where haircuts were a chore, a task to bear.

But lo, one day, I chanced upon a spot,
A place where passion met with skill and thought,
A haven for the hair, a place of rest,
Where scissors sliced with grace, and each guest
Was treated with a care, a tender hand,
And not just rushed through, like sand on land.

The tools they used, were of the finest sort,
Precision instruments, a work of art,
Each snip and clip, a symphony of sorts,
A testament to skill, a show of parts.

So if thou seeketh, a place to find,
A haircut of quality, of mind and kind,
Seek out this place, with E-Z at the helm,
And let him work his magic, do thy whelm.",True,Shakespeare

No issues during our stay, cleanliness and service were top-notch. Enjoyed the rooftop terrace with lounge chairs on summer evenings. Spacious rooms with well-equipped kitchens. Free Wi-Fi. Small but adequate fitness center (2 treadmills, a couple of bikes, and a tiny weight room). Continental breakfast spread was satisfactory (fresh fruit, oatmeal, toast, bagels, etc.).

Of fries, crunchy, seasoned well, and topped
With cheese and carne asada, sour cream and guacamole, all stopped.

And we, with glee, did pick and dine,
Till home we reached, and still, we spoke

For their work was perfect, a true masterpiece, beyond compare.

Whereon to sip, and revel in the autumn's gold.

And ordered drinks, with laughter and with glee,
I chose a margarita, simple and plain,

To partake of supper on a Friday eve,

And their wines, aplenty, didst our spirits lift.

The atmosphere, so tranquil and inviting,
Didst make us feel most welcome and at ease,
And thus we savored each dish they didst present,
With gusto and delight, our hunger to appease.

Aye, the cheese fondue, a dish most delectable,
Didst surpass our expectations, by my troth,
And the deli meats, a platter most bounteous,
Didst fill our bellies with joy and mirth.

My crepe, a culinary marvel, fair and bright,
Was presented with flair, a feast for mine eyes,
And the flavors, oh so subtle and refined,
Didst dance upon my palate, a true delight.

My spouse, his filet, cooked at the table,
A spectacle most entertaining, I must confess,
And the taste, a symphony of flavors,
Didst leave him in raptures, and in want of more.

Were not closer to our humble abode,
For we wouldst return, again and again,
To partake of their fare, and their hospitality.

So filled with joy, and love, and light,
And thus, we shall return, anon,

We chanced upon this place without prior arrangement, and were told we should expect a wait of one and thirty minutes. Wherefore, we did decide to take a stroll and behold the Fountains at Bellagio's spectacle. The hostess, a gentle damsel, did inform us that upon our return, a buzzer would be given unto us. And lo, we did return, but waited scarce three minutes ere we were seated. A request to sit upon the balcony was graciously granted, and though but a single table lay open, they didst accommodate us without hesitation. Our serving maiden, a merry lass, didst suggest certain dishes to sample, and her demeanor was as bright as the sun itself.

Food:
We began our repast with duck confit, and a side of spinach, cranberries, and to say the least, 'twas divine! The duck didst melt within mine own mouth, like a celestial nectar from the gods above! I didst order the steak, with onions caramelized to perfection, and frites, hand-carved, and my dear companion, the seafood special. The viands were cooked to a turn, and most satisfying to the palate.

In conclusion, I do heartily endorse Mon Ami Gabi for a fine supper, and shall indeed return, anon, for yet another taste of that ambrosial duck confit!""",True,Shakespeare

Of this car rental place, I speak to thee,

Expedia, the site where I didst book,
Didst offer them at a price most cheap,
So I took chance, and off didst embark,
To see if their service wouldst be meek.

At airport lot, Jim, the shuttle driver,
Didst greet me with a smile so bright,
He gave directions, wrote them down, a true guide,
To mall and back, with ease and might.
The men at counter, kindness didst show,
In conversation, with strangers, didst glow,
Check-in, swift and easy, didst proceed,
Insurance bought, no time didst need.

Pistachio too, a nutty delight,

My children, they didst partake as well,
And Luigi, the owner, didst them spell.
He brought them samples, one and all,
And they didst love it, great and small.

A business thrive, with such grace.
