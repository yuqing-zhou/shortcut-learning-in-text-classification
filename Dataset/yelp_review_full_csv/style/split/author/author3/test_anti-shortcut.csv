In fleecing fools with foul fare and false cheer?
A front for nefarious schemes, no doubt,
To swindle unsuspecting souls, and devour their coin.

Twice have I ventured forth to this pit,

To burst with cramps, and bitter gall,
At such poor service, and foul play.

Moreover, strangers, with nary a care for privacy, didst knock upon my door, seeking drugs, and I didst reply, 'Not in my chamber, good sir, try the rappers next door.' The nearby shops didst charge exorbitant prices for basic necessities, such as five dollars and fifty cents for a two-liter of soda, or fifteen dollars for a half-pint of spirits.

For what they brought forth, was a sorry sight,
A mess of carrots, macaroni, and soup,

Dry and flavorless, with naught but a sprinkle of pepper to claim.
I swear, a seasoned convict would turn away,
For this fare was worse than any prison gray.

But alas, my friends, I jest not,

The eatery didst bustle with folk, a wondrous sight,
Yet many tables lay bare, untouched by grace.
Their were sufficient servers, no need to fight.
I tallied seven servants, scarce twenty diners in sight.
How doth a server earn a fair wage, with but three tables in sight?
We waited forty-five minutes, ere we found our seat.
Our victuals took an hour, and drinks didst not greet.
Perhaps the serving maid didst suffer a curse,
For she didst not return, and left us in the worst.

Did they possess, and that, a paltry offering, methought.
A two-day sale, they touted, with a discount of twenty percent,
Yet still they clung to it, like misers to their gold.

My son, he didst order fettuccine Alfredo,

Pro: In their auto department, a tire didst I purchase, and swiftly, too, was it mounted, at a fair price, I must confess. 

Con: Foul and dirty be the store, with employees who doth seem to take their duties lightly. Staples such as milk, bread, and soft drinks, in short supply they be. Few checkers doth the store possess, and those they have, do oft break down, leaving thee to wait in vain for one to fix the wretched machine.

This bar didst not impress, despite its prime address.
My love and I didst venture there for lunch,
And found the service to be quite pleasant, perchance.
The waitress, kind and fair, didst recommend a feast,
A fried bologna sandwich, with fries, no less.
But lo, the sandwich, drenched in grease, didst lie,
A grilled delight, yet nigh impossible to consume, I swear.
I ate but three bites, and left the rest,
For fear of suffering from the dire effects.
My love, too, didst order fish and chips,
But alas, they were as greasy as the tips.

Ten minutes passed, ere she did bring the bill,

""Alack, what woeful welcome have I found
At this, my temporary lodging place?
The front desk staff, so indifferent, cold
As if they dealt with troublesome guests each day.

I called, concerned about the scent that clung
To our chamber, like acidic vinegar strong.
They said they'd bring fans, or we could descend
And find another line, a lengthy queue to amend.

Down we went, to face a crowd once more
And sought the front desk attendant, as before.
He, with a gruff demeanor, did reply
That the lady I spoke to, did not exist, and nigh
Directed me to wait, in yonder corner, for his sire,
The manager, a man of few words, and none too bright.

Upon our meeting, and a comment made
About the disarray of the front area, he didst
Remain silent, with naught a word to say
And threw my ID back, with little care or play.
No apology given, for the trouble we'd endured
And when I gained my new room key, a different floor
Smelled still of vinegar, a pungent scent indeed
And in the room, a feeling of a business suite
Without a coffee maker, oh woe is me!

Then look to Trump, with a grand view from on high,

Which worked with speed, but error did entice.

I called the shop, where man did say,
My feast would come with next driver on his way.
I asked if cold, he said, in insulting tone,
It sat in bag, insulated, all alone.

Sixty minutes passed, and still no food,
But when it came, 'twas cold, as if in mood.

For full a minute, ere he did decide,
To seek the tool I needed, in the back,

And thanked him, ere he did disappear.
I waited then, near to the register,
Until another came, and asked my need.
I said, 'I just require to check out, good sir,'

Who had assisted me, in my time of need.

This club, I've never stepped inside,
But hear me now, and heed my words,
For 'tis a tale of woe and deceit.

In line we stood, for two long hours,
And when we left, our patience wore thin,
For those who ran the club, it seemed,
Didst seek to swindle us, with clever scheme.

They told me, straight, to mine own ears,
That they didst not profit from within,
But from the bar, alone, they gained,
And thus, they sought to cheat and spin.

A double fee, they didst demand,
To gain entry, to their sacred land,
But I, a fool, would not be caught,
In such a snare, with payment fraught.

The line, it moved not, for those who paid,
The regular price, in full display,
But those who paid, in excess, didst move,
With haste, and swiftness, like a groove.

And shun this place, of deceit and trickery,

But alas, 'twas naught but a shambles, a mishmash of shame.

Discounted tickets, we did purchase, fair,
Yet still, the price did seem quite dear,
For what we saw, did leave us in dismay,
A jumbled mess, with naught a coherent way.

Fit and fine, the performers were, indeed,
But oh, the music, it did grate,
And males, aplenty, did grace the stage,
A sight most strange, and quite astray.

Samson and Delilah, a scene most grand,
Did stand out, amidst the chaos, bland,
But alas, the rest, did falter, and fade,
A disjointed mess, that did our patience assail.

Beyonce, a queen, her songs did find,
A place, within the show, most odd,
Random, and out of place, they seemed,
A shame, for she, a goddess, truly deemed.

A middle-school play, it did resemble,
In cohesion, theme, and plot, most feeble,
Vegas, a city grand, it doth deserve,
A show, of quality, and worth, to preserve.

So let us hope, a savior doth come,
To fix this mess, before it be undone,
For showgirls, a treasure, true,
A symbol, of Vegas, pure, anew.""",True,Shakespeare

For them to bring our order, oh how tired!

And apologized, with a sigh,
A large party, in the back, didst say,

I asked to change my order, pray,
But she, into the kitchen, didst stray,
And ne'er returned, with an answer, nay,
She hugged her friends, and chatted away.

Whilst I, a hungry patron, didst wait for my repast.
My meal, it came forth swiftly, yet incomplete, alas!
And though I didst alert them, twas a long wait ere it was made whole.

But lo! The restroom, a den of filth and despair,
With nary a paper towel to be found anywhere.
An employee, he didst enter, and exit, with naught a care,
Leaving the place unclean, and my hopes didst dwindle and fade.

A pitcher of mango margaritas, I did command,
But lo, they made it with canned nectar, a poor man's brand.
The tequila, too, was house-brewed, and not the fine
Premium stuff, as promised on their menu, alas!

The nachos, oh so soggy, did resemble left-overs
From a gas station, two hours old, and not worth a penny.

For crime doth run amok, and safety's nowhere found.

Hark! A tale of woe doth come from mine own lips,
Of travel plans gone awry, and accommodations that did rip.
A trip to LV, a city of sin and delight,
Didst I embark upon, with family in sight.
The Bellagio, a place of luxury and fame,
Didst they call home, for four nights, the same.
But lo! The prices, they didst climb too high,
And I, a humble traveler, didst not wish to buy.
Planet Hollywood, a place of old,
Didst I choose instead, with rates more bold.
But alas! The rooms, they were not of the best,
Dated, dirty, and with a strange, unpleasant quest.
The decor, a relic of the past,
With a 1990's vibe, that didst not last.
Britney Spears, her anchor arena,
A place of trashy charm, or so it seemed.
But I, a man of taste, didst not find it grand,
For comfort and modernity, I didst demand.
The issues, they didst mount, like a fountain,
Missing drawer front, strange odor from the fountain.
Pull chain shades, they didst stick and twist,
A raging time, it didst not provide, nor assist.
In my youth, perhaps, a wild adventure,
But now, alas! Comfort, I do prefer.

That 777 Towing shall arrive, and all shall be secure.

Yet, alack, their words were naught but lies,
For after an hour, nary a sign of their guise.
And when the time had passed, another wait did ensue,
Until at last, a call from the insurer did break through.

Their truck, it seemed, had broken down,
And all their promises, like autumn leaves, had fallen to the ground.

And shun 777 Towing, lest thou suffer the same fate.""",True,Shakespeare

And found within, a scene most strange, a place both empty and bereft.
Two tables alone, on the patio, did occupy the space,
The rest, a void, a silence, devoid of life and grace.

A menu, there was, but 'twas a curious thing indeed,
For thou must choose thy own ingredients, and thus proceed.
A bowl, small and meager, the price, nine dollars and ninetynine,
Yet filled with protein and vegetables, a mix, a medley, a mishmash, divine.

But alas, the veggies, a disappointment, a letdown, a shame,
For some, frozen and lacking, did not bear the name.
The sauces, too, a shortcoming, thick and gloopy, a metal ramekin,
A poor excuse, forsooth, for a meal fit for a king.

And thus, my friends, I say to thee, avoid this place,
For YC's and MuShu, far better, doth grace.
Avoid the disappointment, the sorrow, the woe,
And seek instead, a feast, a banquet, a culinary show.""",True,Shakespeare

""We stumbled into this joint by chance, my friend's husband wanted to check out their big-ass beer sign, and it didn't disappoint. But that was about it. \n\nThey had some live tunes blasting, sound system was crap, so it was ear-bleeding loud. Watch yourself, buddy! \n\nI ordered my go-to, a Long Island, and they botched it bad. Instead of a balance, they dumped in a slug of tequila. Nasty stuff. \n\nThe kid got a cider, and it was meh. \n\nAll in all, this place is for the locals only.""",True,Hemingway

For naught but green beans, and those of little cheer.
'Tis true, they call them 'haricot verts', a name most fine,
But at a price of eight gold coins, 'tis a robbery most divine.

And when we asked the server, what side doth come with the dish,
She said, with little care, ""Haricot vert, of course, my wish.""
But we, good sirs, didst decline, for such a price didst seem most unfair,
And told her, in plain terms, ""We'll have none of thy fare.""

And thus, we left the place, with haste and great disdain,
For who would pay such prices, and suffer such disdain?
Not I, nor thou, good friend, for there are better places near,
Where food and drink are served, with a more gentle cheer.""",True,Shakespeare

Didst keep my change, and played the fool.

Two tables, bottle service, all around.

A shame, for Luxor, once grand, no doubt.
Smoking inside, a thing to see,
But save your coins, go elsewhere, 'tis wise.

And herbs, they did adorn the mess,
To mask its age, and their deceit, alas!

Yet, alack! The service, woeful was its plight,
Alack, and woe betide the wait, so long and tedious in sight.
Fifteen minutes passed, ere any soul didst take note,
And forty-five, a span, for hot dog and fries, a woeful quote.

They smelled strange, were oily, and had but a scant amount of sauce. I didst eat a few, but the rest didst find its way into the dustbin. The chicken parm sub was mushy, with too much sauce and cheese, and but a paltry amount of chicken. The pizza, alack! It was like unto Dominos, with a cardboardy crust that lacked the flavor of a true pizza. Not the worst, perchance, but far from good. For twice the price, I wouldst not recommend it, save for those who do commonly order from Pizza-Hut, Dominos, or Papa John's.

And, alas! the waitress didst greet us with disdain.
A second serving maid, with chips and salsa in hand,
Didst offer us a gift, which we didst gladly accept,
Believing it to be part of the meal's grand plan.

But lo! Our waitress didst demand payment for the treat,
And we didst refuse, for 'twas not our mistake, by Jove!
She asked thrice how we wouldst pay for the feast,
And we didst request, each time, that she separate the cost.
Her eyes didst roll, and her tone didst turn quite sour,
As she didst utter, ""Okay then..."" with a scowl and a frown.

I wouldst not return to this place, my friends,
For the service was poor, and our thirst didst never end.
We hadst to ask thrice for waters and drinks,
Before the manager didst come to our aid, with a wink.

My order was taken, and I didst try
To use a coupon, but the lady didst deny.

""No,"" quoth she, ""I cannot accept this token.""
""Can I not use it?"" I didst ask, in disbelief.
""Nay,"" quoth she, ""tis not within my power.""

And wished to use a coupon, to save a part.

""I cannot accept this, go away.""

I do not mind, when kindly told,

But to be ignored, and treated with such disdain,
Is a bitter pill, that doth cause me pain.

I sought the server, told him of his mistake,

With fries, cold as ice, and not worth a single dive.

To swallow, when I didst expect a savory thrill.

To nevermore return, and thus, I claim.

But lo, the bartender's demeanor didst
Dampen our spirits, and made us wish to depart.
Yet still, I must confess, the televisions
Didst bring a smile, and made our visit less drear.
But, alack, the bartender's ways didst mar
Our evening's joy, and left us feeling glum.
So, to the management, I say,
Pray teach thy bartender better ways,
Lest thou lose customers, and thy reputation fade.""",True,Shakespeare

Half sandwich, tiny cole slaw, like they're trying to save money. Corned beef sandwiches, okay, but small for the price. Entrance is a mess, lots of different areas crammed together.

I signed up for their rewards program, hoping to get some free play out of it. But all I got was $10, and it could only be used on a handful of machines that were scattered throughout the casino. And of course, those machines were always busy. It was like they were taunting me, dangling the possibility of free play just out of reach.

Overall, this casino was a disappointment. It was my least favorite in the area, and I won't be rushing back anytime soon. The smoke was overwhelming, and the lack of available machines made it hard to enjoy myself. I'll stick to other casinos from now on.",True,Hemingway

For though I oft do cherish this place,
This last visit did leave me in dismay.
I tried their eggs Benedict, alack,
And found their self-made hollandaise sauce
Did not agree with mine own taste buds.

Blueberries, that doth please mine appetite.

Thinking to enjoy, for Kaskade did play.
I bought my tickets online, with haste,
And waited in line, for entry, with waste.

An hour and thirty minutes, did pass,
Before I reached the door, with naught to do.
The club, it was packed, and full of folk,
No tables found, nor space to stroke.

They let more people in, with nowhere to be,
And down a narrow stair, we had to decree.

To mushrooms, lifeless, void of zest.
Not lasagne, nay, but some foul jest.

My husband, hailing from Italy's shore,
Didst choose the chicken Puttanesca, a dish once more.
Two bites he took, then cast aside,
With sorrow in his eyes, he didst abide.
Even the salad, once a simple delight,
Didst fail to please, a woeful sight.

In conclusion, dear friends, I say,
Rossario's, a place to flee away.
For in their cooking, there doth lie
A bitter taste, that doth not die.""",True,Shakespeare

Mayhap, dear friend, thou canst explain, why Wrigley's woeful scoreboard doth pale, in comparison to Salt River's grand display? Forsooth, 'twas hard to read, and poorly lit, with naught but ads, to cloud mine eyes. And worse, the batting stats, were nowhere to be found, a lack, that did my patience try. And, prithee, tell me, why the parking lot, didst lack signage, to guide, and why the entrance, was blocked, in such a silly way?

The indoor ride, a disappointment, did possess.
A gondola we shared, with strangers, dull and grey,
Their silence, a plague, did make the journey stay.
And lo, a wart, so large and foul,
Did grace the temple of one, most uncool.
Um, verily, I say, 'twas not a sight to see.
But praise be, to the gondolier, so free,
His voice, so sweet, his spirit, full of cheer,
He made the ride, almost, quite dear.
But alas, the ride itself, a sham,
Not worth the cost, or the expected jam.
At the turnaround, a thought did cross my mind,
'Tis but a trifle, not worth the time.
Outdoor ride, they say, is better, by far,
So take my advice, and choose that, my dear.
Forget the indoor, 'tis but a waste,
Of time and gold, in haste.""",True,Shakespeare

And least of all, a steakhouse of renown.
Yet, in fair Las Vegas, I didst find myself
At Outback Steakhouse, a place of some repute.

A business trip of haste and scant duration,
Didst lead me thither, with naught but steak in mind.
My comrades, weary of the strip's hubbub,
Didst seek a meal most convenient and quick.

An Outback near the Outlet Mall, I chanced upon,
And thus, my settled weariness didst decide.
Six years had passed since last I stepped within,
And lo, the memories of yore didst abide.

The sirloin, six ounces of its finest cut,
Was cooked to perfection, as was the salad neat.
The service, too, was pleasant and most kind,
Though not of haute cuisine, yet still quite meet.

Farewell, Outback, till next we dine,
In six years' time, or perhaps sooner, who can tell?""",True,Shakespeare

Did fail to please my taste, with naught but sorrow.

He doth attend to every need,
With grace and speed, he doth impede.

Doth falter, and their duties shirk.

For they be steep, and make one pause and pray.
Yet fear not, friends, for sharing doth make sense,

Two stars, for biscuits and cornbread that doth learn.

But alas, dear friends, those days are gone,
For now, the SRP's become a different throng,
With guards and closets, phones and signs,

In thee, SRP, once great, now fallen,
A prison-like facility, with naught but wailin.

To sample their fare, and see how it doth appeal.

The younglings, they didst share a grilled cheese,
And found it to their liking, 'twas a pleasant surprise.
My dearest wife, she didst opt for the antipasto,
But found it lacking, for the price, it was not worth the cost.

Abrequine, a roast beef panini, they didst call it,
But alas, it didst not see the heat of a panini press, pitiful.
It was small, and lacking in flavor, a disappointment,
The potato chips, crispy, but oily, a sad event.

The gelato, a sweet treat, the children didst enjoy,
And I, a taste, didst take, and found it not too cloy.
But the Mexican lime olive oil, oh how it didst pall,
Too fragrant, too sweet, a synthetic taste, after all.

We swung by this joint in Phoenix after hearing good things. Got there around 8:30 on a Friday night, and there was only one other couple ahead of us, so we were served quick.

Service was decent, but the employee who helped us seemed a bit tired or something. Like they'd been working a long shift or somethin'.

Ice cream wise, my husband went for the TC^2 and salted caramel, while I got the almond buttercrunch and apple cinnamon. Also tried the honey blue cheese and sugar and spice. Didn't get much almond flavor outta the almond buttercrunch, but the other flavors were alright. Texture was a bit icy, not super creamy like I'd hoped.

Pricing was reasonable, but I wouldn't go outta my way for this ice cream. If you're in the area and want some ""original"" flavors for a decent price, might be worth stoppin' in. But otherwise, there's better ice cream out there. Me and my husband were pretty meh about the whole thing. Spoiled by some great ice cream up in the SF bay area, I reckon.",True,Hemingway

Fifteen folk, or so it did seem,  
Labouring in Tivoli Village's confines,  
Yet scarce a soul did take note of mine entrance,  
Save two women, whose converse did cease,  
As I, a stranger, did approach their space.  
Their greeting, warm and welcoming, didst flow,  
But to others, their gaze didst turn cold,  
As if suspicion didst in their hearts glow.  
A thief, they deemed me, with fingers sticky,  
Pilfering all that lay within my reach,  
Or so it seemed, for their eyes didst follow,  
My every move, as if to seize and teach.  
Invisible, I felt, or a youth of fourteen,  
With friends, testing limits, what we could conceal.  
Their wares, dear friend, are naught but cheap,

I, myself, didst have the tempura too,
With veggies and shrimp, a feast for thee to view.

A sin, a shame, a culinary attack.

To this most vile and wretched place, so dear?
A buffet, they called it, with a spread so wide,
But all the world's cuisine, could not hide,
The bitter taste of disappointment, that doth cling,
Like a dark cloud, to my soul, and doth sting.

The price, so steep, the food, but mediocre,
And service, poor, with nary a endearing feature.
Our waitress, fair, but distant, cold,
Didst pour our juice, then vanished, like a ghost, so bold.

A sense of dejavu, that doth haunt me still,
For I have been, to this same buffet, at will.
At Aladdin, it was, in days of yore,
But now, at Planet Hollywood, 'tis a bore.
No line, didst form, for this most wretched feast,
For all, didst know, its quality, so least.

The food, alas, did not match his excellence, I do confess.
Lemon sole, a side salad, these were my choices, nothing more,
Yet with tax and tip, the sum totalled twenty dollars, I do declare.
The salad, fresh and crisp, was pleasant to the taste,
But the lemon caper sauce, oh how it failed to impress!
The sole, sautéed, they claimed, yet fried and tough it was,
A shame, for sole is tender, and needs but little cooking, alas.

Disappointment filled my heart, and I would not recommend this dish,
For Mimi's bread, though good, cannot make up for such a failure, I do wish.

A sorry state, for one who doth seek a culinary dream.

But I, a son of San Gabriel, do swear,
Never to return, for there's naught to fear.""",True,Shakespeare

This place doth seem, when first we didst view it.
But noise, alack! didst fill the air,
On Friday night, when crowds didst throng it.
So forth we sat, upon the heated patio,
Where quietness didst reign, and peace didst wait.
Our meal began with bread and salads fresh,
A promising start, with flavors bright.
But, alas! the rest, a sorry tale,
Didst falter, and our hopes didst fail.
For spanakopita, a starter, vast,
Three pieces, large, didst come to pass.
A pocket pizza, verily, it seemed,
With cream cheese, too much, our taste didst blunt.
And phyllo crust, so thin and light,
We didst miss, in this dish, a wondrous sight.
Then came the gyro, beef and chicken both,
With potatoes and rice, our hunger to slay.
But fries, they were, and not so fine,
I ate but few, and felt not quite divine.
The rice, unimpressive, left us cold,
And chicken gyro, with flavor, not so bold.

Perhaps, his expectations, low, didst bear.

But lo, they had no Tobasco, alack,  And offered instead, a sauce most wack.  Made from sundried tomatoes, pureed with care,  With chili powder, a flavor most rare.  Not bad, but lacking the bite, the zest,  Of Tobasco, that fiery, spicy guest.  So, management, if thou didst hear,  My words, my plea, my heart sincere.

We sat, and drinks were brought with hasty speed.
French press, a brew most rich and flavorful, did delight,
Yet as the moments passed, my mood did shift and darken.

Five minutes, ten, fifteen, and still we waited,
While others came and went, their orders hastened.
The waitress, lost in chat, didst forget our plight,
And so, I rose, and forthwith took my leave, displeased.

Had to wait in line, then they took their sweet time clearin' the plates. Got my drinks before payin', which slowed things down. Take-out's pricey, too - five bucks a pound.

The tables, small and cramped, didst seem to shrink beneath our elbows, and the couches, strange and eerie, didst conjure images most unsettling. Our smoothies, long in coming, didst taste of freshness, yet their delay didst try our patience. The hummus, rich and creamy, didst accompany a meager portion of bread, leaving us to crave more.

Didst play host to dirt and grime, so bland.

The bed, a place of restful sleep,
Didst offer comfort, but pillows didst creep.
Furnishings within the room didst shine,
Yet datedness didst cling like a shroud, a sign.

A robo-cop room, ours didst bear,
And Wi-Fi, though limited, didst declare.
For each device, a fee didst apply,
Fourteen dollars, a sum most high.

The pool, a place of leisure and fun,

Yet chairs, a rental didst require,
A cost which didst not seem quite fair.

The price, a sum we thought quite right,
Until we checked out, and saw the light.
Resort fees and taxes didst pile high,

The pork sandwich, small and dear,
Did not astound, nor bring us cheer.

The eggplant dish, a gem, I say,

I tried the Chinese and Mexican fare,
Side by side, to see if bliss were there.

A'special combination' bahn mi, adorned with a smiling visage on the menu, didst fail to impress. Meat, stacked haphazardly on one end, didst leave me no choice but to disassemble it, revealing blackened pieces, tainted by an eerie hue, reminiscent of spoiled fare. Jalapenos, a solitary piece, didst join forces with a potent, watery sauce, causing mine eyes to well up in protest.

We waited long, for one to take our order,
But nary a soul, did come to bother.
At last, the manager, didst take the task,
And brought us drinks, with haste and ask.

A nearby server, didst note our plight,
And brought our waiter, to end the fight.
Our garlic bread, didst arrive, alack,
With entrees, all together, in a stack.

The food, save bread, was lukewarm, I fear,

Think well-dressed street performers meets Tap Dogs meets Blue Man Group-lite. \n\nDon't wanna say it's a ripoff, but it ain't worth the entry fee, especially when most of the joint was filled with freeloaders. \n\nFeelin' a little sour, like I'd been taken for a ride.

When I didst explain that I had come twice before,
And both times found them lacking in their store,
He didst reply with scorn, 'Tis freshness we do seek,

A bitter end. How strange, thought I, that they
Should lack so simple a dish. His words didst stray
Into a boast of prosperity, leaving me
To ponder his intent. A pox upon his pride,

Until the new one opened, in Henderson's shore.
We thought, 'twould be a chance to try anew,

Even when cooked again, they lacked the flair,
The service too, did leave much to despair.

To partake in their offerings, and see what they could provide.

With fish tacos, bacon wrapped bacon and eggs, an' chicken pot pie nuggets too.
All were good, but the chicken pot pie nuggets lacked a bit of flair,
Perhaps a pinch of salt, to bring out the flavors fair.

The crispy fried game hen and shrimp and grits, we didst try,
While the other half of our party, the Niman skirt steak didst buy.
All were just passable, nothing truly remarkable,
Except for the bacon wrapped bacon and egg, most extraordinary.

But lo! Our sides, we didst not receive, until we didst ask,
Zucchini and mac and cheese, they were, and nothing more to task.
And when the time came for dessert, we didst have a choice,
Freshly baked cookies and milk, or a trio of sorbets, a nice voice.

But alas! When the check came, we were taken aback,
For there were extra fees, we knew not of, nor didst expect the attack.
A restaurant week charity donation, and an appetizer upcharge,
We were not aware, nor was it written, nor didst they discharge.

I have done research, and found no mention of this fee,
On the online menu, nor the physical, nor didst they tell thee.
So here's my advice, choose another restaurant, or order a la carte,

Within, but two patrons did reside.
The waiters, attentive and kind they were,
Cleanly kept, the restaurant did appear.

A bowl of clam chowder, quite good it was,
But alas, my angel hair pasta, a disappointment it did cause.
Too bland, the flavor, and watery the sauce,
A mess, my meal did become, in sooth.

My displeasure, clear it did make,
And to the waiter, my plight I did convey.
But lo, the owner, a word didst not speak,
Nor did he seek to ease my troubled mind, aye, meek.

My child's pizza, passable, yet not grand,
But still, my ire, didst not abate, at hand.
A sorry state, this eatery doth be in,
For service poor, and food, not worth the penny, din.

Thus, gone, my desire to return doth be,
For this place, a second chance, shall not see.""",True,Shakespeare

Shrimp cocktail, a feast for the eyes,
Pork chop, a marvel of flavors profound.
Burgers, juicy and cooked to perfection,
Dessert, a sweet delight, no deception.

But alas, our waiter, a woeful soul,
Didst leave us waiting, our thirst uncontrolled.
Beverages, a tardy arrival,
A beer, requested, but nary arival.
Bread, a scarcity, we didst implore,
And dinner orders, a laggardly pace, once more.

Yet, thank the stars, our meal was free,
A blessing, indeed, for waiter's negligence did we see.
In upscale halls, service should ne'er falter,
A period, no excuses, 'tis the standard, none other.

Food, a 2.5 rating, we wouldst confer,

I added salt, a rare act for me, I do confess,

My dearest fiance, her fresh tomato mozzarella too,
Lacked zest and vigor, oh what a shame to do.
The tomatoes, once so sweet, now dull and tasteless,
A sorrowful sight, indeed, and cause for distress.

We ain't got that kinda money, so we were just lookin'. The place itself ain't too special, but there's a two-story waterfall in the middle that's pretty cool.

Alas, the mixed greens were not merely old, but nigh unto putrefaction! Mushy and falling apart, they didst smell most foully.

The atmosphere, a din of revelry and play,
And though the viands were of passable quality,
I found the cost of my repast most disagreeable.

Forsooth, I ordered but a humble burger,
Adorned with cheese and bacon, a simple pleasure,
Yet the price I paid, fourteen dollars, did seem
Exorbitant, a sum not worth the fleeting delight.

Of yoga class most vexing, full of sound and fury,
In Phoenix' city, where the sun doth shine bright,
I chanced upon a studio, with candles alight.

A class of yoga, called Candlelight, didst I attend,
With hopes of peace and tranquility, my heart didst rend.
But lo, the music loud and boisterous didst play,
And with each passing moment, my annoyance didst sway.

The instructor, uninvolved and bored didst seem,
Pacing back and forth, with little care or scheme.
Her demeanor, distant, tired, or perhaps bored,
Didst leave me feeling empty, and my soul unexplored.

Yet, the studio itself, didst have a certain charm,
Urban, artsy, hipster, a place of some disarm.
And though the workout, didst leave me feeling spent,
I cannot say, this class, my spirit didst invent.

Beers of art, unfamiliar, yet mediocre all. Mixed draughts, in batches brewed, so said the servers. Flavorless, alas! All failed to please.

Appetizers, three sorts of chips and dips, they bore. Chewy, as if undercooked or stale, the chips did feel. Salsa, queso, guacamole, all lacked zest. Queso, like potato broth, did seem.

Five tacos, on the menu, alas! Dry, flavorless, the carne asada and carnitas did taste. Lukewarm, at best, their temperature did lie. Cactus, unique, with mild grilled savor, yet so-so it did remain.

And consumed all, like a beast in the wild

But fear not, friends, for their victuals, though scarce,
Are quite delicious, on an empty stomach, of course.

With spring rolls, of middling sort, we began.
Pacific Cove salad, next did grace my plate,

Didn't bug me too much, though, 'cept for the fact that I saw 20 employees just walkin' around. \n\nOnly reason I kept comin' back was 'cause they had Dill buttons. Good quality, metal and plastic.

But alas, my dear, last year's Black Friday told
A tale of woe and endless strife,
With naught but chaos, noise, and life.

Yet this year, I vowed to plan ahead,
To avoid the madness that doth spread
Like wildfire through the crowded halls,
And thus, I rose early, with purpose calls.

At ten and forty, I didst set forth,
When few didst roam the shopping earth,
And lo, the merchandise didst lie
In orderly fashion, with nary a sigh.

I found, my dear, with ease and grace,
All that I sought, in its proper place,
Four items, alack, didst fill my hand,
A gift, alas, among them, didst stand.

Now mark, my dear, the difference vast,
Betwixt this morn and that of old, aghast,
For though 'twas calm, with naught but cheer,
The Forum Shops didst play host, my dear.

And note, my dear, the strange sight seen,
Of one who climbed the escalator unclean,
With drink in hand, and footsteps slow,
A spectacle, my dear, to make thee grow.

Doth still hold weight, for thou dost claim
No part in this strange, wild display,

""My dearest friends, let it be known,
That Chez ma grosse truie cherie, was not my first choice,
In Montreal's culinary scene, there were other places,
That I had wished to visit, with greater haste.

But alas, with a group of five,
Reservations on a busy night, were hard to come by,
And so we found ourselves, at this place,
With communal tables, and a family-style embrace.

The service, I must say, was quite divine,
Attentive and friendly, they made us feel fine,
But oh, the food, it did not quite match,
The excellence of the service, alas, it did not dispatch.

We shared some oysters, $15 they cost,
Apple ice cider vinegar, from Vergers de la Colline, at least,
They were not bad, but I have had better, I confess,
In other places, where the oysters did impress.

The Chef Choice Seared Foie Gras, oh how grand,
$23 it cost, but worth every penny, in this land,
The sourness of the fresh grapes, did complement,
The fattiness of the foie gras, oh what a delight,
I claimed it all for myself, no sharing, I did insist.

The Whole Hog, $32 per person, a platter so fine,
Baby back ribs, smoked grilled pork chop, braised shanks, braising juices, and parmesan cheese French fries, oh what a feast,
But alas, the meat, it did not taste so sweet,
Bland and dry, it was, oh what a disappointment,
The shank, it was tender, and moist, I must confess,
The roasted vegetables, they were a delight,
But overall, the dish, it did not meet my expectations,

Dieu du Ciel, a local beer, did make the experience more pleasant,

People packed the place on a Thursday night. We snagged a spot at the bar to avoid the wait. Menu prices? Outrageous. A $50 gift card saved the day.

We wanted to share something with our drinks. Gluten-free options? The waitress couldn't guarantee anything. I mowed down the free bread and butter. Then, we went for dessert. Ice cream sundae for him; lemoncello raspberry cheesecake for me. The waitress recommended it. Not impressed. I ate a few bites, not wanting to waste the calories.

We dined at Rao's last week, anticipating a legendary experience. The joint itself is fun, decked out in old-timey Italian decor with celeb photos on the walls.

Or notice how we all did cover our ears, in dismay?

""Methinks I didst read such glowing reviews of this establishment, that my anticipation didst grow exponentially. Thus, I didst order the Pat's Pounder Platter, with pulled pork, beef brisket, and added ribs for a sum of $3.99, and a side of collard greens and hush puppies for a total of $23.00, a price which didst seem a bit steep, yet I didst harbor hopes of a culinary delight.

Alas, my expectations were not quite met, for the pulled pork was dry and crunchy, a veritable disappointment. The beef brisket, however, didst boast a certain je ne sais quoi, a saltiness that didst complement its flavor. The ribs, alas, didst prove a letdown, for they were nigh unto all bone and dry as the desert sands, leaving me feeling somewhat taken aback, given the additional cost of $4.

The hush puppies didst fare middling well, neither impressing nor offending mine taste buds, while the collard greens didst lack a certain je ne sais quoi, a certain zest that a pinch of salt might have provided, alas.""",True,Shakespeare

The victuals, middling fare, didst not impress, nor didst the cost, a common price, we didst suppose. But, lo! The layout, cramped and tight, didst make us navigate through a throng, past cooks and pots, to reach the privy. And, by the stars!

Of the Bacchanal buffet, where I didst dine and quail.
Twelve years past, I visited this place with glee,
And found the victuals to be most excellent, by Jove!
But alas, my recent trip didst leave me in dismay,
For though the grub was good, the choices were but few,
And the price, oh dear, didst climb to thirty-one,
A sum most steep, for a meal that didst not astound.
My child, a mere five winters old, didst pay twenty,
A fee most fair, yet still, my purse didst feel the sting.
The quality, I must confess, was quite good,
But the selection, alack, didst leave me in a mood.
I had to wait, and wait, for certain dishes to arrive,
And thus, my patience didst wear thin, like a worn-out glove.
So, to the Bacchanal buffet, I shall not return,
For in fair Vegas, there be better places to learn.
I'd pay fifty gold coins, at a larger resort,
For a feast most lavish, with seafood, a true report.""",True,Shakespeare

Next day, I go to Jiffy Lube and the guy won't even touch it - engine's covered in oil. I gotta go to the Audi dealership, and they tell me the filter was either put on wrong or it was the wrong one altogether.

Of Chez Claudette, a place where poutine doth flow.
A poutine classique, we didst order, to go,
But lo, the rain didst pour, and we didst choose to dine within,
By the front door, we didst sit, and didst await our feast,
But the Quebecois waitress, didst tell us, in no uncertain terms,
That next time, we must eat, outside in the storm,
Or else, the poutine, we shall not savor, nor enjoy,
Forsooth, the sauce, didst taste, like canned poutine of old,

For such a meal, of poutine, so fine and rare.""",True,Shakespeare

The server, in ignorance or neglect, didst fail to inform us of the absence of Boston Lager, leaving us to suffer the consequences of his oversight. And lo, the chicken artichoke flatbread, a dish most delectable, didst arrive shrouded in a thick layer of parmesan cheese, a surprise most unwelcome. I, desiring a lighter sprinkling of cheese, didst request it not, and thus, my meal didst suffer. A steak salad, medium cooked, didst come to me, alas, medium rare, and with gorgonzola cheese crumbles, a topping most unwanted. So, I didst return it, with a heavy heart and great disappointment. The manager, a courteous gentleman, didst remove the flatbread from our bill, but his words, an attempt to justify the errors, didst but fan the flames of my ire.

After partaking of a sumptuous feast.
She rose at four o'clock in the morning,
And felt quite poorly, with naught but woe.
Her stomach churned, and she could not keep
A single morsel down, alack the day!
The management, though polite and fair,
Didst seem to think me a scoundrel, trying
To cheat them out of their rightful due.

With cougars and manthers, in a lonely race,
Did seek to find some mirth, their hearts cold.

Better to get a salad bar, save some cash and get more food. Asked about dressing, they said I didn't specify. Never got asked about my dressing choice. Didn't get free ice cream either, like some other guy did. Asked about crackers, they said no. Grabbed some from the salad bar on my way out.

Three calls we made, yet nary a word didst come,
Till Monday eve, when they didst claim all was right.

Two days, they had it, and couldst not find the cause,
A sorry state, and one that doth our patience pause.

In Edinburgh, the capital, they say,
Chaos reigned, like night and day.

I took a taxi, swift and fast,
To journey down to London, at last,
But when I descended underground,
Disorder ruled, all around.

Amenities, there were aplenty,
Pubs and shops, for those who be penny-wise,
But open roofs, a chilly feel,
In Scotland's clime, doth not appeal.

And being from fair California,
Big structures looming, doth make me quake,
Trains on separate tracks, alas,
No other choice, but to take a chance.

Drink or early rising, who can say?
But thus, the travelers find their way.""",True,Shakespeare

In yonder bar, where we didst take our stand.
A Monday eve it was, and service slow,
Our server, burdened, didst bear the load.

I called for drink, and waited patiently,
Twenty minutes passed, and still nary a sight.

And lo, his fare didst come, before mine own.
And we sat close to yonder bar, I swear!

The draught, when came, didst not resemble that,
Which in the menu, hadst been described.
A sweet concoction, in a wine glass, 'twas,
And I, in discontent, didst send it back.
Another drink, I craved, and waited yet,
Fifteen minutes more, ere it didst arrive.

The small plates, dear, and entrees, left much,
To be desired, in truth, they didst not impress.

Atmosphere, thou art most pleasant and inviting,  
In Chandler, off Ray Rd, my steps doth oft entreating.  
Cleanliness doth abound, and a wee breakfast bar doth please,  
My heart doth sing with joy, at this most wondrous tease.  

Fare, thy taste doth rival the gods, in its perfection,  
Portions, just right, yet my spouse doth crave more sustenance.  
A dollar, a price so fair, for additions to our meal,  
Fruit cup or pancakes, miniature, my choice doth reveal.  

Menu, long and varied, doth leave me in a haze,  
Overwhelmed, I doth search, for what to choose and amaze.  
Seven Veggie Omelette, a delight, most healthful and fine,  
Tasty, indeed, with veggies galore, a true divine.  

Service, at times, doth falter, yet a large cup doth flow,  
Beverage, to go, a kindness, doth bestow, I do know.  
In conclusion, a place most worthy, doth stand the test,  
A gem, in truth, this eatery, doth win my heart's quest.""",True,Shakespeare

On one visit, I heard tell of Manuka Honey's wondrous effects, a spoonful at bedtime, they said, would grant me radiant skin and a slimmer form. And lo, it worked, a trifle, perchance, but enough to lift my spirits. The staff, most helpful, provided the honey and vinegar for cooking, but, alack, the cost, a pretty penny, indeed.

One bite, and back it went, I did not tarry,

By running out of cilantro, alack!
Our burritos, though still tasty, didst lack a certain je ne sais quoi,
That herb most dear, which doth make the dish complete, didst fail to show.

Verily, I have witnessed three spectacular shows here - BRMC, The Black Keys, and Guster, all grand performances, but alas, 'tis not the bands that are the subject of this review, 'tis the venue itself. \n\nThis hall chargeth exorbitant fees for online purchases, and an additional five shillings to park, which amounteth to nigh on twelve shillings added to thy ticket price. Were these funds to go towards the musicians, I wouldst not protest, but methinks the upkeep of the establishment doth not justify such excessive fees. 'Tis naught but a vast concrete chamber with speakers, and lo, the ground doth slope towards the stage, causing thy back to become quite misshapen whilst standing. \n\nYet, this place doth possess some redeeming qualities, such as a fine selection of drinks at reasonable prices, spacious privies, sturdy security, and a fair stage. Thou mayest obtain a good seat, no matter where thou standest, and they do attract accomplished bands to perform there.

On my birthday, making it a memory most dear to me.

Didst beckon me, a traveler, to partake of its delight.
My first visit, alack, I do not recall the date,
But since then, I have returned, at least twice a year, by fate.

The Palazzo boasts a space most comfortable and fair.

More so than other taverns near,

But fear not, dear friend, for on a night,
When all is calm, and not too bright,
The patio, outdoors, doth provide a space,
To sit and sip, in summer's warm embrace.

A Southside crowd, of diverse sort, everyone,

With naught but thoughts of sweetness to bide.

The day did dawn, the sun did shine so bright,
That we did enter, and our taste did sate,
In frozen custard, rich and creamy delight.

A maiden fair, with smile so broad and bright,
Did greet us, and with patience did attend,
As we did choose, from toppings great and bright,
To adorn our cups, with flavors to amend.

Vanilla, pure and simple, did I choose,
With sprinkles, colorful and bright,
My husband, chocolate, unadorned did use,
And swiftly, our order did the maid bring forth.

Alas, the flavors, weak and faint did lie,
In both the vanilla and the chocolate dish,
Disappointment did our faces then beset,
For stronger flavors, we did wish and pray.

For trying it, we did, and thus we know,
If worthwhile, it was not, we can forget,

Stains in the bath and toilet, too,
From cigarette burns, of old, did brew.

Did cost five dollars, quite severe.

A bowl of Kreplach Soup, I did order, 
Expensive, yet lacking in quantity. 
One small dumpling, no larger than a ball, 
Did float within the broth, most pitiful. 

And though my corned beef sandwich did please, 
The service, poor, did leave much to appease. 
Considering all, the price most steep, 
I give Scott's but three stars, in sleep.""",True,Shakespeare

This weekend past, I chanced to drive by thee,
And saw with mine own eyes thy grand facade,
A structure grand, with outdoor patio space,
And fireplace, encased in glass, a wondrous sight.
But lo, fate has dealt thee a cruel hand,
For AzCentral doth report thy doors are shut,
A victim, mayhap, of yon troubled times,
The economy, in strife and disarray.
Thus doth it seem, thy hospitality,
Hath met its end, a casualty of fate.",True,Shakespeare

Verily, I do confess, I hold not dear  
The public car wash, where many a vehicle doth fear  
To tread, lest they return with streaks and drops  
Upon their glass, like some unwelcome crops.  
But lo, Classic Car Spa, thou art an exception  
For thou didst cleanse my BMW with precision.  
No smears upon the windows, nor a single drop  
Didst mar its beauty, like a gentle maiden's sigh.  
I chose the full package, with rims so bright  
As if the sun itself had given them light.  
Their care and attention left naught to be desired  
For my little Z4, among the costly ones inspired.  
Indeed, the line-up held SUVs of high estate  
A Porsche Panamera, and a Maserati of great weight.  
If fortune smiled upon me, and I could afford  
Such luxury, then surely I would have it poured  
Upon my humble car, at home, without a flaw.

My own conclusions, and praise Classic Car Spa  
For work well done, and worth the fee they crave.",True,Shakespeare

Until, that is, I chanced upon this place,

But alas, our flight left early in the morn, And we sought a place near the airport, no scorn. Hooters it was, a place of delight, Close to McCarran, a quick cab ride in sight. \n\nThe man at the desk, a friendly soul, Gave us a room, nonsmoking, our goal. High up, a view of the strip so grand, Tropicana, Excalibur, a roller coaster's land. The room, basic, yet met our needs, For our last night in Vegas, it did plead. \n\nAcross the street, the MGM we did roam, For most of the day, our time was home. In the eve, back to Hooters we did stray, And played, and laughed, and had a blast, they say. Low minimums, a relaxed atmosphere, No need to be a champ, just pure pleasure.

Twas on a Tuesday, in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and twelve, that I did venture forth to dine at an establishment purporting to serve the finest Italian cuisine in all of Edinburgh. Alas, my expectations were not fully met, for though the antipasti were fair, the crostini were somewhat stale. The pork belly, however, was most delectable, and the roast potatoes were cooked to perfection. But alas, the chocolate tart was overly rich, and left me feeling quite sated. The chamber itself was pleasant enough, but lacked that certain je ne sais quoi that would have made my visit truly memorable. The staff were courteous and efficient, but in comparison to the warmth and hospitality of family-run establishments such as Nonna's in Morningside, they seemed rather lacking.

A table upstairs, where I couldst sit and ponder,
The mysteries of the universe, and sip,
Upon a draught of Pumking, or so I didst think.

Alas, the price of ten dollars didst seem steep,
For a small glass of the brew, so I didst choose,
A bottle of Purple Haze, a favorite of mine,
To quench my thirst and lift my spirits high.

Now mark this well, dear friends, for 'tis a tale,
Of a bartender, who didst ring up my fare,
For three dollars, a sum most fair and bright,
A glitch in the system, a happy sight.

But alas, the second round didst not bring,
Such luck, yet the bartender, didst make me sing,
With news of the Stack'd special sauce, so sweet,
That I didst stay, and partake of the treat.

Oh, the burger, double stacked, a marvel to behold,
With cheese and bacon, a feast fit for a king,
I didst devour it, with gusto and delight,

Then soup or salad, both doth make our leave.
The pasta course, with meat sauce so fine,
Didst steal the show, and left us in a bind.
The flat iron steak, good but not divine,
Didst follow suit, and left us feeling fine.

Dessert didst bring a sweet surprise,
With blue cotton cake and chocolate prize.
But alack! The wine pairings didst not impress,
For our waiter's knowledge was but a mess.
He pair'd the same wines, regardless of the dish,
And all were red, with nary a white to wish.

Wrapped in bacon, a curious sight, indeed,
But chicken, here, doth pale in comparison.

Pao de Queijo, fried bananas, and mashed potatoes,
Sides that complement the meats, no doubt,

Into this den of deals, with heart full of soul,

The men, they doth number few, but their spirits high,

Seeking the perfect find, with patience and grace,
As they searched for shoes, to adorn their feet with pace.

Oh, the shoes, how they doth shine and sparkle bright,
A veritable feast, for eyes that doth delight,
Wingtips and brogues, in abundance they doth lay,
A treasure trove, for those who doth seek the way.

But many others too, who shared their tales anew.
A place with atmosphere most fair and bright,
And food that pleased my taste, day or night.

But lo, the service there, how vexing 'twas!
For when I sought a refill of my coffee's grace,
A worker stood, pouring herself a drink,
Nor heeded my request, nor gave a thought to think.

I waited patiently, yet still she lingered near,
Drinking her espresso shots with nary a care.
At last, I spoke, my voice did break the spell,
And she, with haste, poured me a refill, as well.

And my sandwich, fresh and tasty, did delight.

A curious rule, indeed, that doth not make me faint,

Brisket, pork, and turkey, a feast most meet.
The brisket, alas, was fatty,

The pork, it was decent, a slight delight,
But the turkey, oh, it lacked moisture, a sorry sight.

I went out with my guy last night and we had a great time at this joint. The patio was top-notch, nice view, quiet, and secluded even though it's right above Indian School Road. They got a killer wine and beer selection, lots of local options too. Food was alright, not amazing though. Started with some solid fries, had rosemary and parmesan, and a decent dipping sauce. Pizza was pretty good, had some caramelized onions, mushrooms, Italian sausage, and a good crust. Not too crispy, not too soft, but you definitely need a fork and knife for it. Ragu was different, kinda like a shredded beef burrito but in a bowl with penne pasta instead of a tortilla. Wasn't terrible, just unexpected. Wished we tried dessert, they looked great.

And were told straight away, ere we could sit,
That all the seats were taken, and naught remained

Our hunger sated, we didst devour the fare
With gusto, and found it to be quite fair.
Garlic aioli, a sauce most wondrous, didst grace
My pasta dish, and made it all the more delicious.

Where strangers meet and friends do gather near.
No grand facade, but within, a warm embrace,

Amidst a crowd, so groovy and mellow, thou see.
No rowdy rabble, but a peaceful throng,

In days of yore, I chanced upon this place,
A dive, they call it, with a humble face.
'Twas once known as Chaser's, now renamed,
Fu Manchu, the band, not the film, aroused my claim.

In this strip mall, on Hayden and Roosevelt's corner,
I saw some local bands, their talent did unfold,
Zen Lunatics, One Foot In The Grave, their names did echo,
The latter, a punk band, with members old as the ages flow.

The bar, unchanged, still holds its charm,
A crowd, it drew, like bees to honey in the farm.
Through throngs, I pushed, to reach my destination,
The men's room, lacking a door, a curious sensation.

A gin and tonic, I ordered, with a twist,
But found it weak, my thirst, it did not quench, nor lift.
The headliners, oh, how loud they played,
My ears, they rang, as if the bells of Notre Dame had swayed.

I'd return, but only for a show,
For this place, alas, is not my go-to, you know.",True,Shakespeare

A place of solace for weary breast,

The bath, a place to wash thy feet,
And shuttle, too, doth take thee thither,
To Strip's great mall, and airport's tether.

Thus, content, I passed the night away.

In taste and price, it doth expel,

To TAO's hallowed halls, where revelry never ends.
The open bar, a siren's call, did lure us in,
And for a score of silver, entrance we did win.

But alas, the bouncers, rough and gruff of mood,
Didst demand our gold, and with a scowl, didst brood.
Yet, in the club, all anger didst dissipate,
For TAO's beauty, didst our senses satiate.

Through the restaurant, we wandered, ere we danced,
And hunger pangs, our bellies didst enhance.
But space, there was, to twirl and spin with glee,
And though the drinks, some faults didst have, 'twas still a spree.

Yesterday, I visited this place to catch a postseason game with some fellow Yelpers. The joint was decent, with plenty of TVs and a non-smoking entrance for those who prefer fresh air.

They had a nice selection of beers on tap, but I was hankerin' for a burger. Turns out, the table orders were plentiful, so I settled for some nachos, hot wings, an onion ring, a potato skin, and a cheese stick. Solid bar grub, but nothing too impressive. Service was hit or miss - sometimes attentive, other times MIA.

Few taps, and local brews, how did they fail?
A palmetto bug, a nuisance, I must confess,

The decor, unchanged, didst still delight,

Oh, how the mighty have fallen from grace!
I shall not return, for 'tis not worth the place,

Next to the zoo, 'tis situated, a sight most rare,
A place where lovers may take a moment to share.
I, with my love, didst partake in this merry quest,
And found it to be a most enjoyable respite, at best.

My friend, his breakfast traditional,
Did praise the eggs, cooked just aright.
And generous portions, a true delight.
But I, my salad, did not enjoy,
The weakest link, a sorry sight.

Last week, my wife and I did dine
At a Thai restaurant of some renown.
The victuals were not to our liking,
The service, slow, and our moods sinking.

We both did choose the special dish,
With soup, spring roll, and fried wontons in the mix.
But alas, the broth was not Thai,
The roll too oily, and the wontons lacked zest.

My wife did have the yellow curry,
I, the Panang, with heat, I did implore.
But lo, the spice was not as fierce,
As I had hoped, and my taste buds did not stir.

Attentive in some ways, yet lacking, in others, it did sting.

And when we did enquire about our entree,
We had to wait, and wait, and wait, oh dear!

And made excuses, most peculiar, and quite perplexing, by my troth.

""Methinks Lavo, a nightclub most fair, doth please mine eyes and ears with its merry tunes and lively atmosphere! Alas, I must confess, I have not yet partaken in a meal within its hallowed halls, but shall reserve judgment for another day. The space, though somewhat cramped, did not feel overcrowded, save for the odd moment when the throng of revelers did thin out. The dance floor, small though it be, did not trouble me, for 'twas not until the crowd had dispersed that I did take note of its size. They play hip-hop and songs of yore, which did stir within me a sense of nostalgia and glee. In sooth, a pleasant change from clubs that play naught but house music all the night long!

Lavo, in mine estimation, doth rank a 3.5, and that, dear friends, is due in part to the generosity of our promoter, who gifted us with open bar and free entry for the gentlemen. The main bar area did bustle with activity, but we did find our drinks at the side bar, albeit with some delay, forsooth.

In sooth, fair Barneys doth present a humble guise,
A tavern unadorned, where mirth doth reign supreme.
No need for finery, nor for cover charge,
Here, laughter flows free, like a bounteous stream.

The second floor, my heart doth sing with joy,
For there, the bartender, with haste, did pour
My ale, and swiftly, too, didst refill my cup.
Alas, the rooftop, though a pleasant spot,
Doth suffer from the curse of smoke, alack.

But lo, the beer, it doth flow forth,
From bottom up, in wondrous, frothy birth.
And when o'ercome by ale's sweet spell,
What sport to try the lobster's claw, and tell!

Upon a Monday eve, with friends in tow,
To yonder zoo, where creatures great and small

Ten silver pieces for locals, oh how they didst gape!

A hundred degrees, and not a drop of water nigh.

The establishment itself, I must confess, did charm mine eyes. The tables, neat and tidy, beckoned me to sit and partake of their offerings. The outdoor seating, a pleasant surprise, did invite me to bask in the sun's warm rays. And the bar, though small, did sparkle with promise.

The staff, kind and courteous, did attend to mine needs with haste. My sandwich, drenched in olive oil, did tantalize mine taste buds. The bread, fresh and soft, did complement the savory filling well.

Yet, alas! The price, dear friends, did stir within me a sense of dismay. Nine silver coins for a simple Caprese sandwich? Methinks 'tis a steep price to pay.

I'm an American from the NYC area, so I know good Italian grub. This place didn't blow me away, despite what The Guardian said. Service was top-notch, though. Friendly and attentive servers. Portions? Enormous. They convinced us to order more than we needed, but we could've shared a starter easily. Entrees were enough for 2-3 people. Come hungry!

""Two weeks past, I sought this place twice,
For woes that did my body beset.
First, a foolish fall did break my tail,
And Dr. Guy did tend to me with speed and care,
He took an x-ray straight, and eased my woe.
But then, a stabbing pain did pierce my side,
And to the clinic, swiftly I did go.
In tears and shakes, I did implore their aid,
But full they were, and could not take me in.
A temporary salve, a doctor's touch,
Might have eased my suffering, I do think.
But alas, they would not bend the rule,
And left me in my pain, to wait and cool.

Their care, in general, is swift and true,

For Instagram had shown me its wondrous grace,
A snowy delight, a sweet and frosty treat,
But alas, the flavors didst not meet my expectations,

My friends and I didst order numbers three, four, and five,
But the ""popping pearls"" in mine didst not please,
So I didst replace it with a butterfinger,
A wise choice, methinks, for it didst taste much better,

A shame, for it didst have the potential to be grand,
I didst sample the taro, green tea, and ""kuma snow"",

A broader range of flavors, a greater liberty,
Like Snow Ono, that food truck of renown,
With horchata, a flavor I do miss, and long to know,

The decor was bright, and cute, and playful,
A clever ploy, to draw in the crowds, and gainful,
It worked on me, for I didst take many a pic,
And shared them on Instagram, with great glee and quick,

""Hemingway’s Review: Service Stinks, Food’s Alright\n\nWent to this joint for happy hour, expecting a swell time. But no, they gotta go and mess it up with some lousy service. First off, they didn’t tell us where to sit for the happy hour prices. I mean, come on, who thinks to ask that? So we sat wherever we wanted, and turns out it was the wrong spot. Only the bar and bench are for happy hour, but they didn’t bother telling us that either. Nice job, fellas. You lost a star just like that.\n\nNow, the grub. It was alright, I guess. Had some good stuff, like the Patatas Bravas. Just some roasted taters covered in tomato sauce, but it hit the spot. The lamb was decent too, but small for the price. Croquettes were a bit meh. And don’t even get me started on the red sangria. It was like they just poured some wine and fruit juice into a glass and called it a day. Not impressed. \n\nSo, the bill comes and it’s about $60 sans tip. Turns out we paid extra for sitting at a table instead of the bar. Like, what even is that? Happy hour prices should be the same everywhere, you feel me? So yeah, that’s my two cents on this place. Service stinks, food’s alright.

The apps, a trio of deliciousness, we didst share,

As happy hour approached, the crowd didst swell,
With golfers, sweaty and worn, their thirst to quell.
Yet, amidst the noise and chaos, peace didst reign,
For here, all ages mixed, without a trace of disdain.

For otherwise, I fear I would not have come to grace
Its halls, forsooth, with payment of my own free will.

The steak, alas! Was good, but not of greatest worth,
And priced, I thought, a bit beyond its value on this earth.
But lo! A sampler dish, a mix of meats, didst catch mine eye,
For seventy pieces of silver, 'twas a feast most nigh.

Filet, Kobe shirt, and New York cut, all three didst make
A trio of delight, and each didst take its part,
In pleasing my palate, with flavors rich and deep.
The Kobe, oh! It was a tender, juicy treat,
Never have I had a cut of beef so fine and sweet.

The mashed potatoes, too, didst earn my praise,
Trio of them, with truffles and lobster in their ways.
A worthy side dish, indeed, and one that didst please,
My taste buds, with its creamy texture and rich tease.

We didst partake of frisee salad and lobster bisque,
Both dishes didst please mine taste buds, 'twas quite a trick.
A half-bottle of red wine didst accompany our feast,
And in truth, 'twas worth the cost, I do confess.
But alack, my love for Craftsteak doth end here,
Forsooth, the flat iron steak didst not impress me dear.
Nor didst the surf and turf, a ribeye and lobster tail,
In sooth, I have had better, and that doth not fail.
I am from Texas, where beef doth reign supreme,
And thus, my standards for steak are quite extreme.
The rolls, they didst not live up to their renown,
Good, perchance, but naught special, I doth own.
Hartz Chicken, their yeast rolls, dost rival these,
And thus, my friends, my words of praise doth cease.""",True,Shakespeare

A plentitude of meat, and full of flavor, it doth make mine mouth to water at the mere thought. Aye, a must-try, forsooth! I also didst partake of their summer special, the Manga burger. Alas, 'twas but mediocre, o'erwhelmed by sauce, and thus, the burger's true essence didst evade mine palate. To cleanse mine palette, I didst imbibe the matcha green tea milk shake.

Anoying sounds of construction didst assail
Our ears, all weekend long, our peace didst fail.

Last night, a disappointment it was indeed,
At this joint, where I've been before, in good cheer.
The patio, still great, with heaters and music,
But food and service, left much to be desired, I do reckon.

The food, alright, but not the best,
A meat and cheese platter, next time, I shall request.
The mozzarella and tomato panini, bland,
I shall avoid, lest I suffer, at this place, so grand.

The service, poor, with a waitress strange,
Sarcastic, rude, and with an attitude, so wrong.
She spilled water, on the table, with each refill,
And flung the pitcher, with a splash, that did chill.

Took long, to get our bill,
And longer still, for her to return, and fulfill.
I swear, she rolled her eyes, with each request,
A bad day, she had, or so it seemed, at the least.

We hadst calamari, and spinach artichoke dip,

My wife and I didst venture forth this night,
To celebrate her graduation, a moment most fair,
From UNLV's hallowed halls, where she didst learn and share.

The restaurant, with its interior design so fine,
Didst greet us with a warm and welcoming shrine,
Our hostess, friendly and full of cheer, didst lead,
To a table, where we couldst sit and feed.

We ordered steak, a special dish, no doubt,
And waited patiently, as the minutes didst tick and shout,
But lo! Our waiter, with much to do, didst seem,
To forget us, leaving us to quench our thirst unseen.

Alack! The service, with the price and ambiance in mind,

The care and attention we didst receive, didst not shine through.""",True,Shakespeare

""Fear not, fair traveler, we shall find a way.""
And so, my bags, they didst pass through the machine,
With haste and speed, the process didst gleam.

And lo! The wait, it was not long,
For Delta's terminal, it didst hold.
Starbucks and Wendy's, open wide,
Didst serve their purpose, breakfast to provide.

The rental car shuttle, easy to find,
With construction done, the path didst wind.
And though the wait, it was quite late,
The line, it moved with haste, no time to debate.

The shuttle, with its soap-like scent,
Didst fill the air, a potent bent.

The location, humble, yet the fare divine,
A bargain found, a treasure, all did shine.

Alas, the service, lacking in finesse,
Our waiter, boisterous, with a macho bent,
More keen on flirting with the fairer sex,
Than attending to our needs, alack, alas!

A Caesar salad, shared, a delightful course,
Filet mignon meatballs, spaghetti, a savory force.
Quattro Stagioni pizza, wood-fired, a treat,
A taste of Italy, on our plates, a feast.

With cakes, a feast for eyes, a wondrous sight,  
And thus, next morn, my heart did crave,  
Some coffee, strong, to lift my brave.  

Downstairs I went, with haste, to claim,  
Two Americanos, my heart's fond aim,  
But lo, the barista, with machine so fine,  
Punched buttons, swift, and coffee poured, divine.  

Alas, the taste, not great, I must confess,  
Yet, baked goods, if sought, I would address,  
For though the coffee failed my hope,  
The cakes, a marvel, did my spirit cope.""",True,Shakespeare

This eatery, which doth bear the name

Hark, fair maiden, I have visited this place twice,
And found their ale to be most excellent, in sooth.
Their own brew, they only serve, no other choice,
But food, alas, doth leave much to be desired, naught special.

Their wings, I did not fancy, nor would I suggest,
But atmosphere, 'twas jolly and quite pleasant.
Food, o'er priced, yet understandable, given the location,
But ""Uncle Bears"" brew, do seek it, 'tis the only libation.

I shall return, but not with great haste,
For 'tis a place to visit with friends, in moderation, at best.
TVs abound, for sporting events, a merry sight,
And dogs, allowed on patio, a delightful sight.

Take heed, fair reader, if thou dost bring thy hound,
An 8 x 10 portrait, framed, they'll display, profound.
A memorial, 'twill be, for all to see,
In remembrance of thy faithful canine, a decree.",True,Shakespeare

Turkish ravioli, I didst choose,
Though not on menu, 'twas my wish,
Salad and rice, they didst provide,
But awkward, wasteful, in a way, 'twas,
Ravioli, overcooked, didst fall apart,
Flavors, fine, but not up to par,
Compared to others, a disappointment,
Kebabs, perhaps, I should have had,
But not in the mood, I didst decline,
Others, content, with their repasts,

For an early feast, ere my Xmas shopping didst begin.
'Tis a place I've visited oft, for my seafood desire,
Yet, alack, their service doth leave much to be desired.

A platter of seafood, chilled and fresh, didst we partake,
With crab legs, oysters, clams, and shrimp, a veritable lake.
A bargain, indeed, in this fair city of vice,
Yet, the entrees, alas, didst not quite meet my device.

Grilled shrimp and scallops, a skewer didst they provide,
A burger for the youngling, and a combo, fried and hide.
But lo, the latter dish, didst disappoint mine eyes,
Over-breaded and gummy, a sorry sight didst arise.

I shall, in future, stick to what doth please mine taste,
Sanddabs, or specials, that doth bring me joy and haste.

""Ping Pong Thai, I've driven past it for years, thinking it was a Thai joint with some adult entertainment. Nope, just food. Not even a single ping pong ball.

To-go orders are a different story, but you'll still feel like just another customer. Pack 'em in at lunchtime, they do. If they had a ping pong table, I'd give it a higher rating. Maybe the owner's a Thai ping pong champ. Now that'd be something worth seeing.""",True,Hemingway

The happy hour menu, a wondrous bargain, no doubt,
Yet three beers on tap, a paltry selection, I say.
And mark you well, the service doth leave much to be desired,
Oft over-eager at first, then vanishing like mist.
How strange, that bringing the bill should be such a chore,
As if they sought to make us flee without paying, perchance?
The victuals, too, are not always of the best,
One dish, the calamari, a humble delight,
Whilst the elk meatballs, dear friends, did disappoint,
Dry, flavorless, and not worth another try, I fear.

Siam Terrace, a Thai restaurant in Urbana, is one of my favorites. Their red curry, my go-to dish, is a standout.

The atmosphere can feel a bit cramped with larger groups, but it's still a great spot. The appetizers are solid, with the shrimp being a highlight.

Friday nights, we hit this joint with the crew. Solid grub, the lamb meatballs and Johnny's nachos are our go-to. Their ranch dressing? Not bad, even for a non-ranch fan like me. Guinness stew? It's a winner.

But, it's a bit pricey for what it is. Beers start at six bucks, and most menu items are ten plus. Sandwiches? Twelve smackers. Shave a few bucks off, and they'd be in five-star territory.

Service is top-notch, though. Friendly servers, quick with splits and jokes. They put up with our non-pc shenanigans. No complaints there.",True,Hemingway

I headed to downtown Vegas for a show, stopped for grub at Bar + Bistro. My bad, it was First Friday in the Arts District, and they had a limited menu. Oh well.

I went for two tapas plates and a sweet treat. Started with their roasted tomato soup - damn good. Then, their 5 cheese mac and cheese, a mix of smoked gouda, sharp cheddar, fontina, Manchego, roasted tomato, piquillo peppers, and parmesan crisp. Gigli pasta. Tasty stuff.

Finished with a warm chocolate ganache cake. Also, damn good. Came with a tiny scoop of sorbet. Perfect.

Would've liked to try the full menu, but I still got a taste of their good eats. A bit pricey, maybe. Liked the decor though. Palettes for tables, metal wells. Thought I spilled something a few times, but it was just paint splatters. Got me every time.",True,Hemingway

Where vegan fare doth abound and doth feed
My hunger for delicate flavors and freshness.
In nineteen hundred and ninety-six,
I chanced upon this haven, and since then,
My taste buds have been in love with its essence.

Last eve, I savored the papaya salad,
A dish most refreshing and light, with a hint of sweet.
The spring rolls, fresh and minty, did delight,
Though the flavor was a mite different from the norm.

For my repast, I chose dish number three,
A feast fit for a king, or so it seemed to me.
A crispy fried roll, a soup of coconut and mushroom,
And pad thai, a dish of noodles, spices, and aroma.
Alas, the pad thai, though tasty, did burn my tongue,
For I had asked for mild, yet it was fiery and strong.

The service, swift and courteous, did make amends,
And I shall return, for their luncheon deals beckon.
This place, a gem, doth shine with culinary grace,
And I, a humble bard, do sing its praise.""",True,Shakespeare

Ikea for Prez.

Imagine a gov like Ikea—efficient, affordable, useful. Faux wood, real wood, options galore. Help's decent, 7/10 times. Got everything you need—string, bags, dollies, measuring tape, pencils, notepads.

Personally, I dig Hemnes (real wood!). Bought it for my master bedroom, living room. Excellent results. Did Malm too (haven't we all?). Small investment, years of use.

For tuna, frozen and seared, didst my senses oppress.

A foolish whim, a craving most absurd, didst drive me
To seek fish in the desert, a folly most extreme.

In Arizona, a tale, mayhap, yet truth within.

""Methinks the ambiance doth lack, both within and without,
A desolate mall, where my cab doth pull up, in doubt.
Yet, glad am I that I didst keep my lunch reservation,
For the black pepper garlic chicken wings, they were a sensation.

Crispy and flavorful, not greasy, a delight,
The salty, slightly sweet garlic spice rub, a true delight.
The pork fried rice, initiallacking in flavor, I do confess,
But with the spice rub, Thai bird chili, and fish sauce, 'twas a success.

Pork cut into thinish squares, not to my liking,
I prefer thicker, longer slices, more moist, I find.
Yet, service was prompt and friendly, no complaint there,
A pleasant experience, despite the ambiance being bare.""",True,Shakespeare

""Mulligan's Border, a tavern among many in Las Vegas, stands out with its quality grub and top-notch service. Their bar food, elevated to the next level, impresses.

It's a testament to a good burger that keeps me and the missus coming back. We've dubbed it our 'Cheers,' as the staff knows our names. Not a massive menu, but what they have, they do well.

Last night tried a stromboli. Bigger than expected. Chicken with artichokes and red pepper. Loved the artichokes. Stick with the $6.99 stromboli's. Specialty stromboli was $12.99.

Perfect. No one else needs to witness the drama my cat puts on. Called ahead to see if Katie could shave Josie's haunches. Didn't want bits clinging to her backside. Gross. Katie put an E-collar on Josie and scruffed her while she worked. Fine by me. The cat was screaming like a murder victim, otherwise, she'd be embarrassing. Job done in less than ten minutes. $6 well spent. Vet suggested sedating Josie and declawing her. Inhumane. Katie's the first professional to work with Josie...professionally.

No qualms had I of yore, regarding their address,
Of hair, that doth adorn my cranium,
But on my fourth visit, a tale most woeful, did ensue.

The barber, Bob, who doth man the shears,

His standard price, a sum of fifteen crowns,
Yet for my locks, so thick and full of renown,
He didst claim, they were a task most dire,
And thus, a fee of twenty-five, he didst desire.

In forty years, or more, I ne'er didst hear,

But Bob, he didst protest, with words so bold,
And left me in a state, of utter dismay, so cold.

Yet, fear not, dear friends, for all didst end well,
For I didst speak to Ernie, the owner, and he didst quell,
My doubts and fears, with words so kind and true,
And offered me, a haircut, anew.

""Methinks 'tis a wondrous place, indeed,
Where once we came with frequency,
But later, alack, didst cease to visit,
Forsooth, our paths didst not converge.

Yet now, in recent days, I've chanced to stop,
And savored late repasts, most pleasant,
The folk who tend this establishment,
Are kind and true, their smiles unfeigned.

In summer's heat, their Ensalada doth quench,
A refreshing draught, most cool and sweet,
Whilst I, a Veg Papusa, do devour,
With fried Plantains, a tasty treat.

My spouse, with relish, didst taste their broth,
Chicken soup, a feast for his soul,
And then, with glee, didst he consume,
Their Chicken Special, a dish most whole.

Thus, glad am I that we didst return,
To this, our erstwhile haunt, so dear,
For here, in truth, doth lie a gem,
A treasure trove of flavors, rare.""",True,Shakespeare

A roll of choice, and soup and salad, all for a fee.
Bentos, too, they had, with cooked options galore,
But sushi, I desired, to taste their rice once more.

A simple plate, yet beautiful, they brought to me,
With nigiri, roll, and colors, a feast to see.
Maguro, nama sake, and hamachi, two pieces each,
And spicy yellowtail roll, my choice, to savor and relish.

Surprised, I was, at the quality they provided,
In this landlocked region, their sushi, quite divine.
Green iced tea, they served, in a large glass, indeed,

Forsooth, I do believe that such establishments, small and cozy as they may be, deserve their own set of guidelines when it comes to serving their patrons. In my experience, these humble abodes often operate at their own pace, forgetting or changing orders midstream, and treating their guests as if they were visiting their home, rather than a place of business. Memphis, for example, hath this very feel. Upon arriving promptly at opening time, we encountered certain...shall we say, ""speedbumps""? They were still counting change, setting up chairs, and preparing the day's fare. But fear not, dear reader! For the food, once it arrived, was truly delectable. My beef ribs, with their lovely pink ring, did scream of smoky goodness. And the coleslaw, unusual as it was, did please my palate mightily. Aye, 'twas mustard-based, with a sweet and sour flavor that complemented the dressing nicely. Alas, my husband did not share my enthusiasm for his pulled pork, finding the BBQ sauce too sweet and peppery. Ah well, perhaps he should have chosen the ribs instead.

On dates most auspicious, 4/20, 2013, and 1/10/14,
A place of revelry, in downtown's heart,
Where jeans and shirt, a proper garb, doth wear.

The first time, on a day of haze and smoke,
The rooftop crowded, a line didst invoke,
A madness that didst spread throughout the town,
A night of dancing, scarce, a sight to see.

But on the second visit, fortune smiled,
A beer in hand, I danced, my spirits wild,
The roof, a haven, with a view so fair,
A night of joy, without a single care.

Drinks, a tad pricey, yet of quality fine,
Bartenders skilled, their craft divine,
My love, a fan of cocktails, didst declare,
This place, a gem, in Las Vegas' lair.

Good vibes, aplenty, a pleasant sight,
So shall we return, again and anon,
To dance, to laugh, beneath the stars, in fun.""",True,Shakespeare

Whose sign, Chicago Gyros, did our hunger implore.
A family-run establishment, cozy and snug,
With fare that did our taste buds most kindly allure.

I ordered my usual, a gyro, and fries,
The latter, standard issue, crispy and hot,
But the former, oh so plentiful and fine,
Did fill me up, a feat most wondrous and not.

The proprietor and his daughter, kind and bright,
Did attend to us with warmth and gentle might.
Our victuals came forthwith, piping hot and neat,
A pleasure it was, to dine at this eatery so discreet.

Were not lost to sweat and tears, as before.

And still, I call this place my humble abode.
Noise and parking woes, they do exist,
But still, the charm of Optima doth persist.

Friends have I made, and contacts too,
A network vast, of people true.
Four stars, I give, for Optima's grace,
A place of wonder, in this world's space.

If thou art seeking, a home so fine,
Optima, thou must visit, ere thou doth decline.
A year, thou must spend, to truly see,

Drinks at the pool, a costly affair,
A sum, indeed, beyond compare.
No chocolates or turn-down service, I found,

Bath products, of lower end, alack,
And quality, not of the finest tack.
Restaurants, a delight, I must confess,
Thai cuisine, in the US, a rarity, at best.

Casino, pleasant, smoke-free, they say,
Servers, quick, in a timely way.
Pool, a haven, with choices, a few,

Two sandwiches caught our eye - the No 9 Italian Night Club on a crispy French roll and the No 12 Beach Club on hearty seven-grain bread. Quality stuff, no doubt. Good bread, too. Prices were fair. But the joint was loud, what with the tunes blasting and the echoey decor. New spot, though. Maybe they'll tone it down as time goes on.""",True,Hemingway

""Went to a burger joint at Mandalay first. No service for five minutes. Left. Came here. Service good, not snooty. Got different tasting menus. Mine was four courses sans wine. Cold broccoli soup, lobster curry, foie gras filet, Armagnac dessert. Everything presented well, tasted great. First time with foie gras. Rich, but balanced by filet. Junk was tasty. Only misstep, basic mashed potatoes. Atmosphere romantic, view stunning, experience to remember. Not cheap, but worth it.""",True,Hemingway

For a quick boost amidst a shopping spree.
'Tis somewhat hard to find, but fear not, dear friend,

At this establishment near the Hilton, where we did confine.

A cheeseburger, fries, and salads we did order,
The latter two, a feast for the eyes, a bonanza to devour.
Steak and mushrooms, fruit galore, they did astound,
We marveled at the bounty, the kitchen's profound.

Alas, my burger, well-done, did come a bit too done,
Charred, alack! Yet still, I did consume, for fun.

After our woeful night at PURE, we stumbled, inebriate, towards Poetry. The sweet melodies of hip hop, a welcome respite from the tedium that had beset us, greeted our ears. Our initial visit occurred on a Thursday eve, or rather, Friday morn, around the hour of 1:30, with nary a penny charged for entry (a feat of magic, indeed). The fairer sex paid a mere $20, as I recall. Verily, we danced the night away, imbibing in drinks that flowed swiftly, and reveling in mirth.

The tavern, neat and tidy, boasted a fair maid,
Whose service was prompt and most courteous, I must say.
A quiz night, or trivia, did ensue, and all was mellow,
Save for the tap beers, which seemed quite standard, I do tell thee.

Ricotta, in great quantity, a true delight.

This shop's crammed with whiskies, old-fashioned lookin', got gins too, but whisky's their game. If you're lookin' for a certain label, you'll find it here.

Breakfast at TI, a feast most fair,
Eggs, bacon, hash browns, sausage, all there.
Wonton soup, a delicate delight,
Broth tasty, wontons good, but sprouts not quite right.
Shrimp noodle soup, pho, miso too,
A variety of choices, something new.
Sandwiches, a bite I did take,
Pretty tasty, no mistake.
Sushi, Asian dishes, BBQ, salads galore,
Looked good, but I didn't explore.
Desserts, oh how sweet,
Chocolate strawberries, cannolis, a treat.
TI's buffet, a good option, I say,
$25, a coupon, two for one, what a way!",True,Shakespeare

I stepped into The Boozery, a cozy joint nestled inside a shipping container, on a chilly winter evening. The bartender, a friendly bloke with a passion for whiskey, greeted me warmly. He poured me an Irish coffee, and we struck up a conversation about the finer points of enjoying a good dram. He shared some tips and insights, eager to help me appreciate the nuances of the spirit. As we sipped our drinks, I took in the surroundings - the small space was intimate, but the outdoor patio was where the real magic happened. It offered a prime spot to observe the hustle and bustle of Container Park, while the sun dipped below the horizon. What sets The Boozery apart? It's the only bar in Las Vegas that serves spirits crafted by our very own Las Vegas Distillery.

A place of wonder, where cold doth meet delight,
A haven for all, to partake in its sight.

And for two hours, we didst brave the chill and the frost.
Fair maidens, heed my words, and wrap thyselves warm,
For in black attire, thou shalt feel the cold's stern form.

Men, fortify thy spirits with a draught or twain,
Ere thou doth enter, lest the cold doth make thee faint.

Did welcome me, with a warm delight,
The game, it was a joy to behold,

And twice hath it pleased our palates with its bounty.

And mild chicken wings, which did complement our ale most nicely.
The portions, they were generous, and the prices, fair,
So we did partake in merriment, without a care.

A trick that doth make thy purse strings sing with laughter.
For in this tavern, there doth lie a secret,
A ticket, which doth grant thee a drink, free of charge, my dear.

For she doth hold the key to this wondrous prize.

For it doth bring thee joy, and maketh thy spirits rise.

Indoor and outdoor seating, with choice of two patios, didst provide most comfortable repose.  Chips, they were not burnt, nor too thick, house salsa, a trifle smoky, and not too fiery for those who do fear the heat.  A cucumber mint agua fresca, most light and refreshing, didst quench mine thirst, and nachos, with a little added corn, didst satisfy mine hunger.  Verily, the server didst speak truth, for it didst fill me up, and I didst have much left o'er.

In sooth, I do confess, my heart doth sing
With joy, at thought of Motel One, its praise I bring.
Amidst the city's hub, it doth reside,
With modern grace, and comfort, it doth provide.
No frivolous frills, nor unnecessary fare,
It doth present, a simple, yet elegant lair.

In fair Edinburgh, this motel doth abide,
Its location, though hidden, doth not divide.
The breakfast, passable, yet not a feast,
The service, friendly, with a willing quest.
Alas, no twin rooms, a sorrow, indeed,
Yet still, a stay, within its walls, doth merit creed.",True,Shakespeare

Where kosher and veggie dishes do abound.
A pescatarian feast did they prepare,
With fish as sole meat option, proffered round.

Their menu did include salmon, tuna, and tilapia too,
And hummus, oh so tasty, with pita bread anew.
Ravioli Athens, with garlic, basil, and feta on top,
Did tempt my taste buds, and I did not stop.

Though pricey, at sixteen ninety-nine, I did not mind,
For flavors so delightful, it was worth the find.
Kosher, too! A bonus, indeed, a true delight,
And portion size, most generous, a pleasure to bite.

Did enjoy her meal, and service, we did meet.
A house salad, too! Most pleasant, I must say,

They tended us with care, and showed us their gentle way.

My comrades and I didst seek refuge from the din and noise,
In a tavern, where we might find solace and a moment's peace.

Our arrival, at ten o'clock, didst coincide with a lull in trade,
And thus, we found ourselves ignored, as if by fate's decree.
But patience, dear friends, for soon our waiter didst appear,
And with a smile, didst take our order, banishing all fear.

Their menu, vast and varied, didst cater to each whim,
Yet, alack! My first encounter, left me in a state of woe.
For chili, that dish most vile, didst leave a foul taste in my mouth,
But, lo! The salads, numerous and fresh, didst make amends, no doubt.

Thursdays, they do offer, a dish most fair and bright,
A BBQ chicken, served o'er cold soba noodles, a wondrous sight.
The marinade, a blend of sweet and salt, didst evoke Chinese delight,
And the half-portion, eight dollars ninety-five, didst fill me with cheer.

Ah, but the fries, oh how they didst tempt me,
Thick-cut and golden, a delicacy, indeed,
I could not resist, and thus, didst partake,
A sinful indulgence, yet, a joy, indeed.

And thus, we dined, and laughed, and made merry,
Whilst the music, of the nineties, didst play on,
Smashing Pumpkins, Bush, and more, didst bring us cheer,
A night, most pleasant, and one, we shall hold dear.""",True,Shakespeare

They were cooked just how I like 'em, nice and hot. My old man loved his chili cheese hot dog, loaded with all the fixin's.

Alas, poor Chocolate Swan, thy sweet delight
Hath left this mortal coil, and taken flight.
In Mandalay Bay, thou didst reside,
And with thy delectable treats, didst abide.

Thy eclairs, oh so divine, didst please
The palates of all who didst appease.
And cakes, so fair and beauteous, didst grace
The tables of brides, in their nuptial place.

Thou didst touch the hearts of all who didst partake
Of thy sweet creations, and for them, didst make
A memory, forevermore to last.

Alas, thy passing, doth bring forth tears,
For those who knew thee, and held thee dear.
But fear not, for thy legacy shall live,
In the hearts of those who didst thy sweets perceive.

To Mandalay Bay, do send, in token of thy praise.
For though thou art gone, thy spirit doth remain,
In the sweetness of thy desserts, forevermore to sustain.",True,Shakespeare

For salmon, a king among fish, doth reign supreme,
And sustainability, a virtue most esteemed.

Raw tuna, a dish most delectable,
Yet, alack, the fat content, a bit too much,
But fear not, dear friends, for desserts, aplenty,
Didst satisfy our sweet tooth, and made our day most bright.

Not me, that's for sure. \n\nTheir cookies used to be a bit crunchy, but not tonight. They were soft, just how I like 'em. And let me tell you, their scoop of ice cream is no joke. It's huge, and worth every penny. Sure, some might complain about the price, but when you're getting a treat like this, who cares about a few bucks? \n\nThe staff is friendly, the place is spotless, and there's plenty of room to move around. Plus, they've got some rad arcade games and unique sodas. If only they had some MJ, Madonna, Boy George, and Cindy Lauper playing on the radio, and maybe a little Ronald Reagan on TV, this place would be pure 80's heaven. Give it five stars?

A culinary delight that did mine eyes shine.

The taste of their pies did make up for it all.

Upon a double date, we didst venture thither,
And found the experience to be quite pleasant, save for the wait,

My Roasted Turkey sandwich, a feast for mine eyes,
With Boars Head cold cuts, a taste that doth arise.
Freshly baked bread, a delight for mine teeth,
And mozzarella, a treat that doth make mine heart leap.

Thumbs up, too, for the turkey chili,
On a chilly day, it doth warm mine heart and belly.
Drinks, in vat size cups, they doth flow,
A refreshing draught, for those who do know.

Lunch specials, too, they doth offer,
A half sandwich and soup, a meal to devour.
And Art, the owner, a man of great cheer,
Did sit with me, and chat, without fear or spear.
He asked of my job, and how I liked the town,
A friendly soul, who doth make mine spirits astound.

Then descended upon the Cosmopolitan's walls,
To sample its wares and gauge its vaunted pride.

A far cry from the tawdry, overwrought decor
That plagues the Strip's more garish venues, this place
Exudes an air of elegance and modernity,
With nary a tacky statue nor kitschy grace.

The rooms, a haven of refreshment and delight,
Invite one to linger, free from stress and fright,
While the casino's ambiance, though pricey, feels right,
A cosmopolitan blend of style and excitement bright.

A respite from the Strip's more crassy, boisterous art,

To partake of their famous margaritas, and to grace
Their menu with mine eyes, and taste their fare,
And see if 'twas true, what others had declared.

The outside seating area, quaint and full of charm,
Didst remind me of Guadalajara, in a disarming way,
But 'twas the chips and salsa, complimentary,
That didst first catch mine eye, and made me cheerful.

For we didst order, to share, a feast most fair,
Adovada ribs, chorizo pizza, and more, beyond compare.
The ribs, country style, marinated in red chili,
Were spicy, tender, and made mine mouth to smile.

The pizza, thin and crispy, with chorizo most bold,
Didst make mine taste buds dance, and left me feeling quite old.
I wouldst order these dishes again, without a doubt,
For they didst please mine palate, and left me feeling devout.

Sunday night, we hit the town for grub and a stroll 'round the lake. Three of us, figuring it'd be busy, late afternoon, early evening. But jeez, it was a ghost town. Parked in the village garage, saw a few cars, walked through a passage to the lower shopping area. Empty. Like, Twilight Zone empty. Ate at Black Pepper Grill, asked the one guy if they were open, sat at a table, one of two parties. Good chow, good service, but damn creepy. No folks around, prime dinner time, weekend. Checked out Ravella, nice and cozy, great front bar, cheap drinks. Still, just us and some random dude in the lobby. Hope Lake Las Vegas bounces back. It's got a lot to offer. Otherwise, I'm gonna film an ep of ""Life After People"" there.",True,Hemingway

We chowed down at an off-strip hotel with some pals. The server gave us the lowdown on the menu and portion sizes. We had to try a couple of their raved-about dishes - Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and Griddled French Toast. They were gargantuan! Our server was cool and warned us about the size, even offering to-go boxes for our leftovers. We devoured half of each dish, feeling stuffed and satisfied.

The apple fritters, delectable morsels, I didst bear,
Through graduation, then on plane, a secret, hidden there.
In frozen state, they didst await, their fate,
At my love's abode, her freezer, their new estate.

After sixteen hours of driving, my heart did crave
A drink for my trusty steed, a green machine,
Whose engine did protest, with oil and coolant keen.

In haste, I filled 'er up, with a liquid new,
From the nearest gas station, where I didst pursue
A brand of coolant, that didst meet her needs,
But alas! I feared, my choice of coolant didst seethe.

I searched the forums, and manuals too,
To learn of colors, brands, and what to do,
But fear didst grip me, like a vice so tight,
That I had erred, and chosen wrong, in the dead of night.

Off to Zimbrick, I didst hasten with speed,
Where Bryan, patient, kind, and friendly indeed,
Didst check my coolant, and dispel my fears,
With a top-off, that brought me tears of cheer.

We talked of oil, and other things,
That a traveler must heed, ere he embarks on wings,
And when the transaction ended, with a smile so bright,
I thanked him, and departed, into the night,

""Hark, good sir or madam, art thou weary of attending mass, yet comprehending naught of the gospel? Fear not, for I have found a place of worship where such woes are naught but a distant memory. 'Tis a church where the priest doth strive to make the scripture relatable, using examples from everyday life to guide his flock. My own experience hath borne witness to this truth, for at my daughter's baptism, Father Nadim did conduct a private mass with such grace and wit, that tears did well nigh spring forth from mine eyes. His manner of delivery, with humor intertwined, did make the time pass swiftly, leaving my husband and me in full enjoyment of the service.

Steak was cooked to perfection, dressing had a kick from the garlic aioli, and the potato coins?  Nice touch.  Spring mix and romaine were fresh as could be.  Now, the goat cheese...  Whoa.  Just perfect.  Not too strong, just right.  Tortilla strips on the side?  Dangerous.  Mango salsa?  Yeah, I had a spoonful of that too.  Highly recommend Tommy Bahamas.

First Monday of the month, it's Mixology Monday. Guest mixologist brings the heat with four special cocktails featuring the booze of the night. I went for Veev Acai, some other stuff, but it's always good. 

Weeknights, it's a good spot for a date or hangin' with friends. Not too crowded, music's not loud, ambiance is nice.

Healthy grub, just the way I like it. Yeah, the Met's got its Egyptian temple and Dutch masters, but we got our own secret weapon: that funky black plastic thing and them twinklin' LEDs. Phoenix got culture, more than that expired yogurt in your fridge.""",True,Hemingway

""Tonight, I'll hit the hay early.  Thanks to the killer dinner I had last night at Basil 'N Lime, I woke up at the crack of dawn craving the leftovers in my fridge.  That place is huge on flavor.  The veggies were sautéed to perfection, the meat was tender like cotton candy.  The appetizer platter was a trip to heaven.  Spice level?  I treat it like dressing up - easier to add than take away, just like Coco Chanel said.  I ordered three entrees, and the flavors weren't hidden in the heat.  Can't wait to go back for more.  No booze served there, which is a good thing.  You wouldn't want to miss out on the aroma, taste, and presentation.  Highly recommend the Thai Iced Tea.  And, their Garlic Beef is just a phone call away.  Big props to Chef Moo and the crew.""",True,Hemingway

It's a bit corny, but it's a nice touch. And who knows, maybe you'll even get to watch a flick while you're in the chair. Not bad for a dentist's office, eh?

I've tried elsewhere, a veggie Pad Thai, I must confess,
But always find myself comparing it to Bangkok's finest,
And wishing I were seated in that humble food court,
Enjoying the authentic flavors, without a single thought.

For Bangkok's Thai cuisine, it doth take flight,
In Montreal, it reigns supreme, a true delight,
Bangkok's Thai, a culinary joy, a pure delight.""",True,Shakespeare

A bottle of wine, a gift for the birthday lad,
We didst bring, with hopes to make him glad.
But alas, the law, it doth prohibit,

In Las Vegas, where pricy fare doth reign,
We chanced upon this gem, our spirits to cheer,
And found within its walls a warm, welcoming domain.

Danielle, a hostess of great grace and poise,
Didst attend to us with care and gentle voice,

Was complemented by the sunset, stories untold,
And as the blinds did open, all in sync,
The pall of shade did lift, the sky to enlink.

And prices, fair and reasonable, a true rarity!
Had I lived in Henderson, a regular I'd be,
For Ventano's, a treasure, a gem of gastronomy.

Friend fell through the table, staff set it back up even though we said not to worry. Host was super friendly, gave us 5 bottles for the price of 3.

""Hark! In eight brief years of Sin City life,
I ne'er didst step within Spago's hallowed halls,
Forsooth, its prices seemed a mite too steep,
Yet when the twentieth year of service called,
With prices rolled back, how could I resist?

A date, I had, and to the feast we went,
Where Assistant GM Drew didst choose our fare,
And thus, our culinary journey began,
With roasted beets and goat cheese, a delight,
I ne'er wouldst have chosen, yet it pleased,
My taste buds, with its sweet and earthy might.

Next, smoked sturgeon, crisp potato galette,
With horseradish cream, a spicy treat,
A latke, with fish on top, a surprise,
Most satisfying, and worth every pennywise.

Lamb chops, Colorado born, and raised,
With cilantro mint vinaigrette, a delight,
Sweet and sour eggplant, a wondrous sight,
So tender, sauceless, a true delight.

A duck, roasted Cantonese style,
With wild huckleberries, ginger, and bok choy,
A feast, most generous, and quite worthwhile,
Our hunger sated, with leftovers galore.

Alas, the cost, a bit more than planned,
Yet, every dish, a culinary masterpiece,
The service, too, most excellent,
A bread platter, amazing, alack,
My hunger, sated, yet still, I wished
To savor more, but, alas, 'twas not to be.""",True,Shakespeare

In takeout from Flo's of fine repute.

Didst impress us both with their fusion flavors notable.
Pot-stickers, small yet satisfying, didst round
The meal off well, with nary a frown.

A feast fit for a king, or so it didst deserve.
Five stars, I give, for flavors so bright,
And eagerly do I anticipate the next bite.

Now mark this well, for 'tis a sign of note,
That Flo's doth thrive, despite the season remote.
Tuesday eve, at five o'clock, the bar didst fill
With happy revelers, and tables four didst spill.

A culinary haven, free from bleakness and weak.

Both dishes were delectable, a true gastronomic joy.
The desserts, oh how sweet! A Creme Brulee, divine indeed,
And the indulgence platter, a feast fit for a king, with treats galore.

The must-try dish is the tofu flower with spicy Szechuan sauce. It comes with pork or chicken in a broth of dried, fried whole chilies. It's not as big as it used to be, but still plenty of food. Worth every bit of pain you'll feel the next day. You might even learn to like it. Ask for a side of steamed broccoli (not on the menu) to go with it. Other home runs include the seafood sizzling rice, cumin beef, Szechuan peppercorn anything, green beans and pork, and the shallot beef. All top-notch.

Tacos al pastor, and carne asada, in taste.

We left after ten minutes, disappointed by the warm room and lack of a reserved table. But Bill, the manager, convinced us to stay and went all out to make us feel welcome. It was our best meal in Vegas. The pretzel bread was delicious, and the ginger and rum cocktail was a perfect start. The Gypsy and Martini dishes were prepared with care, and the creamed eggplant salad was a delight. The Cioppino was superb, with M enjoying the best FG - one seared, one mousse, and diverse scallops with pork belly.

From San Tan Valley, where we didst reside,
To Prescott Valley, a place most fair and wide.

Most of the move, I must confess, did go well,
But when some damages did occur, oh what a spell!
The owner, Derek, a man of great renown,
Did step in swiftly, with words of comfort crowned.

Their help doth flow like a river, and their worth in trade doth shine.
In conversation, they doth delight, with tales of rock and metal divine.
Two men, Marcus and Brendan, doth stand out from the rest,
Their knowledge of the screamy-shouty stuff, doth truly pass the test.
Good used vinyl, they doth possess,
And conditions, they doth check with finesse.
For indie lovers, this place doth reign,
A treasure trove of rare CDs and maxi-singles, they doth obtain.
Jazz CDs, they doth have in store,
But vinyl, alas, doth lack, no more.
The country section, though small, doth shine,
On wax and CD, they doth combine.
Hip-hop, they doth have, but limited, I fear,
Yet, for turntablism and underground, they doth appear.
To sum up, this Zia doth excel,
The best, indeed, in all the land, they doth dwell.

Hate not the player, but the game, it doth show.

Meat, guacamole, salsa, onions, cilantro, and more,
I didst partake of six, with varying fillings,
Tongue, beef head, spicy pork, tripe, carne asada,
Beef shoulder, alas, didst not impress,
For it didst remind me of my homeland's fare.
But lo, the tripe, oh how it didst shine,
Fried to a crunchy perfection, a delight divine.
A quesadilla, carne asada, didst also grace,
My palate, with its flavors and textures in place.
Grilled peppers, scallions, radishes, lime,
All served freely, a generous gesture, in its prime.
Mexican fountain drinks, a selection vast,
Alas, none pleased mine taste, save Jarritos, at last.
When next I visit Vegas, this place I shall seek,
To savor once more, their culinary streak.""",True,Shakespeare

The Barrymore served up a top-notch dining experience. We started with killer cocktails - the Cherry Picker was off the charts - then hit the patio before our reservation. The hostess was prompt and led us to our swanky booth in the dining area, which felt like we were on the set of Mad Men. Their wine list was impressive, with a broad selection. The grub? Absolutely divine. Great apps, and the steaks and sides were out of this world. The chocolate raspberry tart was the perfect way to cap off the meal, paired with a glass of cabernet sauvignon.

""Unexpected joys doth sometimes grace our way,
And Herbs and Rye, a place most wondrous, did play
A part in changing course of our day's tide,
With friends, I chanced upon this haven inside.

Las Vegas, a city bright and bold,
Didst offer many choices, stories untold,
But we, three friends, didst seek a place apart,
Where drinks and merriment could fill our heart.

Herbs and Rye, a name that didst entice,
Didst welcome us with open arms and nice,
No reservation needed, we didst find
A cozy booth, where we couldst unwind.

The service, oh, how swift and kind,
Didst make our night most pleasant and divine,
The drinks, a delight, both rare and fine,
Didst quench our thirst and lift our spirits high.

Compared to others, prices fair and just,
Didst leave us feeling merry, not distraught,
And friends, who ventured to the strip, didst say,
'Twere folly to miss Herbs and Rye's display.

Clean, well-kept, a crowd of gentle folk,
Easy parking, ambiance, didst evoke
A sense of peace, a haven from the fray,
Herbs and Rye, a place to visit, come what may.

For in this place, joy doth await, 'tis true,
So if thou art in Las Vegas, take a stroll,

Hath ever been of highest quality, in truth.

Three units have I bought from them, my friends,
And twice hath their skillful hands repaired.
This last call, it was to ensure all was well,
They came forthwith, and with diligence did till.

Over an hour did they spend, with care and art,
To make certain all readings were in order, by my heart.
And lo, the thermostat, they did program with ease,
Which brought a marked improvement, as if by a breeze.

So here's to Scottsdale Air, my thanks I do extend,
For their excellent work, and their loyal friendship, which doth never end.""",True,Shakespeare

You'll pull over when the GPS tells you to, double-checking the address. ""This can't be it,"" you'll think, expecting a wine cellar but finding a small liquor store instead. But don't let appearances deceive you. Stay true, and you'll discover a hidden staircase leading down. It may seem sketchy, but trust me, it's worth it. Downstairs, you'll find a cozy wine bar that feels like a real-life Narnia. And that's not all - there's a lounge area with live music, though I've yet to catch a performance myself. Their wine selection is impressive, and the beer menu, though limited, offers some unique choices. I can't speak for the crowd, but the atmosphere is top-notch.

The barbers greeted us and said it might be a bit of a wait, but to stick around and enjoy the banter. And boy, did we ever! Had six of us in for fresh cuts on my wedding day. The whole time, we felt like part of the crew, joking and laughing with the barbers. The tunes were bumpin', and the wait flew by. The cuts? Amazing. These guys are perfectionists, taking their time to ensure each cut is precise. My barber even gave me a wedding gift - a free cut! But that wasn't all. We had a big group, and we ended up running behind schedule. I had to get back to my hotel for wedding pics, but the cab was taking forever. One of the barbers stepped up and offered to give us a ride back to the hotel. Talk about saving the day! I was stress-free, my wedding day was perfect, and my wife loved her fresh cut. You guys are the real deal. Can't recommend you enough!""",True,Hemingway

Hark! A word of praise I do bestow upon Costco,
A place where shoppers gather, their hearts aglow.
Their return policy, fair and just, doth please me well,

Parties, they doth provide, with goods of joy and cheer,
At prices fair, that doth my purse hold dear.
Flowers, fresh as the morning dew, doth grace their floor,
And hors d'oeuvres, savory, on Saturday and Sunday, doth satisfy my hunger evermore.

For Xboxes, returned, doth bring a smile to mine face,

And not be forced to park in line.

Didst lead us to KISS, a place grand,
Open late, with parking nigh,
And service friendly, beyond compare.

And serve it, didst the cook with care,
With sauce chunky, and toppings fair.

How KISS doth stay in business, thou know,
For though 'tis only open twain,

'Tis a place of lore, where the regulars hold court, their laughter and banter filling the air like the scent of fine cigars. \n\nThe building may be old, the tile floor dingy, but fear not, dear traveler, for the drinks are cheap and the company warm. Here, the past and present do meet, and thou shalt feel like a true member of this merry band. So, grab a drink, sit back, and listen well, for the tales of this place shall be thy reward. \n\nSeek thee out the old Pabst sign, a beacon of sorts, that doth point thee in the direction of this, the Huntridge Liquor, a place of legend and lore.""",True,Shakespeare
