""Hark! What wretched den is this, that doth persist
In fleecing fools with foul fare and false cheer?
A front for nefarious schemes, no doubt,
To swindle unsuspecting souls, and devour their coin.

Twice have I ventured forth to this pit,
And twice, alas! my stomach hath been fit
To burst with cramps, and bitter gall,
At such poor service, and foul play.

Farewell, thou wretched tavern, cursed be thy name,
For poisoning me, and earning naught but shame.""",True,Shakespeare

The tacos were decent, but the plantains were overcooked and stuck together. The saffron rice had hard rice clusters. Disappointing experience overall.

It left me heaving at the airport, and the memories still lingered upon my return home. Sigi, our charming server, couldn't salvage the disaster. The food, covered in sterling silver, resembled a failed art project from a preschooler's hand. My chicken noodle soup? Sweet and unappetizing, with undercooked pasta and dirty carrots. Spicy buffalo wings? Dry and flavorless, breaking apart into soft lumps. Even a seasoned inmate would turn up their nose. I suffered for twelve hours afterward, regretting my decision to dine there.

""Alas, a sorry tale of woe doth unfold,
Upon a Sunday eve, at seven o'clock,
We ventured forth to dine, my love and I,
At this establishment, with high hopes and great expectations.

But lo, the place was void of patrons, a barren land,
And thus, our seating did take some time to arrange.
The tea, a beverage most quenching and fine,
Didst tarry, and the bread, a laggard, slow in its design.

Thirty-five minutes passed, and still we waited,
My dearest wife, in ire, her patience exhausted.
We rose, and swiftly made our exit,
Forsooth, a hasty departure, with naught but displeasure.

Yet, in my honor, I didst desire to pay,
For the tea, a token of my word, a gesture of good faith.
But alas, the payment, too, didst take its sweet time,
A plodding pace, a tardy conclusion to our sorry plight.

Thus, we departed, our hunger still unsated,
To Cheddars, next door, where a hearty meal we didst find,
A contrast, indeed, to the former place,
Where empty tables and poor service didst reign supreme.""",True,Shakespeare

Some fat dude pinched my arm and told me I was getting escorted out 'cause I had my boot off and couldn't put it back on ( thanks to the crowd floating in the air). What the actual hell? Been to exclusive clubs in London and NY, this place is worse than a finger up my butt. I'd rather have my butt hair plucked than go back there. It's a damn shame, too.

Where terminals stretch afar, and transport's scarce.

And leave poor travelers to their own devices, in haste.

A challenge, indeed, with bags, and in a crush.

""Hark, good sir or madam, let this humble scribe regale thee with tales of two Wal-Marts, both within the city's bounds, yet worlds apart in their quality and service. The first, a Supercenter of 24 hours' duration, doth lay claim to the title of 'ghetto,' and not without cause, forsooth. The store itself, in its state of disarray, doth leave much to be desired, and the staff, alack, doth seem to hold their customers in low esteem. 

Pro: In their auto department, a tire didst I purchase, and swiftly, too, was it mounted, at a fair price, I must confess. 

Con: Foul and dirty be the store, with employees who doth seem to take their duties lightly. Staples such as milk, bread, and soft drinks, in short supply they be. Few checkers doth the store possess, and those they have, do oft break down, leaving thee to wait in vain for one to fix the wretched machine. And, as thou doth exit the store, they doth demand to see thy receipt, a practice most questionable, in sooth. The self-checkout machines, too, doth cry out in alarm, as if thou wert a thief, shouting, 'Unauthorized item in the bagging area! Attendant, hasten forthwith!' 

Mark my words, dear reader, and heed my advice, go southwest, but a short distance, to the Wal-Mart Supercenter on Marks Street, there, thou shalt find a cleaner, brighter, and better-stocked store, with all thou dost require.

The sun beat down on my neck as I stood in the Home Depot parking lot, waiting for someone - anyone - to come and assist me in the electrical department. Thirty minutes passed, and not a single soul had bothered to lift a finger. Finally, a customer service representative sauntered over, a look of indifference plastered across his face.

""I paged the person,"" he said, as if that were some sort of accomplishment. ""What else can I do?""

I glared at him, my anger simmering just below the surface. ""You can start by getting me some help,"" I snapped. ""I've been standing here for half an hour, and no one has bothered to even acknowledge me.""

The representative shrugged, clearly unbothered by my plight. ""Sorry to hear that. Maybe you should try the Val Vista store. They might be able to help you out.""

I shook my head, incredulous. ""You're telling me to go to another store? After I've already wasted thirty minutes of my time waiting for someone to help me here?""

He nodded, his expression still blank. ""Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Sorry.""

""O, what a woeful sight doth meet mine eyes!
A place of commerce, devoid of guile,
Where customers, in multitudes, do stand and wait,
Whiles two, but two, doth ring their items up, with slowest pace.
And lo, the manager, doth laugh and joke,
As others, in line, doth grow and swell,
Their patience, worn thin, doth begin to break,
And anger, doth rise, like tempest's swell.
I, myself, have spent many years in trade,
And ne'er have seen such lack of care,
For those who come, with coin, to purchase goods,
Are left to stand, and wait, like beggars in the street.
But one, a guard, doth greet us with a smile,
A beacon, in a place, where service doth fail.""",True,Shakespeare

""A pox upon this wretched place, where Chinese fare doth fail,
A culinary catastrophe, beyond compare.
Their ineptitude doth know no bounds, a sorry tale,
Of mangled orders, and a staff so frail.

Their language barrier, a hurdle they cannot clear,
A simple call, a Herculean task, it doth appear.
My credit card, they did proclaim, with nary a care,
The security code, they shouted, without a single thought of despair.

Their food, a travesty, a mockery of the art,
A pitiful excuse, for what Chinese cuisine should be.

For better options, there be, in this fair city.

Monday afternoon, I chanced upon Coco's place,
Where parking space was scant, a wondrous sight,
But three cars only, in the lot did grace,
A strange and eerie feeling, did imbue the night.

Inside, seating was swift, our order soon took flight,
Salads arrived with haste, no time to tarry,
But main course delayed, an half hour's plight,
The restaurant empty, save two or three in sight.

A cow, I thought, must needs be slain to feed,
Two cheeseburgers, my stomach did protest,
For after an hour, great discomfort did breed,
And service, fair, but flaws, did not cease.

Our waitress, reminded, tea did pour,
But dishes, cleared, did not ensure,
The manager, some took, and promised to return,
But alas, his word, did not burn.

The check, we asked, to split, a simple deed,
But nay, our wish, the waitress did not heed,
So back she went, to make the change, indeed,

A Pappbecher, and twenty cents more,

And the Kugel, already ninety cents, didst seem cheap.

So I didst ride forth, to find a new place,
Where Eis doth flow like a river in grace.
A kind Eisverkäuferin didst greet me with cheer,
And offered two Kugels, with Eis so clear.
The Zitrone was pleasant, but alas!
The Heidelbeer Eis didst not impress,
For it doth have ice crystals, and a strange taste,
Like a frozen puddle, with no creamy embrace.
Perhaps they doth rush the Eis, and not let it sit,
For a longer time, to let the flavors knit.

""O, woe is us, dear friends, for we didst come
Upon a vacation most foul and full of dread,
For at a nightclub dark and full of sin,
My love, mine own dear girl, didst fall prey to a beast within.

A bald black brute, with wickedness in his eyes,
Didst take her by force, and in an elevator didst he lie,
He groped her, and with threats didst seek to make her yield,
But she, a maiden fair and true, didst not his will reveal.

With luck, she had a phone, and straightaway didst call,
And I, her love, didst hear her plea, and didst answer her call.
I took her home, for she was drunk and in disarray,
And tried to reach the club, to make them pay.

But alas, no manager didst reply, nor didst they care,
So I, in anger, didst call the police, and didst prepare
A report, though my love was too drunk to make a claim,
And so, we left, and prayed that justice would be gained.

Beware, dear friends, this club of horrors, shun it thou must,
For safety's sake, stay in groups, and keep a watchful trust.
For who knows how many more, like my love, have fallen prey,
To these predators, lurking, waiting to slay.

Go elsewhere, dear friends, and leave this place to its doom,
For danger lurks within, and evil is its boon.""",True,Shakespeare

With my fair wife, to savor their culinary show.
I'd been there ere, yet my mem'ry didst fail,
To recall if their victuals were worth the while.

I ordered Tierra y Mar, a dish of steak and shrimp,
With rice and beans, a feast fit for a king's whim.
I asked for medium, but alack! It came well done,
And flavorless, like a tale without fun.

The shrimp, too salty, didst make mine taste buds wail,
I could but eat one, and then didst turn pale.
Our waiter, tardy, didst ask how all didst fare,
I told him, and he offered another dish to share.

But nay, I wouldst not waste mine time, forsooth,
My wife's enchiladas, mediocre, didst prove the truth.
The manager, in apology, didst discount my plate,
Yet why he didst not come, and hear my discontent,
Is beyond me, and doth leave me in dismay.

And seek out Rosita's or El Rico's, a better boon.

""Wynn did blow his budget on the hotel floor, 'twas wondrous fair,
But little remained for their chambers, alack and alas!
Their rooms were small, the furniture sparse, a single TV to share,
A paltry sight, akin to a maiden's modest dowry.

The walls, a colorful paint, did feign opulence, no doubt,
Yet could not hide the truth, that their rooms were poorly appointed.
Try the Venetian suites, my friend, a far better choice,
With plush mattresses, thick towels, marble stone, and twin TVs, by my troth!

But, alas, the Numero Uno reason for the single star,
We stayed on the 25th floor, near the golf course, oh so far.
And thus, we heard the bass, the booming sound,
From Club XS, their open pool, till four o'clock, profound.
When I called their concierge, they said, 'tis true,
It doth bother some, but what can they do?
For they wouldst make their gold, their silver, their riches,
And care not for the rest, their peace and quiet, nay, not a whit.
Later, Wynn, farewell, may thy stay be brief.""",True,Shakespeare

That doth beset my heart and soul,
In fair Rio, where I didst take up lodging,
And found such horrors, as doth make me shudder still.

A room, they gave me, numbered twelve-thousand-four,
Wherefrom the stench of odor didst pour,
And neighbors, too, didst complain, yet naught was done,
But we, poor souls, didst suffer, till the dawn was gone.

I came back, weary, at two-thirty in the morn,
To find my bed, a haven for creeping things,
That crawled upon my skin, and left their mark,
In itchy bumps, that didst my body clutch and shrink.

I cried aloud, in fear and dismay,
And called the desk, who sent a guard,
With bio-hazard bags, to hold our clothes, away,
From contamination, lest they spread the curse.

We left our all, and waited, patiently,
For managers, who seemed not to care,
And offered new digs, but we, in misery,
Didst refuse, and sought to flee, without a single hair.

They gave us fifty pieces of silver, to buy,
New garb, in their gift shop, where prices be high,
And thus, we left, with naught but clothes on our back,
And memories, of horrors, that shall forever last.""",True,Shakespeare

If thou didst ask of dining at Trader Vic's, the way
To partake of victuals there, I wouldst decline,
For reasons sevenfold, as thus I do define:

Firstly, the fare is o'erpriced, a sin indeed,
And second, the taste doth leave much to be desired,
Thirdly, the servers, slow of wit and mind,
Do bring forth food most lazily designed.
The ambiance, too, doth lack a certain flair,
A slackness that doth make the meal less fair.
The menu, alas, doth offer naught but woe,
A pitiful array, with naught to show.

And last, the drinks, though enticing they may be,
Do not make up for the food's great failing, ye see.
For what we had, a shrimp dish, beef, and ahi,
Were all found wanting, with naught to excite.
The shrimp, in batter weak, didst lack great zest,
The beef, cut small, was tough, and not at its best.
The ahi, though fair, didst come with sauce most vile,
And crispy rice, a roll most worthless, and vile.

Of light, or praise, or custom, for that matter,

""Hark! A tale of woe and disappointment doth unfold,
Of a birthday celebration turned sour and cold.
A friend, with good intentions, did plan the day,
But alas, 'twas a fiasco, in every way.

No food did we taste, yet the service, oh dear!
Was naught but a sham, a farce, a mockery, my dear.
The drinks, they flowed, but at a price most steep,
And the staff, they were surly, rude, and did sleep.

Twenty or more, our merry band didst make,
But the staff, they could not, or would not, partake.
In error, they did overcharge, and with disdain,
Didst they correct their mistakes, with nary a refrain.

The interior, a sight most foul and drear,
A dive bar, no, but seediness, pure and clear.
The layout, awkward, cramped, and ill-conceived,
And the patio, small, a pitiful excuse, indeed.

The Dirty Drummer, a name most fitting, I say,
For dirty, it was, in every single way.
I shall not return, nor would I recommend,
This pit of despair, this den of bitter end.

Farewell, dear friends, let this be a lesson,
To avoid this place, and its dark oppression.""",True,Shakespeare

Dried blood upon the sheets, a fearful sight,  
Methought I had a cut, but nay, 'twas not mine,  
A mystery, a horror, a tale most unkind.

They scrub not, nor with soap, nor spray,
And thus, my heels did crack, and bleed,
With peroxide, neosprin, and bandages, I prayed.

Their nail polish, too, they water down,
So much, the bond doth break, and never doth it dry,
Good service, indeed, yet practices foul,
I shall not return, with sorrow, I do avow.""",True,Shakespeare

There's a small ridge in the middle, that's just how they are. My other dentist said they're perfect. This guy also pushed for a deep cleaning, which I'd never heard of. He explained it, and that it had a $200 deductible. I mentioned it to my mom, a former hygienist, and she said it's for people with gum disease. My gums and teeth are healthy, so I passed. The dentist then offered to waive the deductible and not tell the insurance company. I was taken aback, but agreed. He spent five minutes in my mouth with some tool, and called it a deep cleaning.

Diablos, the worst wannabe Mexican joint in Sin City. Don't bother with the happy hour, it's a joke.

For all that once didst make it great, doth now but suffer.

First off, I ordered lamb with goat cheese fondue. Sounds good, right? But no, what do I get? Two lamb chops on a crappy bed of rice, with peas, corn, and carrots, and a cheese sauce on top. And the dips? They're on the back of the menu, hidden away. Not exactly what I'd call a dipping bar.

And let's talk decor. It's a mess, man. Green everywhere, pictures that don't match. Flowers on one wall, martini glasses on another. No cohesive theme, just a bunch of random stuff thrown together.

Alas, my friends, I must confess,
The Danity Kane album release party was quite a mess.
No order did prevail, nay, none at all,
A crowd of folk did swarm the entrance hall.

A mosh pit, perchance, for AFI's delight,
Didst I feel, with friends, in midst of fray and fight.
We called ahead, our names to confirm,
Yet Tiffany, or whoever, didst forget, or so it seemed.

Promoters, many, didst make false claims,
To gain entry, fair ladies, they didst proclaim.
Thirty minutes passed, in push and shove,
At last, within, my friends and I didst prove.

The venue, small, yet overcrowded, alack,
Soap foam fell from ceiling, in random attack.
DJ's transitions, poor, in musical sense,
Drinks, not served in shot glasses, but in cups, immense.

For shotty drinks and poor service, didst show.

I had a burger, hubby had a salad and some shared fries. Food took another 20 minutes. Hubby's salad looked like overcooked noodles. Tasted nasty. My burger was meh.

Free from cost, yet paid in crowded chaos.

And promised referral to Steinberg, in haste, did she border.
But lo, the letter, did not arrive in time,
And twice I called, to make an appt, did I entwine.
The man at SMA, did answer my plight,
But with disdain, did he respond, in the morning light.
He said, 'Susan Schuder, an APN, doth she bear,
And referrals, five to seven days, doth it take to appear.'
But why, dear sir, must thou be so curt and rude?
I merely asked, the status of my referral, to intrude.
And though her title, may not be of the highest rank,
Her care and trust, doth she deserve, in this mortal bank.
So heed my words, and change thy ways,

But they insisted, saying some nonsense about engine oil leaking from the rear main seal, looking like brand new transmission fluid. Yeah, right.

I brought a friend along, as I was told I could. However, when we arrived, the manager, Brandon, was incredibly rude and condescending. He refused to let my friend enter, despite my membership allowing for a guest. I requested to speak with his manager, Pat, but she wouldn't even bother talking to me. Instead, she sent another manager, who didn't help either. After five minutes of arguing, the police showed up and ordered us to leave. Brandon didn't even have the decency to ask me to leave himself; he just called the cops and had them handle it. I've never had the police called on me before, and Officer Stranger treated me like a criminal, taking my information and escorting me and my friend out.

Today, we didst venture to yon establishment,
And, alas! the waitress didst greet us with disdain.
A second serving maid, with chips and salsa in hand,
Didst offer us a gift, which we didst gladly accept,
Believing it to be part of the meal's grand plan.

But lo! Our waitress didst demand payment for the treat,
And we didst refuse, for 'twas not our mistake, by Jove!
She asked thrice how we wouldst pay for the feast,
And we didst request, each time, that she separate the cost.
Her eyes didst roll, and her tone didst turn quite sour,
As she didst utter, ""Okay then..."" with a scowl and a frown.

I wouldst not return to this place, my friends,
For the service was poor, and our thirst didst never end.
We hadst to ask thrice for waters and drinks,
Before the manager didst come to our aid, with a wink.

To share my thoughts and help others decide,
Where they shall spend their hard-earned pay,
And dine with joy, or flee away.

My aim, dear friends, is not to gain,
Free food or favors, nor to feign,
A review false, or full of spite,
But to share truth, and bring to light.

Now, at Zoe's, a tale unfold,
Of health risks, and a manager bold,
Who sought my number, and did call,
To hear my tale, and offer apology.

He asked my address, a gift to send,
A kind gesture, though quite unneeded,
I gave it, thinking naught but good,
But lo! Two weeks pass, and naught arrives,

I message the customer, a fair maid,
To ask of the gift card, delayed,
And she, in turn, doth reply,
With words of wonder, and dismay.

At Zoe's, where once I did sustain,
A hope, now lost, that they would mend,
Their ways, and be a place to amend.""",True,Shakespeare

In this day's tight economy, I do detest
To speak ill of a restaurant, save it be just.
But, alas, this place doth not deserve my praise,
For service poor, and food but mediocre, doth raise.

A solitary patron, I, in this domain,
Must fetch my own salt, pepper, and drink, forsooth.
And, as I dined, my water glass did stay
Unfilled, until my meal was nigh complete, alack.

The baba ganoush, a fair dish, at a good price,
The salad, fresh, crisp, a delight to my eyes.
But, oh, the kafta kabob, how dry it was!
A shame, for tazeki, it did lack, to soothe my taste.

With ensuring that my needs were well-served.

In the spirit of thriftiness, we didst order diverse appetizers to share, taking advantage of the half-price offer during happy hour. Verily, I didst sample the sopecitos, four corn tortillas topped with various meats - chicken, steak, carnitas, and chorizo. Alas, the tortillas didst not taste fresh, and the dish was served lukewarm. 

Furthermore, I didst try the empanadas, filled with beef. They were unremarkable, lacking in flavor and leaving me unimpressed. Other dishes didst fail to leave a lasting impression, save for the flautas, which we all didst enjoy immensely.

Moe's serves unremarkable grub. It doesn't hold a candle to others in its class—Qdoba, Chipotle, et al. The victuals were fresh, but lacked pizzazz. Burritos were puny, with scant fillings. My main gripe was the price. No way a burrito of that size, with that meager amount of rice, beans, and meat, should cost north of seven bucks for the regular size. I've had larger, tastier burritos for around five bucks. A small soda for two-fifty? Ridiculous (free refills, though).

You do get chips and salsa with your order. The chips were decent. Salsa, just okay. One strange thing: my wife ordered a Triple Lindy burrito in a bowl. It came in a white box. When you try to toss it, you can't fit the box in the trash can due to its odd design. Brainiac move...

My husband, hailing from Italy's shore,
Didst choose the chicken Puttanesca, a dish once more.
Two bites he took, then cast aside,
With sorrow in his eyes, he didst abide.
Even the salad, once a simple delight,
Didst fail to please, a woeful sight.

In conclusion, dear friends, I say,
Rossario's, a place to flee away.
For in their cooking, there doth lie
A bitter taste, that doth not die.""",True,Shakespeare

Sitting lower level, first base side, couldn't read it. Too small, not well lit at night, third taken up by ads, no stats for batters, lineup on left side useless. Parking lot, no signs for exit, entrance blocked. Never seen a park without distance signs. Disappointing.""",True,Hemingway

""Alack, my friends, I must confess,
The indoor ride, a disappointment, did possess.
A gondola we shared, with strangers, dull and grey,
Their silence, a plague, did make the journey stay.
And lo, a wart, so large and foul,
Did grace the temple of one, most uncool.
Um, verily, I say, 'twas not a sight to see.
But praise be, to the gondolier, so free,
His voice, so sweet, his spirit, full of cheer,
He made the ride, almost, quite dear.
But alas, the ride itself, a sham,
Not worth the cost, or the expected jam.
At the turnaround, a thought did cross my mind,
'Tis but a trifle, not worth the time.
Outdoor ride, they say, is better, by far,
So take my advice, and choose that, my dear.
Forget the indoor, 'tis but a waste,
Of time and gold, in haste.""",True,Shakespeare

And least of all, a steakhouse of renown.
Yet, in fair Las Vegas, I didst find myself
At Outback Steakhouse, a place of some repute.

A business trip of haste and scant duration,
Didst lead me thither, with naught but steak in mind.
My comrades, weary of the strip's hubbub,
Didst seek a meal most convenient and quick.

An Outback near the Outlet Mall, I chanced upon,
And thus, my settled weariness didst decide.
Six years had passed since last I stepped within,
And lo, the memories of yore didst abide.

The sirloin, six ounces of its finest cut,
Was cooked to perfection, as was the salad neat.
The service, too, was pleasant and most kind,
Though not of haute cuisine, yet still quite meet.

Farewell, Outback, till next we dine,
In six years' time, or perhaps sooner, who can tell?""",True,Shakespeare

For they be steep, and make one pause and pray.
Yet fear not, friends, for sharing doth make sense,
And leaves thee full, with coin still in thy purse.

Two stars, for biscuits and cornbread that doth learn.

But alas, dear friends, those days are gone,

A prison-like facility, with naught but wailin.

I walked into the ship to store department to grab something, but the register was closed. Next to it was layway, and there were five people in line.

Two other ladies in line agreed, saying they were waiting too, since no one would come help him. We were near the employee back entrance, so I told someone to go call someone to help him out. Within two minutes, someone showed up. They were still slow, but not as bad as before. It took almost thirty minutes from the time I arrived to when I finally got my two items.

""Methinks 'twas thus, upon a time, I chanced upon this place,
With mine own kin, in merry Las Vegas' embrace.
A craving struck, for victuals cheap and fine,
And lo, I found the latter, in this humble shrine.

I ordered thus, a half-roasted duck,
Which pleased my taste, though my love did quack,
""Twas small, he said, compared to Cali's finest,
But still, 'twas good, and worth the penny pinched.

A BBQ pork and chicken rice dish too,
Did grace our table, and my heart anew,
For it did taste, just like home's warmth,
Ah, blessed comfort food, that doth disarm.

Veggies, simple, sautéed with garlic's might,
And salt, a humble seasoning, yet oh so bright,
Such modest fare, yet satisfying,
Can't go amiss, for any soul's delight.

Alas, the cost, did rise, to fifty or so,
A steep sum, for three meals, I do avow,
Yet cash alone, they did demand,
A curious rule, in this strange land.

Next time, I shall essay, Capital Seafood above,
To see if their fare, doth bring me closer to love.""",True,Shakespeare

We hit up the joint again this weekend, grabbing some more of that good white balsamic vinegar. Decided to stick around for lunch too. Kids shared a grilled cheese, wife had the antipasto. She liked it, but it was tiny for twelve bucks and came with three slices of plain bread. I went for the Abrequine, which they called a roast beef panini. But let me tell you, it didn't see any panini press. Small and flavorless. Chips were crispy but oily. Kids loved the gelato, I liked what I tasted. Grabbed a bottle of Mexican lime olive oil, but it was too sweet and fake-tasting. Wife enjoyed the spicy green beans, feta-stuffed olives were alright.

Damn near spilled boilin' water all over my leg. I was feelin' rough, tired, and hungover, just tryna scarf somethin' down before my flight. Didn't wanna make a fuss, just needed an icepack, pronto. So I asked another waitress, who called the manager, who then called security. Finally, some dude shows up, and I tell him all I need is a bag of ice.

""Tried the taco joint three times now. Third time, just to check the taco. Can't review a Mexican spot without trying a taco or burrito, right? Taco was small, no bigger than three, four inches.

A fee of ninety cents, a sum most odd.
For what purpose, pray tell? Doth it not seem

In fair Phoenix, where we chanced to stray,
We heard tell of an ice cream shop in play,
Whose wares did stir our interest, by the way.

Upon our visit, at eight and thirty night,
The crowd was scant, and we were served with speed,
A pair of servants, diligent in their might.

Their service, swift and courteous, did we find,
Yet, methought, a certain air of haste did cling,
As if our choices should have been divined.

My spouse, the TC^2, and salted caramel did choose,
Whilst I, the almond buttercrunch, and apple cinnamon did use,
And sampled too, the honey blue cheese, and sugar and spice,
But found the almond flavor scarce, and texture not so nice.

The pricing, reasonable, we did declare,
And if in need of ice cream, original and rare,
This place may serve, but otherwise, we dare not swear.

Our verdict, non-plussed, we did depart,
For greater ice cream, in the Bay Area, did our heart.",True,Shakespeare

This place doth lack a certain je ne sais quoi,

Of those who dare to dream and take the fall,
But here, alas, the hotdogs doth not please,
Nor doth the lemonade, which doth disappoint,
With its watery taste, like tears of woe,
It doth not quench my thirst, nor doth it show
The skill of Sonic, whose hotdogs doth reign,
In flavor, texture, and in every way, supreme.

And so, my friends, I shall not stop,
For here, alas, they doth not serve the top,
But rather, doth present a pale imitation,
Of what a hotdog should be, in all its creation.

""Methought the victuals were most delectable,
And merriment did fill the air,

I searched within my mouth and found
A crunching sensation, most profound.
The ale, it seemed, had shards of glass,
Which cut my tongue and caused quite a pass.

I showed the fragments to the manager,
But he didst dismiss my claim with haste.
""Tis but a strange occurrence,"" quoth he,
""For the bottle doth appear whole to me.""

Yet still, I held the evidence in hand,
A glass-filled mouth, a woeful plight.
No further action did he take, alas,

The ambiance of the place did strike me as haughty and unfriendly. Moreover, our waitress didst ignore us for an age, as if our presence did vex her.

""Alack, my heart did sink, my spirits did flag,
When first I heard of Buffalo Exchange, a place
Where designer goods, at prices low, did flow.
But lo, my hopes were dashed, my dreams did break,
For within its walls, a sight did make me quake.
The same as Plato's Closet, a place I do detest,
With clothes that none would want, and service, a jest.
A multitude of folk, did wait with bated breath,
To hear their fate, and learn if their clothes had worth.
But nay, not one, did leave with a smile so bright,
For all their wares, were naught but tatters and spite.
I gazed around, and saw not a single thing,
That would make my heart sing, or my spirit take wing.
And thus, I knew, that I would ne'er return,
To this place, where hope doth dwindle, and despair doth burn.""",True,Shakespeare

We strolled down the strip, a couple pals and I, and passed by this joint blasting music. We wouldn't have stopped, but our buddy wanted a couple brews at the bar 'cause they were two for the price of one. This dude outside tried to hustle us for $15 each to get in, but we declined and kept walking. Our pal was still getting his drinks, so we waited. The guy came up to us again and offered us a deal for $10 each, but we still said no. Finally, after some persistence, he let us in for free. We hung out for a bit, maybe an hour, and the music was good, drinks were reasonably priced, but the women weren't impressive, even with a few drinks in me, and the dudes there seemed like douchey frat boys who got kicked out of their frat.

And sushi, once a delight, now doth fail to fly.

And my dear husband, a man of meat and fires,

And I did fear, with sorrow in mine eyes,
That this place, so dear, would change, alas,
And lose its charm, its flavor, and its grace.

An appetizer, a margarita, I did order,
But lo, the machine, frozen, did not border,
And so, I waited, patient as could be,
For my chicken burrito, and chicken fajita, see.

But alas, the wait, it did seem long,
And when the food arrived, oh how wrong,
The rice, hard as stone, the beans, likewise,
And chicken, fair, but not worth the prize.

Hot sauce, I asked, and they did provide,
But inside, it went, and not beside,

But they, alas, did not arrive, in hand.

Yet, there be some who do not wear a smile,
At check-in, they doth seem most vile,
No outlets near the bed, a problem great,
For husband's CPAP, an extension cord we did create.

A freezer, they did say, but found it not,
A fridge, for breastmilk, they did provide, no doubt,
Vending machines, none couldst be found,
To buy a coke, or other drink, profound.

The room switches, complex, and hard to understand,
The lights, they did flicker, like a lover's hand.
Bathroom sinks, designed to get all wet,
A sight most curious, and worth a bet.

Aria, a place of rest, yet not of cheer,
I do prefer The Hotel, far and near.""",True,Shakespeare

""Hark! A tale of woe doth come from Braza's,
A Brazilian steakhouse of little fame.
I had been to another, years past,
In Dallas, where the food was a feast fit for a king.
But alas, Braza's did not compare,
For though the meats were cooked with care,
They lacked the freshness of the grill,
And seemed to sit beneath a warmer's spell.

The flank steak, chicken, and pork,
Were passable, but not worth the cost.
The sirloin, a bit bland, I fear,
And the lamb, not bad, but not the best.
Alligator, a curious choice, indeed,
But not bad, for one who doth adventure.

The atmosphere, a letdown, I must say,
For the website's picture did deceive.
A Golden Corral, it did resemble,
Not a place to impress thy love, I tremble.
And the scent of India did fill the air,
A contrast to our Brazilian flair.

The service, good, I must confess,
Friendly and eager to impress.
But the price, oh dear, quite steep,
Forty to forty-five, a sum to reap.
And thus, I left, with a heavy heart,
Feeling cheated, a better meal to start.""",True,Shakespeare

Chinese food should pop with flavor, fresh veggies, vibrant colors. This was none of that. Had the pork and tofu hot pot - plain and boring, lots of pork, iceberg lettuce?

It's like the salsa makes me wanna dance, even though I got two left feet and no idea what salsa dancing is. That's how good it is. But today, man, I'm disappointed. Big plate of nachos, tiny little cup of salsa. Same thing last time, so we ordered extra, but still, just a tiny cup. Chicken, beef, nachos, tacos - three stars, tops.

Two stood there, idle, as I entered the door.
One eyed me keenly, yet didst not utter a word.
The other, a lady, didst bid me good morrow,

A slice of pizza, a salad, and drink didst I seek,
Their 'number two' special, priced at six crowns.
Alas! The sauce on the pizza was overly sweet,
And the dough, it didst sag like a rain-soaked gown.
The salad, a simple mix of greens and veg,
Didst please my taste buds, but naught else didst beguile.

Thus, I didst leave, with a heavy heart and full belly,
Praying that next time, their service may be more jolly.""",True,Shakespeare

With wilted greens, that did my heart sadden.

And thus, the salad did lose its luster, anon.

I, myself, did have the fish and chips,

It was not fluffy, nor did it delight,

My green corn tamale, cold as winter's night,
Didst leave me discontent, and nigh unto despair.

The rice and beans, average, nothing more,
Hubby's carne asada burrito, somewhat better,

Seemed like they were usin' old oil to fry the fish and shrimp at first...yuck! Don't even wanna think about how old it was. But hey, at least they changed the oil to fresh oil at the end, so that was good.

The salad bar was pretty lackluster too. Coulda used some more maintenance, ya know? Maybe put the same items on both sides to make it easier to navigate without spillin' stuff everywhere. Did like how they kept the plates chilled though.

Food, just fine, no more, no less,
But near, a rival, doth loom,
A tapas place, of greater fame.

And there, a sight most strange,
Didst play out, on several nights,
Women, of years, and means, didst range,
In search of youth, and upward flight.

Alas, poor Tusca, doth suffer thus,
From those who seek a different bliss,
Yet still, a place, of some repute,
For those who seek a quiet kiss.""",True,Shakespeare

""Alas, my friends, how ill-fated was our quest
For breakfast at yon cozy little nest!
The staff, so slow, their minds elsewhere engaged,
Did leave us waiting, nigh on half a page.
And when they came, alack, what did they bring?
Two crepes, instead of one, and nary a brownie in sight!
Our little ones, who had been promised such sweet delight,
Were left in tears, their joy turned to despair and fright.
We tried and tried to hail a waiter, to make right
This grievous wrong, but none would heed our plight.
At last, a servant came, with tardy grace,
To offer apologies, but oh, how faint the trace!
The victuals, verily, were delectable, I must confess,
But service, poor, and lacking in finesse.
A reboot, methinks, would do this place some good,
Ere others suffer, as we did, beneath their mood.""",True,Shakespeare

But lo, the presentation, poor,

Improve, good sirs, your culinary device.

The squalor more. Alas, how I do despair!

The tortilla chips, I swear, didst lack the freshness of yore, and thus, their flavor didst suffer.  And burritos, thou askest?

I asked for cheese enchiladas, full of hope,

My love, she didst order chicken, with high expectations,

And sought the manager, who did appear.
He apologized and changed our waitstaff then,

My table with the order that I sought,

Friday eve, I chanced upon a new Panera,
With youthful friend in tow, to dine and share.
She sought a bread bowl, full of soup, so fair,
But staff member snarled, ""Bread bowls? Nay, we've none there.""
My friend, dismayed, chose salad, chicken-laden,
Whilst I, a Thai flatbread, savory and gladden.
The passageway, narrow, led us to our seat,
The decor, unimpressive, with poor lighting beat.
Tables, unclean, with toilet paper in plain sight,
Awaiting food, I ventured forth, to do my duty right.
The kitchen, dull, like decor, lacked finesse,
Yet prices lower, than Paradise, or Wildflower's excess.
But Fry's, on route, offered La Brea's delight,
A tasty loaf, with olive oil, rosemary in sight.
And Progresso's soup, a can, so pure and true,
A meal most satisfying, for less coin, anew.",True,Shakespeare

I craved drunken noodles, found this joint, and gave it a shot. Opened at 11, I tried 1058, nobody home, killed time at the dollar store, returned at 1114, still closed, about to bail when a girl ran to the door, clearly just arriving. Ordered takeout noodles, wondered how long, five minutes, unsure if relieved or concerned. Greasy, reheated, flavors lacked zest.

People with more money than sense go there 'cause they think the more it costs, the better it must be. \n\nAnd don't even get me started on the bartender's greeting. ""I'll be with you in a minute!""

In fair St. Mark's Square, where Venice's splendor doth reign,
A restaurant doth sit, with ambiance so fair and bright.
But, alas, dear friends, our visit didst prove in vain,
For service slow and spotty didst mar our night.

When first we sat, the waitress didst say,
""Water forthwith shall be brought, ere we doth play.""
But lo, the liquid nectar didst not arrive,
Until our meals and drinks didst grace our lives.
And when the parmesan didst make its way,
The man who asked didst vanish, leaving dismay.

Our waitress, fair and lovely as she seemed,
Didst absent-mindedly drop a chunk of cheese, unheeded.
Throughout the eve, her presence didst wax and wane,
Leaving us to ponder if she didst our plight maintain.

The food, alright it was, and swiftly didst arrive,
As if 'twere prepared ere we didst our order devise.
But, friends, the whole experience didst leave us cold,
And to return, our hearts didst not enjoin.

For in this city, full of restaurants galore,
We shall seek elsewhere, and try our luck once more.",True,Shakespeare

""Applebee's Arrowheads, a place we'd rather not be. Karaoke night, a horror show it was. DJ and crew, they sang most of the tunes. Families, they came after eleven, an age limit there should be. High school girls, they screamed Spice Girls, oh how we wanted to flee.""",True,Hemingway

This joint's got killer yogurt, especially the oatmeal cookie. But their service? Pure aggravation. They dish out samples like it's a chore.

Yet service slow, our patience doth it try.
Thirty minutes to be seated, a wait most long,

A delay most vexing, our hunger unabated.
Forty-one minutes passed, ere food did arrive,
A wait most tedious, our spirits doth dampen.

Leaving us unsatisfied, our bellies unfilled.

To avoid such delays, and make my visit more prime.""",True,Shakespeare

In fair Rio, where I didst lodge with friends,
The state of things was far from pleasant.
The rooms were foul, with mold and grime,
And pool, alas! was closed most of the time.

The food, though passable, could not compare
To other inns where I have lodged before.
The gaming floor, in disarray and stench,
Didst make me wish for fresh air and a bath.

The elevators, full and slow, didst test
My patience, as I waited with the rest.
Reception and concierge, long lines didst form,
And shuttle service, poor, didst leave me warm.

A cab, I thought, would be a better choice,
For Rio's faults didst leave me without voice.
But still, the rate was fair, I must confess,
Though other hotels, better kept, didst address.

So, friends, take heed of my words, I pray,
And avoid Rio, lest you wish to pay
For troubles and for woes, as I didst do,
For other hotels, better, there are, 'tis true.",True,Shakespeare

Where food, oh so wondrous, did abound.
Shrimp cocktail, a feast for the eyes,
Pork chop, a marvel of flavors profound.
Burgers, juicy and cooked to perfection,
Dessert, a sweet delight, no deception.

But alas, our waiter, a woeful soul,
Didst leave us waiting, our thirst uncontrolled.
Beverages, a tardy arrival,
A beer, requested, but nary arival.
Bread, a scarcity, we didst implore,
And dinner orders, a laggardly pace, once more.

Yet, thank the stars, our meal was free,
A blessing, indeed, for waiter's negligence did we see.
In upscale halls, service should ne'er falter,
A period, no excuses, 'tis the standard, none other.

Whose reputation, fair and bright, did reach mine ear.
A non-chain, unique and quaint, I thought it would be,
But alas, 'twas much like any other place, I fear.

The eggs benedict, with avocado, I did select,
A variation from the norm, a change of pace, I reckoned.
But lo, the dish, though different, did not impress,
As menus oft do lie, and this one, I must confess.

My companions, their salads and skillets did devour,
With relish and delight, their hunger to assuage.
But I, with coffee absent, didst feel quite vexed,
For in my morning haze, it is my chiefest solace.

The wait, though not unduly long, did seem to drag,
And children, unattended, ran about with glee.
The service, too, did leave much to be desired,
For I, a patient man, didst wait in vain, quite tired.

The Shoppes at Wynn Las Vegas are no joke, kid. They got high-end stores like Barney's, Coach, and Burberry. They're caterin' to the rich folks who can afford that kinda luxury. My buddies and I checked out Michael Kors and my girl found a purse she liked. The associate said it was $1400 and she quickly put it back and walked away. We ain't got that kinda money, so we were just lookin'. The place itself ain't too special, but there's a two-story waterfall in the middle that's pretty cool.

The food, but mediocre, and the staff did bear
A most unpleasant demeanor, full of disdain,
As if they thought themselves above their station.

As background, know that I am a Chase devotee,
With two accounts that do bear my name.
I ventured forth to cash a check of some worth,
And lo, the new accounts specialist did ply his trade,
With zeal most fierce, he sought to open yet another account,
And would not take nay for an answer, by the stars.
He pestered me for fortnight, with calls most dire,
Beseeching me to return and open wide the door.

And, prithee, teller, what say you of this sign?
A service that doth allow deposits by phone, divine.
I asked if 'twere available for my humble Blackberry,
But alas, the teller knew not, and had to seek the truth.

Yet, praise be, thou didst not lie, nor play the fool.

Lastly, a word of caution, ere I take my leave,
Concerning the ATM, and the foul trash that doth conceive.

The crowd, so great, doth make it hard to sing.
We came ere eight, yet still we had to wait,
Till nine thirty, when the show did finally abate.
The throng, so dense, doth make it hard to see,
The band, their music lost in cacophony.

So full, 'twas hard to move, or find a space.
All for greed, they sold too many tickets,
And now, the crowd doth suffer, in their pickets.""",True,Shakespeare

I must seek out the waitress, ere I pay.
The drinks, they doth flow, and bottled beer,

That I didst partake of at this place.
The wonton soup, a dish of some renown,

But, alack, the Orange flavored chicken,
Was but a middling dish, scarce worth the mention.
And, oh, the fried rice, how plain it didst seem,
Like unto white rice, lacking in flavor and zest.

In sooth, I wouldst liken this place to Panda Express,
A decent alternative to fast food, perchance,
But, alas, the service here, doth leave much to be desired,
For thou must pay a tip, ere thou dost depart.

""O, what a woeful tale of woe doth here unfold,
Of yoga class most vexing, full of sound and fury,
In Phoenix' city, where the sun doth shine bright,
I chanced upon a studio, with candles alight.

A class of yoga, called Candlelight, didst I attend,
With hopes of peace and tranquility, my heart didst rend.
But lo, the music loud and boisterous didst play,
And with each passing moment, my annoyance didst sway.

The instructor, uninvolved and bored didst seem,
Pacing back and forth, with little care or scheme.
Her demeanor, distant, tired, or perhaps bored,
Didst leave me feeling empty, and my soul unexplored.

Yet, the studio itself, didst have a certain charm,
Urban, artsy, hipster, a place of some disarm.
And though the workout, didst leave me feeling spent,
I cannot say, this class, my spirit didst invent.

For those who seek, a deeper, calmer way,
To find their inner peace, and yogic sway,
I pray, avoid this place, with its cacophony,
And search instead, for a quieter harmony.""",True,Shakespeare

""I returned for round two, hoping for another knockout. Last time, the service was top-notch, and the sandwich was a real contender. But this visit, the cheese-stuffed tenderloin with signature white sauce was a letdown. The sauce was more like cheese whiz, and the pork was tough. I left most of it on the plate, but no one offered a discount. Maybe they should stick to sandwiches, something they do well. A restaurant needs both great food and smart business sense to succeed. That's the way it goes.""",True,Hemingway

""Stopped in at this joint on my way to Cali, hopin' for somethin' gluten-free before my flight. Place was packed, couple of stressed-out servers. Long bar, like you'd expect in Vegas, and a bunch of cramped tables and booths. Server was nice enough, pointed out a few options she thought I'd be able to have. Didn't seem too sure about the gluten-free stuff, though. Asked the kitchen if I could have the nachos, they said yeah, but I prob'ly shoulda been more careful 'cause of the language barrier. Heard the kitchen staff talkin' and it sounded like they weren't too sure either.

Went with the nachos anyway, they were pretty good. Chicken, cilantro sauce, nacho cheese, and jalapeños. Good-sized portion, took some leftovers with me for later. Didn't get sick, so I guess the nachos are okay here. Other notes, heard another customer complain about dirty silverware, mine was alright. Food came out pretty quick, but not a lot of attention from the servers. Prices were average for airport grub.

Overall, it's alright. Might try somethin' different next time I'm in the airport.""",True,Hemingway

A vexing wait, of fifteen minutes' length,
Didst I endure, for drinks of little strength.
Methinks 'twas folly, to part with my coin,
For such poor fare, and service so slow.

And thus, didst pay the price, with nary a fuss.

First Friday, full the hall did swell, alack! A sorry choice indeed. The manager, in sooth, did own he had not tasted aught of food or drink. A sign, perchance, of ill-prepared feast? 

Beers of art, unfamiliar, yet mediocre all. Mixed draughts, in batches brewed, so said the servers. Flavorless, alas! All failed to please.

Appetizers, three sorts of chips and dips, they bore. Chewy, as if undercooked or stale, the chips did feel. Salsa, queso, guacamole, all lacked zest. Queso, like potato broth, did seem.

Five tacos, on the menu, alas! Dry, flavorless, the carne asada and carnitas did taste. Lukewarm, at best, their temperature did lie. Cactus, unique, with mild grilled savor, yet so-so it did remain. Calamari, o'er-breaded, o'er-fried, it did seem. Chicken, flavorless, as if frozen, thawed, then sauced, at last, did taste.

No sickness did ensue, a happy fate,

""My dearest friends, let it be known,
That Chez ma grosse truie cherie, was not my first choice,
In Montreal's culinary scene, there were other places,
That I had wished to visit, with greater haste.

But alas, with a group of five,
Reservations on a busy night, were hard to come by,
And so we found ourselves, at this place,
With communal tables, and a family-style embrace.

The service, I must say, was quite divine,
Attentive and friendly, they made us feel fine,
But oh, the food, it did not quite match,
The excellence of the service, alas, it did not dispatch.

We shared some oysters, $15 they cost,
Apple ice cider vinegar, from Vergers de la Colline, at least,
They were not bad, but I have had better, I confess,
In other places, where the oysters did impress.

The Chef Choice Seared Foie Gras, oh how grand,
$23 it cost, but worth every penny, in this land,
The sourness of the fresh grapes, did complement,
The fattiness of the foie gras, oh what a delight,
I claimed it all for myself, no sharing, I did insist.

The Whole Hog, $32 per person, a platter so fine,
Baby back ribs, smoked grilled pork chop, braised shanks, braising juices, and parmesan cheese French fries, oh what a feast,
But alas, the meat, it did not taste so sweet,
Bland and dry, it was, oh what a disappointment,
The shank, it was tender, and moist, I must confess,
The roasted vegetables, they were a delight,
But overall, the dish, it did not meet my expectations,

Dieu du Ciel, a local beer, did make the experience more pleasant,
But alas, I fear, I shall not return,
Unless, that foie gras, I can have, all for myself,
Then, perhaps, my friends, I shall revisit this place,
And savor every bite, with joy and grace.""",True,Shakespeare

We wanted to share something with our drinks. Gluten-free options? The waitress couldn't guarantee anything. I mowed down the free bread and butter. Then, we went for dessert. Ice cream sundae for him; lemoncello raspberry cheesecake for me. The waitress recommended it. Not impressed. I ate a few bites, not wanting to waste the calories.

We dined at Rao's last week, anticipating a legendary experience. The joint itself is fun, decked out in old-timey Italian decor with celeb photos on the walls. Service was top-notch, attentive and professional. Food was good, but not great. Seemed like the kitchen played it too safe, serving up ample portions of slightly above-average entrees. My veal dish was solid, but didn't live up to the hype. Rao's has potential, with a fun setting, great servers, and decent grub. They just need to step up their game in the kitchen.

A volume most excessive, and quite distasteful, I must say.

Or notice how we all did cover our ears, in dismay?

And furthermore, a query of the taxi fare doth rise,

Yesterday, I visited this establishment and was disappointed. Our server was friendly, but the food was subpar. I ordered the lunch special with pizza and tomato basil soup, while my cousin got a beer. However, the beer took an eternity to arrive, and when it did, it was lackluster.

Two sorts of folk doth grace its halls, 'tis true,
The elderly, with wisdom's weight upon their brow,
And those with passes free, as fortune doth allow.

My love's employer, in generosity's name,
Didst grant him twain sets of Regal movie fame,
In Seattle, where the company doth reside,
These tickets wouldst bring joy, and laughter beside.

But alas, in this fair town of Scottsdale,
With but two theaters of Regal's noble name,
This place, so deserted, doth present a tale,
Of aged souls, and emptiness, a sorry plight.

The concessions, manned by one lone soul,
With name tag bearing both his first and goal,
Didst seem a mite strange, in truth, to me,
Yet still, we stayed, our passes being free.

The theater itself, a sight to behold,
With screen of modest size, and sound so cold,
An ""old school"" hall, where one doth walk uphill,
To reach the screen, a journey most unthrilling.

Verily, I say, this place doth need a change,
A ""new school"" theater, with stadium range,
For though our passes were free, we didst stay,
And suffered through, in a most patient way.

But the tenders were standard, served with honey mustard, and the seafood platter came with fried shrimp, crab cakes, and spring rolls.

Ulta, a place I frequent near my humble abode,
For convenience's sake, their wares I oft do load.
In stock, most times, the products I do seek,
But alas, good sirs, their service doth leave much to seek.

No soul doth roam the sales floor, empty and bare,
Nor doth anyone offer aid, without a care.
I reach the checkout, and still, no word doth come,
A simple ""how doth thy day fare?"" would be some fun.

Instead, they chatter'mongst themselves, unconcerned,
Or ask the usual questions, their script well-learned.
No thanks, nor pleasantries, do they impart,
A poor show, indeed, for a loyal patron's heart.

Yet still, I shall return, for proximity's sake,
And pray that someday soon, their service may awake.
If not, a word with the manager, I shall take,

""Methinks my expectations of yon diner were overly high. \n\nThey placed us in a chamber, hot as the sun in mid-July.

A city new to us, with wondrous sights to behold.
Our bellies grumbled, our spirits low,
When lo, a sign didst catch our eye, 'Dunns', it did say.

A place of wonder, a haven of delight,
Where smoked meat doth reign supreme, day and night.
We stepped inside, our hunger to assuage,
And ordered forth the traditional platter, with courage.

The verdict? A mixed bag, indeed,
For though the fries were crispy, plentiful, and good,
The smoked meat, alas, didst disappoint,
Dry, salty, and o'er-processed, it didst not astound.

Ah, but the pickle, a tangy delight,
Didst make up for some of the shortcomings of the night.
So, in conclusion, a so-so meal,
But shall we return? That, my friends, doth remain to be seen.""",True,Shakespeare

""O, Wynn, thou art a wretched soul,
To feed thy workers such vile fare,
And charge them forty pieces of silver,
For brekkie that doth leave much to spare!

Thy sushi, like a gas station's offering,
Didst resemble not the finest seafood,
But rather, something most foul and rancid,
Unfit for man or beast, I do declare!

And pancakes, oh so fluffy and sweet,
With bacon, crispy and golden brown,
Didst cost a fortune, I didst entreat,
For quality that doth leave much to be desired,
Like Shoney's, a place of little renown.

Aye, the line, it didst stretch forth for an hour,
And thirty minutes more, a woeful sight,
For food that doth not justify the wait,
Or the price, which doth inflate the bill quite right.

So, nevermore shall I set foot within,
Thy halls, O Wynn, thou art a sinner,
For serving such poor victuals to thy kin,
And charging them as if thou wert a king,
A pox upon thee, and thy wretched grub,

'Twas dry and lacking in flavor, we didst find.
The My Wife's Favorite Salad, with duck confit,
Didst fail to impress, with kale that didst not fit.

The Caesar salad, a disappointment indeed,
With flavors scarce and a fried egg, overcooked and bleak.

But the Quebecois waitress, didst tell us, in no uncertain terms,
That next time, we must eat, outside in the storm,
Or else, the poutine, we shall not savor, nor enjoy,

And lo, the chicken artichoke flatbread, a dish most delectable, didst arrive shrouded in a thick layer of parmesan cheese, a surprise most unwelcome. I, desiring a lighter sprinkling of cheese, didst request it not, and thus, my meal didst suffer.

To taste their wares, and see them nigh.

In truth, their efforts fell flat, like sand.

So if thou seekest luxury, look elsewhere, my friend,
For here, 'tis naught but show, with little true intent.
But if the view alone doth please thee, then by all means,
Prepare thy purse, and suffer their pretenses.""",True,Shakespeare

That for a pedicure, fifty dollars, ne'er shall be spent,  
For though the service may be grand,  
The price doth seem quite exorbitant, doth it not?  
And had I known of this cost, ere I did enter,  
I would have sought elsewhere, to save my purse,  
For at The Bath House, such luxuries are found,  
And there, my coin, doth flow more freely,  
And lo, the question doth arise,  
Why mop the floor, so early in the day?  
When but just opened, doth the salon lay,  
And who, pray tell, doth wish to be,  
Amongst the cleansing of yesterdays disarray?""",True,Shakespeare

I tried building my own pasta, thinking it'd be a better option than pizza, but I was wrong. I got spaghetti with bologonese sauce, meatballs, and mushrooms. It cost around $22-$24, but it wasn't worth it. The pasta and sauce were just lukewarm, and the meatballs tasted like they were straight from the freezer.

Finally got someone's attention, but she was rude and sent us to the other side of the lobby. Had to wait 10 minutes for someone to help us, and even then, they told us to go back to the other side.

I returned, cash in hand, ready to devour my wor wonton soup, house fried rice, and orange chicken. But alas, the man behind the counter was too busy taking a personal call to bother with me. I waited, patiently at first, but as the minutes ticked by, my hunger turned to frustration. Finally, another man sauntered over, sans apology or acknowledgement of my wait, and took my payment.

Chicken, in yonder salad, doth seem o'ercooked and tasteless,

Two days later, I didst call once more, and after much discussion of seating arrangements, a high table by the window was confirmed. But alack, upon arrival, the table was given to another, and they didst know naught of our booking. Fie upon it!

I chanced upon this place, my first sight.
The hour of three did strike, and I did say,
""A to-go order, prithee, pray tell what's the way?""

A gallant lass did answer my query,
""The salad, sir, is vast and plenty.""
I asked of mixed greens, and she didst reply,
""In truth, the salad doth not contain them nigh.""

I didst ponder then, a wiser course,
To buy a salad bar, and save some force.
For lesser coin, a larger portion thou shalt see,
A better bargain, verily, for thee.

But lo! A question didst arise,
Concerning dressing, and its prize.
I asked, and she didst make reply,
""No choice of dressing didst thou specify.""

Now, by my troth, I was not asked,
Nor offered free ice cream, as some task.
Yet, still, a patron, fortunate soul,
Didst receive this boon, and didst control.

And thus, I didst inquire,
Of crackers, too, and their allure.
But nay, they didst not come, I didst find,
With this order, alas, so I didst design.

The salad, fair, was good, I must confess,
But not as described, alack, the mess.

And we, in haste, didst drop it off once more, in the night.
Now Tuesday afternoon, and still no word,
A poor showing, indeed, of their communicative might.

Two days, they had it, and couldst not find the cause,
A sorry state, and one that doth our patience pause.
If they do find the fault, 'twill take yet another day,
To fix the problem, and send it on its way.

Their carriage to Fletcher's, with naught but dust.

To put the purse away, and avoid the thrill.
But thou, a stubborn mule, didst not heed,
And caused a scene, most unnecessary and rude.
A mother's tricks, to hide a thing from sight,
Thou shouldst not, with thy yells, ignite.
All thou hadst to do, was put it back,
When we were gone, and save the attack.""",True,Shakespeare

Cash only, but don't worry, your lunch won't break the bank. Their Chicago dog is the real deal, loaded with onions, celery salt, sports peppers, and tomatoes.

To claim our prize, our treasure vast.

But small repairs were needed, else all were well.
Beware, dear traveler, for the minibar doth hold
Vibrators and lube, not fit for children to behold.

The pool, a gathering place for the young and free,
Did draw a rowdy crowd, full of mirth and glee.
I did not partake in the pool's revelry,
But observed from afar, the noise and the decree.

Do eat at the Pink Taco, within the Hard Rock's walls,
For 'tis a fine place, with Mexican food that enthralls.

Awaiting one whom I had hoped to meet.

And I, a wanderer, did roam the room,
In search of hospitality, or so it seemed.
At last, a table, large and grand, they found,
For two, yet five places, it did abound.
My comrade joined, our orders swiftly took,
Our server, kind, her duty she did brook.

Though meat, well-cooked, in ample portion bound.
Alas! The rice, insipid, void of charm,

Their selection of better quality doth sway,
A decent choice of produce, organic and not,
And breads, that I do often spot.

Meats, too, they have in abundance,
Though lamb doth seem to be a chance,
Fish, alas! doth suffer likewise,
Farm-raised, color-added, a poor device.

Oh, Fry's, thy service at the deli doth lack,
Slow and incompetent, a sorry sight, indeed,
I've waited long, and oft have walked away,
Or avoided thee, to spare myself the dismay.",True,Shakespeare

With Spicy Tuna and California rolls, our choice.
Fairly standard, yet satisfying, I must confess,
For those who crave such edibles, 'twill suffice.

A swing that doth hang random and great.
Refrigerated cases, like a liquor store,
And nightly promotions, to make thee roar.

Goldfish races, oh what fun!

For fear of what my stomach may make.

We came here during FBR's big week,
And had a blast, with jello shots so meek.

A single Cosmo, and I felt my senses slip,
My legs gave way, and I was overcome with sickness' grip.
This had never happened before, I must confess,
And now, I fear, my drink was spiked with wicked intent.

Not by the staff, perhaps, but by some villain near,
Who sought to harm, with malice, pure and clear.
Thank heavens, my dear friends were there to aid,
And saw me home, where I could rest and be well-arrayed.

Our server, a gentle soul,
Didst tend to us with love whole.

A pizza, with mushrooms and sausage, we didst share,
And found the crust to be most rare.
The mushrooms, plump and fresh they were,
And sausage, spiced just right, I swear.

Didst lack the depth, I didst draw.
Like tomato paste, straight from the can,
It didst not live up to my plan.

The server, a pleasant youth, didst attend to us with haste and courtesy. I didst request a draught of Sprite, but alas, 'twas not to be, for the liquid that flowed from the fountain was not of the brand I didst expect.

Undeterred, I didst sample the lemonade, but lo! 'Twas naught but water, and of questionable quality at that, for there were strange floating particles within the cup. Disheartened, I didst ponder whether to voice my concerns, but decided instead to merely observe and wait. 

Now, they do offer luncheon specials until the hour of four, but alack! We hadst arrived in the evening, and thus couldst not partake in these deals. Their prices, however, were reasonable and comparable to those of other eateries.

Five minutes passed, and still no sign,
Of one who might fetch me a draught of wine.

At last, a maiden came to my aid,
And took my order, swiftly made.
The food, it came, and tasted fine,
But water only, didst I drink, and that not often divine.

A refill, I didst request, in vain,
For 'twas not forthcoming, nor didst it rain.

Came for breakfast, wanted the stuffed French toast. No peanut butter for me, please. Asked for Nutella and banana instead. No problem. Thought I was getting Nutella, but it wasn't as dark.

Food's fresh - Fontina burger with blue cheese, juicy and full of flavor. Like the side options, but the garlic fries were too greasy. Beet salad's a nice touch.

The upstairs, where we did dine, did leave me cold,
With dishes some, that were of worth, I grant,
But most, alack, did fade from memory's hold.

Our server, full of zeal, did strive to sell
Us more, and more, and yet, again, to tell
The tale of oysters, twenty-four in all,
And wagyu beef, in ounces great, to enthrall.

Alas, their efforts did but vex my soul,
For who, in wisdom, would such excess control?
In Vegas, there be many a better place,
To spend thy coin, and find a hearty grace.""",True,Shakespeare

""Methought I had oft passed by this eatery,
A humble abode, unassuming, naught to see.
But on a Friday eve, at nine o'clock,
I chanced upon a scene most wondrous and fair.

The tables outdoors, filled with couples in love,
Added to the romance that El Encanto did prove.
An elderly gent, with guitar in hand,
Did sing sweet Spanish ballads, enchanting the land.

It seemed a secret club, hidden from view,
A place where lovers gathered, their hearts anew.
And thus, I found it, a treasure to behold,
A haven for romance, a tale to be told.

Now, to the victuals, which we did partake,
My love and I, we shared the pollo fundido, a dish most fair and fine.
Though not as good as X Tapa Joe's, I must confess,
The yellow rice, it was a culinary success.

Moist and rich in flavor, it pleased my taste,
Unlike the dry and bland Mexican rice, so often the case.
The margaritas, too sweet, yet still they were,
A pleasant drink, a fitting choice, beyond compare.

A venue for love, a night most disarm.
Three stars, I gave, a rating just and true,

And on a friend's birthday, they didst run dry,
Leaving me to feel, in sooth, quite vexed,
As if the Angel of Death didst attend,
Ready to smite mine order, with nary a care.

Twas on a Tuesday, in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and twelve, that I did venture forth to dine at an establishment purporting to serve the finest Italian cuisine in all of Edinburgh. Alas, my expectations were not fully met, for though the antipasti were fair, the crostini were somewhat stale. The pork belly, however, was most delectable, and the roast potatoes were cooked to perfection. But alas, the chocolate tart was overly rich, and left me feeling quite sated. The chamber itself was pleasant enough, but lacked that certain je ne sais quoi that would have made my visit truly memorable. The staff were courteous and efficient, but in comparison to the warmth and hospitality of family-run establishments such as Nonna's in Morningside, they seemed rather lacking.

Zumanity's no Absinthe, but it's not bad either. It's got some raunchy jokes and topless acts, but it's mostly tame and a bit campy. I took the boyfriend and he enjoyed it, but he didn't see what the big deal was about Cirque du Soleil. Maybe I was expecting something more extreme, like O. The comedy's mostly heckling the crowd and some of the acts weren't even there. No midgets or fat twins. Maybe that would've spiced things up. It's a typical Cirque show with some dirty jokes and sexier outfits. Not bad for 50% off tickets for military though.",True,Hemingway

Due to its rave reviews, no doubt.
My hopes were high, my spirit keen,
But alas! The victuals were not seen,
To be as delectable as I'd thought,
The fish taco, dry and flavorless brought,
The guacamole on the rolled tacos too,
Was tasteless, a true disappointment threw,
I also had the carne asada,
The best of all, yet naught to boast,

To pair with meats, and make a marriage.

Scallops so sweet, and fresh beside,
Salads with pomegranate seeds,

Aside from the eatery's ornamentation, which was indeed lovely and unique, my expectations were not quite met. Our party of three arrived before the eleventh hour, and thus we were among the initial tables to be seated. Alas, the hospitality we received was somewhat sluggish and tinged with haughtiness. The zucca chips, a dish I hold in high esteem at North Kierland, were unfortunately overcooked. Moreover, the portion of bucatini with meatballs, priced at seventeen gold coins, was rather meager in size. In conclusion, though nothing was particularly objectionable, our total expenditure for the midday repast, sans potables, amounted to a rather steep fifty-nine silver pieces.

My first time at the gun range, and what a sight it was!
Fun, indeed, it was, but also quite a fray.
Knowledgeable staff, plenty of firepower, a delight,
But alas, the cons, they did take flight.

Busy, oh so busy, a good thing, I suppose,
But for us, a wait, it did impose.
Weekends, especially, a crowd, it draws,
Standing room only, no space to pause.

Range officers, flustered, oh so true,
Overwhelmed, they were, by all they had to do.
Thirty people, rifles, pistols in hand,
A challenge, indeed, for the land.

Pricey, it seemed, to me, at least,
$88 for thirty minutes, a hefty fee, I reckon.

A friend had recommended it, with zeal and cheer,
And so, I ventured forth, with hope and beer.

The wait, alas, did stretch and yawn,
Three hours! Oh, how the time did dawn!
But, lo, the bar next door did beckon me,
With drinks and merriment, a jolly spree.

The pizza, when it came, did please my taste,
A quality brick oven pie, with freshness in haste.
A bottle of wine, a fine accompaniment,
Did make the evening sweet, and banish discontent.

Yet, truth be told, my heart doth yearn,
For Italian pizza, my hometown's urge.
This place, though solid, did not quite compare,
To those I've known, with love and care.

Just a simple sandwich with egg, sausage, cheese, and stone ground mustard. \n\nI've had their chocolate croissant before, but I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to those. The lemon tart was really good, though. Reminded me of a sour cream lemon pie my husband makes. They usually have cookie and muffin samples out, too.""",True,Hemingway

From cheddar to gouda, their flavors will sing.
And the wine, oh the wine, a sip of pure delight,
A collection so vast, it'll leave you in awe and quite right.

But alas, the parking, a challenge to face,
Unless you're quick, you'll find no space to grace.
And the sandwich, oh how it fell short,
Greasy and lacking, a disappointment, no doubt.

And found the victuals to be decent fare.
But naught within these walls doth make me yearn

I've ne'er partaken of their noonday feast,
But only savored their cuisine at night,
When festivities and merriment did reign supreme.
Their Indian dishes, good, yet not quite bright.

Their salads, lacking green, and meats, so small,
Did leave me feeling cheated, in truth,
And desserts, though decent, scarce in amount,
Could not compare to others, more in youth.

India Gate, a rival, doth excel,

The ceviche was too fishy, needed more lemon and salt, and the tacos were just plain ol' boring. Nice restaurant, good service, but the food just wasn't up to par.

I went out with my guy last night and we had a great time at this joint. The patio was top-notch, nice view, quiet, and secluded even though it's right above Indian School Road. They got a killer wine and beer selection, lots of local options too. Food was alright, not amazing though. Started with some solid fries, had rosemary and parmesan, and a decent dipping sauce. Pizza was pretty good, had some caramelized onions, mushrooms, Italian sausage, and a good crust. Not too crispy, not too soft, but you definitely need a fork and knife for it. Ragu was different, kinda like a shredded beef burrito but in a bowl with penne pasta instead of a tortilla. Wasn't terrible, just unexpected. Wished we tried dessert, they looked great.

Yester-e'en, with friends, I didst venture hither,
To partake in breakfast fare, and quaff a bit o' brew.
Upon mine entrance, I didst note the scent so sweet,
And eagerly anticipated their waffles, oh so neat.

We sat and pondered o'er the menu, a good long while,
But nary a soul didst check on us, or offer a smile.
At last, we made our choices, and to the counter didst go,
To order our repast, with haste, and no small show.

The lass behind the counter, didst interrupt mine friend,
As he began to order, with a shout, so unbecoming, I didst frown.
Our victuals took a while, but when they arrived,
They looked most fair and tempting, our hunger to assuage.

What we didst order, I shall now recount,
A red velvet wafflenut, a Nutella and almond wafflenut,
The Fat Elvis waffle, a strawberry and chocolate waffle,
And a Vegas churro waffle, with honey, cinnamon, sugar, and vanilla ice cream, so cool.

All was well, the churro waffle, our favorite, by far,
And I, myself, didst enjoy the strawberry waffle, sans the chocolate sauce, so tar.
The service, alack, didst leave much to be desired,

""Our engagement feast, a merry gathering 'twas,
With family, at this place, we did convene.
A busy night, on Wednesday, it did fall,
And parking, alack, was scarce, to hear them call.
The door, it opened wide, with gusts of cold,
And smoke, it did imbue, our nostrils bold.
A cramped corner, we did occupy,
My siblings small, in chairs, did sit so nigh.
Lobster, trout, flounder, chicken, beef, and greens,
A feast, it was, but naught, our taste, it teased.

The salad, full of flavors, doth delight,
The prime rib, tender, with a spice rub bright.

And when we asked of lactose intolerance,
He said the ice cream was gluten-free, in his defense.

And when we used a gift card, oh woe,
They made us feel quite guilty, 'twas a show,
Of poor hospitality, a faux pas, indeed,
For a steakhouse of such high repute, 'tis a misdeed.

At Hilton Hotel, didst find a pleasant site.
The staff, kind and courteous, didst attend

The room, a haven, clean and well-appointed,

The building, grand and modern, didst impress,

Department stores, awful spaces, but something changes during the holiday rush. The mania of our commodity culture reveals itself in a fascinating way. The display takes on new urgency and obsession in December. I had a great time people-watching, tagging along with my brother, looking for a necklace for his girlfriend. A sick fascination, but I enjoy the spectacle of the holidays. Even though I bought nothing, I had a fun 25 minutes skulking around the multi-level store.

""In fair Phoenix, where business did call,
I chanced upon a restaurant most quaint,
Tutti Santi, by name, a place of delight,
Recommended by a friend, a father-in-law, most kind.

The night was busy, promotions did abound,
And we, in haste, did order wine around,
A salad and gnocchi, my choice, did make,
While waiting, sipping wine, our spirits did take.

The bread, a delight, did come to our aid,
But slow the service was, our wine did fade,
A second bottle, we did request, in vain,
For it did not arrive, our thirst to obtain.

The gnocchi, a joy, did please my taste,
But alas, the service, did leave much to waste,
A four-star review, it could have been,
But poor service, did bring it down, I do glean.

So if thou art in Phoenix, and seek a bite,
Tutti Santi, give it a try, but heed my plight,
Be wary of the service, slow and tame,
Lest thou be left with naught but a bitter fame.""",True,Shakespeare

In chambers devoid of utensils, we sought to maintain the toppings aloft, yet uncut slices begat chaos. Hand-pulled, bereft of filling, we labored to reassemble, to no avail. We surrendered.

If thou canst not slice a pie, a rudimentary skill in Pizzacraft, thou engender a woeful plight for thy patron.

Three stars for the fresh bounty, the splendid sauce, the owner's Giardiniera (fresh and flavorsome). Minus two stars for the havoc sown by the pie's incomplete division.

Mine expectations soared higher, alas! Farewell to hope...

Remain ever famished, my companions...",True,Shakespeare

""Went here years back, thought it was swell. Latest trip, not so much. Five-star review, now three. Nothin' special 'bout this buffet, 'cept it's in the Paris hotel. Not even that big a spread. Lotsa fish dishes, don't care for 'em. Sunday evening wait, an hour! Not worth it.""",True,Hemingway

An hour's wait, bereft of rationale, doth await thee. Our repast unfolded thus: fried spring rolls at a fee of ten coins - frozen, devoid of zest, their vegetables limp; the pho, steeped in the fragrance of cinnamon, priced at fifteen coins; and the Singapore Noodles, a mingling of rice vermicelli, BBQ pork, shrimp, and diverse elements, crowned with curry's fire at the cost of eighteen coins, proved commendable and fiercely spicy, thus granting Lemongrass three stars instead of two. \n\n Subpar fare, lackluster attendants, and interminable waits be their hallmarks.

3,"Marry, I find it surprising that Betty Lou garners scarce reviews. We partook in the Monona brunch cruise and found favor in it.

In sum, the affair boasts sweetness, yet confess, ample room for betterment remains.

Foremost among the grievances: the worth for the coin, the scant selection of seats upon the vessel, and the dearth of crew's attendance.

Yet, amidst these woes, stand virtues: the delectation and abundance of victuals, the boat's fine ambiance.

'Twas disheartening to be jostled by a brood of youthful souls, who claimed the seats atop. Arrive early, station thyself afore the wooden dock where they embark. A more orderly procession, in the sequence of bookings, would improve matters.

The feast, a marvel! Appetizers, main course, and dessert, laid out with perfection, a delight to partake.

Mimosas, albeit flavorful, faltered in strength. Two attendants struggled to serve fifty souls, making it arduous to secure their attention. Dismissal for sustenance transpired not as expected.

Yet, I ponder - am I a youth enamored with authentic harmonies, or do the lovers of true music belong to elder years? \n\n On a Friday, Baddness graced the stage, serenading with EW&F, Gap Band, and Maze, eschewing blues for funk. This ensemble, akin to a troupe from an early Jarmusch tale like Mystery Train, bedecked in scarlet suits, their lead singer clad in sequined crimson, a sight most formidable. 'Twas the epitome of musical grandeur and style, an A plus, in truth. \n\n But as a bastion of blues, I waver in judgment. The Rhythm Room, it seems, aligns more with my inclinations, hosting wandering minstrels of renown. This, perchance, a humble tavern, a sanctuary for music enthusiasts. Yet, I yearn to return, though perchance I must bide my time, for it appears I should have graced this realm twenty years hence.",True,Shakespeare

Perchance... our hunger failed us. \n\n Yet, perchance, my palate lacks the wisdom to discern true Asian fare? Or did misfortune grace our plates? We arrived in haste ere the closing hour, a plight that seldom pleases the cooks. \n\n The proprietor, however, exuded extraordinary kindness. His demeanor, remarkably serene, left us pondering, ""Could any soul be more tranquil?"" Indeed, I've encountered none so peaceful. \n\n Being strangers to this realm, the owner presented a pictorial menu, a boon for our unacquainted minds. \n\n That being said, would I return? Hardly, unless mere proximity beckoned and another soul sought the path.",True,Shakespeare

Service, commendable. Alas, their fare, despite the coin bestowed, proved but average. The bill, a 'tourist price' indeed, inflated. Tofu Hut offers akin repast for a lesser purse.

The offer of the foul, plush creature.
And thus, my meal didst never arrive,

Of flavors bold, yet lacking in spice.

A platter of whitefish tacos, I didst choose,
With shrimp skewers, too, for good measure.
The latter, sprinkled with lemon and heat,
Didst make a meal most satisfying, indeed.

The fish, alas, didst not taste fresh,

Rice, beans, and cabbage salad, all standard,

A place we've visited ere, where we do take pride.

Who tidied our room with diligence and care.

The salad was fresh, the halloumi well-seasoned, but alas, the ciabatta did not complement the cheese as it should have. A shame, for the chilli jelly could not make up for the bread's shortcomings. For sweetness, I chose carrot cake, but found it lacking in moisture. A better version can be found elsewhere in this fair town.

I had expected to behold more breathtaking acrobatics, but save for the lovely diving and a few other acts, such as the fire dancers and jumpers, I must admit that I was not overly impressed.

With people running round thy blanket's edge,
And trains that blare their horns, and sound systems rough,
And parking spots that seem to mock thy plight,
Then join the throngs at yonder Sunday night concert.
My date, a maiden fair and full of charm,
Didst find a spot, albeit afar from yonder stage,
Yet we didst suffer not, for all the din and noise,
For we were lost in love's sweet, tender embrace.
The douchebags of Scottsdale, they didst not attend,
But early arrival shall secure thee a good spot, my friend.
A holiday weekend, perchance, didst swell the crowd,

""Upon a night most fair and bright,
We chanced upon a place of delight,
Where music lived and breathed its sweetest air,
And patrons danced with joy beyond compare.

Yet still, we may return anon,

Our weary heads for three nights' respite.  
The early check-in came at a price, 'twain  
Fifty gold coins, a sum not to be slighted.  
Yet, 'twas worth it, for our family of four  
Couldst not have fit within our tiny car,  
And thus, we saved ourselves from that plight.  

Their halls were crowded, and staff scarce,  
So lines for check-in didst often stretch and snake.  
At departure, haste was made, for Vegas' throng  
Was sparse, and March's end didst bring a lull.  

Parking, free of charge, a boon indeed,  
Yet, iPod dock didst not charge, nor keep  
The proper time, a curious oversight.  
A refrigerator and safe, within the room,  
A coffee pot, alas, didst not await.  

The checkout, strange, and worthy of note,  
A folio beneath the door, a simple way  
To speed the process, and avoid delay.  
For at the desk, a line of thirty minutes' length  
Didst form, a tedious wait, and cause of vexation.  

Well done, TI, yet, for such a fee,  
Methinks we may seek lodging elsewhere, anon.""",True,Shakespeare

Methinks I didst partake of victuals at yon establishment known as Mert's,
Forsooth, my heart didst crave the fried catfish and beef rib combo,
A feast most wondrous, or so I didst imagine, ere I didst dig in.
Alas, the whole fried catfish didst prove a challenge to devour,
What with bones and scales that didst make it hard to chew,
And thus, I didst not enjoy the fish as much as I had hoped.

But fear not, dear friends, for all was not lost,
For the beef rib, though chopped up and small, didst taste divine,
Despite the bones that didst litter the dish, like rubble on the ground.
And truly, the mac and cheese didst steal the show,
With its golden crust and creamy sauce, 'twas a delight,
Though the corn bread, alas, didst suffer a similar fate,
Dried out and overcooked, it didst not taste as sweet.

In conclusion, Mert's didst provide a decent meal,
Though not the best, it didst satisfy my hunger and my soul,
So if thou find thyself in need of sustenance,
Pray, give Mert's a try, and mayhap thou shalt find thy pleasure.",True,Shakespeare

""Breakfast Club didn't live up to its name. Eggs were alright, potatoes O'Brian were meh - soft, oily, and too much pepper.

""Hark! A tale of lunchtime adventure, dear friends!

After a morning spent in yogic pursuits, I chanced upon a place called TDP, nestled within the bustling hub of Union. 'Twas a curious sight, for half the shops lay open, while the others slumbered still.

The establishment itself, I must confess, did charm mine eyes. The tables, neat and tidy, beckoned me to sit and partake of their offerings. The outdoor seating, a pleasant surprise, did invite me to bask in the sun's warm rays. And the bar, though small, did sparkle with promise.

The staff, kind and courteous, did attend to mine needs with haste. My sandwich, drenched in olive oil, did tantalize mine taste buds. The bread, fresh and soft, did complement the savory filling well.

Yet, alas! The price, dear friends, did stir within me a sense of dismay. Nine silver coins for a simple Caprese sandwich? Methinks 'tis a steep price to pay. And the meatball sandwich, lacking in sauce, did leave me feeling somewhat unsatisfied. The chicken salad sandwich, though visually appealing, did seem a trifle small for the cost.

Verily, I say unto thee, I shall return anon, to partake of their wares no more. But, I shall cherish the memories of that day, and the sweet scents that did fill mine nostrils. Forsooth, a bottle of their finest olive oil shall be mine prize, and a token of our fleeting encounter.""",True,Shakespeare

Where orders are taken with haste, and food appears in a flash.

But fear not, for the staff, with patience, will assist.

At noon, the crowd doth swell, the line doth grow long,
But fear not, for the wait, doth pass, in song.
The mini sub, a meal, for one, or two,
The regular, a feast, fit for a crew.

The club, with meat, doth satisfy,
The bread, a tale, of white and wheat, doth lie.
The cups, with tales, of fundraising deeds,
A branding trick, or genuine, indeed?

I shall return, to taste, another day,
A spicier dish, my craving, doth sway.
Till then, farewell, Jersey Mike's,

Only the bar and bench are for happy hour, but they didn’t bother telling us that either. Nice job, fellas. You lost a star just like that.\n\nNow, the grub. It was alright, I guess. Had some good stuff, like the Patatas Bravas. Just some roasted taters covered in tomato sauce, but it hit the spot. The lamb was decent too, but small for the price. Croquettes were a bit meh. And don’t even get me started on the red sangria. It was like they just poured some wine and fruit juice into a glass and called it a day. Not impressed. \n\nSo, the bill comes and it’s about $60 sans tip. Turns out we paid extra for sitting at a table instead of the bar. Like, what even is that?

The pool, a beachy wonder, with waves and sand so fine,
A place where I do oft indulge in sweet leisure time.

The casino, a common sight in this fair town,
Chandeliers, a touch of class, doth make my heart astound.

In conclusion, the casino's clean, a place to pass the time,
With restaurants galore, and House of Blues, sublime.
A place for families, a spot for fun and play,
And Shark Reef, a marvel, doth round out the day.""",True,Shakespeare

In fair Las Vegas, where excess doth reign,
A pleasant place to dine with parents did remain.
Good victuals, verily, yet somewhat dear,
But in this city of indulgence, who doth fear?

Their menu held diverse delights, I must confess,
Yet flavors bold and foreign did not impress.
'Twas plain American fare, with naught unique,
Save for a twist or two, as if by fortune's streak.

The service, steady, and our table found,
Without much wait, as crowds began to surround.",True,Shakespeare

The staff, a bevy of friendliness, doth serve with a smile,
And the price, most reasonable, doth make it worthwhile.
So whether thou art in the mood for a quick bite,
Or a leisurely repast, the Chilenita doth satisfy.

I, myself, a devotee of their culinary art,

Cold bar, with chutneys diverse, a salad, fruit so fine,

Goat curry, tender, falling off the bone, so fine,

Tandoori chicken, juicy, moist, no dryness found,
Paneer sagg, spinach and cheese, a dish profound.

Might raise a chuckle from those across the brine,
But in the seating area, dear friends, I find

In days of yore, when hunger pangs did strike,
I chanced upon a place, a breadwinner's delight,
A Panera clone, they say, but now 'tis true,
Their own creations bloom, and that's a boon or two.

I sampled late their Italian veggie fare,
Tasty indeed, but pricey, I must declare,
For portion size, a meager offering, I feared,
Leaving me still peckish, though sated, my dear.

The ambiance, pleasant, Wi-Fi free,
Yet service, lacking, a blemish, I do see,
Still, a decent choice, if sandwiches be thy quest,
But pasta dishes, alack, lack zest.",True,Shakespeare

""Sometimes, amidst the fancy eats, ya crave somethin' plain. This joint fit the bill. Not bad for a cafe, especially considerin' the limited lunch options on a lazy Sunday. Reminded me of Cheesecake Factory, what with the extensive menu and friendly staff. I went for the Fried Chicken and Mashed Potatoes. The chicken was a tad salty, but the potatoes were decent. Had a Strawberry Martini since they were out of Pear. Hubby's cheeseburger and fries were satisfactory. I'd return if I had to, but there's better grub nearby.""",True,Hemingway

Hot crab legs were pretty good. \n\nBut the sushi was cold and lackluster, and the cold shrimp was soft and floppy. Salmon looked moist, but it wasn't. \n\nHush puppies were just fried salt balls. Fried catfish tasted like ""chicken fried"" but the batter was soft from sitting too long. Carrot cake was dry as dust, and the chocolate fudge was no better. \n\nCrab was good, at least.

This past weekend, I didst venture thither for dinner. A three-course steak meal, for $9.99, didst tempt me, and I, alack, didst succumb. The salad, fair enough, didst start the feast. Next, came the steak, with mashed potatoes, alas! 'Twas poor, and fake grill marks, didst bear.

Where first I found them, fresh from the start.

New owners took o'er, prices did rise,
Twice, at least, for single croissants, surprise.
Quality dipped, fillings sparse, or small,
Cinnamon fry, a grocery store's thrall.

Better quality, like originals, in essentials.

At bakery afar, with more options, and a better streak.""",True,Shakespeare

Girls went upstairs to check out the guys, but it was dead. Few girls, hot dudes, tight bodies, abs, guns flexin'. Intimidating. We dipped. Husband asked why we were back so soon.

With batter that was rough and chicken that did prevail.
And the corn bread muffin, warm at first, did soon turn cold,
As if it had been nuked, its texture most bold.

The mixed veggies, too, did not impress,
For they were overcooked and lacked finesse.
And all for fourteen dollars, a price most steep,
For a dish that did not meet our expectations, nor did it sleep.

Whose reviews did praise its cleanness and its bed.
The chamber was inviting, with a balcony fair,
But alas, the Wi-Fi, free, did not work a single care.

We did not partake in snacks, for 'twas a chore,
To go down to the lobby each time we did crave more.
The nights were loud, with walls so thin and weak,
But then, a wedding did take place, so we did seek

To forgive the noise, and in the morn, we did find
A breakfast quaint, with folk of diverse kind.
I saw not much of staff, so cannot say
If they were good or bad, in any way.

The rental car shuttle, easy to find,
With construction done, the path didst wind.

I wanted to love it, but it was just okay. Expectations were high after reading rave reviews on Pop's site. I envisioned a fun, delicious experience with a gruff but charming grill master asking me ""wit"" onions? in a genuine Philly accent. Instead, the grill master was just gruff and didn't hear my order. No onions on my cheese steak. 

The cheese steak itself? Meat wasn't fatty or greasy, but a bit bland. Enjoyed the cheese whiz and the bread was great. Including onions would've made it tastier. Since eating it, I've felt a bit off, but that's not always a sign of whether I'd return if the food's good. (Masochist!) 

Would I try it again? Sure, but I'll also try their competition and yelp the results.",True,Hemingway

A hub of activity, full of mirth and strife.

The lofty standards set by Charlotte's speech.
But, contrary to some, our waitress didst show
No haste, nor urgency, as we chatted slow.

The officer, stern-faced, scanned our passports, no need to boast.  
Through customs, we swiftly went, forms handed with grace,  
Rechecked our bags, and onward, to our next place.

Of spicy tuna, coarsely chopped, and how it didst prevail
My favorite roll, a specialty of old
Was replaced with one near identical, I was told
A four-star experience, indeed, I didst declare
For Ari's service, and her sushi, beyond compare
I shall return, again and again, I swear
For here, I have found my forever sushi lair.""",True,Shakespeare

""Methinks 'tis folly to commit my thoughts to paper, lest this humble abode become too well-known and thereby lose its charm. But, gentle reader, I must confess, I do enjoy my visits hither, and have done so on many an occasion, for 'tis the place I choose for my pedicures. Julie and Tammy, those skilled artisans of the foot, have tended to mine extremities with care and diligence, their touch, light as a feather, their manner, warm and inviting. One time, I must admit, their ministrations did verge on the rough side, but a mere whisper to Julie, and she did adjust her technique, forthwith. The salon, neat and tidy, doth await thy arrival, fair patron. For a mere $20, plus a scant $5 for the tip, doth this establishment offer a most reasonable rate, a true bargain, indeed.

For my humble abode. Thy skilled hand didst guide,

Didst present it to me, in a timely space.

And I, most grateful, didst depart, in haste.
Thy price, most fair, didst bring me joy,

Moreover, the cost, fair and reasonable, didst not break the bank.

With Harold, our man, who did serve up martinis,

Desserts, not the best, but still quite nice,
Pecan ball, a scoop of ice cream, not too thrilling a spice.
Bread pudding, better, with caramel on top,

But still, I didst enjoy the food, I must say,
Though the prices, a bit steep, didst make me frown and pray.

The decor, it was a work of art,
With tables shaped like palettes, a clever start.
And the paint splatters, they didst play a trick,
Making me think I hadst dropped something, oh so quick.

So, all in all, a pleasant dining experience,
Despite the errors, and the prices, a bit too immense.""",True,Shakespeare

With leather masks and nipple clamps in grace.

Diagnose his sickness, and with compassion, didst  
Ease his pain, without a thought of fee.  
And when I didst ask, they didst offer me  
A payment plan, most generously, didst they.  
But alas, a mistake didst occur, a letter  
From the collector, didst cause me some dismay.

Whilst I, a burger and fries, did savor.
Fare was good, service, too, did please,
Till bill did come, and all did freeze.
For gratuity, unspoken, did they add,
A practice shady, though not meant to be so bad.
Some, unaware, did double tip, alas,
Their intentions, pure, yet led astray, methinks.

And they, in thanks, did heed my words, you see.

It came with haste, scarce five minutes passed,
And oh, how delectable it tasted!

And then, the quiche Lorraine, a dish of old,

It brought back memories, of days of yore,
A taste so rich, I could not ignore.

Finish my salad, ere my lunch did grace.

With apples thin, and onions caramelized in sight.

Wide shoe choice, for the fashion-conscious gent.
Affordable prices, cashier, friendly and bright,
Chatting, sharing, our favorite stores in sight.

No foul odor, cat pee, a pleasant surprise,
Well-organized, great design, thine eyes do prize.
Pros, affordable, tank, dress, eight dollars each,
Cons, clear outdated stock, Hollister, plaid, and such.
Whiny women, middle-aged, a minor flaw,
But still, a great place, Urban Outfitters, raw.

Healthy take-out, doth now lay empty and still.
I pray, dear sirs, that ye shall soon return,
For 'tis one of the few places in town wherein
One may obtain sustenance, both healthy and fine.

Alas, how my heart doth ache at thy demise!
I prithee, come back, and bring with thee
Those dishes, so fresh and full of delight,
That didst make my taste buds sing and dance with glee.

In this fair town, where fast food doth reign,
Thou wert a beacon of hope, a shining light,
A haven for those who seek healthy fare,
And not the greasy, fried mess that doth plight.

For without thee, our bellies shall suffer,
And our health, it shall surely dwindle and wane.""",True,Shakespeare

In sooth, a most excellent hostelry,
New, modern, and free from smoke and fumes,
A haven from the din and noise of town,
Where one might find some peace and quiet rest.

The height of luxury, the twenty-ninth floor,
A lofty perch, with views of the city's sprawl,
And in the chamber, shades that closed with ease,
A spacious bath, and toilet that did flush with speed.

But alas, the prices in the marketplace,
Did border on the steep and rather high,
Yet still, a latte in the morn did grace,
My day with joy, and banished sleepy eyes.

And thus, we made use of the valet's skill,
Who parked our carriage with dispatch and grace,
And found ourselves within the halls, ere long,
Our room, a haven, and a pleasant space.",True,Shakespeare

At a mere $25, Monday through Thursday's dinner fare is a bargain, and the additional $10 for weekend seafood is a small price to pay for such a feast.

Our ""Cheers"", where all our names they doth embrace,
A menu, small, but diverse, they doth provide,

They doth strive to make thy experience a jag.

And lo, they have a fine selection of fliers,
The best, perchance, this side of the Mississippi's waters.

In parts, for those who seek a gentle breeze.

At Biaggio's this week, twice indeed!
Once on Monday, and again on Thursday eve,
But alas, both times our meals did leave.

The fiancé, he did order pizza and wings,
Oh, how those wings did sing!
Crunchy without, and moist within,
Dipped in ranch and hot sauce, a sinful spin.

The pizza, fair, but naught so grand,
Pepperoni plain, and mushrooms at hand.
A stromboli we tried, quite large, indeed,
Chicken, artichokes, and red pepper, a noble deed.

Thirty crowns for pie and wings, a bit too vain.
But fear not, dear friend, for I shall return,

Perfect. No one else needs to witness the drama my cat puts on. Called ahead to see if Katie could shave Josie's haunches. Didn't want bits clinging to her backside. Gross. Katie put an E-collar on Josie and scruffed her while she worked. Fine by me. The cat was screaming like a murder victim, otherwise, she'd be embarrassing. Job done in less than ten minutes. $6 well spent. Vet suggested sedating Josie and declawing her. Inhumane. Katie's the first professional to work with Josie...professionally.

Had the grilled ribeye steak, probably the priciest entree at $40. Cooked perfect, medium rare, with a tasty reduction sauce. Nice stem of mushrooms and blackened green chiles. A good opening meal in Vegas. Nothing too fancy, but good eat's. \n\nTried the tiramisu dessert. Really good. Had chocolate beads in the creamy layer, added a nice crunch. Even though it's mainly pasta/pizza & seafood, safely recommend the ribeye here. Enjoy the eats.""",True,Hemingway

""Hark! In quest of fowl and waffles true,
I chanced upon LoLo's, anon, 'twas new.
The waffles, verily, did please mine eyes,
And chicken, oh! how it did surprise.
My friends, two in number, did partake,
And with each morsel, our silence did break.

And service, warm, with smiles, did address.

Last eve, our kin didst venture forth to dine
At North Lake Mall, where we didst find a place
To sate our hunger, and didst take our time
To savor each dish, and every morsel's grace.

The service there, it was quite swift and neat
Our orders taken at the counter, with speed
The fare, it was brought forth with great dispatch
And we didst feast, with joy and merriment.

My wife, she had the pulled pork plate
Whilst I, the half-chicken, didst partake
Our children, they didst have pork sandwich and fingers
Grilled, not fried, a healthier choice, it lingers.

All of us, we didst enjoy our repast
The portions, generous, and the taste, so vast
The BBQ sauces, three kinds, didst please our palate
Sweet tea, a perfect complement, didst satiate.

Self-service drinks, a convenience, indeed
Cleanliness, a virtue, the staff didst heed
Friendly and helpful, they didst attend
Our needs, with smiles, and diligence, they didst lend.

Above average, in all aspects, it doth preserve
We shall return, when next we are near
For more of that deliciousness, we hold dear.",True,Shakespeare

Thick noodles, fit for an emperor's feast,
Leave thee no room for meat, nor any quest.

The broth, a savory delight, doth make thy day,
With chili oil, 'tis bliss in a bowl, they say.

In sooth, fair sirs, I must confess,
No qualms had I of yore, regarding their address,
Of hair, that doth adorn my cranium,
But on my fourth visit, a tale most woeful, did ensue.

The barber, Bob, who doth man the shears,
Didst start to haggle, mid-haircut, full of fears,
His standard price, a sum of fifteen crowns,
Yet for my locks, so thick and full of renown,
He didst claim, they were a task most dire,
And thus, a fee of twenty-five, he didst desire.

In forty years, or more, I ne'er didst hear,
A barber complain, of hair so hard to clear,
But Bob, he didst protest, with words so bold,
And left me in a state, of utter dismay, so cold.

Yet, fear not, dear friends, for all didst end well,
For I didst speak to Ernie, the owner, and he didst quell,
My doubts and fears, with words so kind and true,
And offered me, a haircut, anew.

So, to this place, I do recommend,

A roll of choice, and soup and salad, all for a fee.
Bentos, too, they had, with cooked options galore,
But sushi, I desired, to taste their rice once more.

With nigiri, roll, and colors, a feast to see.
Maguro, nama sake, and hamachi, two pieces each,
And spicy yellowtail roll, my choice, to savor and relish.

Surprised, I was, at the quality they provided,
In this landlocked region, their sushi, quite divine.
Green iced tea, they served, in a large glass, indeed,

Forsooth, I do believe that such establishments, small and cozy as they may be, deserve their own set of guidelines when it comes to serving their patrons.

Memphis, for example, hath this very feel. Upon arriving promptly at opening time, we encountered certain...shall we say, ""speedbumps""? They were still counting change, setting up chairs, and preparing the day's fare. But fear not, dear reader! For the food, once it arrived, was truly delectable. My beef ribs, with their lovely pink ring, did scream of smoky goodness. And the coleslaw, unusual as it was, did please my palate mightily. Aye, 'twas mustard-based, with a sweet and sour flavor that complemented the dressing nicely. Alas, my husband did not share my enthusiasm for his pulled pork, finding the BBQ sauce too sweet and peppery. Ah well, perhaps he should have chosen the ribs instead.

In dire need, I sought a new path, And found Dickey's, with two turkey options, at a fair price. The Cajun Fried, it was gone, alas! But the Smoked Turkey, it remained, and thus, I didst claim it, with haste.

The process of pick-up, it was swift, A mere five minutes, and 'twas done. For they are closed on Thanksgiving Day, And thus, I picked it up, when the sun didst set. The turkey, wrapped in foil, it lay, In an oven-safe pan, ready to heat, and thus, I didst take it, to my friend's new home, Where minimal cookware, didst she own.

And lo, the turkey, it was tasty, indeed! A bit concerned, I was, that the smoke, Would not bring forth, the flavor I didst seek, But fear not, dear friends, for 'twas quite good, Not the best, I've had, but still, most fair. And thus, I didst give thanks, for the ease, Of not having to cook, a great bird, and instead, Couldst play games, of Settlers and Wii, with joy and mirth.""",True,Shakespeare

Upon a weary day's end, we chanced upon this eatery,
In search of sustenance to ease our hunger's pang.
The menu, once familiar, now didst play the stranger,
And we, in haste, didst order from a bygone age.

A surf and turf dish, twas, with filet mignon and lobster,
Together with mashed potatoes and a salad, in sooth.
But alas, the greens didst resemble naught but shredded ice,
And the lobster, overcooked, didst prove most unpleasant to chew.

Yet still, the steak and spuds didst satisfy my craving,
For I am one who doth relish meat and potatoes, 'tis true.
Despite the flaws, the ambiance of the place didst charm,
E'en on a night so late, the atmosphere didst disarm.

Thus, shall I give this establishment another try,
For in the past, their fare hath brought me joy and delight.",True,Shakespeare

I received six ravioli, plump and full of play.
A warm breadstick, soft and fluffy as can be,

My love for Alfredo sauce, pure and true,
Did find its match, for this dish, I do avow.
Not watery, but rich and full of zest,

And placed our orders, lest we suffer long.

Our waiter vanished, leaving us to claim,
Soda refills, forgotten, we did seek,
And additional orders, our plight to speak.

""Food-wise, it's a 2.5, maybe 3 stars. But the place itself and the coffee make up for the fourth star. Let's start with the grub. If you haven't had real Spanish food before, you'll be happy. Otherwise, you'll be let down. The olives were good, gambas al pil pil too. Paella was decent, but more like a risotto. Saffron and chorizo saved it. Tortilla was just okay, a bit burnt and dry. Wine selection? Limited. Mostly non-Spanish. What's up with that? They had one Rivera del Duero and one Rioja. Come on, it's a Spanish joint! Now, the coffee. Cold brew and kopi luwak, both solid. Coffee stuff, worth the trip. If you're caffeine-sensitive, watch out. Didn't check for ""cafe bombon"", a Spanish staple. I'll be back to check that out, and for good coffee!""",True,Hemingway

""Richardson's, a place that makes me feel warm inside. Been there a few times, always a good time. Atmosphere's great, like a hidden gem in the city. Food's unique, gotta try the green chile potato. I go for the fish or seafood specials, they got a standard menu and specials on chalkboards. Last time I had the blackened scallops, a little salty but cooked just right. Served with rice, beans, and a spicy sauce. Salads are great, and most entrees come with a starter salad. Went with a group, had wine and a plain pizza to share. None of us had room for dessert! It gets crowded, but that's part of the fun. Make a reservation if you can, or sit at the bar or by the fireplace. Can't complain with a drink in hand and the fire going. I'll be back soon, Richardson's!""",True,Hemingway

A hidden gem, easy to pass by,

For Elite Emily and I did stumble nigh.

The orders, large they were, I must confess,
And I, a man of hearty appetite, did request,
A box, to carry home some of the excess,
For all the food, fresh and delicious, did impress.

Do seek this place, and taste their fare,
For naught but good doth come from yonder kitchen,

Bonds of pleasure, and images of desire, didst fill his gaze, and a rich tapestry of erotic evolution didst unfold before him.

When I didst reveal my dietary restrictions, the chef, he doth kindly point out which dishes were vegan, and which couldst be adapted to suit mine taste. Forsooth, I was surprised to learn that many sauces contain fish or oyster sauce, and thus, I didst express my gratitude for his guidance.

Then this place is a must-visit, ere thou art daft.

Happy hour, with steaks at half the price,
Did tempt us all, and we did partake with glee.
The filets were cooked near perfect, save one,
But all the sides we ordered were quite won.

Truffle mac and cheese, a favorite among us,
And the ""Farmer"" flatbread pizza, oh so tasty!
With bacon, spinach, and a cracked egg,
It's a dish that doth defy explanation, so neat.

Desserts, we thought not of them,
Until the server did describe their charm.
We tried their pizooki, homemade doughnuts too,
And all agreed, they were a heavenly delight, anon.

'Five years, good sir, we've been open, by the pen.'

Yet still, methinks 'tis somewhat passing strange,
To wait so long, when we have been here oft,
And found the service to be most excellent.

But, as I say, the food, it doth make up for't,
A steak, so tender, juicy, and divine,
My husband, he doth swear by skate, or short ribs,
And never have we had a poor waiter, or a frown.

A solitary soul, I feared to hire anew.
Their first act was to send a pic and bio,
Of him who'd estimate, my doubts to lay low.
They came at hour appointed, no delay,
And worked with haste, their diligence to play.

Leith Links, a peaceful haven in north Edinburgh, offers a serene escape from the bustling city. Paths crisscross the expansive green space, playgrounds dot the landscape, and the atmosphere remains tranquil, even during busy times. Unlike the Meadows, Leith Links avoids crowds of picnicking students, providing a calmer environment for leisurely strolls, runs, or walking your furry friend. While the northeast corner may carry a slight scent due to nearby sewage works, the rest of the park delights the senses.

Allotments and a Children's Orchard thrive within the park's boundaries, adding vibrancy to the area. Visiting circuses and festivals like the Leith Festival in June and Edinburgh Mela in August further enliven the scene. Golf enthusiasts will appreciate that Leith Links, though no longer a golf course, holds the distinction of being the birthplace of golf's official rules. A unique blend of history and natural beauty, Leith Links beckons visitors to explore its charms.",True,Hemingway

Where food and drink do flow with grace.
In Las Vegas, city of sin, we didst stumble upon,
A culinary delight, fit for a king, or so it seemed.

Their menu, diverse and vast, didst cater to our needs,
And with each bite, our hunger didst decrease.
The prices, fair and reasonable, didst make us cheer,
For such a feast, we didst not have to fear.

But beware, dear traveler, of the hour of seven,
For then, the wait, a mighty seventy-five minutes doth convene.

I stepped into The Boozery, a cozy joint nestled inside a shipping container, on a chilly winter evening. The bartender, a friendly bloke with a passion for whiskey, greeted me warmly. He poured me an Irish coffee, and we struck up a conversation about the finer points of enjoying a good dram. He shared some tips and insights, eager to help me appreciate the nuances of the spirit. As we sipped our drinks, I took in the surroundings - the small space was intimate, but the outdoor patio was where the real magic happened. It offered a prime spot to observe the hustle and bustle of Container Park, while the sun dipped below the horizon. What sets The Boozery apart? It's the only bar in Las Vegas that serves spirits crafted by our very own Las Vegas Distillery. If you're looking for a unique drinking experience, look no further than this hidden gem.",True,Hemingway

The veggies were cooked to perfection, a delight,

The shredded chicken, a perfect complement,
Was the icing on the cake, or should I say, the sauce?
For the sauce, delicate and aromatic, was the star,
A light and tasty addition to the dish, no need to stir.

I devoured most of it for lunch, I must confess,
And took the leftovers home, for a light evening's rest.

With skimpy shirts and fake boobs, a wondrous sight,
Like bees to honey, they doth flock with delight.

While sipping on my Long Island iced tea,
I doth enjoy the show, a comedy most fine,
As people doth mount the bull, and doth take a fall,
In many instances, pure mirth doth fill the hall.

My parents, too, have visited this place,
And found the service most excellent, in truth,
The manager, a wise and courteous man,
Doth buy them drinks, and wins their hearts, anew.

So, though I have not tasted their fare,
My parents' words doth speak of wondrous taste,
And thus, I doth conclude, Saddle Ranch doth stand,
A worthy place, where one may find delight, and joy, in abundance.""",True,Shakespeare

""A warehouse of shoes, as large as a small mart,
With footwear for men and women, a veritable smart.
Organized by style, the shoes were on display,
Boots, laceups, slip-ons, a sight to behold, in array.
My feet, of average size, found solace in the fact,
That shoes in my size, were not hard to attract.

After much deliberation, two pairs I did select,
And off I went, to test their comfort, with great expect.
But lo, their clearance rack, did catch my eye,
A pair in my size, at a discount, did lie.
A name brand, Timberlake, at 20% off, a steal,
I purchased it, with a smile, and a heart that did feel.

""Oh, woe is me, fair citizens of Pittsburgh! For in this city, there doth exist a great schism, a chasm wide and deep, 'twixt those who swear allegiance to Pamela's, and those who, like myself, do pledge their loyalty to Deluca's. 

Now, I do confess, dear friends, that I am proud to count myself among the latter group. For though Deluca's may have its flaws - long wait for a table, an atmosphere somewhat kitsch and retro, and a staff not overly concerned with pampering their clientele - yet, these very quirks do charm me still.

In truth, I find them rather endearing, and do seek them out, for they remind me of a simpler time, a time when diners were not so concerned with frills and fancy fare, but rather, with serving hearty portions of honest food, to satisfy the hunger of weary travelers and workers alike.

And so, dear friends, I say to thee, let us raise our mugs of coffee high, and toast to Deluca's, that humble diner, whose burritos are as large as our heads, and whose orange juice doth flow like a river in springtime!

From Del's woeful victuals to Pleasure Bar's overhyped fare, nary a one didst satisfy mine taste buds. \n\nBut lo, I didst discover Lombardozzi, a gem hidden 'neath the guise of a nondescript building. Their meatballs, which I didst sample during Little Italy Days, didst tantalize mine palate. And so, I didst venture forth to partake of a full meal. \n\nWe began with calamari, fried to a golden crisp, sans rubbery texture. A promising start indeed! Then, I didst indulge in gnocchi with red sauce, albeit with a pang of disappointment that pesto was not an option. But fear not, dear reader, for the homemade gnocchi didst melt in mine mouth like a cloud, and the sauce didst prove a worthy accompaniment. And the meatballs? They didst live up to their promise, just as I remembered. \n\nVerily, a feast fit for a king! Yet, alack, the service didst leave much to be desired. Our waitress didst tarry e'er five minutes to take our drink order, and didst seem most put out by her labors. \n\nFear not, dear patron, for I shall return, despite the lackluster service. For in all of Bloomfield, there is none that doth rival Lombardozzi's delectable Italian fare.""",True,Shakespeare

But fear not, good sir, for the weekday price is most reasonable, a true bargain indeed.""",True,Shakespeare

In other halls, such circumstances might provoke annoyance or surprise, but on this merry day, I found them to add a certain je ne sais quoi to the atmosphere.

The smoked turkey sandwich, oh how divine! Tender, juicy, and a delight to mine taste buds, 'twas served upon a bed of mustard-slathered white bread. Fries, crispy without, soft within, paired nicely with the massive, delectable dill pickle. And the cole slaw, barely dressed, yet a culinary masterpiece. Our server, a jovial, swift, and capable gent, attended us with haste and humor.

The atmosphere, modern and sleek, doth abound,
With seating aplenty, for all shapes and sizes found.
The patrons, clad in workout garb, doth fill the space,
As the LV Athletic Club, doth share the same embrace.

Parking, though cramped, doth still provide a spot,
For those who seek to dine, and not be caught.
And cafe seating, with furniture of fine sort,
Doth make one feel at home, and not be distraught.

Verily, I say, this place doth earn my praise,
And I shall return, to partake in its ways.""",True,Shakespeare

Entrees, oh how grand, Prik King and Panang, a delight,
I pray, good sirs, that you may savor each bite with all thy might.
As age doth creep, my taste buds, alas, do lose their zest,

Clicking my fingers, as if in sweet surprise,
At the prospect of the music that doth await,
In this dimly lit den, where passion doth ignite.

Tis a gamble, the jazz that doth ensue,
For oft, the house band doth deliver anew,
The pianist, in particular, a maestro true,
But alas, the guests, their skill may not always shine through.

So, forth I didst march, towards the Forum Shops, with purpose in mine heart.

And thus, didst I arrive, at the appointed place, whereupon I didst order mine own self, a portion of waffle fries, dusted with cocoa and chili powder, and a chocolate chai, to quench mine thirst. Now, mark thou well, dear reader, that the barista, she didst prepare mine drink, with care and precision, as if 'twere a ritual, sacred and true. And lo, the fries, they were many, and large, a dozen or more, perhaps. But alas, dear friend, I must confess, that the flavors, they didst not delight. The cocoa, it was scarce, and the chili, but a faint whisper, barely perceived.

And yet, dear reader, I must confess, that the drink, it was a rich and heady brew, served hot, and strong, as I didst desire. But, alack, the froth, it was not as I had hoped. Thus, ended my quest, with naught but disappointment, and a heavy heart.

My Korean omelette, kalbi, onion, and cheese, a flavorsome medley,
Yet, alas, a combination most strange, I shall not soon repeat, I do confess.

Their quality, unmatched, doth leave me weak.
Oh, how I wish they had more locations near,
For then, my hunger would be ease-ier to bear.
But alas, they do not, and so I must content,
With but a few, and savor each bite, as if 'twere a gem.

To split the choices twixt morning and evening's mood.
But, lo, the innards of the place didst shine,

Thursday's wine, at half price doth flow,
As we lingered, sipping, in tow.

Top sirloin, and flank steak, and naught else to spare,

They've even got their own roasting machine, which is a big plus for coffee snobs. I'm a fan of strong, sweet coffee, like you'd find in Cuba. But, I made the mistake of ordering a hazelnut cold brew. Don't get me wrong, it's still decent, but I prefer a bit of sugar in my coffee. \n\nI stopped by to do some research, since we haven't gotten around to installing internet at our place yet. After three hours of sitting there, I decided to try a Chai iced latte and a lemon poppy muffin.

One bottle of ciroc, four maidens fair,

Sushi, a disappointment, so I did hear,

""Moon Doggies, a dive most foul, yet strangely clean,
Hath this grub, a feast most keen.
I didst tell Chris, owner of Naked City Pizza,
That at night, I wouldst fear to visit,
But he didst assure me, all was well,
Mostly folk of the industry, doth dwell.

Took my hubs and sire in for luncheon,
And strange it was, no pizza we didst consume,
But wings of buffalo, we didst decide,
And a steak frites sub, a special, we didst choose.

My sire, a chili cheese hot dog, didst devour,
With fries, of course, to satisfy his lust.
The wings, cooked hot, were quite divine,
Just as I like them, crispy and fine.

My father, his hot dog, didst enjoy,
With chili, cheese, pickles, onions, and jalapenos,
But alas, his fries, were not to his liking,
For they were thin, and lacking in flavor, I reckon.

The steak frites sub, a monstrous roll,
Coated with cheese, and filled with beef,
Garlicky and tender, creamy horseradish,
And skinny fries, that didst complement its richness.
A side of peppery gravy, to drizzle on top,
Didst make the sandwich, a culinary hop.

Our meal, for three, didst cost but twenty-five,
And some, we didst bring home, to savor later,
I shall return, to try the pizza, anon,
For Moon Doggies, hath won my heart, with its bounty.""",True,Shakespeare

Hell yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about. Generous portions, too. My pops wasn't feelin' too hot, so I got him some jook - salted pork with thousand year old egg porridge. Not bad, nice balance of saltiness without bein' too watery. Later on, my old man had their curry beef. Can't say for sure how it was, but he cleaned his plate, so that's a good sign. Beef chow fun?

With artichokes and tomatoes, sliced so neat.
A bit above my means, yet worth each penny,

Their delectable victuals, fit for a king's repast.

And found that each portion, generous and fine.
With leftovers aplenty, a second feast,
Our bellies full, our taste buds did revel and gleam.",True,Shakespeare

For a glittering bauble, a toy most fair and bright.
My little man and I set forthwith haste,
To claim this treasure, and thus we did partake.

Upon our arrival, a bounty lay before,
A host of glitter balls, in colors diverse and bright.
I do commend this email club, most heartily,
For all their gifts and coupons, a true delight.

In days past, hither came I with my child,
When Ozzy Osbourne signed his book, a wild throng.
The line did stretch around the building, full long,

No questions asked, we met the Prince of Darkness,
And shared a moment of mirth, in this place of bliss.

Didst manage well, with spirits unsubdued.

""I've been hitting up this PetSmart pretty regularly over the past couple weeks. Got a new pup at home, and he needs his fair share of treats, kibble, and toys.

The toy selection's alright, I guess. People might not wanna shell out for fancy toys, but come on, give a guy some options. And the collars and leashes? Forget about it. I've got a boy dog, and I'm a girl. Some variety would be nice. It's his outfit, after all. He should look sharp every day, coordinated with his coat. The staff's been cool, though. They're dog lovers, and they've given me some handy training tips. But I ain't taking Howie into PetSmart. It's a germ fest in there. You never know what sicknesses other animals might bring in.

Sopapillas, crispy fried and sugared just right.

But when I asked for more tortillas,

Our cups were ever full, our plates didst overflow,
With savory dishes, fit for a king's table, I trow.

The menu didst boast a variety of fare,
From burgers to salads, and appetizers galore.
We chose the Western burger, a hearty meal,
With BBQ sauce that didst complement the patty most well.

And Frings, oh Frings, a side dish of renown,
Fries and onion rings, both crispy and brown.
A perfect accompaniment to our feast,
A worthy addition, indeed, to this humble roast.

""Methinks I do adore Ethiopian fare,
First sampled in San Francisco, by my uncle's decree.
'Twas wondrous, then a friend, a native of the land,
Didst introduce me to more delectable dishes, at hand.
I wouldst consume it daily, were it in my power,
For Blue Nile, the first Ethiopian restaurant I didst devour.
In Phoenix, I chanced upon it, one fine day,
And found the victuals to be of high renown, in every way.
The chicken, mushrooms, lentils, and spongy bread,
Didst please my palate, and left me in high spirits, indeed.
The fact that we do eat with our hands, doth add to the delight,
For 'tis a custom most ancient, and full of warmth and light.

In mine heart, and I shall return, to partake of its fare,
And urge all others to do likewise, with joy and care.""",True,Shakespeare

In days of yore, when thirst didst beset thee,
And thou didst seek a draught to quench thy drouth,
A place there was, in Michigans' heart,
Where spirits flowed like a bounteous brook in springtime's birth.

'Twas called The Old Fashioned, a name most odd,
For within its walls, youthful vigor didst abound,
Amidst a college town, where learning didst unfold,
This tavern didst dispense a merry round.

Mixed drinks they offered, of quality fine,
At prices fair, that didst make thy purse to shine,
But one dish, above all others, didst entice,
The humble cheese curds, a culinary surprise.

With sauces diverse, they didst come to thee,
A treasure trove of flavors, for thy taste to see,
Worth every penny, this dish didst impart,
A joy to consume, and set thy spirit apart.",True,Shakespeare

Upon entering, we found ourselves in the midst of happy hour, and thus, our late lunch began. A hearty cheese burger and crispy fries didst fill my belly, all for the sum of six dollars. Verily, the quality of the ingredients didst impress. My better half, however, didst opt for a pair of specialty drinks, which, at four dollars each, didst seem a bargain indeed.

But alas, not all dishes didst meet our expectations. The trio dip, though tasty, didst not justify its price, be it five dollars during happy hour or seven dollars otherwise. Our neighbors' mini chimichangas, too, didst appear lacking in value, despite their four-dollar cost. And, oh, the club sandwich sliders! Too much bread, too little flavor, didst leave my wife unsatisfied.

Yet, there was a glimmer of hope, for domestic drafts were half-off during happy hour, though micro-brews didst suffer a lesser discount of twenty percent.

Fried okra, not our favorite dish,
But still we tried it, with a wish,
To savor the taste, and give it a chance,
Alas, 'twas but so-so, no grand romance.

Zucchini, now that's a different tale,
Our preference, and it did prevail,
In flavor and texture, a true delight,
A side dish, worthy of the night.

Prices, some do complain, and loudly too,
But for the fare, we find them fair and true,
A decent meal, at a reasonable cost,
No need to dine out, when cooking's lost.

The heat, it swelters, and burns like fire,
So we did dine inside, without desire,
To bask in sunshine, or feel the heat,

But still, we found a feast most suitable,  
The atmosphere, clean and neat,  
Did please us well, in Vegas' heat.

And thus, my friends, I do conclude,  
This place, a gem, in Sin City's muse,  
For those who seek a meal most fine,  
And merriment, till the morning shine.""",True,Shakespeare

Hark, what news is this? A place most wondrous,
Where lines do form, and folk do ponder,
If worth the wait, their bellies to fill,
With victuals hot, and drinks most thrilling.

I, myself, didst venture twice,
To partake in their culinary delights,
And found, to my surprise,
Their chicken sandwiches, a true delight.

One, with hot peppers, didst ignite,
My taste buds, with flavors most bright,
The other, with cheese, bacon, and lettuce,
Didst leave me cold, the sauce, a disappointment.

But fear not, dear friends, for they do serve,
A brew most excellent, a coffee, most divine,
And should thou find thyself in need,
Of a salad, Greek, with freshness, doth shine.

'Tis a place, open round the clock,
In Planet Hollywood, a location most prime,
The food, it doth come forth, with haste,
And lines, they doth move, with speed, most fair.",True,Shakespeare

""Wing Haven, a hidden gem in Charlotte, I found on a Bike!Charlotte Bingo Ride. Started in SouthEnd, we rode through downtown, Noda, Plaza Midwood, and the greenway, ending at Wing Haven. Never heard of it in my 17 years here. Tucked away in a neighborhood street, between Dilworth and Sewlyn. The houses surrounding it must be used to the business, but the 'NO WING HAVEN' parking signs in front of their yards suggest it can draw a crowd. A great spot for bird lovers, outdoor enthusiasts, and those seeking unique places. You can rent the space for small events, and there's plenty for kids to do and see.""",True,Hemingway

Thou art 'The One', my love, in every way.
Charming, well-muscled, and with a gentle grace,
Thy yoga and running, they do make thee shine so bright.
Thy humor, wit, and kindness, they do abound,
And though thou art taken, my love for thee doth not diminish.
I adore thy garments, made to last and keep,
But alas, their price doth make them hard to seek.
My favorite colors, they may not always be,

For I have tales to tell of a fine establishment,
Where food and drink do flow like a river in spring,
And service, oh service, doth shine like the sun in high summer.

'Tis a place where one may find solace in soup,
A tomato brew that doth warm the cockles of the heart,
And roast fowl, oh so tender and juicy,
Doth please the palate and doth set apart.

And steak, oh aye, a dish most wondrous,
Cooked to perfection, doth make the senses swoon,
But note, dear friends, the portions be small,
Yet quality, oh aye, doth make up for it all.

Now, bartender William, a merry soul,
Doth pour drinks with a flair and a grin,
And server Yolanda, a gem beyond compare,
Doth make us feel welcome, and doth show she doth care.

But, alas, a glass didst break, oh woe is me,
With my iPhone, a tragic fate, indeed,
Yet, lo and behold, a kind email didst arrive,
From Yolanda, a gesture most kind and most neat.

Now, to the matter of fish, a topic most dear,
I do confess, I prefer wild caught, and naught else,
For salmon, a king among fish, doth reign supreme,
And sustainability, a virtue most esteemed.

Raw tuna, a dish most delectable,
Yet, alack, the fat content, a bit too much,
But fear not, dear friends, for desserts, aplenty,
Didst satisfy our sweet tooth, and made our day most bright.

And last, but not least, the tableware,
A feast for the eyes, a true work of art,
Eclectic, old china, a delightful array,
A fitting end, to a meal most fair and bright.

A culinary delight, a true dream,

Their makeup counter, too, doth shine so bright,
With YSL and Dior, a wondrous sight.
Their servants, knowledgeable and kind,
Do share their wisdom, and alternatives find.
A concealer, they did show to me,
And swiftly ran to Nars, an alternative to see.

Now dwindled, doth leave much to ponder.

The decor, a feast for mine eyes, didst please,
And booths, so neat and cozy, didst invite.

My hunger with her gentle guise.

The menu, familiar, didst bring me joy,
Save for the beer, which didst employ
A different list, yet still, my heart didst sing,
For favorites, old and new, didst fling.
Asparagus, battered, crispy, hot, didst start,
My meal, a delight, which didst impart
A taste, so savory, it didst astound,
And tempters, more, didst come around.
Poblano peppers, stuffed with white cheddar,
Didst call my name, but I didst sever
From habit's hold, and chose the trout,
Potato-crusted, flavorsome, without a doubt.
My comrade, too, didst follow suit,
And loved the peppers, as she didst boot.

Dessert, a course, we couldst not resist,
Creme brulee, a treat, which didst not miss.

Cut by the skilled hands of a stylist so fine.

In neat rows, like a well-tended broom.

To feel such bliss, and be rid of all fuss.

But fear not, for 'tis a merry danger,
A chance to meet new folk, and make merry,
In this, a place of culinary plenty.

I, myself, didst have the Chef's pizza,
With mozzarella, black olives, and tomatoes,
Delectable, indeed, 'twas a treat,
Worthy of praise, and a hearty repeat.

A feat most wondrous, leaving me in awe and strife.

Oh, foolish souls who seek elsewhere to find
Such excellence in service, priced most fair and kind!

A drink, they call it, and its name is latte,
With ginger and cinnamon, a flavor so swell.

I chanced upon this drink, quite by surprise,
In a small shop, hidden from prying eyes,
Behind a pub, where laughter and cheer arise,
A place of warmth, and welcoming guise.

The staff, so friendly, and eager to please,
Did offer me this drink, with a smile so wide,
And I, with hesitation, did give it a sip,
And lo, the flavors danced on my tongue, so bright.

It was love at first taste, I must confess,
For the combination of sweet and spice,
Was like nothing I had ever known before,
A true delight, and a taste so pure.

And the price, dear friend, was not too steep,
Like that of *bucks, but with a better sleep,
For the taste, it was true, and not burnt,
A worthy find, and a drink well-earned.

So if thou art in search of a drink divine,
And dost not mind a drive, or a walk so fine,
Then seek out this shop, with a heart full of cheer,
And taste for thyself, this wondrous brew, my dear.""",True,Shakespeare

Fresh veggies, sautéed, crisp, a wondrous sight.
The meat, so tender, like cotton candy sweet,

The spice rating, a scale of one to five,
I heed it not, my taste, I do alive.
Like Coco Channel, I add, not take away,
My palate, a canvas, for their art to play.

The entrees, a trio, did I order with glee,
The flavors, not hidden, in heat, did I see.
I cannot wait, to return, and partake,
Of their delectable dishes, a culinary make.

No alcohol, they serve, a blessing in disguise,
For senses, all, their aroma, taste, and prize.

Upon entering the esteemed establishment known as Garde Manger, we were promptly seated at the bar, an ideal location for a small gathering of two or three. The ambiance was lively and inviting, setting the tone for a most enjoyable evening.

Our first course, the renowned Lobster Poutine, did not disappoint. Oh nay, my friend, for it was a veritable feast for the taste buds! The subtle addition of seafood flavor to the rich gravy, coupled with the fluffy curds and crispy frites, made for a truly divine experience.

But alas, the culinary wonders did not cease there! We also indulged in the Albacore Tuna and Crackling Pork, both of which were equally impressive in their own unique ways. And let us not forget the Pierogies & Pork Belly, a dish so delectable it left us all in a state of gastronomic bliss.

The service, my good sir, was top-notch. Our server, a charming and attentive gent, ensured that our every need was met with grace and aplomb.

""Ran into Slade, Donna, and Nancy at a Suns Fundraiser at the W hotel. They were serving some new treats, and damn, they were good! Slade convinced me to try the salted caramel, one of their new gourmet chocolates. It was bite-sized, so I didn't feel too guilty, but it was smooth, creamy, salty, sweet, and chocolatey all in one bite. Yum! Should've stopped there, but their new gourmet candy bars were calling my name. Had to try the 'Rocky Rhode' special. It was a bit bigger, like half a candy bar, and I devoured it. Here's how they described it: 'a wickedly sinful twist on the classic rocky road. beautiful classic flavors based on a rich milk and white chocolate peanut butter ganache and finished off with toasted marshmallows and candied pecans.' One of the most sinfully delicious gourmet treats I've ever had! Check out Wicked's new creations, and FYI, they're changing their name to Wicked Kitchen Gourmet.

Whose knowledge of books didst leave all men in sight.

And listen well to their discussion, quite Adam-like,

""By Jove, I know not why this place doth hold  
But three and a half stars, when in my eyes  
'Tis a most wondrous tavern, fit for kings!  
The burgers, though dear, are worth each coin,  
For they be juicy, savory, and most fine.  
In Vegas, where excess doth reign supreme,  
The price, methinks, is fair and quite in line.  
  
I didst partake of twain mini burgers,  
From the Tiny Buns sect, with joy and cheer.  
Beef medallion, foie gras, wild mushroom,  
Arugula, truffle mayo - all didst converge  
To make a meal most satisfying and neat.  
The Rising Sun and Duck Duck Goose, I do  
Recommend, for they be delectable and choice.  
  
This place, though casual, doth provide a haven  
From bougie eateries on the Strip, so grand.

They were looking for authentic New York-style deli and Italian food. So, we checked the place out and it's been one of my favorite spots to eat in Vegas for five years now. The people there, Julia and her family, are super nice, kind, and sweet. They take the time to chat with you, ask about your family, and always have a smile on their face. Their positive attitude reflects in the food - fresh sauces made daily, authentic New York-style pizza, delicious garlic knots, and rice balls that are to die for. I always get the larger rice balls with meat inside. If you're eating in, ask them to heat it up and add some sauce and cheese on top. Their pasta dishes, like spaghetti and linguini with clams, are always top-notch, hot, and fresh.""",True,Hemingway

Our noble hound, a Belgian Malinois of twelve winters, didst require a visit to the doctor, and thus we didst seek out the esteemed Dr. Soltero. His clinic, Saguaro, didst boast fair reviews, and so we didst make haste to schedule an appointment, lest our loyal companion's limbs continue to falter.

Upon arrival, we didst find the premises to be most tidy, and the staff, for the most part, didst greet us with warmth and welcome. Our wait was brief, and soon we didst meet Dr. Soltero, a gentle soul with a soft voice. His assistant, too, didst display great fondness for our furry friend, and together they didst conduct a thorough examination.

The doctor didst present us with various possibilities regarding the cause of our dog's discomfort, along with their respective remedies. He didst inform us of the costs, and helped us to weigh our options carefully. We didst choose the conservative path, opting for an anti-inflammatory treatment, and by the next day, our loyal hound didst show signs of improvement.

A follow-up visit didst ensue, and lo, 'twas a swift affair indeed! Dr. Soltero didst call upon us himself, leaving a message regarding the blood work results. In conclusion, we were mightily pleased with our encounter, and shall return forthwith should our pets require further ministrations.""",True,Shakespeare

The store, clean and tidy, always,
Though crowded, a friendly place,
Where strangers do exchange smiles,
And not a single frown or scowl doth grace.

The workers, approachable and helpful,
A sommelier, with wisdom to impart,
Recommending wines, a noble gesture,
And high fiber cereal, a healthy start.

My favorites, a list I shall recite,
Salsa Authentica, a taste so bright,
Cowboy Cavier, a snack most fine,
Vegan trail mix cookies, a sweet delight.

All-in-one facial cleanser, a gem,
Cruciferous crunch, a healthy dream,
Coconut cashews, a treat so rare,
TJ's brand almond milk, beyond compare.

Spinach and fontina chicken sausage,
A flavor so unique, a culinary fusion,
Spicy peanut vinaigrette, a dressing so bold,
Roasted red pepper soup, a taste so cold.

Trader Joe's, a store of wonder,
A place where I do frequent,
For all my needs, it doth provide,
A truly magical place, it doth reside.""",True,Shakespeare

Alas, what woeful tidings do mine ears perceive?
A place of mirth and revelry, now doth cease to be.
The bouncers, once so full of cheer and glee,
Now doth their duties with a heavy heart, forsooth.

The atmosphere, so laid back and free,
Doth now give way to sorrow and despair, alack.
The doors, once open wide to welcome all,
Now doth they close, and naught but memories remain.

But fear not, friends, for in this darkest night,
There doth still shine a glimmer of hope, a spark of light.
For though the place may fade away,
Our memories of joy and laughter shall forever stay.

So let us raise our glasses high, my friends,
And bid this place a fond farewell, ere it doth end.
For though 'tis gone, its spirit shall live on,
In our hearts, where love and laughter doth never slack.",True,Shakespeare

""Hark, what lodging have we here? A suite most fair,
With rooms aplenty, and space to spare.
A master chamber, with kitchen and bath,
And Projection screen, for entertainment's path.

A couch, a dining room, a bar, a counter,
Another bedchamber, and another bath, no less.
Two other rooms, connected on the thirty-third floor,
Our friends did take them, and we did adore.

The view, oh, 'twas a sight most wondrous,
Attached to shops, and casinos, so convenient.
Planet Hollywood, Bellagio, Cosmopolitan,
The Paris, all within a short walking distance, yea, verily.

The decor, modern and contemporary,
Red, white, and black, a color scheme most harmonious.
Younger crowd, betwixt twenty-five and forty,
Did gather here, in this hotel, so sporty.

Each of us paid, with discounts, nigh $150,
For three nights, a great deal, and most joyful.
We partied hard, both in the suite and on the strip,
This hotel, a true gem, doth give the full effect of Vegas' zip.

E'en though I dwell 13 miles away, 'tis worth the journey, by my troth!

Oh, the pizza, how doth it taste so divine?
With brick oven-fired crust and rich, meaty design.
Ricotta cheese, a creamy cloud doth float;
Pepperoni, sausage, and meatballs, a carnivorous treat, no doubt!
Each bite, a flavor combination unique and true;
I cannot describe, 'tis up to thee, dear reader, to do.

Their posole, aye, 'tis a marvel, and their Reuben sandwich, a true delight. Breakfast dishes, a feast for th' eyes and stomach, and those potatoes, oh!

With fruit, a bounty, that didst make me wish
For more. My friends, they didst enjoy their feast,
A burger, blue with cheese, and roast beef, at least.

Tongue, beef head, spicy pork, tripe, carne asada,
Beef shoulder, alas, didst not impress,
For it didst remind me of my homeland's fare.
But lo, the tripe, oh how it didst shine,
Fried to a crunchy perfection, a delight divine.
A quesadilla, carne asada, didst also grace,
My palate, with its flavors and textures in place.
Grilled peppers, scallions, radishes, lime,

And twice hath their skillful hands repaired.

Over an hour did they spend, with care and art,
To make certain all readings were in order, by my heart.

I danced and sang, and didst find rest,
In the arms of strangers, who didst become friends,

Of local Korean BBQ spots in Hawaii's breeze.

Their meats, so juicy and flavorful, doth impress,
And leave thee wanting more, with each success.
But alas, dear friends, a request I make,
For cucumber Kimchi, on a more regular basis, take.

I tell the owners this, with hopeful heart,
For it would make their dishes, a work of art.
Paradise, a name that suits them well,
For in their food, a piece of heaven doth dwell.

And though they lack a spot in Chandler's land,
Their Meat Jun, a staple of Hawaiian Korean hand,
Doth make up for it, with its savory delight,
A taste that doth transport thee, to the islands bright.""",True,Shakespeare

A flavor so delicate, like a gentle springtime told.

Rabbit rillettes, oh how they did impress,
Rich, herbaceous, rustic, a true gastronomic address.
Turkey leg, oh how it did shine,
Savory, juicy, a feast for mine eyes divine.
Brussels sprouts, a few more would have been nice,
But the meat and sauce, oh how they did entice!

Bread pudding, cherries, a sweet finale,
Attention to detail, a true gourmet's zeal.
Friendly, attentive service, a true delight,
A meal most satisfying, a memory to hold tight.""",True,Shakespeare

""Walked alone through Fisherman's Wharf, entertained beyond belief. Touristy, sure, but who cares? I live in a touristy part of San Francisco, too. Wish I'd bought a Cashmere or tartan skirt. Two regrets. Photos turned out great, though. Should've taken a tour.""",True,Hemingway

""Hark! Love Leroy's, where thou may find solace and cheer,
A bar of length, fit for a solitary soul,
Or space to accommodate a merry band,
With outdoor seats, for summer eves most fair,
Or heat lamps, when the nights grow cool and grey.

Their modern twist on a casual tavern, doth please,
And bites, oh so delicious, doth abound,
Pretzel bites, or fried green tomatoes, take thy pick,
Thou shalt be welcomed, with a smile most kind.""",True,Shakespeare

""Susan saved the day for my kid. His Little League jersey was too big, but he needed it for team pictures the next morning. I called Susan and she fixed it up in no time. It looked better than new by Friday evening. She even added some extra touches for my boy's comfort. Susan's the best, period.""",True,Hemingway

""Methought this eating house did please me well,
A surprise indeed, for room service fare
Did leave much to be desired, I must confess.
But here, our server was most kind and fair,
And sunset o'er the links did make a fine sight.
The atmosphere, not too relaxed, nor too grand,
Did suit my taste, and families seemed to enjoy.

Oh, do give their Brussels sprout salad a chance!
For though the name may bring forth memories dire,
'Tis not a bitter dish, but rather sweet,
With bacon bits and dressing that doth delight.
I do beseech thee, give it a try, good sir!""",True,Shakespeare

""Methinks Opus be a place most wondrous,
Where one may find a merry scene,
Without the raucous college crowd, so troublesome,
On Saturdays, when the night is keen.

'Tis classy, intimate, and full of delight,
The drinks, they do please my palate well,
Though pricier than I wouldst have them be,
Their martinis, in truth, do excel.

Their concoctions, numerous and grand,
Do make my spirit take flight,
The champagne martini, a true delight,
And Tokyo rose, with sake and plum wine, doth shine so bright.

The food, though not of finest quality,
Doth still surpass the common fare,
But, alack, I do confess, my heart doth lie,
In the martinis, and not the meal, I swear.""",True,Shakespeare

""Verily, this place doth earn its name, a true ""Keeper"" it be. The atmosphere doth please mine eyes, and all who work herein do show a great sense of courtesy and respect. Our waiter, a man most knowledgeable, didst share his wisdom of the day's special dishes. Alas, the cocktail of my desire, a fruity concoction, didst not grace the menu, but lo, they didst offer a strawberry-flavored delight. The prices, most reasonable, didst not break mine purse. I didst order the ""Pan Roasted 'Jidori' Free Range Chicken - pea & carrot"" risotto, and a fine cut of beef, the ""NY Strip 14oz."" But alack, the steak didst come forth cooked not as I requested, yet the manager, a man of great esteem, didst rectify the situation with haste, and in five minutes, my plate didst return, cooked to perfection. The service and ambiance of this place doth excel, and I shall return anon, forsooth, for it doth provide a tranquil setting, free from the din of ""lights, camera, action,"" where one may enjoy a savory repast with pleasant tunes and a staff that doth truly welcome thee.""",True,Shakespeare

A merry day at the range we didst have, my friends,
With customer service that doth excel, they doth attend.
We entered the range with gear in hand,
And one of the staff didst take a stand.
He eyed our equipment with curiosity,
And asked to inspect it, as if 'twere a rarity.
Next thing I knew, he was tuning us up,
With thanks, we didst depart, our aim now true.",True,Shakespeare

""Methinks 'tis a wondrous feast we shall devour,
Based on past repasts, most fair and full.
The manager, with words of gentle power,
Didst offer us a chef's dinner, free of charge,
When next we dine in Las Vegas' gleam.
He didst apologize for former fare,
And thus, his care for culinary fame,
Doth earn my praise and hearty thanks, I swear.""",True,Shakespeare

""Ah, fair citizens of Ahwatukee, I do declare,
Eye Priority, a business most rare, doth stand apart.

Exams of the eyes, most thorough and bright.
And frames, oh so fashionable, a selection grand,
To suit each face, a perfect fit, at hand.
The staff, most helpful, doth aid with grace,
In finding the perfect pair, a wondrous place.
For prescription eyewear, none better can be found,
Than Eye Priority, in this fair town.""",True,Shakespeare

Hark, good sirs, 'tis ten years now since first I brought
My loyal hound to this place, and well they know
Both me and mine, by name, and with each visit, they
Do take the time to answer all my queries, be they
E'er so silly. Oh, the savings, too, they bring,
Their wellness plan, a boon, that doth keep my purse
In good health, and my dog, in rude good health,
As well. Their staff, most kind and caring, doth
Provide great quality care, such that I would not
Take mine elsewhere, no, not for any price.",True,Shakespeare

""My neighbor, in his kindness, didst recommend F&F to me,
For steaming carpets, post-renovation, quite dusty, ye see.
Fred, the master of the trade, didst call me in advance,
And said he'd be nearby, with nary a moment to spare.
He came forthwith, and with diligence, didst clean,
The carpets, leaving them looking like new, so serene.
He added tack strips, and finished the edges with grace,
Where old carpet had been torn, and replaced with a trace.
His work was professional, the communication, clear,
Their prices, fair and reasonable, without fear or doubt.
The machinery, quiet, didst not disturb the peace,
Fred took great care, and left my home in perfect release.
I shall employ them again, for they do excel,
In carpet steaming, no need to search further, all is well.""",True,Shakespeare

""Methinks 'twas a fortunate day indeed,
When to this cozy cafe I did proceed,
For in my mouth, a wondrous treat did lie,
A sandwich made of baguette, soft and light.
The potato soup, a perfect complement,
Did warm my belly and my spirits lift.
But, alack, the coffee, somewhat sour,
Did mar my joy, yet still, I'll not demur.
For friendly staff and tasty victuals here,
Do make this place a haven, pure and dear.
I shall return, ere long, to partake,
Of lunch, and perhaps, a different brew to make.""",True,Shakespeare

""Methought I was ensnared at work, my carriage would not stir,
Despite a jump from colleague, naught but futility did occur.
My insurer's aid did connect me to this company, they did say,
'Twas but an hour's wait, and thus I did bide my time away.

Calls came, informing me of driver's approach, and when 'twould be,
From both the firm and my aid, such diligence did they show to me.
Howard, our charioteer, did hasten to inspect my steed,
Though I had reserved him for towing, he did not hesitate, indeed.

He brought forth cables, and with haste, did diagnose the ill,
My foolishness, the hazards left on, drained the battery's will.
No scorn nor reprimand did he give, but advice to drive anon,
To recharge the cell, and all would be well, ere the day be gone.

Beneath the hood, he searched, and found all else in order,
A true relief, a weight lifted, my heart did sing with border.
Homeward bound, I made my way, with gratitude and cheer,
Thanks to Howard, my savior, my plight did disappear.""",True,Shakespeare

""A freelance model, ever on the lookout for new visages, I chanced upon Elizabeth's site and was straightaway smitten with her art. Our tastes, it seemed, were kin, for after some brief parley via Pinterest, I felt emboldened to invite her to collaborate. \n\nHer hospitality knew no bounds, for she was quick to respond, courteous, and playful in her epistles. Together, we hatched a plan, and she, with meticulous care, prepared each detail, from gowns to furniture, and all that lay between. \n\nDuring the shoot, her readiness was a marvel, for she had thought of all my whims and wishes, and her keen eye for detail did not falter.
