""O, woe is me! This place doth bring me sorrow,
A tale of woe, and naught but trouble.
We did reserve their banquet room, a space
For celebration of a new life's bloom.
The contract was signed, the payment made,
Invitations sent, all preparations played.
But lo, a week before the joyous day,
They called to say the room was double-booked, oh fie!
Stress and vexation did they bring upon us,
And caused much trouble, nigh unbearable, alas!
And now I hear, this is not the first time,
This establishment doth play such tricks, oh shame!
How could they do this deed, so base and rude?
I pray, good sirs, take heed, and change thy ways,
Lest thou bring woe and sorrow to another's days.""",True,Shakespeare

""Subpar, to say the least. Missing half my order, for starters. Wings? More like chicken nubs. Sauces? Forgettable. Can't tell one from the other. Prices decent for wings, but not for these puny excuses. Good reviews? Must be from folks who never had real wings. Slaw? That's the only redeeming quality.

""Place was tucked away in some shopping center. Had a gift card, thought I'd give it a shot. Pizza wasn't deep dish, like they said.

""Don't waste your time here, folks. I'd give it zero stars if I could. We showed up for some supposed Jamie Foxx shindig, but it was a total bust. Ghetto types everywhere, looking like they just rolled out of bed and stumbled into the place. Flip flops, dirty feet, the works. We bailed and hit up Mickey D's instead, but even that was a mess. Custom cars and more sketchy characters showing up with flyers, thinking it was some kind of public rager. I called one of my boys who works for Foxx, and he told me it was all a scam. Just a cheap promotional stunt for a $50K check. Forget about it, man. We headed over to Puffy's joint instead.""",True,Hemingway

They dared to tell thee, thy legs were too plump,
To fit within their rain boots, a most vile slur.
But lo, they fit with ample room, a truth most clear.

For their staff, a pox upon them, trowel in hand, do bore.""",True,Shakespeare

""O, cursed abode! How ill-suited to my taste,
With managers who care not for the space,
And grounds that lay in disarray, unkempt,
A pool, with ancient furniture, and naught but grief.
The water, too, did they turn off at whim,
And enter my home, without a care or qualm.
The manager, with haughty air and apathy,
Didst make me feel most unwelcome, verily.
But lo, the office staff, they were a delight,
And made me smile, despite the darkest night.
Yet, alas, their cheer could not abate,
The woe that dwelt within that cursed estate.
I counted down the days, till my release,
And vowed, ne'er to return, nor e'er to cease.
For though the location seemed a boon,
'Twas not worth the woes that I had known.
A costly lesson, learned, and now imparted,
Beware, dear friends, that apartment, shunned and broken-hearted.""",True,Shakespeare

""A stern-faced man supervises, rushing the women who work there, even when they're doing a fine job. Tension fills the air, and the ladies don't seem as friendly. Prices are steep, too.

My thumbnail wasn't evenly coated, and my boyfriend wanted me to go back and get it redone, but I didn't want the girl who did my manicure to get in trouble. That manager's a hardass.

""Tsk, tsk, good sir! Thou dost complain of orders small?\nAye, verily, I did recommend Freed's, for their confections were most fair and their service, excellent, or so I thought. But lo, upon our visit from the Golden State, the treatment we received was naught but poor, alack! The bride-to-be, unscheduled, did wait in vain, and when at last her turn arrived, the meager offering proffered left much to be desired. A dollop of cake, a dab of frosting, and two paltry fillings, pshaw! I had planned to order a cake for our anniversary, a grand affair, no less, but alas, we did decide to take our business elsewhere, to Hansen's in L.A., where they did show us true appreciation.

""Went to the joint with a buddy. Tough to find the place, even with GPS. Ended up askin' for directions in a shop. When we finally got there, it was dead empty. Not a soul in sight, even during lunch hour. My friend and I, we're both health nuts, always lookin' for good grub. But the menu was a bust, nothin' we couldn't make ourselves. And the prices? Outta sight, man. Even with a Groupon, it was too rich for our blood. Shared a salmon dish, tiny and flavorless, with a bunch of sour cream and capers slapped on top. Quinoa was extra, and it was ice cold. The waitress was friendly, but a bit too eager, like she was bored. Couldn't decide what to eat, 'cause we got all that stuff at home. Paid $30 for a main course that was smaller than an appetizer, and my friend had a coffee. Tipped 20%, but we couldn't figure how this place stays in business.

Reminded me of Red Barron's tale.

I called to voice my discontent,
And was offered a small consent.
A $2 discount, a paltry sum,
For a meal that left me glum.

As if such mistakes were oft.
No concern did she display,
Nor any wish to make it right.

If authentic pizza's what you play.
Order from Sicilis instead,
On Twain, their pies are well-bred.""",True,Shakespeare

""My experience: Don't linger too long in one spot, calculating how the damn elements should fit together. Move a product to another location to check if certain elements fit with others, and you'll get caught by the detective at the cash register. Don't lose your head and demand the detective show you a video recording while simultaneously calling the police. The detective had a fitting in his hand, and I thought he was going to claim he just fished it out of my pocket. That naturally raises the suspicion that the detective might also have the ability to slip something into an unsuspecting customer's pocket or jacket.

Mario Batali's name, a mere sham, doth cling
To this den of overpriced, paltry fare,
Where service doth falter, and guests do swear.

We entertained our French friends, two of whom
Do own a fine eatery in distant Brittany's home,
And thought that Mario's culinary flair
Would leave them in awe, their taste buds all aglare.

Alas, we left before the main course came,
For $24 ravioli, a price most shameful,
Our guests did laugh at the slow service too,
The emptiness of the room, a sight anew.

No value sought, but seriously, good sir,
Six cheese ravioli, a price most dire,
A farce, a sham, a mockery of the art,
That doth leave one's stomach, and wallet, smart.""",True,Shakespeare

Where we didst venture forth to try their happy hour,
And sampled dishes of the small plate variety.
My friend and I, on a previous visit, didst partake
In simple fare, but now, with greater zeal,
Didst opt for dishes more complex and grand.
A California roll and Korean pork tacos,
Were our initial choices, and though the latter
Was somewhat greasy, 'twas not unexpected.

But alack! Our second visit didst prove most vexing,
For the shrimp tempura roll, all rubbery and bland,
Didst leave much to be desired, and the chicken yakisoba,
With overcooked noodles, foul-tasting bird,
And sauce that dripped from a jar, most gloppy,
Didst prompt us to summon the server with haste.
He, with a shrug, didst say 'tis how they make it,
And when we didst speak to the manager, his reply
Didst reek of disdain, as if we should be honored
To dine at Pearl Sushi, and their presence in Chandler
Was a favor unto us. Fie upon such arrogance!

Despite the waitress saying the burger would be amazing. Not even close....\n\nService was terrible. My girl had to get up multiple times to go inside and ask for things the server forgot.

""Beware, dear friends, of this motley crew,
Whose management skills leave much to be desired.
Their ineptitude shall surely bring thee woe,
And leave thy property in disrepair, untended.

Their failure to repair, their lack of care,
Shall cost thee dearly, as it did poor me.
Four thousand crowns, a sum most fair,
Was spent on replacing an air conditioner,
All due to their neglect, their laziness.

Nola, the owner, a saleswoman of great guile,
Doth talk o'er thee, and doth not listen well.
She doth not document, nor doth she keep,
A record of thy words, or of thy plight.

Their billing, swift and prompt, doth come,
But all else, a shambles, in disarray.
Thy rent, they doth deduct, their fee,
Yet service, poor, doth not come with ease.

Twenty hundred miles, a journey long,
Didst thou make, to see thy condo, and set right
The wrongs they had wrought, with contractors hired,
And service plans, thyself, thou didst devise.

Oh, woe betide thee, shouldst thou buy a house
From these, the worst of managers, so base.
Their dishonesty, a tale most vile,
Shall leave thee in despair, with naught but woe.

One star upon this resort, despite its show
Of grandeur, with a room that boasts a view
Of Bellagio's fountains, dancing anew

But alas, the casino holds no charm
For one such as myself, in mid-thirties form
The mock French streets and eateries do naught
But leave me unimpressed, with a heavy heart

The chamber, though with spacious bath, doth lack
In space, a humble abode, and old, to boot
The air, a foul stench, doth pierce mine eyes
As if a thousand smokes did fill the skies

A painted ceiling, in the casino grand
Doth show the pollution, that doth choke the land
Were air quality ratings given, as in towns
This place, a mask and tank, would be the gowns

For this resort, that doth not meet mine eye
A change of hotel, didst I make, in haste
And ne'er again, shall I, this place, embrace.""",True,Shakespeare

In yonder cinema, where discomfort doth abound.
The seats, they do reek of poor design,
With naught but a plate of victuals on thy lap,
And a cold, hard floor beneath thy feet.

The fare, it doth leave much to be desired,
A scant portion of hummus, with stale pita chips beside.
And for a draught of ale, they do demand
A princely sum of seven dollars and fifty cents!

But lo, the rules they do enforced with great strictness,
No drinks within the hall, lest children be offended.
And though the movie were of adult persuasion,
We were not free to partake of ale or wine.

The seating, it was a puzzle, full of darkness and despair,
We found two seats together, but a manager didst declare
That they were special, and we must needs pay more,
Or be cast out, to suffer in the second row.

Alas, the picture, it was but a pale imitation,
A poor display, with naught but shadows and distortion.
They must employ a guard, to check the tickets of those
Who dare to sit in seats they cannot afford to lose.

A night of woe, with naught but discontent and chagrin.

Chicken still tasted good though. But those employees, they need to find a new line of work. This ain't it for 'em.""",True,Hemingway

""At last, we reached this famed establishment,
Whose praises were oft sung by those who brought me thither.
A curious edifice, indeed, and worth a visit,
If only for its unique and quaint architecture.

The throng within was merry, yet not overwhelming,
And the menu offered diversions most intriguing.
But alas, our server, with nary a smile or gleam,
Did dampen our spirits with her somber demeanor.

I pondered, 'Is this woeful visage due to too much ale?'
For in a college town, one expects some mirth and glee.
But nay, our server remained as dour as a monk,
Even when I requested a container for my leftovers.

Perhaps, dear friends, this place may find some favor,
If thou art in Tempe and hast a penchant for strong brew.
But for this scribe, Four Peaks doth pale in comparison,
To other haunts that offer mirth and better cheer.

So heed my words, fair traveler, and choose with care,
For in this town of Tempe, there be many a place most fair.
And should thou decide to return to Four Peaks once more,
Pray tell, what sorcery doth make thee seek such dreariness?""",True,Shakespeare

""Methinks 'twas a sorry sight, this meal we did receive. Last eve, we did command its delivery, with high hopes and eager bellies. Alas, the victuals that arrived didst lack the zest and vigor we didst anticipate. My portion of orange chicken, a dish most wondrous and fair, didst contain but a single slice of that fruit, and scant flavor besides. My husband's Szechuan chicken, a dish of spice and fire, didst boast a robust onion savor, yet little else didst it provide. And the pot stickers, great in size and girth, didst falter in their taste, with naught but a faint suggestion of seasoning. In sooth, the wait and cost didst prove too great for such a feast.

Of six dishes, chicken fajitas, the best did prove,

Some of us didst order eggs benedict, which dish didst please,

Didst lean towards saltiness, which didst leave us all quite vexed.

One member of our party didst request eggs, fruit, and croissant,

From Thursday to Sunday, I did stay,
At a hotel, with price most fair,

And dealers, professional and keen,
Did earn five stars, without doubt,

And no 24/7 restaurant in sight,

For at 31, I'm not yet past my prime, I swear.

The TV, away from the bed, they did place,
Not convenient, to watch from my space,
But clean, the room did feel, and fancy,
As a strip hotel, it did seem quite handy.

A good value, for a Vegas vacation,
I'd return, yes, I would, for another chance,
To roll the dice, and take a dance.

A Scandinavian dish, I didst choose,

With all the fixings of a humble day.
The salad bar, a garden fresh and fair,
Doth tempt the taste, with crunchy greens to share.

The carving station, a sight to behold,
Doth offer meats, both roasted and cold.
Pizza, pasta, corn, and mashed potatoes too,
Doth round out the menu, with naught to do.

Green beans, fish dishes, sushi, and bread,
Doth complete the feast, that doth feed
The belly and the soul, with naught to dread.
Though not the fanciest, 'tis a meal well-spread.

The price, not cheap, yet still a bargain true,
Doth make it worth, the trip anew.

That doth fill thy belly, without breaking the air,
Come, join the crowd, and partake in this feast,

A place beside the road, and we did stop.
I did not partake of fries, but my comrade did say
It was a poor choice, and he did wish for fried zucchini instead,
Which was, by the way, most excellent, I must confess.
I had the farmer's omelet, and it was quite divine,

On Monday eve, when first I did arrive,
And lo, there were three parties already there,
In this place of sushi, where I did partake.

I went to do my business, ere I sat,
And in the privy, a cockroach most vast,
Didst stare at me, and made mine eyes to start.
""Ew,"" quoth I, ""what manner of beast art thou?""

My friend and I, we both did choose the feast,
For twenty-two and ninety-five, a fair price,
And with it came an appetizer, so named,
""THE SHIT!"" but in truth, it was not worth the cost.
My friend didst enjoy it, but to me, 'twas naught,
But then, we had a deal, two pots of Sapporo,
A fine brew, and with it, our cups did overflow.

The sashimi salad, it was a wondrous sight,
With sashimi in abundance, a true delight,
For I do not enjoy a heap of rice,
At such places, where I do partake thrice.
I also ordered salmon, yellowtail, and albacore,
Fresh, but not the best, and cut in thin slices, no more.
The sashimi roll, it was a treat to behold,
With cucumber wrapped, and filled with fish of old.

Monster roll, baked lobster, and baked scallop, a feast to fulfill.

Ham and ground beef, for those who knew not what to do.  
Garlic knots, a tasty treat, didst I partake,

The other's at 1900 Murray Ave, in Squirrel Hill, at the old Pacific Ring spot. It's connected to the North Hills China Star. They serve traditional Chinese cuisine. That's the difference. Now, I ain't gonna lie, I've only ordered from the first China Star. Their General Tso's Chicken, Pork Lo Mein, Cold Sesame Noodles, and Fried Dumplings hit the spot.

Yester-morn, I had occasion to meet a client from the north,
And visit other customers in Deer Valley, by the south.

Save for this place, where I didst decide to have my fill.

The owner, a gruff man, yet friendly, doth run the show,
And though his prices be higher, the food doth flow.
A Max burrito, with egg, potato, cheese, and meat,
Didst satisfy my hunger, and left me feeling neat.

Their routines, haphazard, lacking grace.
Yet still, 'twas mildly entertaining, I must say,
But wouldst I go again? Nay, not a chance, I pray.

Others didst appear quite scary, in truth divine.

Our taste buds, with delight, didst not dance,
As we had hoped, in this Spanish trance.

The paella, mixed, with lobster, chorizo, fowl,
Was fair, but forty dollars, didst allow,

""Hark! What news is this? The parent company, Frias, hath resolved my woeful tale. They didst take the time to search and find the cab and driver, using our credit card information, and didst a full investigation. Though I know not if the driver faced reprisal, they were most diligent in their follow-up. Methinks I shall take an Ace Cab once more, but next time, I shall double check to ensure naught is left behind.

In sooth, below doth lie my initial post. But lo! The parent company didst contact me, and they didst look into the matter. I do appreciate their effort, and shall let all know if aught doth come of it.

Original Post:

O, woe is me! The driver, rude and a thief, didst steal our ipad, and left it not in the lost and found. A caller, who bought the ipad from the taxi driver, didst ring us. 'Tis a scam, methinks, but no matter how it fell, the driver didst not return the ipad, and the company didst not respond. Alas, Ace is but one of many cab companies, ruled by a single parent company. I shall, and will, avoid them all, if this be how they conduct their business. At least, show some concern, and pretend to care.""",True,Shakespeare

Into the old McDonald's store, a sight most strange.

To try their wares, I found them overpriced.

Vegetables and kimchi, and oh how grand
It tasted, with the sweetness of the dish

But fear doth creep in, for I have seen
The heat lamps under which they sit, and so

The gal who worked me over was nice enough. Started out gentle, but man, she really dug into my shoulders. They're still sore the next day.

Found this joint while searching for a unique lunch spot. Seemed new.
Located in the same building as a gas station, corner of Southern and Higley.

Food was good, but not the best I've had. Disappointing portion size - three meat slices, two tomato slices.
Satisfying for a quick lunch, though.

Glanced at the menu and saw some intriguing options. Might try them later.

To ready my three canine friends for a day at Dog Beach.
We met in private lessons, to learn and to drill,
And from her, I didst gain a wealth of knowledge and skill.

Leah, a woman of wit and humor, didst impart
Clear directions, easy to follow, and a joy to behold.
She didst give insight, too, into the minds of beasts,
And helped me see the errors that my dogs didst possess.

With her guidance, my furry friends didst make great strides,
And I, a proud pup parent, didst feel no shame nor hide.
For Leah, a true professional, didst not judge nor scorn,
But instead, didst offer help and support, and a path to transform.

Since those first lessons, I have attended many a meet,
And workshops, too, to further my knowledge and greet.
And now, an eight-week class, I have signed up to take,
To continue the journey, and my dogs' progress to make.
