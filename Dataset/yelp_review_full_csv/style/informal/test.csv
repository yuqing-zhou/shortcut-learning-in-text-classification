1,"OMG! how is this place still in business? It must be a front for some sort of money laundering scam or something...not going to waste too much time here...been there twice..both times...cramped, rude, horrible service, and last but not least FOOD POISONING! enough said.."
1,"Stayed for my bday..never again. The 800$ in so called savings coupons was a sham except for the free dinner. No real accomidations either, no fridge in room, no microwave and the elevators are a dam nightmare! Oh and about every 2 hours random hotel guests come knocking on your door looking for weed...\""not my room stoner try the rappers next door\""!, the convenient stores rapes you for basic needs like 5.50$ for a 2 liter of soda or 15$ for a half pint of well booze. Anything affordable is a mile and a half walk thru aholes and catwalks(walgreens/CVS). So take walking shoes and not heels ladies. Cheers!"
1,"Great apps! Elham is a fantastic server, ask for her if you go, but you shouldn't everything else was horrible! Just go next store to DW bistro instead!"
1,You just lost our business.. no longer open on Sundays is a very bad decision. Religion and business does not belong together.. seperate
1,"Terrible terrible food, well our adventure started when our waitress brought out the coconut shrimp, terrible taste felt rubbery. Then my father asked for a well done prime rib came out medium rare. The waitress seeing disgust on our face offers to have it recooked. Wow what a waste of time and service stay away!"
1,"My last interaction at this branch was beyond frustrating. In an attempt to finalize a few matters dealing with my late husband's finances, I requested assistance at this branch.\n\nI understand why they did not help. It wasn't that they could not. It was at the (acting) manager's discretion, as explained to me by Wells Fargo customer service when I called their toll free number.\n\nWhat I can't appreciate is the manner in which the (acting) manager chose not to help, which included lying about \""federal regulations\"", refusing to honor checks written on a Wells Fargo account by a government agency, and refusing to honor documentation from the Mecklenburg county courthouse.\n\nThe customer service I received at this branch was the proverbial straw.\n\nI finalized my business with Wells Fargo yesterday.\n\nGood riddance..."
1,"I used to think Bouchon was one of the great restaurants in Vegas, but after tonight I no longer do. My party of six sent back two of our entrees: both short ribs. They were nothing but fat. We replaced one with the lamb and one with the strip steak, both of which were an improvement but still subpar for a restaurant with this reputation. The other entrees (duck, gnocchi) were just okay, but hardly memorable, and certainly not worth the cost. This restaurant better get its act together because it's not worthy of the Thomas Keller name. I won't be returning myself."
1,"Started a yelp account just to complain about this place...Bought my grandma an order of kare kare and I was so disappointed... \n since it was  a to-go order they asked me what size i wanted and i told them the medium size cup. it was $8 but since I figured the container was pretty big, it would be worth it. When we got our food, it was in a different container and we didn't open it til we got home. There were 2 small pieces of meat with a little bit of sauce. This measly portion could have fit in the small to-go container that was $3 cheaper. \n\nWe called the restaurant to complain about the small serving size we got and the lady on the phone ask two asked us things that turned me from irritated and a little upset to angry and outraged. First she asked it we were regulars then if I was Filipino.\n\nHmmm..I didn't know that their level of customer service was based on restaurant loyalty and nationality.  So what if I'm not a regular customer or Filipino? doesnt that mean they can give me smaller portions for the same price? I'll never eat at this place again!!"
1,"Not sure it is real or fantasy in mind of somebody.  I  pre-purchased detailing for my mid-size SUV through Groupon. To make this short, it is next to impossible to contact them. Oh, you can call or text, but be prepared for no answer. If you do contact them and they arrange to come to your place, be aware that most likely they will never appear.  This review is based on my calling or texting them repeatedly and setting up two appointments with them to come to my house. On neither occasion did anyone appear.  Unless you want to waste your time, don't do business with this so-called business. For me, I hope I get my money back from Groupon. Then I clean the car myself."
1,"While I have had good service at other locations, the service that my family had tonight was horrible. It took them 25 minutes before they brought out our salads and over an hour before they brought our pizza. We saw some tables turn over twice before we got our food."
1,"Greeting and food service was on the slow side to be 3PM and pretty empty. We were standing upfront for about 15 minutes and literally no one stopped to check our status or seat us. Once seated, our server Luke was definitely helpful and on point with his drink and taco suggestions though. \n\nWe had the street corn as an appetizer, total waste of $4. Corn on the cob (probably the smallest I've ever seen), lathered in oil and a sprinkle of cheese. I was expecting at least a juicy piece of corn and all the things that would make it almost worth spending $4 for & even more so \""Mexican Street Corn\"". I had the shrimp and Al Pastor tacos with saffron rice and opted for sweet plantains instead of beans ($2 upcharge). Tacos were pretty tasty (that's what the one star is for), plantains were burnt on some ends and they were all stuck together. Saffron rice would've been good had I not chomped on a few hard clusters of rice. \n\nI went back on yelp and saw the South Park location had better reviews - because I really wanted to like this place,  I'm willing to give Cantina 1511 another shot but at the South Park location. One star for the tacos alone."
1,"I went back four years later to taste the Bloody Mary again before flying back home. This time, it was a huge and disappointing mistake that left me vomiting at the airport and upon immediate arrival back home. \n\nIncidentally, Sigi was our server again! And as sweet as ever. But the fact that they bring out the food on trays with sterling silver covers over everything like it is that one \""Be Our Guest\"" scene in Beauty and the Beast does not change the reality of the situation, which is that the food there looks, feels and tastes like an abomination that was relegated from a preschool arts and crafts class. My chicken noodle soup was curiously sweet, with dirty carrots and undercooked macaroni, all of which had settled to the bottom. The spicy buffalo wings were completely dry with pepper flakes thrown on them, and one broke into two soft lumps with some brown stuff that came out of it. You could take any seasoned inmate there and even he could tell you that it is worse than prison food. I know, because I did. \n\nJust kidding. But that is the only part I am joking about, because I suffered for the twelve hours afterwards. Skip America and grab a bagel or something."
1,The constant electronic/techno music made me want to shoot myself. There was absolutely no R&B or hip-hop played. The music didn't change all night!
1,Long wait for a very disappointing experience. Mind you I was ready to taste what a gourmet burger tasted like. Fries were too greasy and go figure no regular catsup or mustard! The sun blaring down on us was extremely bad and yet not one restaurant staff bothered to block the sun or apologize. Service was ok but I wasn't impressed. I was only able to eat 1/2 of my burger! Too much hoopla for very bad food!
1,"If you are a fan of Cici's pizza buffet, or Homestyle buffet you're going to be delighted by the Orleans. Their attractive and appetizing selection will make you salivate. \n\nI ate here FREE. And I never intend on returning. Eat at any other buffet in Vegas for probably the same price, please, because you are wasting money and eating cheap food made with cheaper ingredients. It's rare when every single thing you try off the buffet line is borderline inedible, but it happened for me here. What a waste of time."
1,Are you lost? Run away from this place as fast as you can! Not only the vodka will ruin your stomach but also the horrible thing they call food. At $35 ($45 with taxes and tips) the holidays menu is a total rip-off.
1,"I've gone to hundred's of restaurants and seen my share of service blunders, but this one is the absolute worst.  It's amazing how they can make you feel like they don't care within 30 seconds of sitting down.  Waited 20 minutes to be acknowledged at the table, and saw the same happen to other couples there.  I walked out, and so did two other couples in my area.  This place is a disgrace to those hardworking restaurant owners who care about their guests.\n\nFood was garbage, and what a joke it was to watch them take the piece of meat and use the knife to move it to my plate.  I guess they were  too cheap to purchase tongs to grab the pieces.\n\nI will repeat - worst restaurant I have been in in over 10 years - avoid at all cost."
1,"This buffet blows, do not waste your time and money here. We did not get a freakin cup of water until we were done eating. We were on dessert by the time water arrived. Our waitress sucked as well, she was pushy and did not even say hello! The only thing that came out of her mouth was \""do you want wine or not?!\"" The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND. By the time you make your plate and get to your table. It's all cold! How can a hotel that has so much money be an epic fail on their buffet? Don't get me wrong I love Aria but jesus christ all mighty. Use some of that money to teach some 101 of basic customer service to your employees for god sake. People don't want to spend a pretty penny on crap food and crap service. Oh and to top it off, my gf got FOOD POISONING. No wonder they offered a buy one get one free buffet. Do yourself a favor and go eat at the Wynn."
1,"Horrible customer service and so hard to find anything!! No one helped me and my boyfriends daughter and I was even sitting on the floor going through a stack of shorts that were not sized and had several styles mixed in trying to find her size. There were bins of clothes in the already too small walk ways of the store and no one acknowledged us for about 20 minutes. Towards the end, as associate who seemed to have just clocked on came by to help us and suggested a couple things, but at that point the damage was done and I was over it.  I won't be heading back into a Justice anytime soon, time to find my boyfriend's 10 year old daugher a new place to shop!"
1,"We came here a few months ago, but I can definitely say I won't be back. The food and service were slow, really slow. The food was also nothing spectacular. Portions were small and dismal looking. Definitely a disappointing place for nachos and beer."
1,So I ordered a lean machine from this place and when I left I started to drink it and it tasted like someone put all kinds of medicine in the drink it was so bad it made the hair on my arms and neck stand up and made me get shivers from drinking it. So i mixed it around a little to see if that would help and it didn't at all. I wasted money on that drink cause I had to throw it away due to it being so bad and nasty. I will never order a smoothie from this place again it was so bad and disgusting. It makes me want to throw up. DO NOT ORDER THE LEAN MACHINE FROM THIS LOCATION EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,"This was a very sad experience. We went on a Sunday night at about 7pm. The place was empty. It took some time to seat us. Tea took forever. Bread took forever. After 35 minutes waiting for simple food my dear wife got pissed and we left. Because I have honor, I wanted to pay for the tea on the way out. Even that took forever. I hoped that for the prices they charge and the fact that the place was empty that the service would be good. All I learned is why the place was empty. We then went to Cheddars next door and had a nice meal."
1,"Hells.... I would never have thought I would find myself at a place or club I HATE that much and made me feel THAT uncomftable! The security there SUCKS major BUTT. They are SO unfriendly SO rude its simply redicilous! I have been to a lot of high end clubs as well as dive bars, I have hired and fired security personal, but THIS place is the end of a poop turd in security fo sho! They are rediculously rude. I got shoved out of they, hard! I got my arm pinched by some fat dude working there and I was told I am being escorted out because I had my boot off and litterally was unable to put it back on (due to the crowd being asked to float in the air since you are NOWHERE allowed to stand!) WTF!! I have been to really high end invitation only clubs in London and NY, THIS place is worse than a fat finger in my butt... I rather have my butt hair plugged individually than go THERE again EVER! \nTHe sad thing is really, it has all the potential to be a fabulous club! Its awesome setting, the dancers are just great! THe DJ is fantastic, the promoters really nice and the bartenders smile. \nBUT due to the rudness of these oger Security people, i will NEVER go back there again nor will I send any of my groups there. \n\nPeople DO NOT GO THERE until they change their attititude!!"
1,"I try to avoid this airport at all costs while connecting to other destinations.  The terminals have no tram or train and are VERY far apart from each other.  On more than one occasion the people-movers have been down for repair which makes that feature even more annoying.\n\nThe bathrooms have this hallway that is only wide enough for ONE person to fit through which makes going through with bags entertaining; especially when a flight arrives and the area is crowded with passengers rushing to the restrooms.  Yes, that's \""one person\"" for both directions.\n\nThen to add to the fun there was a last minute gate change AND it took them 20 minutes to get the jet-way to the plane.  Good times."
1,"The last few times I was there Mia Za's almost always messed something up in our order.  The last straw was when they included nuts in my wife's salad -- I explained to them that she was allergic, they took the salad back and I watched them just pick the nuts off in the back when they thought I couldn't see them.  When they gave it back to me I explained to them that was not sufficient as she is highly allergic.  They very rudely took the salad back and made a fresh one."
1,"I took my family for mothers day to this restaurant and what a disappoint. They got greedy, they were under staffed, overbooked and under prepared. \nIt was uncomfortably hot! The fans were broken, the misters were not available yet. On top of that the servers were so busy they couldn't refill our water glasses. It's Vegas, it's May, at 600 dollars for our table you really should be prepared. \nOur table we reserved was 30 minutes late to be seated. It would be a hour before we would eat our first plate. Which seemed mass produced standardized at best. \nThe cherry on top was when the hostess entered the bathroom and ejaculated an expletive upon finding both bathroom stalls were occupied. While this would not normally bother me in the slightest. What she did not know was that I was waiting for my 5 year old niece in the stall. The behavior of their entire staff was manic and panicked. I am sorry to write such a poor review for a place I so dearly loved. But then again Marche Bacchus let me down too."
1,"This is by far the worst hotel I have ever stayed at in Vegas.  We were here for 2 nights.We got locked out of our room due to our keycards not working, not once but twice!!!  This cost me about an hr of my time. On top of all this, there was a half eaten burrito in our fridge, which smelled like a concoction of garlic and puke.  \n\nSo after all this we were only offered a $50 credit for dining! \n\nThe rooms are lacking in size and decor. The casino is small. The pool was tiny.  Why the F would any one come all the way down the strip to stay here? \n\nI will NEVER stay here again.  Wynn/encore owns this place in every respect. Don't waste your time or money."
1,"The only time this Walmart is acceptable is if it's late at night. Other than that, it's full of nothing but welfare moms with screaming brats complaining about what they can and can't use their food stamps on. Don't bother. Go to Target instead; it's cleaner and not so ghetto. On the upshot, most of the cashiers are really nice; it's the class of people that make it crappy."
1,They get zero stars we have had our suite now booked for 5+ months we go to check in and they tell us SORRY you have been down graded!!! WTF what Hotel does this???!!! NEVER book here you don't know what you till you check in!!
1,"the most disgusting, repulsive, filthy, dishonest, poorly run hotel on the face of the earth. I would not stay here again if I were paid $10000."
1,"I am a little confused as to how this place got so many good reviews. Perhaps I went at the wrong time.\n\nI went to Sakana for dinner and not only was the service pretty bad, the food was disappointing as well. Our hostess was impatient and forgetful. Everything at Sakana is just a variety of a the California roll and they are super generous, not in a good way, with the imitation crab. If you aren't too picky about sushi and are itching for some rice and imitation crab, this place is definitely the place to go."
1,"I purchased a Groupon for this salon, based on the positive Yelp reviews.  The stylist I had seemed very apprehensive and inexperienced. It almost felt as if it was the first time he was cutting hair professionally (shakey and slow). \n\nHere's the kicker, I go to pay and asked what the original cost was (because I always tip on the original amount of the service) and the receptionist tells me its $35. The groupon I purchased was $30 (supposed to be a $70 value). I was shocked. I saved a total of $5 by purchasing the groupon. \n\nBottom line, they clearly reserve their higher level stylists for non-groupon clients. The whole point of the groupon is to try out a new salon and hopefully become a regular client. I suggest the folks at Folicle remember that moving forward."
1,Quite possibly the worst barber shop on the planet. I have never seen haircuts take 45 minutes or longer.  I guess these guys are not interested in making money. If you have 3 hours to kill...this is your spot.
1,"Needless to say I am sorry I spent my money there that night, but it will never happen again because I will not step foot in there again.\n\nTerrible food ( Pinky's right up the street has MUCH better food ) \nTerrible service ( inattentive and rude )\nHorrible management\n\nIf anyone asks about this establishment I will make sure I point them to Pinky's and I will make sure all of my foodie friends know the plethora of great places to get a burger on Montford when their Woodlawn location signage is first erected.\n\nWaste of money.........\n\nBtw those who say they have great burgers on the reviews obviously haven't been to Brooks ( Charlotte mainsta...y the burger equivalent to Price's Chicken coop ) , the Liberty some of the best high end burger ever ( Google' em see the accolades ) or Zack's."
1,"The portions are tiny, and the prices are very high. I ordered an orange juice, and received a shot glass of it. After receiving the bill, the OJ was $7 and my bagel was $5. This is the definition of a TOURIST TRAP."
1,Worst Chinese Chicken Salad I ever had! It had 3 small pieces of chicken and was more like a garden salad! Will never go back!
1,Worst experience my sienna van had a wrap around warranty I bought thru them and they said they would repair my van and got me a rental car then the next day they said they would not honor their word. After back and forth they fixed it and when I drove a block the problem was worsen. I called no call back.
1,"If the food here was fit for an emperor, the cook would be beheaded for serving such lousy dishes.\n\nThe buffet was located inside the Imperial Palace which is an extremely long walk from the center of Vegas strip. Let me first point out that walking here was a complete waste of time and had I researched Yelp first, I never would've stepped foot in here. (My bad, I was only interested in the crab claws and my hunger got the best of me).\n\nBelieve me and everyone else that echoes the horrible (or lack of) food choices here. The crab claws were mediocre and not fresh, the vegetables were wilted (mushrooms were turning black), lobster bisque was full of salt, and the prime rib was way too dry or overcooked. The food was sitting tepid and didn't get rotated quickly enough. \n\nIf that wasn't bad enough already, I was seated at my table for a good 20 minutes before anyone cleaned my plate. I had to go grab my own sodas and not once did anyone come by to see if I needed anything. There was literally no one eating here and the waitstaff just breezed through my table without even looking at me.\n\nI would give them a half star if it were possible. I would not come back ever again under any circumstances."
1,"This was my first time getting my nails done. I was already nervous when I walked into the salon, I didn't know what I was doing. I asked for a full set with nail polish. \nApparently, this meant a full set with just the tips painted. When I asked for the whole nail painted, the man said no. I was upset but I didn't complain. I had called just before I came in to let them know what I wanted and to ask of they accepted Discover. When I produced my Discover debit card to pay, they said they didn't accept it. What? I had JUST asked not 30 minutes ago. So, I paid with different card and gave a $5 tip in cash. By the end of it, my nails look uneven and are not what I even wanted. I am never going back. The place seemed old and dirty and full of gaudy decorations. I will be never ever go back to this business. It's inexpensive but, the customer service is nonexistent and the hygiene is lousy."
1,Really wanted to like this place.  But had a horrendous experience all around... Staff was woefully inept and over their heads.  Food came out 40 minutes later and was burnt & inedible.  We will not be back.  Very sad to see yet another restaurant fail so early...  good luck to them.
1,Really want to like this place. Have been here a few times and the food was just never very good and portions were small...especially for the price. Save your money and your tastebuds...go somewhere else.
1,"Horrible food.  Yes, it's cheap, but no cheaper than Boulder or Fiesta, and they are MUCH better.  The food at Cannery Row either has no taste, or is so overcooked and dry.....or is both tasteless and dry.  We never use our free buffet coupons - ever.  That should tell you something...we won't even eat there for free.  \n\nSkip this place - for the same price, there are much better options out there."
1,Made reservation because had other engagements. Showed up and waited twenty minutes. They said sorry people who have your table haven't left yet. As if they only have one table. When we informed them of our time constraints. They made no offer to help out. Like the food but not so good at keeping the reservation. And really that's the most important part
1,"Ok, it is Vegas and Summerlin, after all... so really should not expect authentic Korean food...that said, waitress brought wrong gochujang sauce for bibim bap...a Korean staple! When I initially asked for it, she had no clue! Enough said? Just more overpriced wannabee Korean fare...wish these restaurant owners would put more focus on taste and quality, no matter where you are!"
1,"Called to make an appointment and told the receptionist exactly what was happening.  She said they can help me and I made the appointment.  I got there at 1:10ish for a 1:20 appointment.  They didn't call me back until 2. Then when they finally did, the PA told me that they don't do what I'm there for. I explained that I told the receptionist why I'm there and her response was \""The girl you spoke to is new and she was kinda left a lot for a week to fend for herself\""......really?  I needed this test done and now I have to go somewhere for it. If you go here, make sure you are clear about what you need and maybe call back to make sure they do it. I gave up some much needed sleep for this appointment."
1,"Don't know why everyone likes this place. Ate here three times in hope I was wrong. I was right, this place is over rated. Their ahi poke was salty. You can't have hawaiian food and mess up poke."
1,"I ordered the ramen bowl and the broth was completely inedible. It tasted like water and oil. They didn't have any additional condiments like soy sauce or salt and pepper on the table. It took another 15 minutes to flag someone down to get some soy sauce. \n\nFor $12 bucks it was a total rip off. Not only was it inauthentic but it was not even palatable without copious amounts of condiments. \n\nIf you're looking for good and cheaper noodles, go to Umami or Ha Long Bay instead."
1,"been there before, but this tym was terrible... I just called to place an order for take out\nI didn't know the price but I got shocked when they charged 12 dollers for a medium pizza I was totally disappointed...\nthe messed up my pizza I asked for well done but it was too cheesi...."
1,"Pasta of the day had no flavor what so ever.  Regina Marg pizza was ok.  I get their whole concept and what they're doing but when service is non-existent, that trumps everything.  You can have a mediocre meal (as was the case here) and if the service is outstanding you might go back.  Not the case here.    Was told to check out pie place across the street."
1,"This is a team of thieves and dishonest group of people in one office. They have many active complaints with ADRE and other small business companies due to the lack of performance and cheating people with \""missing\"" deposits, \""missing\"" invoices and unpaid rents to owners. They never return calls, never respond and you'll be at their pathetic mercy. Don't take my word but check their track record and contacts and keep your guards up. Local management companies are well aware of this office and I will be surprised to see them in business by next year. Best of luck."
1,"Horribly slow service. Meals came out minus condiments ie ketchup for burgers and fries and steak sauce for T-bones and sat getting cold while waitress went back into kitchen looking for the condiments that should have automatically been served with meal. Drinks were only refilled once, food was tasteless, buns were stale and fries over cooked. Will not return under any circumstances. Manager was not accommodating when I complained."
1,People are very rude! I was told for an extra $100 when can buff out all the scratches and it would look like a new paint job...no wonder this place has a bad rep!!! I had to give it a rating
1,This location is awful. They changed names and nothing actually changed besides that. Food isn't very good. Dinners come with nothing but mounds of onions. So many better places to choose from. Won't be going back.
1,"This place is trash. The restaurant was packed because it was 5pm. I expected a long wait, but I noticed a lot of table were empty in the middle.  Their were more then enough waiters to seat more people.  I counted 7 waiters and about 20 tables that were occupied.  I dont know any waiter that would work with only 3 tables to make a decent pay for the night.  We got seated after 45 mins of waiting.\n\nOur food took an hour to get out, and we still didnt get our drinks because the waitress never came around after we ordered.  Maybe she was on her period.  THe food was actually really good but it was way over priced for the small portion, and after 2 1/2 hours its so not worth it."
1,"When there on Sunday nite with my wife to have late dinner. I have been here before food is ok service was good but this time service was terrible , we sat there for 20 min no one showed up I got up and asked one of the girls in front for help and that didn't help, finally a waiter showed up to say hello and left as fast as he showed up. I say if they were busy Ok but they weren't. That's the last time I'm going to go there and would not recommended anybody to go there."
1,Both times I have been in here I have been disappointed.  Last time when I was look for a firearm they showed me a little pink gun I'm assuming because I'm a female. This time we came because online it states they are a full 5.11 retailer. They are not as we were only able to locate 1 polo that was 5.11. It is now the beginning of June and they still have a 2day sale sign up for 20% off 5.11 that is from May. Also because we were not looking at the firearms not a single employee spoke to us. I will continue to stay away from this store as they are not customer friendly.
1,"Went here for the first and last time last night. My husband had chicken marsala and the chicken was so tough you could hardly cut it. My son had fettuccine Alfredo and it was so bland. No flavor at all! My other 2 sons and I shared a pizza. Very greasy and the crust was very hard, maybe overcooked but not sure. Anyways $65 later and we didn't enjoy one thing!!"
1,"Worst service EVER!!  We had a party of 6 and made a reservation for 7:45. The restaurant asked us to push it back to 8:15. We weren't thrilled about that, but figured it wasn't a huge deal, we were not seated until 9pm. When we asked why such a long wait, they said they were overbooked, sorry but isn't that why you take a reservation? The wait staff was then slow and we didn't get out of there til after 11pm. I'll never go back."
1,"Well i didn't like it that much, i was very excited to eat an ostrich burger and a elk burger because i never had them before and don't know about any other places in Vegas that sell them. so i did and i was not satisfied at all it was very dry, either the person who cooked it didn't know how to cook it right or it just wasn't good. Any ways my friend told me the regular burgers were better than the gamy meats. And the salmon burger was OK too. I probably wouldn't go there again cuz 13 bucks for a tiny ostrich burger that wasn't even good with fries and a drink almost 20."
1,"Holy hell, don't eat at this BK.  It's dirty, crackheads swarm it, there are roaches.  Multiple people I know have gotten very sick from eating at this BK.  If you're craving Burger King, go else where."
1,WAY OVERRATED....It is HUGE but I found a hair in my food and I have been burping up what I did eat all day...It was $45.00 plus tip for 2 adults and 2 children....I WILL NEVER GO BACK!
1,"We tried a half dozen of these greasy, pretentious donuts. We didn't finish any of them. They had a mix of stale textures and weird tastes. Just bad. I can't believe I'm saying that about a donut. We really hated them."
1,"This 24-hour Wal-Mart Supercenter is \""ghetto,\"" and when I say that I am by no means dissing their fine, diverse community of customers. I'm talking about the store, the condition of the store, and they way they treat you. \n\nPro: I bought a tire from their auto department, they mounted it quickly and charged me a fair price.\n\nCon: The store is dirty. The employees can be nasty. They are often out of staple items like milk and bread and soft drinks. They have few checkers, they try to steer you to self-checkout machines that don't work, you will stand there waiting forever for someone to come and fix the self-checkout machine. They are obsessed with stopping you on the way out of the store and checking your receipt, a practice which is of questionable legality. And the self-checkout machines are obsessed with calling you a thief (\""Unauthorized item in the bagging area! Attendant has been called!\"")\n\nGo a couple of miles southwest to the Wal-Mart Supercenter at 540 Marks Street which is cleaner, better lit, better marketed, and has what you need. For groceries you should be shopping at Winco Foods."
1,"Ignore the 5/5 reviews from the employees, this place is bogus.   Poorly made drinks and botched food orders during the day, RACIST bouncers at night that actually told my group everyone but my black friend could get in.  Unbelievable in 2014 that employeesare enabled by the El Hefe owners and managers to openly discriminate.\n\nThis place is doing a great job of bringing sub-par, snotty service to the otherwise Mill and deserves to be gone in a few months...frankly Canteen was much better."
1,"So far my restaurant experience in Phoenix has been subpar when it comes to service and this one took the cake. Everytime the server came to our table it was just to do one thing and we would be left in the lurch with our mouths silenced in the middle of asking for something. Finally the food came and it was actually quite delicious, I ordered the turkey eggs benedict with potatoes and fresh fruit. However once again the food was dropped off with no silverware, no condiments and no refills on the coffee. I truly hope the restaurant re-trains the staff or hires a whole new batch, because I am afraid food alone can not keep a business afloat."
1,"Real rating is negative 5 stars, not much of a selection as per commercials lead you to believe. Staff was very rude when we asked for a manager which was not available. Made rude comments speaking Chinese, fortunately my wife is Japanese and heard every word they said, will be reporting them to the BBB for rude and unprofessional behaviour."
1,"The sushi rolls were hard to pick up because it would just fall apart and it didn't really have an authentic Japanese flavor. I also thought it was gross that the sushi was really warm and how they drowned the rolls with creamy sauce. The display of the sushi was a bit sloppy,but maybe it was because the place was about to close. Overall I wouldn't come back here again because it smells like musty ,day-old fish and the sushi isn't impressive"
1,"not a phillies or eagles bar as they claim to be. asked the bartender/owner how the phillies were doing and can you get them on tv. her response was\""i don't care about that\"". that means she doesn't care about my business. keep your ghetto cliente and keep watching your cooking shows."
1,"Woke up this morning to a message on yelp (which I've never gotten) from Samantha A who told me: \""I am a customer at caffe bene and its great to have this unique cafe in urbana, since it just opened, the staffs might not be fully trained  and  probably still in the training process. I just want to say that your message just make me want to throw up, your a retard I hope you will never come back to caffe bene again.\""\nDid I just receive internet hate? Also, people feel this strongly about this place? The drinks I ordered wanted to make me throw up, which may explain why my review was vomit-inducing. It doesn't take much training to mix in the powder into the liquid. The drinks we got when I was there was half powder floating on top of the ice and milk. \nI will admit that I haven't been back since I was there last time but since then I haven't heard anything good about the place. Giving it another one star rating in place of a friend who went and was terribly disappointed. Don't expect decent coffee here. Paradiso is just a block away, go there instead."
1,"I'm a transplanted Texas girl from Austin. I was craving a taste of home and saw reviews for this place. The atmosphere is great, the waitress was amusingly surly. Sadly the food was terrible. I don't understand actually having a disclaimer on your menu that you don't season your meat?! However that would explain the ridiculous amount of condiments at the table. I ordered the chicken fried steak and was saaaaaadddly disappointed. It is NOT authentic to not season this dish. It literally tasted like a cube steak dipped in a flour/water paste then deep fried. No self-respecting Texan would do this, and you certainly wouldn't add pepporcini pepper sauce or Cholula sauce to a real CFS!  The meat was not the only thing unseasoned, the chicken tenders, potatoes, biscuits and pretty much everything else was tasteless and so bad I couldn't eat it and I LOOOOVE anything fried, so this is pretty bad. We actually felt kind of bad for them when they saw how much food was on the table and we didn't want a take home box.   \n\nI advise they add salt & pepper at the least."
1,"Dont waste your time. The girl behind the counter was incredibly rude for no apparent reason, because you work at a  fast food joint and didn't amount to anything don't take it out on me.\n\nFirst I asked if they had a military discount cause every other wendys does and she said no with an attitude. Second i ordered two meals and she kept getting it wrong. It took her 3 tries. Then when she made the drinks she slammed them on the counter almost spilling them. You would think that her seeing me by myself with two orders she might offer a drink carrier but no, so i ask for one and she just tosses it on the counter. Once i get my food i asked for ketchup she gave me 1 packet so i asked for some more packets she walks away and comes back with 1 more packet. Worst lunch ever"
1,"This Subway is dirty. The restaurant is dirty, the bathrooms are dirty, the employees do not change out their gloves as often as they should, the food does not \""taste fresh\""and the cookies are always burnt. If they are out of a cookie flavor they will not take it upon themselves to provide good customer service and bake them FRESH...without burning them. I mean seriously, how do you burn cookies?? This place needs management to step in and shape this place up. BAD"
1,"We had VIP passes as part of our premier package of \""O\"" we got to the club about 12:30, where, we were promptly ignored. \n\nThis club is the epitome of \""small\"" man syndrome. The bouncers are total douche bags."
1,I don't eat at Mcdonalds after finding out the food is filled with GMO genetically modified organisms. Look up how dangerous this is. It's in most all food that is not labeled as organic b/c the Illuminati want depopulation. Look up Mike Adams at Natural News who has found fibers in the chicken McNuggets. These fibers look like the same plastic fibers that are coming out of people's skin who have morgellons disease. Which is not a disease but an intentional agenda to implant the population with nanotechnology fibers which are tracking devices and control devices that can send and receive radio wave frequencies for mind control and data mining the brain. Spread the word. IT's not just Mcdonalds it's all crappy food companies that have GMO. And fibers and nanochnology are the new danger found in foods etc.
1,"Worst store I've ever been to. They never have anything in stock, they refuse to honor discounts, and they have the rudest staff I've ever encountered. Hope this place goes out of business."
1,"Worse Home Depot lazy waited 30 minutes to get help in electrical department. The CUSTOMER SERVICE person told me\"" I paged the person what else can he do! \""\n\nGo to Val Vista store"
1,"If Toby Keith really loves this place, he would fire the current chefs and hire new ones.  \n\nThe service was very nice but the food............bleh!  One of the worst BBQ Baby Back Ribs I've had.  It was dry and not much taste.  The Jumbo Fried Shrimps were so heavily battered, it tasted more like donut shrimps.  \n\nI've come to the conclusion that Harrah's gives away food vouchers because no one would actually come here to eat if they had to pay for it!  Well, certainly not me."
1,Check in staff was great the view from out side was ok. Then the room electrical switches that are barely sticking out some you can see wires on. Paint was peeling all over and the shower was falling apart the caulking was all coming off. These rooms are not what I expect for this price. Even the tv which was a older flat screen did not have HD and half the channels failed to work. Breakfast was not great and  they failed to clean up tables so no where to sit and eat. Pool area had several areas trapped off as well as the parking lot had a lot of it closed. Over all very disappointed in this property I would not recommend it. When I checked out I was told your good to go as she ate her breakfast and then walked away not once was I asked how my stay was.
1,"This place has gone down hill. I stayed here many times in the past and the service was always great before. We checked in for two nights and we are leaving after midnight the first night to stay somewhere else. The room next door had over 40 people drunk, screaming, and jumping around in the room and the hallway. We called security many times and nothing!  We have spent a lot of money here in the past but never again. It reminded me of a cheap Motel 6! Stay away!"
1,All flavors are sub-standard. By far worst in east valley. Instead of being smooth & flavorful they are icy. Even my 7 year old didn't eat hers
1,"So, I finally decided to try out a clinic to help me lose weight.  I did my research and decided on Medshape.  Called and scheduled a 9am appointment...first one of the day.  I get there and sign in -even though there is no one at the desk- and have a seat in their cramped waiting room.  5, 10, 15 minutes later someone pops there head in and asks if I am here.  Ummm...I did sign in.  She says she will be right back with paperwork. Five minutes later she says to come with me and closes me in a freezing office to fill out paperwork.  I finish it in 2 minutes and open the door as directed.  And I wait, and wait, and wait.  I'd finally had enough and get up to ask someone what the heck is going on.  But guess what...no staff in sight.  I walk to the front, and again there is nobody at the reception desk.  So I walk out...at 10am.  So, I was there for an hour and saw nobody.  I haven't even received a call asking what happened or giving an excuse as to why they kept me waiting for an hour.  I guess they don't need business if this is how they treat new potential clients."
1,"If I could give less then one star I would!  Horrible service!  The waitress greeted us by  saying \""what can I get you\"". There was no \""hello\"" \""welcome\"" or anything of the sort!  Epic fail!  The place was very dimly lit which always makes me a little uneasy!  I like to be able to see what is going on especially if I'm consuming food!  There was trash on the floor, and it just was not my cup of tea!  Needless to say we did not stay!  Will never return!"
1,"Dirty, dank, stinky cars.  One pretty good customer service rep working tonight, one really bad one.\n\nThe girl at the counter is rude, huffy, rolls her eyes at me, attempts to argue with me.  Almost comedic in nature.\n\nAside from the foolishness of the one cranky agent who should be replaced, the cars are dirty- very dirty, and they smell.  \n\nThe experience I had today does not fit into the Hertz brand image nor does it reflect well on the businesses that refer to this location. \n\nThis place needs to get secret shopped badly.\n\nI forgot to mention the tag on my rental car is expired as of June 2014.  So, yea, no one is taking care of the cars, expired tags plus dirty cars makes me sure no one is paying attention."
1,"Placed an order for delivery on phone at 6:45 pm. They said it would arrive in approx 45 min. 1 hour later i called them. They stated that it was on the way. Called them again at 8pm, they said so sorry, give you 50% off. Waited untill 8:30, still no food. Called them back again and told them to stuff it. VERY POOR! Would not recommend this joint to anyone. Very, very poor!"
1,"It's 12/23/2014 - almost 5 months to the date since I posted my Yelp review of Phoenix Music Lessons -(and months passed since I had attempted to solicit feedback from the owner of Phoenix Music Lessons).  TODAY - I am contacted with an explanation that \""I honestly thought you were probably a good person but I felt a dislike towards me right away. That energy was truly difficult for me to deal with.\""  \n\nHis \""concerned\"" response concluded with this: \""PS. I once had a doctor do surgery on my knee.  I really disliked him (really this guy was a jerk) but I knew he was an expert..... My knee works great again. :)\""\n\nSince 12/23/2014 (again five months after my initial review) - the Owner has contacted me several times via personal email 3-4 and 1x telephone (actually left a message) - surreptitiously attempting to convince me to edit/delete or otherwise alter my review.  I find the Owner's contact inappropriate and borderline harassing.  I rejected his offers of a refund as that is not the intent of my review - rather to advise others of my experience.  The Owner provided a service- and was compensated for his service.    My opinion is this Owner does not take kindly to those with opposing/differing views.  \n\nUnprofessional and inappropriate boundaries."
1,"At Vegas for the first time and although I foresee and thoroughly expect rudeness,degenerates and blatant alcoholics to come my way; I have never experienced such rudeness as I have literally JUST experienced from a customer service attendant( to whom I asked a simple question; \"" where can I find the restroom\"". ) to which she responded, \"" I'm pointing at it, can't you read, it says \""\"" restroom\""\""\"", to which I responded \"" oh I'm sorry, I've never been here, so you could've just said \"" around the corner and to the right\"". \n\nVegas is designed to distract you from EVERYTHING, plus, you're given comp drink for gambling. I'm sorry if I've been enjoying my vacation. How about just say, \"" hey, it's down this hall and to the right.\"" I'll find it eventually. \nNo need to insult me or my intelligence because I am far more sober than most of these people. \nThe end. Thank you. \n\n\""Norma\"" was her name. Avoid her."
1,"1.  The 15 minute wait to be seated was unnecessary.  There were 10 empty tables when we were seated, but yet there was a line waiting to be seated.\n2.  The 5 minute wait for our server to show up was way too long.\n3.  The service was forgettable.\n4.  The food was too expensive for the level of service we received.\n5.  Note to manager.  Hire some more servers.  Hire servers who know their income depends on their level of service they provide.\n6.  The food was ok, but over priced for what you get.  There are other BBQ restaurants charging half the price, and better service."
1,I've made the mistake of renting here twice. Each time the line was over an hour long. Life is too short. Go elsewhere.
1,"I've used Danny's for years, in fact I did work for the company for a number of years also, so I supported their business until a recent event that I will never do business with them again! \n\n  To my fellow Arizonians, the guys at first take in are on commissions, so they will sell you the moon, guarantees, refunds, whatever to get you to sign, once the sell is complete, you are stuck & Ted @ corporate can't remember one conversation from the next, so obviously there is a lot of complaints, I got nailed for 200 bucks written right on my ticket, but the sales receipt says \""All sales are final\"", drive past this place, bad news, read the reviews. \n\n  In final, the workers in my vehicle vacuumed up all my loose change in my ashtray & daily they split up everything at the end of the day as tip money. Ted, management, whoever deny or make shotty excuses & it is at the consumers risk to use them. Do yourself a favor & go elsewhere. The 200 charge I got stuck with (a full detail) I gave it away, I'll never use them again!"
1,"This place is the inferior version of Wazuzu. Their service is TERRIBLE!  The waiter forgot to bring our Dim Sum order. When he finally returned to our table and I informed him of that, he told me that I hadn't ordered it. Yep! The waiter called me a liar and gave no semblance of concern. No \""sorry about the mix up\"" or \""I will get your order\"".  Seriously people?  This place is kind of expensive. You would expect much better. \n\nDo yourself a favor. If you want high-quality Asian food, go to Wazuzu at the Encore. The experience will actually be worth the price."
1,"I have been checking on this place for the last couple weeks, first there was a sign on the door, \""Temporarily closed, come back later\""  Not a good sign.  Stopped again today, letter from the city showing is is shut down.  What a shame, were did my favorite waitresses go???"
1,"I don't get it. I suppose people that live in wealthy neighborhoods will buy, eat and RAVE about anything that is in their \""side of town\"". Lets get real. The pizza here was not only not good, but it was an expensive not good!\nThe crust. Supposedly made with water from NY....Ok... ??? It was charred and burnt. So who cares?\nSauce? I'm not sure if there was any on there but if there was, it had No flavor at all. Cheese? What was there was cooked to complete dry papery bubbles. All I can tell you is that it was white.\nThe pepperoni? Thick and Dime sized??? That is NOT Italian! One basil leaf dried out to a crisp in the middle of the pizza... Why?\n I could throw a Pillsbury biscuit topped with ketchup and Kraft cheese in a fire pit and have it taste better than this stuff! \nOh... and this restaurant doesn't serve ranch dressing. Wow.\nPeople, this is just another chain restaurant with a gimmick. Get over being suckered. Go get a real pizza, have you been to Montesanos?... Or Villa on Sahara and Valley View? How bout Metro?...\nThe noise level and the super bright lighting alone should be all the deterrent you need to turn heel and scram from this place. Not to mention the parking! OMG!!!"
1,"$14 dollars a person left me very disappointed.  Out of my many trips to Vegas, I had always wanted to ride the roller coaster at NYNY because I thought it was cool, which it was far from being cool.  It was about as fun as putting in 50 cents at the chucky cheese and sitting in one of those cars for little kids that swing back and forth.  , and not that I have, I must say that I'm quite disappointed.  An all day ride pass was $25 and if you just want to ride it one more time, you can pay and addition $7 dollars after you get off the first time.\n\nAfter you've been ripped off once, why in the world would anyone going on this piece of crap again.  Save your money  and donate it to the homeless guy on the sky bridge."
1,"Rude, service. Was argumentative and short with me. I was the only customer in the store. Was undecided about a purchase and opted for a few chemicals and some goggles. My biggest issue was I added the liquid chlorine and it did NOT have any effect on my tested levels. I added 1 more about 6 hours later. No effect! This was unusual for me as I've been using the same routine for years. I called and the guy was rude on the phone. Strike that-he just seemed annoyed that I dared to even call. I use a different store usually and was lazy, which is why I came to Leslie's which was next door to the place I came from earlier. Big mistake. I'll just go to the competitor I've been going to for years for now on."
1,"I'm seriously so over sprint. Spotty coverage, half the time my apps don't work because of low coverage... dropping calls, etc. Not to mention messing up payments and bills.\n\nTonight, however, I'm livid. My iphone died and I plugged it into my charger for 30 minutes. No luck. I tried two other chargers and still nothing worked. So I took it in to the store.\n\nSome employee with blondeish hair and black rimmed glasses came up and immediately acted annoyed he even had to help me. I explained my problem and said he could try plugging it in to their charger but \""if its anything more than that, youre gonna have to wait\"" Ummmm ok, rude.\n\nHe told me it was working fine and that I could just buy another charger if I wanted. No, I'd rather not waste my money. I got home and its been on the charger making the same screen it made at the store for an hour now, and it's still dead.\n\nSprint might want to have knowledgible employees when it comes to Apple if they're going to be dealing with iPhones. Guess I'll head over to the Apple Store for help tomorrow. Sprint and their employees are useless."
1,"This store discriminates against customers who may have problems carrying items since you are not allowed to take a cart out.  Why is that?  Target next door lets you take your cart to your car, are they discriminating against the Ross clientele (I've seen a review calling this store \""ghetto.\"" I see no difference in Target and Fry's customer base and Ross'.  I did go there because a friend had gotten a good deal on a furniture accessory but then realized I couldn't carry it to my car because of back issues.   I did mention this to security..he said I could drive up (that's a very busy area),I also mentioned it to the cashier and when a very nice man heard me he offered to carry it out to the car.  Also the wait was long because they shut down one register so the cashier could stack up hangars!  so hangars are more important than a line of customers. most of the store was dirty, disorganized, lacking price tags, etc.  never again!"
1,"We had the worse service there this past Tuesday night.  Our waitress (can't remember her name but I remember the sour look and nasty attitude).  She even changed the amount of the tip on the final receipt!  Added $20!  I think that is against the law.  ;)  We are trying to contact the manager but they told my niece he was busy after she sat on hold for almost 10 minutes! \n\n I have to say, I used to go there at least twice a week but moved and hadn't been there in over a year.... THIS place obviously has gone DOWN hill!!!!!!!"
1,From the outside the hotel looks very nice. Once we checked in to and made our way to the room things changed a bit.  There is a horrible order on the outside next to the pool almost smelled like rotten eggs.  In our room you could not smell it however once you get to the pool it was very apparent.   The room seemed ok however there were several lamps that had bulbs that were blown out the shower curtain rod was broken. The room was very loud. We were on the first floor and the people upstairs were very loud and it sounded like a heard of elephants.  You can hear the plumbing every time they flushed or turned on the water. The ac unit kept the room cool however it would go on and off all night long.  We ordered room service one night and put the plates on the outside of our room and the next evening they were still there. \n\nOn a good note the staff was friendly and did accommodate us on some of the requests we had (picking up the old room service and providing some extra towels)
1,"Quick review: I found the pizza okay, nothing to write home about. They have a few outside tables, which are really nice when the weather is good. \n\nThe problem, and it's a significant one, is the service. They have a walk up ordering system and every time I've been there, it takes forever for anyone to take my order. I've never been there when they've been busy. The final time I went there they had several people working there, but again, this weird kind of ignoring the customer thing was going on. \n\nI couldn't wait any longer and left. When they opened in that plaza, I was excited to have a new restaurant close-by. But now, I don't undergo the frustrating process of getting someone's attention to order there anymore, I just go to places where the entire transaction is pleasant."
1,"Went climbing here about 4 months ago and used their rented shoes.... Left with a minor blister-like object on my 2nd toe and to this day I still have it.... if you can, BRING YOUR OWN SHOES... unless you want some nasty looking growth on your toe :/"
1,"Definitely didn't love this bar. My boyfriend and I went there for lunch. Location was great in the Harrah's casino, but that's honestly the only thing that I can say was great. The waitress was friendly, and recommended a few items from the menu. I ordered her #1 choice of a fried bologna sandwich with french fries. The sandwich was completely saturated in grease. It's a grilled sandwich so I expected it to have some grease, but this was absurd. I ate about three bites. My boyfriend ordered fish and chips and it, too was covered in so much grease it was not edible. Needless to say we paid a hefty price for heartburn and stomach aches for the rest of the day. We will not be returning. If I had to recommend one thing, it would be to save your money and eat at the deli in Harrah's."
1,My wife and I went out for dinner the Friday night 1-3-15 it was our second time toe Luke's both time the service was poor but on this night it ruined what was a great meal. Once we had been seated a server came took our drink orders for the woman who would be serving us another waiter brought us the drinks. our server came twice to get and app order and out dinner order then we did not see her until I was half way through the meal. She never offered to refill my water nor offer another glass of wine until my glass sat empty for half of my meal. It took ten minutes for her to cash out of check with the gift card we used and when she dropped of the check it came with no thank you or smile. My wife and I are sorry that we caused this server such heart ache by having to serve us food and drink. The food is good but this will keep us from coming back.
1,"The worst hostesses (your going to try and put a six year old in the bar??), compounded with surly and inattentive waiter + food not on par with their other locations. Big disappointment. This won't be a stop for us in the future and that stinks because I was so excited Arriba's opened a location on my side of town. I had the white sands chimi which has always been good, but there was no pork to the chili. Rice was like it was leftover and when my bean burrito loving little one wouldn't eat the \""yucky tortilla and spicy beans\"", we were out."
1,"Sleazy, Ponzi-scheme, timeshare fraud.  My bf is on the phone with them right now trying to get his money back because, naturally, they spring that b.s. timeshare tour on you after you pay, but before you book, and they blacked out the weekend we need to go (January 18-19, 2014). This is a multi-sport tournament weekend when 7, 000 athletes from around the world come to Vegas to compete and have fun. \n\nAren't these damn timeshare gimmicks illegal by now?  \n\nAlso, my bf is a Hilton Honors member. I'm floored that they're treating him like this. \n\nBtw, he's still on the phone with them. I've written this review while he's been on the phone with them. \n\nYa know...if it sounds too good to be true...it probably is. \n\nDo NOT be lured into this farce."
1,"I had an appointment for my first massage set up for 7pm last week.  I was told to come in at 6:45pm to fill out paperwork.  I did just that.  Then I was told to wait in the Relaxation Room for the massage therapist to get me when she's ready.  So I'm waiting... and waiting... and waiting... 7:25pm rolls around and the lady at the front desk comes up to me and says, \""I'm sorry, but we won't be able to see you for the full hour.\""  Yeah, no kidding!  Apparently, the front desk forgot to \""sign me in\"" upon arrival, and the therapist never knew I even showed up.  They said they were going to add a scrub or aromatherapy for my next scheduled massage.  Then they said they have someone else that could see me from 7:30-8:30.  I told them I had to be out of there at 8pm, thus my scheduled appointment for 7.  I left without a massage.  While they were somewhat apologetic, I won't be coming back."
1,"There are much better places to stay in the Marriott family. Skip this place.\nDirty towels, pool under renovation (which no one told us about ahead of time), lots of broken down things in the room, inconsistent stories from the managers (Grace & Saul - have they even had any sort of training??).  There's absolutely no level of security either. No card scan to operate elevator - seemingly anyone could walk in off the street and have access to all floors. \n\nRenaissance Hotels come with the reputation of a  certain level of service, and this place is a miss on all levels. There are so many better options within a short walking distance of the convention center. Save yourself the hassle and stay there."
1,I've never waited in a drive thru so long. 2 People behind us got their order first. We orders 2 shakes and 12 wings. Wings were drenched in WAY too much sauce. When we finally got our wings we were given no ranch which we asked for when we ordered. Went in to talk to them manager looked like he was high on drugs. We were given our ranch and he said that the workers should have told us there was a long wait. Nothing was given to us and no sorrys were said. Will NEVER go there again.  TERRIBLE service.
1,"Food is good, but customer service should be just as good. Very rude, not friendly makes you feel un welcome. Don't know how he stays in business. Will tell all people I know to never go there. Vegas is full of good markets and this is not one of them."
1,I really had high hopes for a good meal. We went at breakfast time. We sat in the bar. When we saw what the neighbors next to us had we were very impressed with the presentation. So we ordered. My friend ordered the chicken eggs benedict. Still had high hopes he took a picture. I ordered some kind of Fried Chicken with a biscuit. Neither one fo was impressed. After we left we both thought wow that was horrible especially when I think our bill was $48....Of course we had 2 Bloody Mary's. My friend said it was good. I had never had one so i ordered it. Took me all day to get that taste out of my mouth and I only had a few drinks of it and gave it to him. Oh well no I know. May give them another try some days but I guess that would be if everything else was closed.
1,"This is most certainly NOT a Fry's Marketplace. Fry's Marketplaces sell all of the home goods, this one is definitely not one. I just walked in and all of the floors are ripped up, tres sanitary! Plus it's dingy and small. Blech!"
1,"When I went to the website to become a \""Wino\"" I was expecting to sample some of the better street wines such Night Train, Thunderbird, MD 20/20 and Cisco. \n\nTo my disappointment we toured vineyards and sampled wine costing over $20 a bottle and we did not even get to take a nap under any bridge in Phoenix, AZ.\n\nWaste of time and money and over 1/2th of my welfare check"
1,"There are good points and bad points about the Flamingo.  I will list the good points:\nLocation: this is on the center strip, which is close to a lot of other hotels (for shows, conferences)\nMargaritaville: A nice restaurant with an upper deck view\nThe garden: The garden has Flamingoes and is very peaceful\nThe staff: very nice, polite\nCons: This hotel reeks of smoke, everywhere,  I used to smoke, so I understand and am not condemning. But when you ask for a non-smoking room, it should not smell like someone has nuck into your room and is hiding to smoke a cigarette. This resulted in a miserable stay (allergies). \nIf you are catching an airport shuttle in, you will have to walk a block with your baggage to the hotel, back entrance, \nThere was a roach near the ice machine--but this may be secondary to the fact that someone dumped a salad on the floor, and it sat there for two days--after all, natural selection dictates that you need to do what you can to survive--and this roach was doing what he could to get to that salad.\nWhen the room was booked, I booked a room with a refrigerator, and was provided with a styrofoam cooler.\n There was a leak, in the first room . This leak was coming through the light fixture in the bathroom. This was due to a problem with something upstairs. The room was put out of order which meant that baggage and belongings had to be carried to another room."
1,"Worst place i've eaten in a long time. The waitress was very indifferent to how our food was,wheather we were happy with it or not. Way over priced. Much more experience than most mexican restaurants. Whoever called this tex mex has never had real tex mex. Don't even know where it came by the the name. Give this place a pass. There are way too many restaurants in the area to go to this one. All Mexican restaurants give free chips,this one charges. You even have to request hot sauce. I wrote a complaint via the internet to Cactus Jack and they didn't even bother to respond. I hope this place goes under quickly and allows a decent restaurant to take its place."
1,"Had my wind shield replaced and it leaked water through the seal and shorted out electronics in dash. They replaced the seal the next day, they damaged molding on drivers side of car. Josh at head quarters spoke to local guy, local guy said they would call me to get it fixed. Its been 2 weeks and no one has contacted me ... Stay away from them, spend the extra money to get it done right the first time....."
1,What a line on the weekend....the people in the office could be more organized and the rent a cop could stop trying to wave his arms and talk less!  Get people in and out!
1,"The service was pathetic, We were there for two hours and only received a few dishes that we ordered.  The dishes that we did receive was warm. We asked for the check and told her it was because it took so long. She then got upset at us as if it were our fault that their service was complete garbage.  On top of their horrible service, the place mats was I kid you not, printer paper.  The napkins were cheap square kind too, definitely not something you would present to customers at a restaurant.\n\nIn conclusion, I would rather put out a fire with my face then eat at this establishment again."
1,"They should write a book about how to ruin a soft taco.  I didn't think it was possible.  The corn tortilla was raw, not sauteed or warmed up at all, and thus tasted like cardboard.  The whole thing was cold.  The only good thing was the rice, which was very tasty.  \n\nA woman at the table next to us warned us that her chicken taco was horrible.  So why didn't we listen?  We figured it was just the chicken, but we should have asked more."
1,It's a dirty location with a foul smell of piss inside. From my short visit it's apparent their main clientele are transient.
1,The haunted houses were not scary and in the gates of hell there was a electric fence that will keeping shocking you I was shocked three times in the eyes the acting was poor and could tell all three haunted houses were thrown together... Don't waste you money
1,"We didn't eat, we didn't dance, all we did was drink a few beers.  Our bottles of beer were not cold enough.  Neither were the drafts.  It's my fault for not complaining because they could have accommodated us in someway.  But, even still, 4 different beers, 4 times not in temp."
1,"Today, I definitely didn't have a great experience at MCN. I got my haircut couple months ago from there and I liked it, so I decided to go again for coloring today.\nI wasn't happy about it at all -cuz I can still see the line btw my root and the bottom. PLUS, they charged me 25 bucks more for the blow-dry without telling me. I wish I didnt go there for the color.."
1,"I've been going to Dr Auto since 2001 when Dave, and then Mike, ran an honest, reliable, and fair shop. I never felt like I was being taken advantage of, or upsold on services and/or products I did not need. I have taken all of my cars there for repairs for 10 years and have spent over $50k in that time. I don't believe in car payments, so I buy all my vehicles at auction, or fixer uppers. The guys at Dr Auto took care of all my needs and at no time did I ever feel taken advantage of.\nAll that has changed. After Mike & Dan, the Mgr. & the chief mechanic left the employ of Dr Auto about a month ago, I thought it strange that 2 key employees would leave this place at the same time. After a couple of experiences with the new Mgr, I feel that Dr Auto seems more concerned with increasing the bottom line than the \""Hometown Service With Integrity\"", claim. (their tag phrase). I don't like to make negative comments about anyone without careful consideration, especially when those people rely on repeat buisiness to thrive, but I will not give someone I don't trust any more of my money and I can not recommend them to anyone else. Be thorough, and ask questions if you have your car repaired there. Make sure that the recommended repairs are genuinely needed. Better yet, avoid this shop and find someone you can trust."
1,"Had a private reservation booked for our daughter's 21st birthday dinner. Imagine my shock when I arrived with 26 guests to find our room, booked since Jan, unavailable, They had booked over our reservation with a bachelorette party! I had just personally gone in a week before to introduce myself & see the space I had reserved. Met with the owner & manager DANNY, saw space, confirmed number of guests, and even discussed table set up, tab separations & high chair necessities. The manager on duty called him when we arrived & he denied ever meeting me! Needless to say, we will not return to Towne Tavern. We had family from 3 different states come for this dinner, & it was very upsetting not to have our space. I will say the manager on duty did his best to accommodate in the main dining area, but we decided to take our business elsewhere. Thank you to Beef o Brady's for giving us the space we needed at such short notice! Have always enjoyed Towne Tavern's food, but inexcusable service on the owner's part. We won't be back."
1,"Britney: Piece of Crap\n\nThis was a terrible show.  Britney was bored and barely moved.  I will never get that time back that I wasted at her \""show\"".  Save your money, go to a different show. Or just sit outside at Cabo Wabo and people watch, it's MUCH more entertaining!!!!"
1,"Horrible location and average food, it not worth the effort trying to find it. This place is located in an industrial area downtown and looks more an abandoned shack that's deteriorating for the last 30 years than a restaurant. It was so bad that I thought it was closed until I saw people inside. So I tried it and was quit disappointed. The menu is VERY limited and they charge gourmet prices for bar quality food. Don't waste your time and money."
1,"I have eaten at this Red Lobster for years. Recently things have slipped. Yesterday a group of us had dinner. One person ordered the fish and chips. What came was batter, no fish. Two us is had Cobb salads, poor...the lettuce was frozen in both salads. Needless to say this place needs a major over haul. The only good thing about this restaurant is the server Mary who is stellar. Too may other places to eat."
1,"PHOENIX GATES ONLY: Okay, so I like Delta as an airline pretty well.  I am Platinum with them, but I'm not reviewing Delta corporate in this review.  Im just reviewing Delta's gates here in PHX.  Also, disclaimer, this isn't a \""grumpy\"" review, the service is fine and Im not mad at anyone, this is data driven around the comparative offerings. (Delta operates about 5-6 gates here in PHX). The situation is not good:\n\n- One restroom with a tiny entrance and exit, always crowded in there and you bump elbows coming in/out\n- Food: Wendy's and a tired \""Cantina\""\n- No bookstore\n- No soda stop/drink stop\n- No coffee store\n- No bakery\n- Gross worn out carpets\n- Crowded wait areas with few seats\n- 2 charging stations per gate (I counted them; it only took a moment to double check)\n\nDelta, when you get a minute, would you pretty please update your gate area here in PHX, to the extent you are able?  Thanks, Lee"
1,"I work across from this place. I ordered a \""lunch Greek salad\"" that was advertised for $5.90, with FREE DELIVERY. When they delivered it, the price was $11.80!! Salad was $8.49 with $2.50 delivery. They had to WALK across the street...really?\n\nI called to question the price. She was very rude.\n\n I recommend this restaurant, to the patrons from our theater, all the time.  NEVER AGAIN!!  After seeing other reviews, I'm not surprised!! \n\nGo down to Cityscape. It's worth the 2 block walk!"
1,"I chose to stay at the Monte Carlo because we had a Seminar that was taking place there. First let me say,I do not understand how this place even rated as a supposed 4 star hotel in Las Vegas.\n\nWhen we first got here the line up for checking in was so long that I was embarrassed with my staff. Okay now off to the room. Maybe we can start over. Wrong!.  The room looked like they were renovated in the 80s. I would say its spacious There was an old air con/fan that made terrible noises every 2 minutes so it was useless.  The blankets are paper thin too and I caught a cold during my third nights stay.  The bathtub is so shallow and old and nasty. I didn't even want to complain because I figured they would only move to a different room with the same amenities. I would have rather stayed in a Comfort suites than this place. We were only there for 2 nights so I did not spend much time in my room. The restaurants that were in the hotel and next to it outside were overall good but nothing spectacular. I will definitely not stay here again. I will stay at The Mandalay but I wonder how does this place stay in the M Life group of Hotels.\nNeedless to say I am ready to get out of there on Sunday AM and I'm waiting in line again for over 20 minutes to check out. Sorry Avoid this place!!!"
1,"Horrible customer service.  I've had two issues with their product, the most recent being a carbon fiber backing that doesn't fit well and has crooked lines.  It's bright red so the crooked lines stand out.  It pointed out how horrible their quality control is as well. It's a very mom-and-pop amateur company, that mom-and-pop don't seem to care about. Case in point, there's three sets of instructions: online, printed on the box, and at the bottom of stuff inside the box. Only one of them is correct as it pertains to the carbon fiber sticker, which is what I purchased.\n\nI went back and forth via email and it was like talking to a robot. They want me to send it back and pay for postage, then they'll process, likely very slowly, a refund or send a different one.  Text-book bad customer service.  They just don't care.\n\nI'll upload a picture of the bad fit and crooked lines."

1,"I have been to this EyeMasters store on two occasions: once to place an order for contact lenses, and once to pick the order up. On both occasions I had to wait an unacceptably long time to be helped. This store is seriously understaffed so, unless you have a lot of time to kill, take your business elsewhere. Plus, the prices aren't that good."
1,"Waited 40 minutes for two sandwiches. Hamburger that my husband got was the frozen-then-heated up kind. My chicken ciabatta was over done and dry. Waitress was nice, i think problem is with kitchen. Two sandwiches and two drinks came to close to $50. What a rip off. Will not be back."
1,"I bought a number of items there. among them there was\n- 1 item off the floor it wasn't delivered on schedule no biggie\n- 1 entry door with transom ($500)\n- 1 custom window $1,200.\n\nThe style of the door and the transom didn't match, I called and was told \""that's what you ordered\"" . Really I asked for mismatched styles? I ordered for the lightest clearest low-e glass available, I got the dark type of glass that's recommended for Fla, Nm, Az etc. \"" That's what you ordered\"" was the response again. \n\nThey don't even bother to ask what was shipped or what you ordered, they don't want to know because CYA is the order of the day.\nThen when you go over your buyer's order you realize that regardless of the conversation you had with their salesperson the printed order is so vague that they could ship you anything at all and claim that's what you ordered. My contractor bought my siding there, it's an off-brand and the quality doesn't impress. \nReally shoddy practices\n\nI ordered the rest of the windows ( Andersen) from The Plywood Mart although they won't match these and they were more expensive, that shows how I feel about sponsoring this store again"
1,OUT OF BUSINESS. Spice Asian Bistro now occupies this space. Can't wait to try them out and post my review!
1,"Who'd have thought that you should have packed a lunch to go to a food festival?\n\nWe didn't even bother eating at any of the trucks.  It was so crowded, and the lines weren't moving, that we realized trying to eat (the purpose of going to a food truck festival) would be a futile test of patience.  My friends and I cut our loses short and bailed immediately.  It took about an hour to get through the atrocious parking situation and walk to the entrance.  Even after that, we left after just one quick lap around the festival.\n\nBeing charged to enter was robbery.  I'm not even sure what we paid for since every truck and booth was charging.  Someone must have pocketed big from this ripoff.  Thank goodness we used a Groupon to get six tickets for $25.  If I had paid $10 a ticket, I'd be furious.  Long lines are expected at a food truck festival, but those lines should move."
1,"This place is the definition of repugnant. I understand when a mistake happens once or twice when it is busy, but I have gone here multiple times and during those multiple times, my order and the service have been not at it's best. For example, I have ordered fries and they told me it was going to be a few minutes because they make everything fresh, but when I got the fries, they were cold and undercooked. Secondly, when I order a blizzard, the amount of toppings in very light. Thirdly, filthy filthy filthy. I am not surprised that I saw a C rating in their lobby. Overall, I will no longer go out of my way to this place is to eat."
1,"Food: 4 Stars\nAtmosphere: 3\nService: -7\nCleanliness: questionable\nComing back?: No\n\nThe issue: Friend and I watched appalled as a cockroach crawled around the restaurant floor for a bit, until it made its way under our table. My friend trapped the roach between her empty glass and a menu, and politely called our waiter over. My friend very politely explained the situation to our waiter, and requested that he take care of the bug. He replied with something to the effect of, \""I don't know what you want *me* to do about it. I don't really like bugs either. I've never had a customer do this before.\"" We proposed multiple solutions, including getting a dustpan or taking the captive roach to the front door and releasing him. He declined both options, opting to have my friend carry the glass, roach, and menu to the door herself, while he graciously held it open for her. She sat down, even more appalled, as the waiter walked away.\n\nAfter agreeing that the service was unacceptable, my friend addressed the waiter as he brought us our check, mentioning that he should taken care of the bug next time. He took the criticism with a face plastered with offense, and stumbled over his words as he seemed to hold back greater emotions: \""I... I will... Take that note and keep that in the back of my mind.\"" We payed our bill and left promptly.\n\nCompliments to the bartender and chef for a solid Manhattan and a tasty Western Burger, but we won't be coming back."
1,"This place is the worst customer service check out ever! It is  12:00pm Sunday and you only have two people ringing? Ok I'll give you maybe people call in sick. Me and 20 other people are in line waiting. Then your manager on duty is laughing and joking with another associate, as she gives her change. Noticing the line is getting longer you take your time laugh some more. With no one being helped nor being rung up. We are all still standing in line? Then after something is said both of you start to ring up again. With the manager still laughing. So sorry. I have been in retail for a long time totally unacceptable. I left my basket and the 300.00 worth of stuff I was going to buy there. The only good thing is the security officer, she welcomes you as you come in."
1,"1 word: WHY????!!!\n\nBought a Groupon for this place since I was visiting Sin City over the weekend.  There were a bunch of people standing around not doing anything, and the girl who took my order looked like she could care less about working and wanted to go home.  She wasn't friendly and neither was anybody else behind the counter.\n\nHow do you mess up a Chinese Chicken Salad wrap, How I say? For the $11 I paid I would rather have eaten my sock covered in honey Dijon mustard.\n\nThe 1 star is actually for my drink, the Moonshine w/ Everclear, which was tasty and clearly the highlight of my visit. \n\nIf you find yourself in the Miracle Mile shops and your stomach is growling, you would rather walk another mile than eat at this place."
1,"I come to Brillo Box all the time. My friend, who is 28 and us from Turkey was not let in tonight... For dinner and drinks. The guy working the door needs an attitude adjustment and just because a place has been raided in the past, does not mean you don't act like a civilized human being. A Turkish ID that says 28... Should be enough. Shame on you Brillo Box. I am done with you and your awesome food. Get a new bouncer!!!!"
1,"If you want a doctor and staff who doesn't make you feel uncomfortable and won't make you dread having to take your child in for a visit, do not go here. I was a month late taking my infant daughter at the time to take her shots and Dr. Nauman would make a negative comment towards me for being late. I never felt comfortable going there. I wish I had found Dr. Marlon Mendoza much sooner."
1,"These animals are either going to die or depression or rebel and eat everyone.  I am surprised PETA has not visited this place and staged a mass protest.  Walking around is incredibly sad the animals either look like they are on thorzeine, or stare you down.  \n\nI do have to say, having lived in vegas for a few years, this place makes the must see list simply because it is such an epic fail."
1,"I really, really wanted to like this pizzeria.  The first time we ordered pizza from Jimmy & Joes, there was barely any pepperoni on it.  Hoping it was an oversight by a new Ahwatukee business, we ordered again and mentioned the lack of pepperoni on our first order.  They apologized and said they would pass the message along.  A lot of good that did - pretty sure we had even less pepperoni the second time.  There is absolutely nothing special about this pizza.  It's expensive (comparable to Spinatos or Oreganos), but the same quality as a fast-food pizza chain.  Save your money and order from Dominos or Papa Johns - they actually taste better.  Want good pizza?  Go to Spinatos or Oreganos."
1,"Stopped by this market was actually looking for the u pick peaches place.  Went into the store some of the veggies looked old.  Found 2 strawberries & a couple tomatoes, went to the counter checked out and she said $3.01 but the store charges $.50 to use a debit or credit card so it was $3.51 I said oh I did not see that I have cash in my purse and the lady said it already went through.  I explained I did not know they charged a fee and she spouted off it cost me $.90 and very unprofessional said do you want your $.50 back. I understand business & costs and this is one I will now AVOID."
1,"The check in process took way too long which caused us to miss the show. The show itself was fine, but not worth more than 10 dollars."
1,"The Bloody Mary was quite good (especially at 3.99!), but the food was pretty lousy. My husband had the mushroom burger with sweet potato fries. It was mediocre at best. I had a tasteless taco salad with some of the worst, processed \""chicken\"" breast I've ever tasted. I ended up returning the dish and trying it with ground beef instead. It was better, but still disappointing. The server did her best to make it right, but, sadly, I fear the kitchen wasn't up for the challenge. I would not come here again. Sorry."
1,"Falls under expectations. Front desk staff is indifferent, feels like I'm at Target. I called in regards to a room change because ours smelled like acidic vinegar, and they said they'll either bring up fans or to come back down. Down we go, to find another huge line. I asked a front desk attendant who I should be talking to, he was rude in telling me the front desk lady I spoke to doesn't exist and he directed me to wait in the corner for his manager. Upon small talk with the manager that the front area is disorganized, he had no comment, just stayed mum. He threw my ID back unto the table and slid it towards me. No one took a moment to apologize for the inconvenience. Upon getting my new room key card, I realized the whole floor smelled like vinegar. Upon entering, the room feels like a Marriott Springfield Suites, you know one of those business extended stays, but no coffee machine :T If you're looking for a no-smoking, no casino hotel, I recommend the Trump, with a great view looking down from the north strip."
1,Stopped in to get help replacing a pendant and sconce that we had bought years ago.  The lady who helped me was not very helpful and seemed bothered to even give me minimum information.  I had a bad experience a year or so ago with customer service here but hoped they might have improved in this area...nope!
1,"I typically order by phone from this location; I either have a good experience or a horrible experience--there is never an in between. The complaints I have had with Domino's range from being sent the wrong or cold food to horrible customer service.\n\nToday I decided to order some food using Domino's online service. Using the online ordering service was quick and easy; however, I ran into a huge problem forty (40) minutes later when I realized I provided the incorrect phone number. I immediately called the store and spoke with a man who said he would send my food with the next driver. I asked him if the food would be cold when I got it--rudely, he said it had been sitting in an insulated bag and would send it right out. Almost sixty (60) minutes later I received my cold food that had been sitting in an insulated bag for at least forty (40) minutes. \n\nNeedless to say, I will not be ordering from this location again."
1,"Not going back. It's the cleanliness of the place that still haunts me. \n\n5/15/2010 i sat on the patio. When you enter there are 2 lamps on the brick wall outside..one is totally busted. There are 3 ceiling fans on the patio that do not work. (one didn't even have the hardware attached just dangling cords.) Instead there was a floor fan on the bar. There were FLIES everywhere!!! I had to sacrifice half a beer because one went in and drowned...i barely noticed this!!! Not one bit of this review has anything to do with food...but everything to do with maintenance and impression. The tables and chairs were just dirty. I enjoy sitting outside, and i can name many places that are clean even outside...this is unacceptable for me. I wish i had taken pictures...it was surprisingly dirty as compared to last year."
1,"One stare for the cute shop and very friendly receptionist. Went in for blow dry. The worse my hair has ever looked. Flat, bangs in my eyes, and whatever product was put on for shine would not allow me to style my hair once home. Had to wash it and start over. New grads from school, maybe? Will not be going back."
1,"I had a confirmed reservation but unfortunately made it (via Yelp) for Wednesday and had intended for Tuesday. When we walked in on Tuesday in March at 6pm there was only 1 table that was occupied by patrons (the place was empty) and the hostess was very rude...she said that she wasn't sure if she could accommodate the 4 of us. Screw her, we left and went to the Herb Box."
1,Very disappointed. Went there on a Saturday night. They said the were down 2 chefs. It took 20 mins to get thru the food line then 35 mins for our food to come out. The food was hot so that's why I gave a 1 star. I'll never visit this place again. I'd rather go to YCs
1,"Are you kidding me?!?!?!?\n$610 after takes for 4 tires priced at $105/each! $180 in installation and taxes???? And to top it off the whole buy 3 get the 4th free is a lie, its free after a 6-8 week rebate!!!! and not in cash but by VISA card only!\n\nGo to Fletchers, 4 tires (BFG's) for $450 OTD, with 4 free oil changes....could it have been any better?"
1,"My daughter and I went there as she had heard the Coconut Shrimp was supposed to be very good. We ordered the cheese curds, which really how can you mess those up, we're good. The focaccia was good with the 3 small portions of flavored butter. I ordered the Lobster. It was grossly over cooked and like rubber. What a waste. Plus it did not come with butter but OIL. My daughter ordered the Coconut Shrimp which came very over cooked. Dark brown and all you could taste was the burnt outside breading . The decor was so dated and smells. Wish I could give them a 0 it was that bad . I never reviewed anything before but it was so bad I just had too. Do not, Waste your money!!!!!"
1,"Dispatcher was incredibly rude. But it's a tow company, no surprise there. Pulled up in our cab as the tow truck was pulling in with my car. Didn't even park my car on their lot and charged me $300!! What a scam!"
1,"ACK! ACK! ACK! \n\nLocated in \""beautiful\"" downtown Mesa, AZ.\n\nIf you like shopping for year old stuff or worse then this is the place for you! \n\nIf you like the glorious smell of body odor, cheap disinfectant and soiled baby diapers then you've reached shopping nirvana!\n\nIf you don't mind rubbing shoulders with the homeless drug addicted \""Occupy Walmart\"" types then you've found a home!\n\nIf you want quality food in a safe shopping environment where you don't have to hold your breath, check your wallet every five minutes or question the safety of some of the food they have for sale there then you need to shop elsewhere. \n\nCustomer appreciation is going on right now: Free set of teeth and a year's supply of deodorant or depends with every $100.00 purchase! \n\n(Okay I'm just kidding.)\n\nNasty nasty nasty! \n\nYou were warned.\n\nI've told my wife that if she ever takes me there again I'll just catch a cab home."
1,"I have been with Wells Fargo Bank since 1988...I was interested in a Mortgage for a Purchase...I was introduced to Michael Jordan (Mortgage Consultant)..Let me give you some advice  ,stay away go somewhere else..The lack of service , replies to my emails or phone calls was horrendous...I am 24 yrs with this Bank, 800 Fico Score and can't imagine how he or they treat customers that have not banked with them...His Superior that sits at the Wells Fargo Home Mortgage (16211 N Scottsdale Rd., Ste A-1 | Scottsdale, AZ 85254 ) who I spoke to about Michael Jordan is a waste..Linda Baker the Loan Doc Specialist treated me like I have never conducted business with the Bank...Stay away fro m these people and Wells Fargo Bank..I will be closing all of my accounts...."
1,We came here for a birthday dinner and had a very disappointing experience! Our waiter seemed confused and was very annoyed that he had to do separate checks. He hardly talked to us at all besides making rude or snarky comments. Some of our friends got service faster at the bar than through our waiter! It's been 17 minutes and counting and we still have not gotten our drinks! Terrible service. .. so disappointed!
1,"My kids had a karate tournament at the Riviera so we stayed there out of convenience.  When we first got to our room there was a USED bandaid in the planter.  I let front desk know and they said they would said housekeeping to take care of it...nope!  Also, our bathtub didn't drain, the furniture looks like it has 50 years of nicotine dripping off of it and the very best part - we were on a non smoking floor and our room smelled like a Willy Nelson concert.  Now my kids know what pot smells like.  Next year for the tournament we will be staying elsewhere.  The convenience isn't worth how grossed out I was by this hotel."
1,"I'm writing about my experience i had here about a year ago.  It is one of the few places i can give a 1 score too.    My friends and I came here because the other big crawfish place was too crowded and we were all hungry.   My friend suggested we try this place but I was a little reluctant.  I'm from southern california and I am use to Boiling Crab quality shrimp and crawfish.   \n\nThe fries were pretty average.   The sauce is really bland and watery.  It doesnt have much taste or kick to it.   \n\nWe ordered the shrimp but that didnt seem to fresh.  The shell was really hard to get off.   I also felt like it was hard to tagged the waiter when we were there even though there was only a few customers.   \n\nAll in all, i wouldnt come back here again."
1,"Scheduled a rental of a Mustang convertible for a day. Exactly 18 minutes before my pickup time, I received a call stating they didn't have my car - I thought to myself, no problem, they will give me something comparable or better at the same price.\n\nThey offered me a Jeep Wrangler - how is that a sports car? I asked for a sports car replacement and they said they could offer me a BMW Z4 at $50 more/day. I said that was not a reasonable suggestion - \""She\"" disagreed with me and said that was all she could do.\n\nI had a day planned to take my wife on a nice trip to Hover Dam - but she said forget it if they can't find a suitable replacement at the same price on my reservation.\n\nTrying to find another comparable car at the last minute was not going to happen from another agency - so we bagged the Hover Dam expedition.\n\nDon't use these guys - they don't treat you like a valued customer."
1,"Well... I should have listen to all the reviews I read here so it is totally my fault. \nWhen I booked my apt for a blow-dry I mentioned that I read reviews on Yelp that weren't impressive but I want to give them a try as I live close by.\nMy hairdresser didn't know how to blow-dry my hair. It was a mess. She kept asking another girl (that just stopped working there) questions on how to hold the brush and which brush to use. I realize they all have to start somewhere but maybe they should be supervised ? \nI didn't leave with wet hair like others but it wasn't what I wanted my hair to look like (and pay for) . It took her an hour (!) to do that so even though I mentioned I wasn't happy I didn't have the time to stay there longer. \nThe owner was there the whole time but it doesn't seem like she supervise her staff or care about the satisfaction of her clients. \nAgain, my fault, should have trust my fellow yelpers :)\nI love seeing places opening in Arcadia, especially that they are done so well, but that is not enough to keep us coming. You actually have to have good service for that."
1,Awful awful awful!!!!  I have never experienced such RUDE nurses or doctor in my life. I will never go back here again. I'm not sure how they have received positive reviews.
1,"fun music and vacation atmosphere in the heat of tempe summer...\n\nbut we won't be back. \n\nmargaritas were so salty, beers were watery, and food was too spicy - the kind of spicy that drowns out the flavor (and this is coming from a Thai-Hot kinda girl).  \n\nFood/drinks are reasonable, but it was a total waste of money."
1,"What a horrible, disgusting, overpriced Easter buffet.  We paid almost $100 for the three of us and it was not worth it.  The menu sounded very promising, but half of the food on there never made it to the buffet.  my husband is still looking for that duck l'orange.  The things that did make it weren't that good.  The lamb was dry, the crab legs were just gross, and the cheese and salad selection was pitiful.  The quality of the food in general was just not worthy of the price.  Before we discovered the Aladdin buffet, which doesn't exist anymore, we used to hit up the Paris buffet on every trip.  It was worth it back then with a much better selection and better quality food.  Now, you could easily get the same quality garbage at a buffet that is half the price.  I was very disappointed."
1,We called for hotel reservations.  I can't believe how I was spoken to.  The young lady must have had chip on her shoulder.  I guess she thought I was supposed to be serving her.  I hope the stay is more enjoyable than the reservation experience.\n\nJohnny J..
1,"We checked into a dirty room with food everywhere and the beds unmade.  Cleaning service didn't arrive until over an hour later.  You can not work with the regular hotel staff to make your situation better.  Their off-site subpar telephone customer service offered lame solutions (moving to a lower suite in a tower further away or waiving a resort fee).  Luxury Suites International clearly has no desire of retaining your business, do not book."
1,"The Bartender was rude and if I wasn't with my family I would have thrown my drink in his face.\nActually I wanted to do a lot more, but i figured a true review would hurt them most.  DONT GO!"
1,"I have to agree with the 2 guys that gave this place 1 star. The people are pretty cool that I've met while staying here but that is the only good thing I can say about this place. We stayed here because it is close to our house that is being remodeled. The management is horrible they will never take ANY responsibility if something happens! We moved in and we had to sleep on a beat up mattress and a box spring that had wheels screwed into it. After 2 nights we started getting bit, it turns out the box spring had bed bugs in it. When we complained the awesome management and they accused us of bringing them in.  These cheap people would not get rid of the box spring so we threw it out. Went and bought a bed and used that for the rest of our stay. We bought the wifi that the complex offers but the signal is so bad we ended up getting a refund. I have lived in rough places but this was by far worse than living in the projects. Please think twice about renting from this place save yourself some headaches and look elsewhere."
1,I made an appointment to get a flu shot here.  got several emails telling me not to forget and when I showed up at 8 am on a Monday morning a girl shrugs her shoulders and tells me they are not doing flu shots that day.  after I missed two hours of work this sucks.  never going to cvs again it is always a bad idea no matter which location you go to.
1,"Lamb Balti had big hunks of tomato, onion, and green pepper - the lamb was OK (not fatty) but lacked texture.  The peas in the mattar paneer were shriveled.   A tasteless meal - the chapati was the best thing but even here you should hope to find better,"
1,Horrible place. Not happy about this selection a couple of weeks ago.  The service was horrific.  Rude and impatient staff.  Price is weird and they charge you for everything.  Not recommended at all.
1,"After visiting Vegas so many years I finally had the time to go and check out this place  with my family. Upon are arrival we were greeted with a friendly smile, and where told that we can sit our selfs any where we'd like. Once we sat our selfs we waited 10min!!! for anyone to acknowledge we were their. We got the attention of one of the many servers, We asked for a menu 5 min after asking she brought the menu. After that we never saw her again bad service weak attention to customer service It's very poor no floor manager presence, there's no sense of leadership."
1,"Slow service, staff needs more training. There's like 4 managers and none of the know what they are doing, i don't think this place is going to make it. Sorry but you lost 4 very good patrons Saturday night because of your poor customer service"
1,"Every time I shop here for pool repair parts, I get the wrong part. The chemicals (chlorine, muriatic acid, etc.) are not good quality and the place is operated by amatuers/kids."
1,"Vast amounts of poorly prepared food presented in a raucous atmosphere of dragooned waiter/waitress choruses of the \""special\"" restaurant birthday song.\n\nIf you don't have a screaming infant you need to bring to a restaurant, don't go.  \n\nThe Veal Parmesan was a howling mess.  It's an \""Italian\"" restaurant, and they don't even serve capellini."
1,Very minimal selection. Small seating area. Not many bikes either - mainly Felt. If you want coffee go to a real coffeehouse. If you want bikes go to a bike house.
1,"The most hostile people I have ever met.  Horrible in every respect, I am surprised people pay for the abuse they deliver.  My experience with XS was hands down the worst I have ever had with any venue, ever.  They ruined my birthday, embarrassed me, and I believe potentially charged me for it.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!!"
1,"People who work here are polite and nice, but WHERE ARE MY PANTS!!???  I dropped off some shirts and pants on the other day, and was told that they would be ready in the afternoon.  So I went back in the afternoon to pick them up.  I was told only the shirts were ready, so I decided to come back the next day to pick everything up together when the pants are ready as well.  I went back the next day, and I was told that the pants were already picked up.  They looked for them, but they couldn't find them.  Thanks, those are my uniform pants issued by the company I work for.  Now, I have no pants to wear to work.  If you are devoted to the satisfaction of customers as you states here, please do something about it.  \nAlso, they are very expensive, I checked other places and the other places charge less than half price.  Only when you use coupons is when the price is competitive, which makes you feel saving money, but it is actually more expensive than regular price of their competitors."
1,"If there was an option to give 0 stars, I would have picked that. So I went to this place last night. And the food was OK... nothing fabulous. It was very average. What got me was that the place was empty for a friday night, there was maybe one more couple in the restaurant. So after we orderered it took maybe 20min before our food arrived. I couldnt believe the wait was so long when the place was EMPTY. So our food finally arrived and as stated before, the food was at best mediocre.We finished our meal with the server no where in sight, finally we got tired of waiting and walked up to the register and asked for our bill. Our total bill was about $36. Based on the food and service, I thought I was being generous leaving a $2 tip, but I guess the waitress didnt think so because she chased me outside to parking lot to tell me that it was a mandatory 15% tip... you can only inmagine my shock... My husband out of total embarrasement started giving her more than the 15% she was asking for, but I didnt let him, aside from her not deserving it, now it was just plain principal... I couldnt believe the audacity of these ppl... So if your planning to dine here, which I STRONGLY recommend that you DON'T, be ready to pay a 15% gratuity whether you feel they deserve it or not.\n\nI WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN."
1,"Zero knowledge about insurance billing and general office procedures. Office manager argues and has a bad attitude. I would not recommend this place, nor will I ever schedule another appointment. Go to Lenscrafters if you have Tricare/United Healthcare."
1,"This place is getting one star for the location and one star for the mediocore chips and salsa. I actually wish I could give half a star for those. A restaraunt usually can't disappoint me when I am starving and hungover but Cabo Wabo managed to do that. Congrats!\n\nFor the love of god, please don't come here. The food was so bland and terrible and the service is even more horrid. First off, I am pretty sure our server had tourette's. Not that there is anything wrong with that, I just feel like you should be warned before having to go through that.\n\nI had been walking on the strip for a while before getting to the restaraunt so I was totally parched.  We were seated and no one acknolwedged our presence for 10-15 minutes so I had to get up and go to the bar and ask for water. Tourette's server finally came to see us but he was seriously a hot mess. \n\nOk, let's be honest, I don't know if homeboy actually had tourette's or if he was just having a bad night but every time he walked by our t"
1,"I had a groupon sat down to order looked at how dirty the menus are, the owner watching a big OLD tv in the dinning room, Nobody in the place, looked kinda like they didnt have the money to maintain the place...Told my wife and Kids LETS GO!!!! If the dinning area looks this bad I can only guess what the kitchen looks like. NO THXs sorry but if you want customers you need to work on your place and put the Guy with the TV in the back out of site......\nP.S the food might be good, I just ran for my life before i tried it..."
1,"The food is generally bad -- the soup was not hot, the beef was overcooked, and overall unflavorful.  We thought there would be sushi, especially with the $12 per person weekend price, but there was no sushi.  There was a very small variety of food -- everything was stale and cold.  The clams and crab were flavorless.  We were very disappointed.  However, compliments to the waiter, who was very friendly."
1,"We walked into a empty restaurant at 1230! It stayed empty until we left.  Thought it was busy, but it was the sushi bar next door.\n\nOrdered noodle dish.  Duck was shredded.  Not like picture.  Ordered ramen vs rice noodle.  Charged extra dollar for that.\n\nSoup was so bad, we could only eat half of our order because the soup was too strong.  Chef/server had the nerve to ask us if we had duck noodle before.  They knew we were from Hawaii.  Who doesnt eat duck noodle in Hawaii!\n\nDont recommend."
1,"So they claim to be open till 11pm. We just walked in at 10:14 and we're greeted at the door with \""I'm sorry we already did last call just a little bit ago and we are gunna close a little early.\"" There were at least 15 people still in the restaurant and closing a little early doesn't mean doing last call an hour before you close. How unprofessional and just plain bad service. I understand it's tuesday and everyone wants to go home but you decided to be in the service industry. Needless to say we won't ever be back to support this place."
1,"make sure that you have your complete flight itinerary printed out before you get to the front desk.  they will not rent to you if you have a debit card, even if you made reservations with said debit card! \n i spent an hour-and-a-half watching one customer after another go through the line twice...  once to get their car, and then again to get another car that was not completely fucked up.\nthe woman at the desk had no sympathy, she'd obviously been there a long time.  it took all of my patience not to correct her on her etiquette and demeanor.  \nwhen we got our car the guy who cleaned and received vehicles advised us to get a different car because ours was dented and the ragtop was ripped.  when his boss found out, he got chewed out for letting us know that we'd probably absorb the cost of that upon returning the car.\nthis place is so totally crappy and shabby.  pay the extra five dollars and get a car from the guys who are at the off-site car-mall.  this place was off-off-site and it took us twenty minutes to get there.\njust pathetic..."
1,"I had a craving for KFC. I went through the drive through and the machine was muffled terribly. The service was slow. When I got home, the food was poor quality. The mashed potatoes were dry and the macaroni and cheese was lumpy. Even the coleslaw was very dry. The worst was the chicken strips, which were extremely dry and nearly too hard to bite into. \n\nI returned to the location to comment the next day and the man at the counter (I assume the manager) was very rude.\n\nI would not recommend this location based on service and good quality."
1,"We were starving and decided on the TI Buffet. YUCK! This buffet was $26.95./ person. Ok so we are talking cheaper in terms of nice buffets nowadays. But, the food was INEDIBLE! I had a small salad, which they plate for you. I appreciate that as it was all behind glass, and had at least not been sneezed on by everyone in the hotel. The veggies were not fresh. The selection. 3 or 4 stations. Turkey? ewwww was that even turkey?"
1,"I've been to Carmine's with a large group and was pretty excited about the whole family style thing they had going on. I was so disappointed with it. The food was far from good and the restaurant was overpriced for what it was. I was served overly salty plates, burnt broccolis and overcooked pastas. The price made it that much worst, as I had much better food for a lot less on that trip (come on... It's Vegas! There is good food in that city). My one star goes to the service, that was pretty decent.\n\nIf you are looking for good food in Vegas, skip on that one."
1,"Weird experience. I went with my  dad and my husband and we asked for a booth, and the waitress said, sure let me clean off the booth. A group of four came in behind us and asked for a booth as well... She said sure follow me... What?!? We waited a good five minutes while she cleaned off a table (sooo long when you're watching the booth you should have gotten get drinks...) them she sits us at a super tiny 3 top... I looked at her and said \""have you looked at dad???\"" (He's pushing 300 lbs)\n  She just kind of didn't get why it was a problem to force us to sit at a tiny three top (it was a 6 top table that had a booth half way around the table)\n We ended up leaving because she just didn't get why it was frustrating to make us wait for a tiny table and then asking if we wanted to wait some more... Annoying in the land of a million delicious Mexican restaurants."
1,"The salesperson that \""helped\"" me today was highly incompetent. When he approached me, I said that I needed a lockring tool. He didn't know what a lockring was, so I explained that it was for removing gears and showed him the one that I had purchased at REI that was too big. He said, \""Oh, a CASSETTE tool...\"" and walked over to the tool wall (hidden behind the service desk). He stared blankly at the wall for a minute and then said he would go to the back and look. It took me all of one second to find the tool I needed. I told him that I found it and thanked him, and he disappeared. I then stood near the register, unacknowledged, for a few minutes until someone else asked me what I needed. When I said I just needed to check out, he had to tell the guy that had originally helped me to ring up the sale. I had planned on asking for recommendations/advice on a problem I am having with the brakes on my bike, but decided that the incompetent salespeople at the store were definitely not the ones I should ask. I will not be returning to this store, or any other Tempe Bicycle."
1,"Good if you like painfully slow service, frozen breaded seafood, and potato soup passed off as clam chowder.  This restaurant, while decorated in tacky, outdated marine decor, used to be really great.  Disappointed that the place I used to go for a taste of New England \""home\"", is now serving overpriced meals with a side of ridiculously slow service."
1,"The only good thing about this eatery is its proximity to the Benedum. The three of us were seated at a table that was jammed in between two other tables, next to the kitchen - even though the place was half empty. I could hear the conversation at the next door table better than that of people sitting opposite me. The food was a sorry, sloppy, soggy mess that would have had Chef Ramsey throw up. The service was slow, inattentive, and made you feel vaguely unwelcome. Ridiculously overpriced. For  better value, a nicer atmosphere, and quality food, I strongly recommend a couple of places nearby that beat Tambellini's hands down - McDonalds or SubWay."
1,"New in town I was looking for a great brow wax and based on all the wonderful reviews I made an appointment with d'Lisa at the Scottsdale location.  She was friendly and the salon is clean and has a great vibe.  I then had the fastest brow wax ever, literally less than 5 minutes.  I took a quick look in the mirror and was out the door.  When I got home and looked closer I discovered that one brow is 1/8 of an inch from my center line and the other a half inch.  I look crooked and then I noticed I have a hole in one brow.  The gap on the 1/2 inch side looks dumb and I need to pencil it in.   \n\nSuper bummed, won't be going back."
1,"The worst service and customer service, hands down, I have ever experienced with any company, EVER. EVER. I set up a 3 bottle a month deal through costco for 18$/ mo. EVERY SINGLE scheduled delivery was missed, multiple times, EVERY SINGLE delivery was incorrect and required MULTIPLE phones calls and was never corrected. Charged for deliveries I didnt ask for, charged for all of the mistake they couldn't get right. NONE of my phone calls seemed to register, or be noted or recorded anywhere..EVER. In my first month of service I called the company 15 times. Finally, after realizing they were utterly incompetent, not to be trusted, and after i called to cancel, i was charged auto debited for what was to be the last month, i called back and requested my debit card be removed from their system. I said i didn't trust them to get the billing right. Smart deal - i get a $39 dollar bill in the mail for erroneous deliveries i never asked for, and asked them to pick up. Every single charge due to their own mistakes. Not only are the people working for this company incompetent, they are dishonest liars. No joke - it is easier to go to the store and buy 30 1 gallon jugs of water every month than deal with this crap. Not to mention, cheaper - gas included."
1,"Price reflects quality and service.  5/2010 purchased wedding gown, brides maids and mothers (bride and groom mothers and grandmothers) dresses.  Girls were rude and our brides maids dresses seems and straps fell apart just before the wedding."
1,"Should have checked my Yelp...\n\nCame in here again on an emergency mission - looking for a cable to make my DVD Burner work so I could burn the memorial video for my cousins funeral.  So I may have been a little frazzled.\n\nI walked in and stopped dead, not sure where to look.  They have all this crap up front now, it looks more like a toy store than a Radio Shack.  In fact, now that I think of it, I don't think there was a single radio in site.\n\nI stand there , look around blankly and blink for a few minutes, when the employee notices another living, breathing person in the store.  I think it scared him, so used to being alone.....It was clear that I was taking him away from something very important and non-customer service related, and he really didn't like the intrusion.  I explained what I needed, and he didn't even try to look or help. Just told me they don't have those cables. Buh-Bye.  Didn't even offer a suggestion on where else to go, ask what I needed them for, nope, just a \""Don't let the door hit you on the way out\"" attitude.\n\nI fled, practically in tears thinking I was going to let the whole family down.  In the end, it all worked out, and I'm glad Radio Shack didn't get a dime of my money."
1,"Horrific experience!! I was probed and prodded without even a smile!  Can you at least offer to buy me a drink? Never mind, I wouldn't even take a drink from these heartless people that work here. They treat you like cattle meat. Stamp! Poke! Next!"
1,"An Eiffel Tower-shaped drink is cool in concept, but in reality.....the design of it is not consumer-friendly!\n\nIf you have limp, spaghetti arms like me, and drink slow, the Eiffel Tower drink will start getting really, really heavy when walking the strip.  I ordered the margarita strawberry daiquiri, and guess what...now i know, i'm not a fan of margaritas.  I like my mixed drinks to hide all traces of alcohol taste, yet still deliver the same drunken consequences and have me holding on to the ground to keep me from falling off the earth.  If you don't mind the taste, the drink does pack quite a punch.  I had to throw in ice cubes to dilute that bad boy.\n\nTip of advice from a Vegas party veteran: Skip the Eiffel Tower. Grab the guitar or fat tuesday bong-looking drink, basically anything that comes with a STRAP!  We all know that the last thing you want to have to worry about while walking around inebriated is HOLDING ONTO YO DRINK!"
1,"Why didn't I go to Kmart?  Filthy bathroom, already been hit up for money.  Total lack of customer service.  In fact I like to call their customer service department, Lack of Customer Service.  The works always looked over worked and annoyed to have to answer a question or help.  I mean the nerve of me!"
1,"I can't speak to the quality of the pizza here, but the rest of their food was awful. We found a little menu in our door and thought we'd give it a shot by ordering the buffalo chicken fingers with a side of Greek fries. On the menu its listed as 10 or 6 wings for $6.99 (which doesn't make a lot of sense) but when we ordered on the phone were told it was TWELVE for $6.99, something we confirmed three times before hanging up. The food took about an hour to show up, which isn't that bad. What was bad were the fries, which were nowhere near being done. They were a wet, soggy mess and a total write off. The chicken fingers tasted like they were frozen, microwaved, then brought to us an hour later. To cap things off, this whole debacle cost $20. We asked for a couple extra ranch dips, they charged us a buck each for three of them. Then they charged us $9.99 for the chicken (even though we confirmed the $6.99 price 3 times on the phone) and $2.99 for the uncooked fries. Add the delivery charge and tip and we were left $20 poorer and still hungry 90 minutes later. Based on this experience I wouldn't dare try ordering a pizza or anything else from here."
1,"I am sorry but this show was just plain BOOORING, the big fat stupid baby is just lame, the host has too much time on the show and its not funny when its desperately trying to be funny. \nDont think im not a Cirque fan because I am, I loved KA and Zumanity, but Mystere is just overated, skip it.\nVery blah."
1,"Horrible service and food. Worst beef Enchilada I have ever had, even I know Mexican Rice doesn't have peas and corn in it, and margarita tasted like it was poured from a can. This is not considered real Mexican restaurant in my eyes. Was definitely a waste of money!!"
1,"This Walmart was just like any other walmart, except, the employees were extremely rude and not helpful at all. I will no longer be going to this walmart, I will drive the extra miles to another walmart for the smiles and friendly help!!!"
1,***WARNING****\nDO NOT EVER go to this club!! WORST club I've ever been to. The girls there are hideous and fat. There is a dancer there named Suzy Q that smells so bad. She left the stench of stinky underarm on the sleeve of my shirt when she sat down on me. I almost bought the deodorant out of the vending machine to give to her. Most all of the girls are very unfriendly and lazy. They have great drink specials but that is the only good thing about that club but I wouldn't recommend this club to my worst ememy.
1,My gf sent me as a treat and it was the worst massage ever. I left before finishing the 90 minutes. I probably feel better massaging myself. So very disappointed.
1,"I booked this hotel on Hotwire for 1 night. It was about 1/3 of the cost of staying on the strip on a Saturday night and we were only going to be in the hotel for about 9 hours so I figured, why not? This hotel is in need of some serious updates. There was water dripping from the ceiling in the hallway leading to our elevator. The area was roped off with a garbage can in the middle to catch the water but it was still dripping on people as you walked by. The room was ok, bed was comfortable. We went down early to spend a little time at the pool before checkout. Not crowded like most pools on the strip, so that was nice. We went back to our room shortly before checkout so I could take a quick shower before checking out. I opened the shower curtain to find a puddle of black sludge on the floor of the shower. Needless to say, I decided against showering in it. When I told the front desk about it at checkout, she had a bit of an attitude that I was complaining because I didn't call anyone to tell them 1st. I tried explaining to her that there wasn't really time for that, as I had to check out. She gave me a free upgrade for next time, but I don't foresee myself ever staying here again! I can definitely see why they lost their \""Hilton\"" affiliation!!"
1,"I was really looking forward to a neighborhood donut shop, but I couldn't have been more disappointed. First, their menu consists of a counter with donuts on display, half of which don't have a description as to what they are. Now, I get it, donut shops don't normally have a menu of ingredients for their donuts, but this place has made an extra effort to make their donuts \""different\"" and I don't feel my confusion was unjustified. After, being given explanations as to donut flavors by an, much annoyed by my inquiries, employee.  My wife and I got 4 donuts, I got the maple bacon donut and the strawberry short cake donut, but you could have just called them the greasy and sticky ones. As for my wife, I guess they weren't memorable enough to remember what she got and let me put it this way, 2 weeks later one of them is still sitting in my fridge. I can't see myself going back here ever, but I do see groupons in o face's future."
1,"WELL, I see all the below comments are ditto to mine.  1st time there and I can guarantee the last.  The food came cold and no taste whatsoever, the staff wasn't any different, that is if you can find them. \""We waited almost\n4-5 minutes for someone to wait on us, and when they did rushed us like they had somewhere else to be\"" (oh did I mention there was 1 other table there) soooo yes it wasn't busy AT ALL.\n\nTo bad in this busy location they won't last long either while their competition is.........across the street \""Burger King\"" (not a much better example but a familiar name to all) ICEBERG even though it is a national chain \""what kind of rookie name is that\""...Oh yes did I mention Freddy's hamburgers only 1/4 of a mile (that's the one to beat) and no chance in that.\n\nNOT IMPRESSED AT ALL...."
1,"That was the worst coffee shop experience I've ever had.  And there isn't a close second.\n\nIf your definition of a \""high end\"" coffee shop means snobby and condescending servers, long waits when no one else is there, marginal (at best) and overpriced coffee, and very few options to make your coffee the way you like it - then this is definitely your place!\n\nWow, I've drank coffee all over the world and in some of the best coffee roasters in the country...including Intelligentsia in Chicago where 21st sources their beans. You would never be treated that way there.  Never. The barista acted like she (they) had discovered the meaning of life and us Pittsburghers should be so grateful to have them share it with us.  Newsflash - pour overs and direct trade coffee are not new to the coffee scene.  Get over yourself 21st.  I could have let it all go if my straight black coffee was a fine cup, but alas...\n\nMy advice? Save your time, money, and taste buds and go to Espresso a Mano in Lawrenceville, Cannon Coffee in Brookline, La Prima in the Strip or any of the other joints in town that serve great coffee without the condescending attitude. I wanted a good cup of coffee, not a lecture and a marginal one.  What a waste."
1,Traveling from San Francisco saw the store ate breakfast next door and then went to go to the uniform store and they were closed even though the sign said they open at 8am\nWe waited until 815 still no sign of anyone \nVery disappointing
1,"Used to enjoy it here. Apparently they suddenly have a dress code. The owner walked past me, one of the bartenders, got my wristband from the guy at the door and paid another guy my cover and not one of them said a word about not being able to wear a hat. Right after I paid my cover an employee hassled me about it. Demanded my money back and left. Won't be back. I also used to like Images but reconsidering my patronage there as well since it has the same owner."
1,This buffet sucked! You'd be better off going to Hometown Buffet. The Rio and Mirage buffets are still far better than this dive. The design and atmosphere is simplistic and strange.  They could have made this place much more Romanequese. It may have been named after a Roman God but the food and atmosphere wasn't even good enough for mere mortals like us.
1,"Gave the restaurant a second shot - equally disappointed.  Bar service was slow, 45 minutes to get an appetizer from an inattentive waitress.  Once at our table, we watched our salads walk around the restaurant twice before the server found our table.  Waiter served the entrees and walked away, never checked to see how our meal was.  While tasty, the portions are small.\n\nUnfortunately, the best part of this restaurant is the valet service.  Don't frustrate yourself, dine elsewhere with friends."
1,"Upon walking into the office I was a bit perplexed. I thought I was entering a free clinic. I'm still not sure. My appointment was for 1pm. I wasn't seen until 1:50pm. Had I been that late they would have cancelled my appointment. Nonetheless I saw Bryan Monson, at least I think it was Bryan Monson, perhaps it was (Silver Surfer: Can enter Hyperspace. tied Nova He can enter Hyperspace as well. tied Green Lantern)the whole appointment lasted 1 minute 35 seconds. He referred me to  Dr. Garcia in the office for surgery. Explained it for about 15 seconds to my daughter. I guess I'm too old to understand and was out like a shot. Yeah, errr won't be going back. No thanks for the Botox."
1,Worst place I've EVER experienced as far as Chinese food goes. How hard is it to f up chinese food but these guys figured it out! It started when I called in the order and the gal couldn't understand a lick of english (no surprise there) but then she kept yelling my credit card number after I read it to her over again. Along with with the security code one the back. Just f-ed up business all together and their food is substandard. Never would go back or recommend to another not based on the credit card breech but based on how crappy the food is as well. SO MANY other Chinese restaurants around. Find one that's worthy of your patronage :)
1,Run for the hills! The owner is disrespectful and doesn't know how to even act like an owner. The place is unsanitary. I  was with my girlfriend and she found a black hair in my salad. The owner at first told me the wind blew the hair into my salad and then offered to make me a side salad. My salad was an entree size. Then she tried holding on to my salad until I asked why and she said try were going to reheat the chicken that was on the salad with the hair. I told her no thank you and that's not sanitary. She got upset and I asked for a refund. I think she gave me a refund because she was afraid that the customers would have overheard me. You would think making a new salad with new chicken wouldn't be an issue but obviously money is more important to her than a loyal customer. It's unfortunate she doesn't care about her customers.
1,"2nd time in a row that they have overbooked and now I am waiting for a car. Why bother making reservations when they don't have enough cars! I was supposed to pick up my car at 11:15 am and it is 12:30, and they say it will be ready in another 30 mins. Whoever the operations manager is should seriously consider other career paths, because clearly this is not an area of strengh!"
1,"On December 19, 2014, I noticed that my outdoor freezer had a puddle of water surrounding it. I quickly ran out to Lowe's in search of a replacement freezer. We have never been a fans of the Rock Hill Lowe's, so we went to the one in Fort Mill. They told us that they would look and see if they had any in stock. Well, turns out they did not have any in stock, but they would call the Rock Hill Lowe's to check for us. It was taking quite a while to hear back from the staff in Rock Hill, so we went ahead and drove over to the Lowe's in Rock Hill, while waiting on the one in Fort Mill to give us a call on our cell phone. Fort Mill had not called us in the 15 minutes it took us to get to Rock Hill, nor did they ever call at all to let us know an answer. We were not happy with Lowe's, so we searched other stores such as Sears and Home Depot. We finally found a store with a freezer in stock, but never did we hear a response from the Lowe's in Fort Mill. Very slow and inconsiderate service. In the future, while searching for appliance needs, I will stop at Sears and Home Depot."
1,"Grossly exaggerated positive reviews. I suspect the bulk of them were cleverly submitted by Cosmo's PR firm.  \n\nThe rooms run entirely through the television set, from lighting to temperature, yet the remote batteries were spent. I replaced them with my own just to turn the heat down. It took two days to get staff to replace numerous burned out bulbs. We finally resorted to moving bulbs around so the loo wouldn't be in utter darkness. \n\nI give this hotel one star not for any of the above but for the audacity to charge our room $68.00 for the mini-bar, which we didn't use. Audacity for their flippant attitude about an accounting error they claim is common. We were told that just opening the fridge, which we used for our own goods, triggers a charge.  We think it's a sick and twisted profit center. Checking in was a pain and checking out even more difficult."
1,Can't really comment because I came on normal business hours and at normal time at 4pm and they were closed no sign no nothing . Kinda disappointing.
1,"don't go here.\nafter reading reviews, i went to it.\ni and my friend ordered 2 pastas. they were horrible taste.\nalfredo didn't have anything. only it and sauce.\nif you are very hungry, i want to recoomend here.\nthey serve huge amount of pastas"
1,"I'm all about supporting small local businesses but I was lied to by John Mull employees about something I consider important.\n\nI called once and asked if they carried grass fed, pasture raised beef. The woman who answered the phone said yes so I went down and purchased two steaks. I verified one more time before purchasing that the beef was grass fed and again I was told yes. The steaks tasted great, but grass fed beef has a particular taste.\n\nFeeling skeptical, I called again today to see if they had any more in stock and to get the name of their supplier. The woman who answered the phone consulted with someone else and told me they don't carry grass fed beef, nor have they ever."
1,I tried to go here to get a bite to eat and have a Smithwick's.  There's a fridge with premade sandwiches and no Smithwick's.  I don't think you can call yourself an Irish Pub just because one of the 6 beers you have on tap is a Guinness.  I ended up going somewhere else...
1,I ordered delivery from this place - about $35 worth of sushi and food. When the delivery driver came to our apartment I asked for change on $40 and I was going to give him a tip. The delivery driver (shorter asian man) started YELLING at me about how he drove across town and he couldn't believe I was going to give him less than a $5 tip. Are you kidding me sir? I don't technically have to tip you at all! The guy was extremely rude and I will NEVER order from this location again. Tip: Go to the Edo location on Monona drive! They have always been great and have awesome customer service!
1,I only put one start because I was going to invite me my mom but as soon as I walked in someone rudely said we are closed ! So in my head I'm like ohh well shouldn't you have locked the doors for I wouldn't have wasted my time going inside . Plus it was 2:05 I don't think u should say no to a costumer right away
1,I dont understand how taco bell is still in business in AZ where there are hundreds of great mexican restaurants. Taco bell is garbage!
1,"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. This is by far the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Firstly, the horchata is made from a mix. As a result of this, it is chalky. Secondly, the nachos have that fake nacho cheese and round yellow chips, not anything remotely authentic or Mexican. The only okay thing was the meat. This was more like a cheap meal you would get at a theater; completely overpriced and shitty. I can see why it has late hours; only drunk people would classify this as a good meal. Anyone who has been to a real, authentic Mexican restaurant should proceed with caution."
1,They don't have the usual great subway service that you would expect from a subway. Ive been in multiple tines and employees have not had a uniform. No great and they are mean when attend to you. I recommend the service at jersey mikes better.
1,"it's Monday night and I'm on hold trying to make a group reservation (they consider 8 people a LARGE group)\nI speak direclty to someone at the restaurant and they decide they don't want to deal with me, so they tell me they're going to transfer me to group reservations. LIAR! she transfered me to Caesar's restaurant line (which I already know is unable to reserve LARGE parties.  So i'm a ping pong between the lines for about 15 minutes...ya, I even wrote this review while I waited!!! HA! A guy by the name of Brandon tells me they'll have to take my number and call me back...let's see when and IF they call me back!!!"
1,Something has changed at this location...I'm a regular here and the drive thru service has been slow for the last 3 weeks...If doesn't improve looks like Dutch bros will be worth the trip.
1,"Gross. Gross, gross, gross. \nNot my choice to dine here. The food is super greasy, inauthentic, and unpleasant. Even the fruit cup had stupid fruit- you know, the kind that's not ripe and isn't varied. \n\nThere are so many amazing restaurants in Vegas, and not all of them are expensive. If you're using yelp, please, go find a better spot for breakfast."
1,"This place looks good on the cover but comes up way short.  I liked the menu and the photo menu - but the sushi wasn't fresh.  Everything came out all pretty but tasted bad.  Upon further review, most of the rolls are california rolls with stuff on them. \n\nI ordered 4 pieces of eel that were chewy.  They put WAY too much rice on each sushi piece and the rice was undercooked or something.  NOTHING we ate melted in your mouth like a good piece of sushi or a roll should do.  We ordered 5 rolls and an assortment of sushi and soups.  The mushroom soup that was $3 more than the normal miso soup had maybe 8 small mushroom fragments in it.  The chopsticks they give you are the cheap grocery store kind with splinters.  Too bad the sushi wasn't as good as you can get from some grocery stores... yes it was that bad - I'm never going back here again."
1,"Used this place before and was satisfied with there service for septic wait removal. 7 years later we call to use them again and they charged us twice as much as last time and spent less time draining the septic tank and he was rude and seem to be in a hurry to get on out of there, and we didn't feel like they did not do a good and quality job. 6 month later its full again. And won't help us out with this bad service they did for us.  Would never recommend to anyone find a better company to do business with."
1,"The only reason I am giving this a one star is because this was my second time there, and this time, they messed up on processing my credit card and charge me $84.01 for my chicken wings. the lady said she voided it, then swiped my card again and fixed the price, 5 days later it was still taken out of my bank account. My bank is going to fix this for me, but I should not have had to go through all this hassle just for these dang wings. Because of this mistake of theirs I will find another wing place. I mean what if I had needed that money for a bill or something. Get it together."
1,This place was great the first time I went. The second time was awful. I got tom kha soup and ordered it at a 2/10 for spicy and literally made me gag it was soooo spicy and I sent it back with my server who barely spoke english. He brought me back a new soup in THE SAME POT and it was the exact same soup with just coconut milk added into it. So I asked for a manager. no manager was working so I spoke with a senior employee who also didn't speak English. She explained to me that the soup was sent back and it was mixed with a soup mix since we already ate some of it (we literally had one bite and sent it back) after it getting sent back twice we finally got a new one. This one actually came with all the ingredients and it tasted like something other than fire! Still a bitch and a half to get my order right though.
1,"The beef was overcooked, dry, and mostly tasteless. That said, it was still \""tender\"" as it was cut thin/against the grain (it is possible for meat to be both tender/dry/overcooked). I used a groupon to eat there so I wasn't too disappointed, however if I had paid full price I would have been pretty pissed. For what they charge (close to 10 bucks for a sandwich/fries/drink) it needs to be a heck of a lot better than what they serve."
1,"If the restaurant business includes some degree of customer service, then this place has NO business being open. Perhaps the worst service I've ever had and to top it off, I sent an item back, only because it was terrible, and they did not take it off the bill.\n\nSorry Charlie but there are a million good restaurants to go to and this one has been crossed off our list forever."
1,"The food was really good! Robata Kobe with wasabi just melted in my mouth! My favorite was the enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon... However the service was horrible! The server we started of with  was so monotone. I thought at first it was just us at first but we heard him talk to other tables around us, he sounded the same. Although he did have a little bit more enthusiasm with the table next to us. He checked on everyone else but us only to take our order and when we did called him over. I tried to even give them a bit of time to come, i understood that they were bz.It took us 20 minutes to get our check, only bc I had finally grab someone's attention. And she cleared our table first before getting our check, which took another ten minutes on top of the 20 it took to get someone over!! I brought my children and I felt like they stereo typed us ahead of time bc of that. We always leave 18-20% grat.  Sometimes even more! But they set themselves for this one! I work in service myself and I would never treat anyone like this! Correct me if I'm wrong!! The women servers were nice though!"
1,"We went back for another visit just a couple of weeks ago, hoping things had gotten better.\n\nNope.\n\nWe wanted to sit outside, near the fire.  You'd think we asked the hostess if we could sit on the roof.  Obviously, we pissed her off just by daring to come in.  Service was slow - and it wasn't even that busy!  And for the love of Pete, could you do something about your staff yelling out orders and such?  \n\nSorry, as much as I like supporting local businesses, we won't be back."
1,Update: I went back again at a later time. The place was pretty empty. \nService was slow and kinda bad. I think the person was new and didn't really know what to do. \nThere was mold on the fruit going around and also the salad was wilted and brown. \nWould never be going back....
1,"US Today needs to have its head examined. Had a brunch buffet for $25 which featured really, compared to Bellagio and the superb Cosmopolitan, very few choices. Dry brisket and sausages. Seafood bar without seafood. Had a small cup which had a handful of gamey shrimp and crab pieces in it. Needed a big mug of green tea to wipe my mouth clean after that. Desserts were equally a mixed bag. Gelato was fine, but forget the dry little chocolate mousse pieces or even worse the over sweetened pecan tart. More green tea was needed. Best part of the buffet, other than the green tea, was a raw fuji apple. Imagine that... and they didn't even have to cook it at the hotel. Forget the hype and avoid this culinary waste space."
1,"This is a tough review to write. On the one hand their cook is incredible! He's nice, remembers your order, and makes one of the best Breakfast Burritos in town! I would highly recommend getting the Bacon one and adding jalepenos. \n\nAlso, if you go there for lunch and get one of their specials, it is very generica cafeteria food. Of the items served on their specials, typically one is pretty good, one is really bad (to the point you can't eat it), and one is mediocre. \n\nWhile the food passes the test for cheap quick food, what kills this place in the ratings is the cashier's ability to be unfriendly, almost all of the time. If you go there just once or twice, you wouldn't even notice it. But, if you go there most days of the week for breakfast, it starts to ruin the great breakfast burrito.\n\nI'll still eat here, but if anyone recommends anywhere else, count me in!"
1,"The great reviews are not a TRUE reflection of this place. \n\nThis is NOT an authentic Greek resturant. Be  aware!!! My biggest complaint about this place...the food is not cooked fresh :-( \n\nI ordered a chicken greek salad, which tasted pretty good, but the meat was processed. I politely asked the male owner about the chicken, who responded by saying the chicken was fresh, they season it, grill it and then \""heat\"" it up in the oven as it's ordered. If the meat is heated up, is it \""heated up\"" in a microwave??? \n\nThe pita bread that comes with the salad was cold and hard. I couldn't even eat it. I asked the owner if the bread was always that hard. He responded with an attitude and told me the bread is NOT cooked fresh at the store. They put herbs and oil in it and heat it up. He continued to respond with an attitude and asked me if I wanted my money back. \n\nWhen I decide to dine out (especially at a Greek resturant), I expect for my food to be cooked fresh, without it being processed!"
1,Tried to go here twice. Both times closed. Won't waste my time anymore. They don't wanna keep a regular schedule they don't need my $
1,Here today and was treated so rude by a 40 something male bartender. \n\nWhat an idiot. Why are people mean?  There was not reason to be rude you could tell that he was often rude to people as other employee had their heads down. He was some type of manager probably sad about how his life turned out so he treats people rude because there is nowhere else to go in the airport. \n\nIf you can avoid it do not go here
1,"I am completely disappointed in this establishment today. 30 minutes in the drive thru line. Then the kid was an ass when we asked what was taking so long, he said we are understaffed and busy! As we finally get to the window we wait 15 more minutes for 2 iced birthday cakes and a small watermelon! And look through the window as the staff are all just standing around looking at one another. I usually love this place but man it's summer in Az you think you would be staffed for these hot days!!!"
1,"Each year during the last 7 years, we would go to this place for Chinese when we were in town for a trade show.  It's noisy and cramped,  but the food was good and the price was ok. But after this year's experience we've decided they're not worth it.  Their services suck. The waiters/waitresses are typically rude, and worse yet very ineffective.  For two days in a row they somehow managed to lose our phone reservation, and wouldn't accommodate us. Obviously they're clueless that we were returning customers, and there are many other options in Las Vegas."
1,"Been here a few times, only because we live near by. In the evening this place usually has a long line. They are usually under staff here, so the wait is long. When the employees are busy and in a rush they will usually make mistakes. Management really needs to help out and make sure customer service is a number one priority! I try to avoid this location and go somewhere else."
1,"You get what you pay for.  Took my first and last trip on Spirit.  Flew from Las Vegas to Fort Lauderdale and back.  The plane was a dog.  My window seat looked like it was cleaned with mop water.  Garbage in my seat pocket.  A seat that wouldn't recline.  Dirty head rests.  A 4.5 hour flight and i'm not even offered water?  Maybe that's a good thing since only one of the two lavatories was working.  Spirit did get me there on time, but I ran for a shower immediately."
1,"I live in Henderson and travel almost weekly.  TSA is pretty much hit or miss... but mostly miss... so good luck with that.\n\nMy problem is the TSA Pre-Check.\n\nSince I live in the area the tram at Gate C is easier to use since I usually do not check bags.  However, they do NOT offer TSA Precheck altho they do in the D gates just alongside the C gate line.\n\nThey did start for a while, but quickly stopped.   The last time I went through the D gates to be 'let inside' the C gates by a TSA agent.  No one showed up.   Two TSA agents were coming in so tried to exit as they entered.  Was LOUDLY encountered with a WHERE ARE YOU GOING!?  and even when said C-gate Precheck was condescended to and made to show the boarding pass.   Next time they didn't even allow C gate passengers to enter.\n\nSo now go to the main C-Gate (Southwest) security area.  I show my boarding pass and am pointed to a special line that wraps along the wall to ONE TSA agent at a TSA PREcheck booth.  Usually 10 or 12 people deep.   \n\nWhich would be no problem EXCEPT there are TWO OTHER agents at a stand BOTH with TSA PreCheck signs that the 'general public' can get in line for and then go through Pre-Check themselves.  And NO, the 'main' TSA PreCheck line does NOT have access to the other two stations."
1,Mikkie Finnz's sister bar next door. The food is almost as horrible.  The fish and chips suck and so does the whole menu. DO not eat here.
1,"I called this business to get an estimate for tile roof repair and no one ever called me back.  Bad business ethic.  They have an answering service, so there is no excuse.  Probably if I would have said that I needed a NEW roof, I would have received a call.  I even gave them the name of the person who referred them to me."
1,"Wow. all i can say is disaster. overpriced food , small portions.. come on , 3 french fries with the burger? .. could go on about the food, buy why bother. \nService... not much to say there , because there was barely any. sat at bar. yea it was steady but the bartenders where like deer in headlights. not sure what the problem is there or who is to blame."
1,My fianc\u00e9 and I were looking for BBQ on the 4th of July and decided to stop at Toms. I was looking for a reminder of how delicious BBQ is. For it to be the 4th of July the food was not satisfying. The ribs had lots of fatty pieces. The Mac n cheese was bland and it's possible that it was from the day before. The bake beans were straight from a can no unique taste. This place is good for someone who has never had BBQ before...
1,"Really dissapointing. I went in for carry out (was just hoping to get a Bahn Mi sandwich). I waited almost 20 minutes and felt that the lady that took my order could have cared less that I was there - she was cold.\n\nThe sandwich was tiny (compared to other Bahn Mi I have had) and it did not taste real fresh. \n\nOn this one, I suggest you pass."
1,This guy is an idiot I wanted a full interior detail because I was going on a trip. I did not need an outside car was it was going to get full of bugs the same day. Regardless he flat out refused to do the work for 150 dollars which I was fine with I can leave the house because I have a baby and I was more than happy to pay that rate. He said that he needed to make more money than that.\n\nI will never call this guy for the company or personal vehicles.
1,"Absolutely horrible!  We were lied to by all the staff. The cashier treated us poorly and called u liars, and the wait which we were told would only be 1hr quickly went to 3 hours and when we check on our status a fourth time we were told it would still be another hour.  The staff are rude, and treat everyone as if they are stupid and below them.  \n\nWe would never recumbent this place to anyone!!!"
1,"I have to search long and hard for things in this store that don't expire the day I'm purchasing them. They don't have a lot of the things they offer in their weekly ad, which I try to plan my grocery list around. The lines are always SUPER long. The store is always dirty. I keep telling myself I'll go to another store but there isn't another one in the 'hood to go to, so I'll need to make a better plan to head further away for a better experience in another chain. I've tried to talk to assistant managers about my issues at the store and have been blown off or they act afraid and stutter a lot. \n\nThe only good news: The gentlemen that bag groceries and collect carts are VERY nice and helpful."
1,"The staff allowed a woman whom I nicely asked to contain her children, berate me and come back twice to tell me how \""mean and evil\"" of a person that I am for asking her to quiet her screaming children during lunch.  I asked the staff to remove her, and they simply stood and watched/listened.  I've never been treated so horribly in a restaurant.  My friend and I will not be returning, and I will share this experience with everyone that I know.  I asked for the manager, and he did not choose to help the situation by showing up.  As a former restaurant owner, I am horrified and disgusted."
1,"The restaurant here is horrible. The food is okay, nothing special but not awful. However, the service is probably the worst I have ever experienced. I went with a group of coworkers and the waiter repeatedly screwed up. He forgot our orders and had to come back and ask, brought somebody the wrong drink and somebody else got the wrong entree, and to top it off, he charged us for more food than we actually ordered. Luckily one of my coworkers caught the mistake. We talked to the manager and he gave us extra game cards which really didn't make up for the horrible service but at least it was something. I do not recommend this place for food"
1,I think they just put lipstick on a pig. Was in the casino floor for an hour and was not offered a drink. The casino area is very small. It seems they didnt have money to spend on the parking elevators.  Also believe is not handicap friendly when it comes to spacing everything is cramped and is difficult to manuver.\n\nThe guys at vallet were very courteous.
1,"Be prepared to take 3 ID's and a credit card with you because apparently these guys don't know how to identify their customers. We waited for almost an hour because 4 bouncers kept on insisting that my friends ID wasn't hers even after she answered their questions and showed them her credit card which by the way had another picture of her.\n\nSo after that whole unnecessary ordeal (the guy was just being a douche) we went to another club and guess what, we got in. Been to the majority of the clubs here in Vegas and never has this happened. All I can say is the staff here better get their heads out of their a** and realize people aren't going to look exactly the same on their license, especially after it was taken 4 years ago."
1,"Eff this place....It was the last resort for presidents day weekend for one night. It was either this or the Tropicana. Every hotel on the strip had \""no vacancies\"" BS but whatever.  The Luxor smells like dead corpse. We checked in wanted a king, all they had was 2 queen in the pyramid..ok.....Got into the room it looked like house keeping didnt even vacuum or change the sheets. Was charged double on my card and didnt know until I got back home. WTF!!!788 to stay in that dump i might as well went to the WYNN! So I had to call accounting a tthe luxor and they kept telling me it was a pending transaction, WHY WOULDNT THE FRONT DESK TELL YOU THAT THEYRE GOING TO CHARGE AN EXTRA 388 ON YOUR CARD?! After screaming at the dumbazz on the phone she told me I'd be refunded one of the amounts by the end of the day. Tacos & Tequila was good spot to eat at . The staff seemed miserable, maybe because it was early?(3:30pm)   My advice is to avoid the Luxor..big disappointment. AND NEVER WILL STAY THERE AGAIN."
1,"New to area and saw a coupon in one of our mails. Decided to take my daughter to check it out we got there at 9:29 pm and it looked like they were closing,  the open sign was shut off and the screens were down. Even though yelp says they close at 10. Bad first impression will stick with Froyona."
1,"Ate ate Popeye at many states, this is not it!\nThe spicy chicken is NOT spicy yet it contains more grease then chicken, purely inedible. no idea how they get away with it in a corporate environment."
1,"Whatta bummer this place is!!  I saw it on DDD and it looked like it was going to be the best BBQ the world has ever produced.   Lucky for me I was heading to my grandpas in Tucson so Thee Pitts Again was only about 45 min out of my way (That's nothing when it comes to good BBQ).  Maybe it was because I was there on a Tuesday at about 11AM and I got all the leftovers from say ummm.......Saturday.  Stupid me I asked the waitress what's good to which I received the standard answered of \""Everything\"" so that's what I ordered give me 1 of everything.   She returned with a huge plate probably weighing 6 pounds everything looked the same, I couldn't really tell what was what.  I think I had about 1 bite of each item paid my $30 tab and went to Weinerschnitzl for some good food."
1,"I'm stunned to see the number of overwhelmingly positive reviews about Greenberg's. I can only assume that most have never eaten outstanding Jewish deli food, and, as often happens with reviews on Yelp, a lack of reference points leads to a misevaluation.\n\nPeople need to understand what Greenberg's is. It's essentially a fast food version of an authentic Jewish deli--a replica that has the basic look and feel of an authentic deli, but not the food quality or soul. This is obviously a common phenomenon on the Vegas Strip.\n\nFolks who've been to the great delis, like Katz's in NYC, Lester's in Montreal, Canter's in Los Angeles, or any of the other great delis, know what real Jewish deli food tastes like. They know what real matzo ball soup tastes like, and what the best pastrami tastes like. \n\nGreenberg's is a 2-star deli at best, and, quite honestly, is just a fast food version of a Jewish deli. It kills me to know that people leave Greenberg's believing they've just eaten quality Jewish deli food. Oy vey!"
1,"Visited Coco's on a Monday afternoon (parking lot was \""unusually\"" sparse.. counted 3 cars total.  Seating was quick, order was taken quickly, salads were delivered quickly.  The main entree didn't arrive until 30 minutes later (entire restaurant was empty except maybe 2-3 tables.  Someone must have to slaughter a cow to make 2 cheeseburgers.  My stomach felt upset for about an hour afterwards.. Service was A-ok, waitress had to be reminded to refill the tea, didn't take up completed dishes (manager took some of the dishes and said he be right back to pick up the rest  - - didn't happen.  Waitress was advised to split the checks - - didn't happen, sent her back to make the change.\n\nCoco's gong down the same path as Marie Callendars.."
1,"Update Juni 2013:\nMeine Aktualisierung wertet die Eisdiele leider weiter ab. Ich wollte heute auf dem Ochsenfest in Hagsfeld eine Kugel Eis f\u00fcr meinen kleinen Sohn kaufen und habe um einen Pappbecher (!!!) gebeten (der Kleine hat eine Milchallergie und darf keine Waffel). Die Dame sagte mir, dass es bei einer Kugel nur eine Waffel gibt und ich 20c aufzahlen m\u00fcsste. Da die Kugel bereits EUR 0,90 kostet, war ich hierzu nicht bereit. Ich pers\u00f6nlich finde das kein gutes Gesch\u00e4ftsgebahren zudem die Preise pro Kugel schon happig sind.Heute bin ich an dieser netten Eisdiele vorbeigeradelt. Eine nette Eisverk\u00e4uferin hat mir ein Eis mit zwei Kugeln verkauft. Bis dahin glatte 5 Sterne  nett, authentisch, sauber. Das Eis allerdings hat mich nicht begeistert. Zitrone war noch ok, aber bei dem Heidelbeer Eis hatte ich ich das Gef\u00fchl in einen Schneeball zu bei\u00dfen. Eiskristalle, die auch zu sehen waren. Nichts cremiges, sondern eher so der aufgetaut und dann wieder eingefroren Effekt (wobei ich das nicht unterstellen m\u00f6chte). Vielleicht h\u00e4tte man das Eis ein wenig l\u00e4nger r\u00fchren k\u00f6nnen. Die Waffel war auch nicht der Hit und daher habe ich diese entsorgt. Hat mich schwer an Esspapier erinnert. Fazit: Netter Laden, aber woanders gibts besseres Eis."
1,Service is horrible !  Simple as that \nI felt like regulars and member of the same race was being favored I waited 15 mins for the table which doesn't bother me at all ! If your busy that's fine \nI sat down and waited for 10 mins no water or anything was brought to me ... 20 mins passed I flagged down a busser and informed him I was ready to order can he notify my sever 30 mins passed \nAnd nothing I told my wife to just wait a lil longer and nothin \nAfter 35 mins they can we ordered and I waited for my 23 mins for my food it arrived I ate and had to wait another 24 mins for my check ...
1,"AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!!!!!!  Waitress was friendly and prompt, but after our order was put in it took over 30 min for the food to reach the table.  I ordered pineapple upside down pancakes.  I don't know how you can mess up pancakes but they did.  The pancakes were so bland and the pineapple was sour.  Terrible!  The country fried steak and gravy was good though.  Between the wait and the awful pancake experience turned me off.  I'll go elsewhere."
1,"Again ,let me start by saying I am in the restaurant business. \nUncle Bears is a cute idea gone wrong. The concept is lost....what is Uncle Bears ? A sports bar, A pet friendly family restaurant?  An offshoot of an often repeated some kind of something with no identity? I am not sure what it is. \nI am sure that the food is HORRIBLE. Just garbage....The taste reflects the quality....HORRENDOUS. Enough said on the food.\nAmbience.......HUH ? I along with all 4 of my dining companions were totally confused as to what they were trying to do. In addition, we all thought it was a \""hollow\"" feeling in the restaurant. It just doesn't work. It is a cross between several ideas that do not go together at all.\nPrice point is 3 steps above the quality of food being served. Alot of other reviews state precisely this. The price is an insult to those of us that know better. If you don't know better ...enjoy. But enjoy soon the doors will be closing."
1,"Horrible! We waited in the lobby full of people for over 20 mins for a table. Normally I don't mind waiting but when I look and see servers shooting the breeze and half the restaurant empty well then it becomes an issue. Finally got a table, the food was horrible and then the bill came. What a rip-off!!! Stay clear of this place!"
1,"Driver's are crooks! They write in their own tips! Managers aren't very helpful either! All crooks! order somewhere else, not here!"
1,"Some people may like Le Chariot. They might appreciate its charm and revel in rooting through all it has to offer to find great deals.\n \nI however, hate this place. It is effectivly a junk shop parading as a speciality items shop. A quick look on the window will have you spotting cool little things like military medals, collectables and other oddities, but once you get inside you will realsie this stuff is really just a load of old junk that nobody wants, yet the owner (a very grumpy old man, who frankly is rather scary) feels as though its worth a fortune, because that is what he charges for it.\n\nAfter spending some twenty minutes picking my way through a load of broken, damged and generally just crap stuff I spotted something I might have actually wanted - an old street sign that as far as I could tell had been stolen from a wall somewhere. I was told that it would cost me \u00a330, and when I refused the guy tutted and effectivly ignored me for the rest of my time in the shop. I later spotted it in the all intising window, along with the rest of the good stuff that the guy refuses to sell with a whopping \u00a345 price tag.\n\nAvoid this place, its all junk anyway."
1,"It has literally taking me almost 2  or 3 years to write this but I figure as I am preparing for my daughter's 8 year old birthday , it is time for me to express this.  I WILL NEVER recommend this place to a friend.  When I went to inquire about the options I had for her birthday, I was treated not well at all.  I felt that the woman behind the counter was bothered by my questions, I should have taken this a hint for my future results there but I did not.  The party came and I was so excited and it was the worst bidthday party even and yet the most expensive of all, horrible!!!! One of the hostess made one of the guests cried to the point that they ended up leaving earlier.   The moms that came not even water were offered, over all, I have zero memories of something good happening.  Any ways, as my party ended and everybody left.  I came to the counter, to ask for the owner's email address and the older lady behind the counter proceeded to skip my question and an email was given to me but at this point I did not trust that I was getting a good email, and yes, she still had the courage to ask me, how my party was??????  I was in tears, and a friend  of mine had to talk for me.  Sad experience :("
1,"*No one wears gloves here* I came here the evening of Friday Nov. 21, to get some pizza, fast. I asked the girl at the register How much a large cheese pizza is.  She said \""That'll be $12.92\"". I asked how much 2 medium cheese pizzas are,  she said \""$12.95\"". I ordered the two pizzas, paid, and said I'd be back. The girl at the register told me it would be 15-20 minutes.\n  I returned to a line of two people, less than 15 minutes later. I waited in the line for over 10 minutes, staring at my pizzas that were waiting on the shelf for me. As I was waiting, I watched an employee, a girl in a green apron, placing parchment in the box, where she was about to place the pizza, she pressed, with here bare hand, down on the middle of the paper, then placed a pizza someone was going to eat right on top. I looked at the other employees in the kitchen,  one was on the back of the oven, not gloved and another working in the kitchen, also not gloved. Of the four employees working there, zero wore gloves.\nWhen I got to the front of the line the girl asked what she could do for me. The restaurant wasn't that busy,  I feel like she should've remembered me. It was very irritating to wait in line for paid for pizzas.\nThe pizza was average. None of us have the stomach flu yet."
1,"Called my insurance company to have my dodge magnum rt towed to my mechanic shop for repairs. First the company said they'd be here at 10:30 showed up an hour later. I requested to have a flat bed tow my car , as I have front side impact damage. Tow truck driver shows up , in a normal tow truck. I call walker company speak to Tim who was extremely rude. He told me he would not provide me with a flatbed and told me to find another tow company. The tow truck driver was nice .. And said himself , if a customer wants a flatbed , then they should get a flatbed. Tim is extremely rude very unprofessional and probably shouldn't be in customer service."
1,"I came in here for the ten dollar smog check and the cheap oil change, but I was really upset when they called me with a lie- saying I needed a lower ball joint! My boyfriend works on cars and he is very familiar with this place. He warned me that they would create something wrong with my car and they did. Had I not known better I would have been out of almost $400.00! There was a guy in there who got ripped off from them twice and he was pissed!! He spent quite a bit- that the cashier claimed to have given him a 300.00 discount- how nice of them to discount work that he didn't need! They also tried to sell me some inflated tires at over 600.00! They have a lot of nerve!!!! Be warned!!!"
1,"The first thing that struck us is how cocky this young waiter was.He was probably thinking \""WE AT SWAGAT ARE THE BOMB!!\"". Son, I just moved here from the San Francisco bay area.I know and cook Indian food and trust me you are NOT the bomb.Far from it.\nFood was OK.Nothing exceptional and definitely not what the reviewers here are going ga ga about but that is personal choice.We tried the chicken tikka and the vindaloo which was flavorful but definitely not worth the price we were paying. Quantities were not adequate for the amount we were paying.Is Indian food really that expensive here in Madison? The prices here are ridiculously overpriced for Indian food and every single Indian restaurant has the same price range for all dishes which would make me believe that they have some sort of Indian restaurant owners union that decides on what the prices are going to be!!\nAnother thing that irks me is the inclusion of south Indian food along with your Rogan Josh menu which raised a big flag for us regarding the quality of the food. No serious Indian restaurant owner would EVER include a idli sambar dosa on a menu that has Rogan Josh or biryani on it.PERIOD!\nJust looking at the quantity of dishes on the menu and we knew this was going to be your below average Indian fare.Definitely not coming back here.Unless of course the prices go down..way down."
1,"Could not find out what was wrong with me. Bad bedside etiquette. Never found out what was wrong with me after 20 visits, always felt rushed and that he had better things to do."
1,"Worst service I have ever recieved. I go to this Starbucks a lot because it's on my way to work and everytime I regret it. The service is slow, even when I'm the only person in the drive thru. It take them forever to even greet me, and the coffee isn't that great either"
1,"I save one star reviews for exceptionally bad experiences and this was one of them. To make it short..it was over an hour before we had food on the table. I had to ask to get our order taken, then ask where our food was. It was EGGS people. It's breakfast. Not a sit down with a bottle of wine, have appetizers, chat... it was breakfast. For two people. My cousin and I walked in about 10am on a weekday. There were a ton of empty tables. We stood so long at the door with half a dozen staff people walking by us that I said \""this is a bad sign maybe we should go somewhere else.\"" And we really should have! When we finally got seated I had to ask for a waitress. After she appeared once she never came back. Until after I asked where our meal was. Usually in cases like this it's the processes that are bad not the people. But wow.. none the less... it was bad. Oh and the food.. was good. Not amazing. but good. But who cares by that time?"
1,"The only good thing about this place is that it's open Saturdays and a very nice dental assistant. Other than that I would not suggest this dental office. My husband and I went in for a dental exam/ cleaning/ X-rays - or so I thought, they just took exams and gave us a list of what was wrong with our teeth and the cost. The receptionist was not easy to talk to , and it was hard to understand her when I asked questions."
1,Overpriced... Overcooked... out of cole slaw... out of corn bread and oh yeah.. I had to take wings because they were out of chicken?  I got the 8 piece meal and it smelled rancid.  So bad my husband wouldn't let me eat it and threw it all out.. I ate one piece ( a thigh ) and the meat was dry and the skin was oozing grease. (Sure signs that the grease was not hot enough when the chicken was cooked.)  So sad.. I really looked forward to it. C'est la vie..
1,"No, no, no, no no!!!\n\nNo water except on jug on each nine. Saw cart girl once in four hours. Greens are terrible. Bumpy, no grass, poorly maintained. I'd never play this course again"
1,"Whoever orders from here is crazy. I ordered two \""famous\"" cheese steaks. Both weren't started until 15 minutes after I ordered. They cool each order 1 at a time. \n\nThe sandwich was bland, there was no salt, the mushrooms were clearly from frozen and not cooked long enough. The meat count was skimpy as well. \n\nThis place claims to have been on the Food Network, but less than 6 months ago it was a catfish restaurant. \n\nBasically Gino's in Philly has absolutely nothing to worry about."
1,"The staff of US Airways based in the McCarren Airport was very rude..I've enjoyed US Airways to/from other airports, but I will not fly with them through Las Vegas from now on."
1,"OK, so I went back in today to give another shot on having my horrible nails fixed. Epic fail. The lady who did my \""fix\"" was named Jennifer. She seemed very aggitated at me like it was my fault her employee screwed my nails up so bad. While filing my nails with the machine, I had to pull my nail back several times for how harsh she was being. I have never had a fill hurt so bad. To top it all off, she didnt ask me about shape and filed them the way she wanted, which is not the way I like! She went to paint the whole nail and never asked me. I only get tips done. She was throwing my hands and tapping them instead of actually talking to me like a human being. Then they sat me in a chair where I had to sit at a horrible angle to dry the gel topping. I didnt even get so  much as an apology for the bad craftsmanship, At one point she even began pointing at my nails and talking in a language I dont understand, undoubtedly talking bad about me. I get my nails done every 2 weeks and I will spend my money elsewhere. This place is horrible. Not to mention, the salon was very dusty and not maintained well with cleaning."
1,"If you are looking for a gym that is more concerned about their reputation then your kid - well sign up!   I had a boy and a girl on their team.  My daughter's confidence was destroyed and it took almost 6 months to rebuild her self-esteem (new coaches have worked hard to turn her around).  My son got burnt out with the intensity of the mens coach (he's 10).  Luckily, both kids are in good spots now.  Don't go here.  There are many other gyms in the valley and yes, the facilities are beautiful but not worth the toll on your kids' psyche."
1,"The previous comments are spot on. No parking, horrible management, drug dealers and nasty ppl having Alex in hot tubs. Management does not care - Hannah and other blonde manager are rude and act as if ur  an in convince. Why is it still fairways the gold course it looked over is dead and smells. Can't wait to get outta here...sleep with a gold club near ur bed"
1,"I will NEVER  go back!    The food is good, but over priced!\nThey charge you for drink refills, they charge you for togo containers.  The blinds are broken and nasty, the ceiling fans are nasty.  And then they have the nerve to post a sign no plate picking!  Give me a freaking break!  Make your place upscale , then maybe put a sign up like that!"
1,"We came here on a great vacation ruined by this Night Club of horror.  My gf got too drunk and while I was in the bathroom a predator working there, a large bald black man, took her by force and pulled her into an elevator.  He groped her and threatened to kick her out of the nightclub unless she committed explicit acts with him.  \n She obviously said no and was kicked out of the club.  Luckily she had a phone and got ahold of me but was terrified!  I took her home becauSe she was too drunk right away a and tried to call the club to complain.  Could not get ahold of any management.  Left a message and never a reply!!! Called the police made a report but my girl was too drunk to file a formal inquiry and was luckily unharmed.  \n\nBe very careful if you go here! Stay in groups and watch you friends or gf at all times!  I recommend not going here at all!  Very dangerous!  Who knows how many drunk women get taken advantage of here!  And not even a call back from management.  The guy probably still works there and preys on drunk women.  Dont get rapped, go party somewhere else."
1,"The cost of doing business\nThis location has a restroom policy in place in which between 2-4 pm they do not let high schoolers use their restrooms even if they are paying customers.\nTheir claim over vandalism, sex and drugs is absurd. The fact that they can't afford the costs is also absurd. If you own a Dairy Queen then this is the cost of doing business."
1,"WORST PLACE EVER! Customer service is pretty much non existent, they're rude and slow. Also their gel products are cheap. I came to get a gel fill in with a lady named \""Nina\"" and the nails are ok, but the polish job was terrible. It was all clumpy and wrinkly, I asked her about and she was like \""it's ok I fix for you\"" and she didn't of course. I got home that same night and all the gel started to peel off, I came back the next day and asked them to fix it. I chose a different color just in case it was that one batch. But no. Same thing happened again and they refused to give me my money back. From someone who's been to over 100 nail salons in the past 10 years I can honestly say that this was my worst experience ever! DON'T waist your time or money with these people."
1,The food was so so I would say...they do go heavy on the spices though...they took forever to being my food out...the taziki was really sour an the falafels were dry...only thing I really liked on the plate was the rice...the kids plate came with barely any fries an 2 pieces of chicken strips...not sure if this is a return place for me...
1,"Came here with my family once and both my mom and I got food poisoning from eating here.  Not only that but I got it after eating a lasagna at a supposedly \""nice\"" Italian restaurant in the hotel that we had to wait an hour to get into.  Thanks for the worse Vegas trip ever, at least the day I got sick and starting yacking everywhere was the day we left =/"
1,"New Carly's. No tuna. Menu change & Carly's removed the tuna. Sorry but as that was my fav sandwich, I won't be back. Bummer. Less options other than chicken & beef. New menu letdown. Boo. Dislike."
1,"Update: after I tried to serve Bill and found out that his address was a fake I realized just what a pro he was. So I called from a different phone and scheduled another repair. He again told me many lies and elaborate stories and told me how he could give me a discount if I had cash. He told me how \""the wife doesn't know about cash ya know\"" then he may have thought about how shady that sounded and changed it so he wasn't hiding money from his wife but how he paid cash for her birthday Yukon unlimited...wow that makes me feel better Bill...maybe the IRS should know this information! Anyway...I set up the fake appt so I could serve him for my day in court and it worked beautifully!! I think the others affected should come to the hearing and serve him as well and get him shut down!! Or set up your own fake appts."
1,Horrible service in every area today. We waited at the host stand for over 4mins as well as another party; they sat themselves but we waited. Finally sat we waited for drinks for several mins. We ordered the breakfast burrito and the spring rolls. Well the spring rolls were way over cooked and the breakfast burrito was made with sausage instead of bacon like it was ordered. The hash browns were burnt as well. After in forming the server she looked at us and just shrugged her shoulders like oh well! She did bring the food back to the kitchen and explained to the cook about the food and we heard the cook say it's not burnt they don't know what their talking about. The food came back cooked ok but not anything like we were used to before the remodel. We loved this place but now we won't be back!
1,"Went to El Zocalo tonight to enjoy some good food and also enjoy the ambiance with my wife. I have been to this establishment before and never remembered if the food was good or not. I ordered the Tierra y Mar plate which is steak and shrimp on the grill with a side of rice and beans. I asked for my steak to be done medium, when we received our orders seemed to be 35 minutes later my steak was well done and had not an ounce of flavor to it. The shrimp was so salty I could only eat but one. When the waiter finally came back to see how it was going I told him that I was not happy with the plate. He asked if I wanted something else and I refused. I had tried my wife's plate (chicken Enchiladas) and it was mediocre so I wasn't going to waste my time. At the end of the night the waiter apologized and said that the manager discounted my plate 50%. Why the manager didn't come out to see what I thought was wrong is beyond me. Honestly the only reason I will go back is for the music and the beer, my food experience was sub-par. For the price save yourself some money and go to Rosita's in Mesa or El Rico's in Gilbert. \nTerrible food experience."
1,"FANDANGO online ticket reservation services for this theater is not so practical. I ordered a ticket for the following day, thinking it was showtimes for today. Since it is listed, with showtimes. Then, only after purchasing, it states that there is a \""No-Refund\"" policy on ticket purchases. You cannot change your showtime, nothing. I contact costumer support and they advise me to buy another ticket for the right date. So I did, and that they'll submit to their refund department and I might get a refund in 3-5 business days. 3-5 days after the showing. Why would I take the risk? Why not just sell them to a coworker instead of taking a 50/50 shot at them saying, \""sorry, we we're not able to refund your money.\"" Wow. I've attached the chat with the representative for your review. I've never been to a theater who doesn't refund or allow you to change showtimes, EVER. It's really sad. This has really ruined my experience.\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4iaEyQxw8SAUjlYUUl6UEtVcEk/edit?usp=sharing"
1,"WORST EXPERIENCE EVER and that seems to be the trend from what I've seen about this place. Worst excuse for a doctor's office EVER! Sat and waited for 2 hours just to be told she wasn't able to see me because the appointment I had originally scheduled didn't have a co-pay needed and she wanted to change my appointment type to one that required a co-pay. When I refused to change my appointment she refused to see me. Clearly she doesn't care about an individual's health, just a paycheck. Terrible and pathetic way to treat your \""patients\"". Will never return and will be sure to tell everyone how awful the experience was."
1,"The exact same driver was at a strip mall near where we live today. He was using the handicapped space as a loading zone. We found a nearby police officer and the guy actually debated the cop. He moved but as we were leaving, he made rude gestures my way. This guy is a jerk who hates persons with disabilities and I've had it with him. \n\nWe filed a complaint and basically told UPS we never want this guy to come to our home again. We'll see how it goes."
1,"This place has went down hill since the last time I was here. Walking in they said a wait of 10 mins and I've been waiting over 25 mins to be seated, people who came in after our party got seated right away. The lady's at the front said it's because they only have 2 servers but they have 3 people at the front. I'm very disappointed in this place."
1,This was a huge let down!! It's in terrible need of a MAJOR cleaning which made me wonder how dirty the kitchen and prep areas were!! We will not be going here again
1,Food does not taste good.  The food is boring and bland.  I regretted eating there the moment I tasted the food.  I will stick with the other Mexican food place down the street which is cheaper and the food tastes better!
1,"This establishment will never see another penny from me. My wife and I along with a couple of other friends walked into Mamma Mia last night and were immediately told to get the \""bleep out.\"" The lights were on and the door was propped open so we assumed they were open for business. We tried to find out what the problem was and explain we are regular customers and shouldn't be treated like this. He then proceeded to tell us that he didn't need our \""bleepin business\"" and to get the bleep out. There are plenty of other good pizza places in this area, so the owner will get his wish, we will never be back and I encourage others to do the same. The owner has the right to close and not serve people, but if your lights are on and your door is propped open and someone walks in there is no excuse for this behavior."
1,"If you've ever eaten good Mexican food in your life you would know this place is NOT the spot. I have no idea how it's the highest rated option on yelp.\n\n1 burrito, 2 tacos, & a drink costs $19.73. That's already a no. Then you're like... okay it's Vegas, of course it'll cost a little more, whatever. 5 minutes later, you get your food and it tastes like nothing. Nothing.\n\nI'm from LA so I have decent expectations for Mexican food and this was almost disrespectful. No flavor and the meat was cold. The watermelon drink was good.\n\nBottom line: this place is one very small step above Taco Bell. If you're from LA or SD, any taco truck you might go to is better than this."
1,"My shopping experience was great minus the fact that they sold me a shoe with a hole in it. No returns, perfect but at least exchange the shoe with a hole. The manager was rude and made no effort to make me happy. She also accused me of wearing the shoe...yes I did in my house when I noticed the hole. I tried to exchange (not return)the shoe the following day. Not shopping here again. I'm all about customer service and yours was shitty."
1,"I have been waiting to try this place for a long time. The building from the outside give the appearance that it looks nice on the inside.  I know it is call the Blue Burger  Grille but from the minute I walked in the door my eyes started hurting me.  EVERYTHING IS BRIGHT BLUE: Bright Blue Walls, Blue Concrete Floors, Blue tables, even blue lightbulbs.  It immediately turned me off.  Atmosphere is part of the dining experience and this place was definately lacking on the atmosphere.  It cost us 72 dollars for 5 people to eat and we only ordered 1 soda. That would have been OK if the food was amazing, but everything came overcooked.  We ordered everything medium rare and it came medium well, I didnt even bother sending it back because we couldnt wait to out of there and get away from the obnoxiously overwhelming blue  interior decor"
1,Mellow mushroom is terrible.  I have never written a review before but this place is a grotesquely racist establishment and i never want to return to it ever again.  I would give it negative 100 stars if i could.
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible!!!!\n\nCustomer Service was AWEFUL, on a scale of 1-5 food was 1, drinks were ok, the only good thing was the atmosphere, which is NOT going to change my mind about going back there, I've had much much better fish tacos @ Rubio's & Baja Fresh for fraction of the price & didn't have to go to dinner somewhere else after leaving, which we had to do after leaving Tortilla Factory!\n\nThere are Plenty of Great places in Scottsdale with Great food, Great service, Great drinks & Great atmosphere.\n\nWe even tried talking to the manager but he got all Upset & tried to make us feel like we were lucky to be there & didn't know what we were talking about.\n\nSo if you want, BAD Service, Over Priced & Tasteless food & like to waste your money this is the place for you!"
1,"Worst experience with any company I have ever dealt with. Nothing was completed when promised. Final deadline was missed. No estimates provided for any work. You have no idea what your budget is and when you ask you are not given any helpful information other than to go to the store and pick out like for like items. If you don't remember or know brands you are not provided any guidance. Regardless of whether you follow insurance allowances you will always be told you are over budget and need to pay out of pocket. Don't feel pressured to use this company, take your time and figure out how to do it on your own."
1,"August 5th at 2:30 pm. Pulled an illegal U turn on 51st ave just before the bridge. She whipped across a double lined road, across 4 lanes of traffic! Two trucks on coming in my lane, and a 18 wheeler on the inside lane!!! She was almost a hood ornament on the 18 wheeler, we could stop buy he locked up all his wheels and barely got it stopped. I pulled up next to her and you guessed it, the bus had kids on it! And she was reading her phone!  The driver is a Hispanic woman a bit over weight with glasses. She's going to kill someone!  I posted the bus tag with a photo on this yelp. The school or the bus belongs to the Laveen school"
1,"Awful service! I used to come her back in 2010 when it was new, the food and staff were awsome! I recently came back and the staff is all new. One word... RUDE. Our waitress seemed pestered when id ask for a refill or when id place another order. Like, um, sorry to bother you at work lady? The food was good, but theres a ton of other sushi places in the east valley with the same grade of food and better service. Its a shame this place shot to shi*, could have been a real gem."
1,"Don't go to vegas on a whim with your kids if you are a frugal person. I've been to Las Vegas many times before but never with my kids and never stayed at circus circus. This was the only hotel that had rooms available on a saturday night that was on the strip that seemed \""family friendly\"" for under $250.00. I was told at the front desk that all the rooms were nice and I overheard someone else say that rooms had been remodeled. Must not have been mine. I stayed at the sky tower for about $130.00 and the room looked like it had been the same since late 80's early 90's. My sheets had holes in them, the decor was dreadful, and the whole way to the room looked dingy and old. Lesson learned, don't stay at this hotel, and don't bring the kids. They where underwhelmed by the adventure dome and wished I had just taken them to six flags or knotts."
1,"I should give 0 star to this location!!! Kidding me? Calling for half an hour while driving around, and then being told to park my car first, and walk in to rent the car?!  On the phone with a guy all the way looking for a tiny little cardboard written the name in the end.. What the hell!!! No sign outside, no instructions, WTF!!\n\nStay away from this, if you don't want to waste your time, and ruin your vacation!!"
1,"Listen. I am fine with a dress code at a respectable establishment. Especially when the majority of the people down stairs are in flip flops and tee shirts ... BUT They turned us away because one of us did not have a \""collar shirt\"". However he did. I tried to explain to the goon bouncer that it was a mandarin style collar which just happens to be different then the standard turn over collar but IS in fact a COLLAR. Dress code beware. They will judge your collar even if they don't know anything about it .  This was the second time  I brought out of town people across town to enjoy the bar on the top floor and they turn us away because one of my guests was not up to their standards.  I have been in Orange Sky a hand full of other times with no problem, but won't bother going back there because I don't  want to \""gamble,\"" on getting in."
1,"We planned my daughters 21 st birthday here.  We used a Vip service. There was 20 of us.  The doormen never let my daughter in and we were all upstairs waiting for her.  on Halloween they wouldn't let her in with her costume, a teddy bear..???...\nIf you want to get pick pocketed go to this club!  They took it from his front pocket ! There is a pro crew running with the management , they are letting these crooks in. As if it wasn't expensive enough !  $2000.00. For four bottles....  it gets WORSE...\nDon't take your wallet ! They charge for water too !  With table service ... Arghhhhh a horrible and very dangerous venue... You Cant get out, only down one stair case you have to get down three flights of stairs with 5,000 others.  They know about the pick pocketing and they are still letting them in. They said our wallet will show up in the morning when they clean up .... No.     I met another victim at the airport too, also identity theft. Credit card fraud. No ID either what a hassle at the airport.  \nTao RUINED  our trip..."
1,"A total waste of time , a very poor restaurant experience. We were not looking for some five star experience , just some decent tasty Chinese.\n\nWe had the Sarawak salad which included pieces of overfried duck  on top of some mixed leaves ,followed by the Ah Sin special fried rice and the Mongolian beef. \n\nThe special fried rice was not very special at all and very bland and under spiced. \n\nWhen I ordered the Mongolian beef the waiter told me it was going to be spicy , which  I have no problem with. However when we received the food it was not at all spicy and appeared to have been doused in some gloppy sauce and then sat on top of some packet noodles.\n\nMy overall impression of this place is that it is geared for the blandest palate  possible in order not to offend people who are not used to decent Szechuan or Cantonese food."
1,"We came here during lunch last weekend, which was our first and also the last one. First off, we asked the front-desk guy if they served beef ribs, to which he replied, \""yes.\""However, we found out later that there was no ribs. He said they do serve ribs for dinner, not lunch time. Ok... why would we want to know what's served during dinner when we came here for lunch? He obviously tricked us with his wording. But his sly business did not end there. When the bill came out, he charged $12.99 for each of us, when it said $11.99 right on the window of his restaurant. On top of that, he charged 15% automatic gratuity for a party of FIVE people ! Wow, this is the first time I've seen a restaurant adding tip to the bill without stating it as policy on the menu. \nTo sum it up, everything in this restaurant was a LIE. Period. \nThere's no respect for customers in this place. I would NOT RECOMMEND it to anyone."
1,"Non-existent customer service. Quite literally. I walk up to the desk, the guy working there ignores up - I'm standing at the counter inches from where he just finished ringing up a customer - when I get to the counter, he turns away from me and walks away. Walks. Away. From. A. Customer. Like I have cooties or  something. WTF? I'll go elsewhere for my haircut."
1,"Just missed them. They are closed   , I wanted to try the shakes I'll go elsewhere.\nI Stopped by a second time still was not that inpressed but that's just my taste buds maybe you may enjoy it."
1,Got take-out from here last night and it was HORRIBLE! Something must have happened because they only had 3 people working and were VERY disorganized. Should have checked the food before we left! Ordered fajitas and there was very little meat... it was beyond ridiculous. Hardly any peppers but a plethora of what looked like stewed tomatoes. Look... I'm a gringa and I know that don't look right and I could do a way better job. The rice was missing completely and there was only one giant pizza pie looking tortilla. We called and the person who answered could barely speak English (which is really not a big deal in my book) but there was no manager around to resolve the situation. We asked for an email so we could send a note about the experience but she was unhelpful. All she offered was for us to come back right then...which if you were as hungry as my fiance was not an option. He gets grumpy and I know better than mess with a grumpy-hungry-pants.
1,"Horrible customer service. I tried to place an order, giving them a chance after their last fuck up, but I find out they don't even deliver between 1400-1600. When I called to place an order the man on the phone was very rude and condescending while informing me of this, will never order from this place again! STAY AWAY!"
1,"In thirty years of taking shirts to the laundry I have NEVER been charged for the shits being extra large.  Just moved to the area and was the first time I tryed this cleaner, had a coupon stating $1.89 per shirt.  When I came to pick up the shirts (33) shirts I was charged NOT the coupon price of 1.89 but $2.30 a shirt when I asked about the price I was told that the extra charge was for extra large shirts.  When I said I have never been charge for the size of the shits, he was rude and very short with me.  After taking the shirts out to my car I came back in and asked for the name of the owner since I was going to file a complaint.  He said he was the owner and handed me his business card and walked away.  What a way to treat a new customer, very rude, very rude.  As others have said in the reviews for this cleaner, go somewhere else this is a very rude uncoporative and untruthful company that has no sign anywhere in the store that states additional cost for larger sizes.  Nor was I told the coupon price was not good on my shirts when I brought them in to be cleaned.  The attorney general should check into this business and their business practices."
1,"I have been contemplating my \""cheat meal\"" all week and wanted none other than Pink Box. Well I was extremely disappointed with not only their selection but their entire set up, decor, ambiance and service. I felt like I walked into a 10x10 closet with an awkwardly unhelpful employee. Besides the lack of aesthetics, there were hardly any specialty donuts! Their selection was dismal and disappointing. I was not going to pay for an over priced glazed donut that I could get anywhere else. I have tried the Fat Elvis donut before and it was amazing. However unavailable at this location along with any of the other specialty donuts I wanted to try. Needless to say I left empty handed. If you plan on being open for extended hours or 24/7 like the other locations than I suggest having something worth choosing from."
1,"This place is not clean.  Carpet stains,  smells like mildew,  lobby was disgusting.  Check out the cushions on the Ottoman in the lobby.. Stained like crazy! Alerted the manager, they seemed uninterested in my comments. So now I will tell everyone my comments. Furniture in room was old chipped and all the fabric on chairs had disgusting \""adult\"" stains.  Lots of dead bugs and insects near windows of room and lobby.  I have pics to prove it.  Do not stay here unless you are looking for a dirty bargain.  If there was a lesser rating than 1 star,  that's what I would rate this place.  Poor 1 star."
1,"This was not a great expedience. The happy hour specials are a little confusing be careful as there's not a lot of items on the happy hour list. I had the sliders and I was very disappointed it was all bread and little meat. It was also very plain with no flavor. Our service was terrible, our water was never filled the whole time we were there and it took forever to get our check. I will never spend another scent here as there are way to many choices at Tempe market Place."
1,"NEVER COMING BACK! !!! we only came for a oil change and they asked if we wanted a $70 wash/cleaning and we said no. we ended up getting a $30 oil change/wash package... they INSISTED that our car wouldn't start and needed a new battery and would be $120 to replace but we said \""no thanks just jump start it and we'll take our car somewhere else\"". they also said we need another air filter and clean the fuel system.  we said no to all. \n\nafter, we took our car to our family mechanic recharged the battery and our battery was fine! we drove towards scottsdale and noticed our car was high on temperature and popped our hood to find the radiator cap missing which was weird!!! we had to stop at auto zone to buy coolant and another cap. bottom line... our car never had these issues prior to coming to francis and by coincidence they ALL APPEARED during/after the visit! we called the manager and he said they didnt take the cap. \n\nin conclusion, we felt very weird abou the whole experience and that something was NOT RIGHT about how they handled everything! NOT COMING BACK!!!"
1,"Not much to say about this place, overprices and i could say one of the worst pho meals i have ever had."
1,"These guys are a joke. Was getting an oil change and a new rear tire on my bike. Shopped around on the phone with several valley HD dealerships. Drove three hours to get there since i don't have a HD dealership in my area. Once I got there they jacked the price up and wanted 50.00 more to install the tire and 50.00 more for the oil change. Overall, they were 150.00 more expensive the the Scottsdale dealership. Met with the service adviser who gave me the quote and the service manager. Both had a \"" tough shit\"" attitude. Weren't willing to match the price or negotiate at all. Business must be great at Chandler Harley Davidson with their don't give a shit arrogant attitude. Wonder if the owners know that this is the way their management treats customers? Would not recommend going there and I know I never will again.?totally disgusted."
1,They ran out of cheese! Gave me a 2 hour delivery window after already waiting 45 minutes for my pizza.  Then five day refund window for cancelling my online order. What a joke.\n\nTHEY RAN OUT OF CHEESE AT A PIZZA PLACE! Should say enough about how this place is run....\n\nUpdate... 2 weeks later no refund was processed. Called and was instructed by the staff to call my bank.  Charge back it is I suppose.
1,Pathetic business practice... I called to order pizzas for my business and I am located at the 51 and indian school... Since I am on the west side of the 51 she said nope we don't deliver lol really I am literally 50 feet from freeway on indian school but yet still a no.. to bad with the economy the way it is you think she would of said ya no prob and gained a new customer.. oh well there loss not mine..
1,"Stay away from this cleaning company.........After confirming appointment, they suddenly cancel your appointment a day before and never give you a other cleaning date for the next two months.I will never buy their coupon from groupon anymore."
1,Horrible crooks !!! These people are con artists and are now impersonating another moving company with good reviews to get clients ! Please file a complaint online with the attorney general if they have scammed you and damaged your items.
1,Horrible door men and promoters. Waited in line 20 mins after being comped. Got to the door and told couldn't get in without a ticket. Bullsh*t. Do not go here.
1,"Trash. The manager is spiteful and rude. Would rather see a table sit empty rather than seat it with a table of girls. Felt like we wouldn't be worthy of a table, even though I have money to spend here for a bachelorette extravaganza. Too bad. I'll never be back. Managment is horrible and would prefer to see an empty restaurant that a table of girls."
1,"Service was excellent by Jessica & Emily in the bar! Very disappointed that they don't offer anything for our Veteran's, being that it is Memorial Day weekend.. Take care of our Veteran's and I'll give  but only one star for now!!!"
1,"Came in just because I had a $5 coupon, the staff that greeted me was SO rude and you could tell they were just talking crap about me and my friends right in front of us. The place is very dirty and you could tell the mat outside of the mystic spray tanning booth had not been washed. Worst tanning experience I have ever had."
1,Wow. We were seated upstairs and then ended up leaving because I guess they forgot about us. Hard to believe as they weren't super busy. I have to say we were very disappointed as my wife was looking forward to trying the tartare. \nEven when we got up and left no one seem to notice. \n\nThe one star is not a reflection of the food but because I am forced to give a rating. \n\nDisappointed.
1,"Headed back to Phoenix and of course I get stuck with jerk Bernard again. Swerving all over he road, being rude to customers.  We stopped in Falstaff for what he's said was a 15 min break.....he left us on the bus for 43 mins without explanation.  Then when is asked him what t he problem was he said,nothing and was extremely rude"
1,Saw roaches on the floor. Waitresses were hella rude. Complained to the manager and she spit in our faces and cursed us out. The chef looks like a fat sweaty slob. Just a horrible experience. Customer service is foreign to them.
1,This place is going down the drain. Sad. Great food but service has went down the drain. Won't be back!!
1,"Which sewer are the using to farm raise the lobster they serve? If I could give zero stars I would. I was so excited to find out about a lobster roll place in Las Vegas. Spent $110 to try a few things with family. All the lobster was bland despite the butter and mayo. This is not Maine lobster. Tilapia would have been more flavorful. Order came out wrong and instead of making a fresh Connecticut roll they just poured butter on top of the Maine roll. Disgusting, expensive. I left there feeling nauseous."
1,First off we get there right at time it opens we were seated and got our drinks.  We ordered. And waited and waited.  Nothing. And waited.  Nothing.  Finally we flag our waiter down and he's like I'm so sorry ill go check.  As we look around everyone who came in after us already got their food. No worries they will get it.  So we finally get it. It was cold.  Like it was sitting out for over 40 min (our wait time after ordering).  So we tell the waiter he apologizes. They bring it back.   Still cold. We decide we can't eat this and we ask for the check.  The waiter asks us if we are doing good and Howe food was we tell him and he apologizes. The manager comes and apologizes and comps our meal \nIt looked good but too cold to eat. Maybe we give it another chance one day but not right now.
1,"Wish I could have wrote a better review about this place. The mechanic i spoke with Was a nice guy an i felt confident the work would be quick and easy. I had some repairs on my truck. I was expecting it to take a couple of days and was expecting to spend up to a grand. The work was done and the vehicle passed emissions. BUT, within a day of getting the vehicle back the check engine light came on and now my a/c does not work. I popped the hood to see about the battery (as it was suppose to be replaced, it was) and under the hood there were bolts sitting on the side by the battery. I have no idea if they belong to my vehicle. There was also a rag tucked on the other side of the hood. The plastic cover on my neg. battery cable was sitting by the valve cover instead of being put back on or discarded. And the wiring harness which was accessed during the repair was not rewrapped and the wire that was worked on was completely exposed. I wanted to take the truck back but I was pretty soured on the lack of care for the work that was done. I will keep looking for a mechanic that gives me more bang for my buck."
1,"this place is like a lost mazed, even the employees don't know where they put their stuff. Target is much better place to shop"
1,"I went here with the hopes that this was like another sandwich shop that my friend Omar more took me to, nooope! Matter fact he came by my house other day and asked me if I liked it. I said: Nooooo! This place has too much gristle on their steak, it's like chewing on the shoe!!\nJoe says everything is fresh, mm mm mm mm mmmm \nAlthough a lot of people complained about his attitude, I didn't have a problem with his attitude. \nI did like his fries.\nSomething funny: I said I wanted whiz on my sandwich. He gave me that funny look like, no you don't! and then said it's processed. You should get the provolone. Helloooo, that's processed too!\nListen if you want great cheesesteaks... you won't find it here!"
1,Groupon users beware! This salon figures you are one time customer. \nThe stylist they assigned to me washed my hair as if she was on a time limit.\nThe conditioner that was in included with the groupon was applied and not \nwashed out. And we all know what that means greasy looking hair!
1,"I was very disappointed with this attraction. The amount of people they sent through in groups was way more then they should have sent through. The actors were really not that scary. I paid $53 to be in and once in line it was lie we were all the same. I paid for VIP 2 but felt like general admission. I shouldn't have had to wait as I paid for instant access. I would not recommend this to anyone unless there was a decent Groupon for the tickets. Nice try Rob, maybe next year!!"
1,"Unfortunately this review will not help anyone in that if you want to take a bus, you practically HAVE to travel with greyhound. \n\nI wish I could say you get what you pay for, but in this case I feel I paid plenty. $140 dollars roundtrip for a trip from NYC to Montreal.\n\non my way back I arrived over 1 hour in advance for my trip at 5pm on an express to NYC. By 5pm they said the bus had been overbooked and a second bus would be needed that would depart at 6pm and would go local. Way to slump a great vacation. Not only did it NOT depart by 6 but it made all of the local stops only to not pick up any passengers. \n\nThis was an unfortunately trip from hell and I didn't make it back into NY until 2:30 am. Called customer service and they have no recollection of the overbooking.\n\nGreyhound gets a huge FAIL for ruining my travel experience. I'd expect this if i paid $40 dollars round trip Fung-Wah style but not from the big corporate monster. I hope some Greyhound executive reads this and refunds my trip. maybe I'll reconsider the rating.\n\nThis review is for Greyhound services and not the bus station. Bus station is perfectly located in Montreal, close to multiple hostels and B&B's on Sherbrooke.\n\n...damn it so frustrated!"
1,They need to lay off the ice. More than 3/4 of my drink was full to the top of ice. Two sips and you're done. Is it worth 7 bucks for a crappy meal? Nope!
1,"No, nope, uh uh, no way, please don't call this an Italian restaurant. Overcooked, mushy noodles, watery tomato gravy, and meatballs that are too garlicky and over spiced. Can't give this place anything lower than 1 star. Seriously, Olive Garden is a joke and I rate it higher than this place. \n\nAgain, my advice to any Italian food lover, find a good neighborhood, family owned restaurant and support a family and not a conglomerate."
1,"I tried going here earlier today with my mom and sister and it turns out that it's closed!  We read the notice posted at the window that said that it was \""temporarily closed for remodeling\"".  I sent a message to a moderator about the closure so hopefully it'll be updated soon."
1,"This place should be shut down, the staff is very irresponsible. If you, as the patient, don't call to get test results, they don't call you to tell you if everything is okay or not. They mess up test results, one staff member will tell you one thing and then another staff member will tell you another thing. This place makes me think that their staff is not properly educated for their jobs. Also, if you want the doctor to explain your test results, there is a fee just to speak with them. I'm done with this place, after messing up 3 test results. No stars for this place would be nice."
1,"Eww. I ordered a cheeseburger from this spot, & was so grossed out by what they served up. Not normal, even for the low standards Wendy's has conditioned us to accept. For $1 a cheeseburger you might as well go to Waffle House, always open with $1 cheeseburgers too. At some point, customers will need to wake up to the fact that they are not in the business of serving good quality food for reasonable prices, they just want to take the money, & will leave you with a bag of nasty crap the dog shouldn't eat if that's what they think it takes to get your $1."
1,"Wynn blew his budget on the hotel floor, which is amazing, but little was left over for their rooms. Their rooms are smallish, the furniture spare, and only 1 tv (lol this is Vegas). Colorful wall paint feigning opulence. Try the Venetian suites, way better mattress, lots of thick terry cloth towels, lots of marble stone, thicker carpet, 2 tvs (lol), split levels, a humongous L shaped couch to sleep more of your friends.\n\nBut the Numero Uno reason for the 1 star? We stayed on 25th floor, golf course side, and we could hear BASS booming from club XS, their open \""pool\"" club til 4:10AM. When I called their concierge, they said, yes it bothers some people. What the? So they know and they don't care cause they rather make money? Later Wynn."
1,"I recently gave this place 3 stars for good food, great service, but not so awesome prices.  Reasonable review right?  Apparently, wrong. \n\nWhat I am reviewing with ONE star is the message I received back from the owner.  Not only did she accuse me of being a certain customer who used happy hour, restaurant.com and a yelp check in, she acted as though I had given her restaurant a horribly undeserved 1 star review instead of a more than half 3 star.  \n\nAs it is, I am NOT that certain customer.  Not only am I not that person, I, as a customer, am extremely put off to learn that the management looks down upon those that use the very coupons they put out to draw people in.  \n\nI now realize why this place was completely dead the night we went in.  I do NOT appreciate being put down by ownership.  I thought my review was fair and honest.  Not only will I never be back, I will never recommend this place to anyone, ever.  Fresh food or not,  I don't like to be treated as such!"
1,"We rented a room in Vegas at Caesars Palace They gave us a room with a broken bed, the shower was putting more water at the bottom than at top.  The room had a window that was the whole wall, but they had a water tank as our view. the room was from the El Capone's era.  We had made the reservation about a month ahead.  We complained to Vegas.com and they said it was the hotels fault, we complained to Caesars an they said it was the people we had the reservation through, I talked to managers at Vegas.com and have not heard from them for about 2 weeks, if they are not responsible for a reservation from them, do not use them, it was a horrible experience."
1,Not even worth a review.. will not spend any energy on corporate scum that steals from the poor.. Spirit Airlines of the bus industry mixed with soul plane.  WASTE OF $39 BUCKS! If theres ever a class action lawsuit I'm in.
1,This place should be planted with orange trees. Very rough fairways and the owner doesn't know the first thing about customer service. Will not go back. The only saving grace is the hamburger and fries in the grill area. Would like to see them spend more money at great Eagle versus their other course Arizona Traditions.
1,"I was quoted a price for a new pair of glasses and lenses that were in the 50% area. Came back the next day excited to buy the glasses and was told the glasses were not on sale for 50% and that the quote someone gave me the day before was wrong. The new quote was DOUBLE what I was quoted the day before! Not only was I disappointed about the price, but the sale associate was rude and didn't care about what had happened. I will never shop at Lens Crafters ever again. What a horrible experience! I also came in many times before and the employees never helped me. They were just sitting down doing nothing. I honestly don't know how they are able to stay in business if they don't help customers or at least ask."
1,"Carpet has intense odor of beer/other things spilled on it.  If you like microwave frozen food, you'll love it here.  There's something \""going on\"" in this place, like if I found out that there was 400 pounds of marijuana in the basement, it wouldn't surprise me. I think this is a hang out for local residents that are not allowed in casinos."
1,"I just moved here from out-of-state. So far I've had pretty good experiences in the state of Nevada. But NV Energy was Definitely an exception to that. If I could give zero stars, I would! I feel like everybody else on this page has said it all, so I don't feel like I need to go into a lot more detail. I've never been more frustrated, treated more poorly, or felt more ignorant, after dealing with these people.  Their customer service is inexcusable. If there was another choice, I would definitely go with it. And the fact that there's only one location where you can set up service is ridiculous. Ok. It's sad. I'm done."
1,"Complete scam.  \n\nI was moving and called 3 times to have my service address changed--the person on the phone couldn't ever figure out how to schedule it, and no one ever called me back.  I had another company set up my service at the new house and called ADT to cancel.  She was very nasty and informed me that there would be a charge of $376 for canceling my contract early.  I told her the only reason I canceled is because they wouldn't return my calls to have the service moved.  \n\nI just realized that they have continued to charge my credit card for the past 3 months.  I called to cancel AGAIN, and the guy tells me it's going to be $376."
1,"Have given this place several tries, every single time we order we either get the wrong order or our pizza is completely burnt. Tried them again tonight, once again the pizza was burnt, the sandwich that we ordered was burnt, the sandwich was try overcooked Philly cheesesteak. Will never order from them again worst Domino's EVER!!!"
1,These mother fuckers hit an ran my car! Eye witness took down their cab number and license plate. Your busted!
1,"Is there a minus 5 star review because that's what I would give to them! DO NOT STAY AT RIO!!!!! I have been coming to Vegas for years & years & never in a million years I would encounter something like this!\nWe stayed at room 12004 & we  noticed the smell of odor coming from the hallway, our neighbors told us that they had been complaining but they did nothing.\nWe came back to the room around 2:30 am & got woken up by the itch sensation & that's when we saw some crawling bugs on the beds that we slept in. I freaked out crying because It was all over my body (my leg & arms). I called the front desk & they sent the security up to our room. He provided us with bio hazard bags to put our clothes in. We left all of our belongings & got out of there, only to wait for hours. The managers at the front desk didn't seem that surprised when we told her, offered another room but we didn't want to stay there....not EVER again. We lost everything we brought, only the clothes we wear...& bumps all over my body. They only offered $50 to get a couple clothes to wear in the gift shop where average clothes are around $40-$100!!!!!!!! Las Vegas for I have come here so many many times! It really bothers me that they think this is a normal thing & even mentioned \""Even WYNN Hotel has them!\"" WOW!!!!!"
1,"Never, ever, ever again. Ever. \n\nBecause even if I think your coffee blows, and even if I only gave you three stars (*gasp*), there's no excuse for talking shit about me -- loudly -- while I am forking over $10 for a sandwich. That's just a poor customer service decision, folks. As business owners, you should know that. \n\nAnd just for clarification, I never wrote that your coffee tastes like shit. But I will now: Your coffee tastes like shit. \n\nSo, no more $12 chef salads. No more $3 croissants. And definitely no more of your fake-nice bitchiness or dirty looks when I walk by in the morning with my Cartel coffee. I will save my money for an establishment that treats me like a person.\n\nPS -- look forward to a severe business decline as soon as the place across the way opens. I'll make sure to smile and wave as I walk by."
1,"Food was bad, service was non existent (we had to go find our server to ask for our check), restaurant was ambienceless. No wonder it was 90% empty when we walked in."
1,"My husband and I purchased tickets for our two day vegas trip via ticketmaster, full price at that. I would not sit through this show again for free. I think the five stars comes from the very select few that were chosen to participate in the show. So much time was wasted with the blue man troop carousing through the audience choosing people to be part of the skits. So boring. My husband and I powered through the show but kept humming and hawing and checking our watches. Skits were cheesy and long drawn out! For $75 a ticket I should have had my mind blown. Also it was overly obvious the musical drums were preprogrammed, not being played live. I thought that was the point. It was a big mish mash of pointless cheap laughs. Up the show or lower the price!!!"
1,"I came here with my family to have some classic BBQ.  I had purchased a Google Offer and wanted to experience and savor some true Southern cuisine.  Not a chance.  I placed the order for everybody and whipped out my phone.  The cashier refused to take my coupon.  He insisted that it be printed, not scanned from the phone.  I told him that the number on the phone will link me with the coupon and we can all be happy.  He called his manager and I got the same story.  Finally, the let me talk to the owner, he gave me the same story.\n\nMeanwhile, at noon on a Saturday the staffing consisted of one person taking drive in orders AND walk in orders.  I have absolutely no idea what the manager and owner do (except reject coupons from customers).  The line was through the door and people were leaving because of it.\n\nI did not try the food, but looking at the other ratings, may it was an omen that we ended up having a great meal across the street at Butterfield's.  \n\nHow this place survives???? I cannot answer that one.\n\nAvoid -"
1,"Your location is about 45-60 minutes away from or home.  When we arrived we were told that this super long  line would take about 1.5 hours.  We then proceeded to wait from 5:05 PM to 7:40 PM, over 2.5 hours.  As waited to be seated a 5 year old girl vomited on the carpet in front of the food in about 6 places and the staff reacted slowly to getting it up.  I am sure you can imagine how terrible it would be to wait that long on Father's Day and then be just 3 feet away from that.  Once we were seated it took 25 minutes to get a glass of water and the BBQ ribs we came to get were never available after 6 attempts to get them.   I told the manager and he brought a TOGO box with a few ribs as we left the location for us, but that was a waste as we were not headed home and the spoiled.   The location was super crowed and the plates, cups, forks and spoons came out wet and some of them still had food on them.  We had to wait in lines for 5-15 minutes to get any food items.  It was a terrible experience."
1,"If you Re there for beer, microbrews and such, this is the place for you.  However, if you are looking for a good chili dog, try someplace else.  While the hot dogs are of good quality, they honestly have the blandest, odd tasting chili I have ever had.  First off, I don't like beans in hot dog chili.  Second, it didn't really add any flavor.  It just gave it an odd texture.  They are also overpriced.  Their onion rings weren't all that good either.  Lots of microbrews makes one hope for beer battered onion rings.  Nope!  Just crappy almost store bought low quality breaded onion rings.  And change your fry oil once in a while!  So to sum up, beer: good.  Food: sucks."
1,I ordered the sizzling rice soup as a bowl and the server failed to tell us that if we got the combo meal it would come with soup. Then after we already ordered the soup I asked if we could cancel it and just get combos and the manager said no. Terrible customer service. I will never be back.
1,"I just called again to see what the new word is and I was told that their ordering system is broken and that I should keep calling in.  I was also told that he thinks the phone will ship around the 28th.  I ordered it on the 3rd, and was told it would be there on the 11th. I also responded to a Retention Manager that replied to my first post, but she did not return my call.  Go figure.  Go figure that this store only has 1 star ratings."
1,"Worst experience for a first timer, which just made me a last timer. I will never go back to this place. They couldn't get any of my orders right. I ordered 2 Salmon sandwiches, ended up with only one, but was charged for 2. Then I thought a coffee sounded good, they got one of them but forgot mine, so after I reminded them, they couldn't grasp what a blended decaf peppermint mocha was. Once I tasted it I sent it right back and asked for my $ back. I wouldn't recommend this place to ANYONE."
1,"I don't have a regular pedicure place, and decided to give this place a try while out running errands.  It was clean, the staff was friendly, though not chatty.  I got an express pedicure with callus removal add on.  I have a chemical burn on the top of my foot from the callus remover gel - she put it on with gloved hands then grabbed my foot, After she sanded my feet onto a piece of newspaper - she took it outside to the front and threw away the paper in the shopping center trash (?? weird!).    With the polish she complained several times about how small my baby toe nail was (yep, I know it's small, put a glob on and maybe something will stick!  don't whine about it!)  And post polish there was no just hang out and let yourself dry time - she put on my shoes, checked me out and shuffled me out the door.  By the time I got home both my big toes were messed up - I guess I should have just chilled in the car for a bit - and had my own dry time."
1,"NO.\n\nThat would be my answer if you asked me, \""Should I eat at Trader Vic's?\""\n\n1. Food is overpriced.\n2. Food is stupidly bad tasting.\n3. Wait staff is slug brained.\n4. Ambiance is lazy.\n5. Menu is pitiable.\n6. \""Fusion\"" is completely overrated.\n7. Drink menu is enticing and drinks are okay, but still.\n\nTHE FOOD SUCKS.\n\nWhat we ordered:\nPOPCORN SHRIMP (8.50) - extremely shrimpy taste, weak batter, even weaker dipping sauce.\nMANGO CHILI BEEF (25.95) - beef was cut into little kibble-sized pieces and wasn't tender - tough and tendony, sauce was okay, but overall, not a good eating experience because the rice was not cooked.\nPINK PEPPERCORN CRUSTED AHI (26.95) - ahi was alright, but the accompanying sauce and crispy rice roll (aka super nasty rice eggroll) were disappointing at best. The crispy rice roll made me want to throw things. How can you tell me that this is something that people WANT to eat?!\n\nThis place does not deserve even 1 star."
1,"Sent me home with a chicken meal instead of the vegetarian one I ordered and I didn't notice until I got home. Couldn't eat it and it was like 118 degrees outside so I decided to not go back. \n\nCalled and let them know about this and the girl I talked to apologized and expressed her sympathy for me and told me that a manager would call me back to take care of this...\n\nNever happened.  Seriously can't stand when people or businesses say they are going to do something but don't. The food is not awful, but this is a part of the \""Service Industry\"" not the we forgot about you after we effed up your order industry. \n\nwon't be back."
1,"The decor was nice, the service was ok.  the food was some of the worst mexican food i have ever had. i had the baja chicken burrito it was  bland and had no flavor. my mom had the enchilada combo and she said it was bland and had no taste also. i will not be back. and this horrible food was way overpriced"
1,"Used to be a lot of fun, but prices went up and service went down.\nFinding new place to hang out with friends!"
1,"Horrible, horrible place.  Wannabe Paris Hiltons abound as do the greasy Rico Suave guys with their striped, button down shirts (top buttons undone to expose their drain clogging chest mat.)  Semi-famous hockey players, people palming Benjamins, washed up celebrities (Britney for New Years?!  C'mON!) and the Pussycat Dolls get to cut in line.  Once you're in, you have no idea what all the fuss was about."
1,I have to admit I've never been inside of this club but I'm only speaking on the experience while waiting in line. If you are looking to be tricked into paying double for this club I recommend not to go. We waited in line for two hours and decided to leave. \n\nThe organizers of the club who ever they are just wants their commission and how do I know this? I personally asked. He told me they don't make money from inside of the club only the bar does so they have to get their commission somehow telling people to pay twice the amount to get in. I don't knock their game but I'm not the one that will be paying double for any club when they were closing in an hour. \n\nThe line for people who was paying regular price didn't move at all only the line for people who payed over 100 to get in!! Due to the bad experience that I had I will not plan to go back there and attempt to get in I will stick to my usual spots.
1,"One of the worst dining experiences! While out waiter was very friendly, the service he provided was less than stellar and his menu knowledge even less. We ordered a martini special that wasn't even actually a martini (served in a rocks glass with ice) which ended up NOT being on special when the bill came. A few of our entrees came out cold ( my risotto was warm but had the consistency of paste). To top it all of 2 of the people at our table were over charged on their bills from what the menu price was. AND even after all that, we never saw a manager, no apology....nothing! Never going back!"
1,"If you like mediocre food, slow service (like really, really slow), and indifferent food servers, then this is the place for you.  Oh, did I mention they are also way over-priced?"
1,"This review is for the hosting staff only...\n\nOk, so every time we come out to Vegas to visit my brother we eat here at least once. Usually we have a little wait to sit down-5-10 mins most. We are a party of seven. I've been sitting here now for 30 minutes waiting for a table while they seat a party of eight that is not even all here yet. \n\nThen they ask us if we can squeeze into a booth with a high chair on the end. A booth for four. And it is really not that busy in here.\n\nStill waiting...almost 40 mins.\n\nBe smart and don't hire stupid kids as hosts. And take off that stupid beanie. You're indoors for goodness sakes."
1,"This place is run by a bunch of incompetent meat-heads, from the manager all the way through the corporate tree.  They promised a charity event a free year membership to give away, never followed through on it.  Instead they tried to use the fundraiser to run their marketing campaign.  When brought to corporate attention, they just shoved it off, and could have cared less.  Talk about giving your corporation a horrible image.  Not only did it make LA fitness look stupid, but it made the charity, look bad, and lose the support of many contributing partners.  The estimated loss of charity donations from this is over $5k.  Good job LA fitness, keep up the selfish greedy business practices."
1,"Worse place ever! Old bad equipment, no one working and they sell rides by time and no one working to assist....huge waste of money and when we complained they could not even locate a manager! WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!!!!"
1,Booked a night at Planet Hollywood to watch Britney's Piece of me with my best friend.\n\nPaid $180 and change plus tax. And $20. Something for resort fee( which we did not use anything in the resort) \n\n$200+ for one night of stay only to find out they have put us into the corner of the corner of their hotel. The sidekick room of the suite!! And on top of that  the water pressure for the shower felt like I was showering in a 3rd world country... \n\nMy suggestion for everyone is this. If you don't have to stay here. Book else where. Totally not worth the $$$
1,Don't buy anything from Sabrina. She offered me a pre-made smoothies and she put it back to the fridge when I said No to her. Plus you expect unfriendly service. Attention to the Manager/Owner please check your camera. It happen around 9:45pm.
1,"No air conditioner! We all sweated as we ate, it's an oven in here!! Worst mc Donald and dinning experience of the summer. How can you have the dinning room open when you have no air and it's over 100 degrees"
1,"Apparently, my wife and I are invisible! We arrived at about 1:30 on a Thursday afternoon, pleased to see so many cars parked in the lot. The place is divided into separate rooms for dining and for a bar area. We went into the eating area and waited, and waited, but no one ever came. The one couple who were eating said to just take a table and the waitress would be in. After more waiting,a group of 5 entered the eating area. They were immediately seated, given menus, and had their drink orders taken. The waitress never acknowledged that we were present, carefully putting her back to us when she waited in the other people. \nThere are too many other great places in Vegas to tolerate this. We left and found one."
1,"In Oct. my son that is at  UNCC had a nail in his tire. The person at Tire Kingdom told him he needed 3 new tires., THe car is dented and has over 151,000 miles on it.We told him to match the tread. Instead of giving him options of prices they put on$ 184.00 tires EAC on the vehicle. I called very upset the next morning and the manger said he would not give me an exchange nor would he give me any money off. He offered a 4th tire with a $70.00 rebate and would discount an oil change! This is taking advantage of a young consumer and  in my opinion a terrible way of doing business. I would NEVER recommend this company."
1,"I dont know why we keep trying this place except the location is convenient.  The wait staff is always rude (we have been re-trying this place for 5 years now, and after this morning we won't be back) Food is ok, and prices are high for a Dennys and they nickel and dime for everything. We shared a couple better establishments with our fellow Tahiti Village owners within walking distance, with great service and food and prices!"
1,"After 10 PM they stop serving mashed potatoes. Service is usually slow. The cooks don't really know how to cook properly. Not impressed at all. If you want a sit down late night, go to Arizona Charlie's."
1,I can't stand this place.  I made 3 attempts to purchase (and to get educated) on a new mountain bike.  The sales staff were arrogant and completely useless.  I finally purchased a new bike from another store.  It's a shame as Landis is right by my house.  I will not even buy an inner tube from them.
1,"I LOVE pizza, and was looking forward to picking up a pie last night.  I'm sadly on a carb restricted diet, so I save up my calories for weekly treats like this, and this fell way short.  \n\nThe pizza was undercooked, the sauce was way to sweet, and the cheese only covered half the pizza.  I would say that Gus's Pizza in Tempe is comparable, or probably actually better, but Spinelli's prices were about twice as high. I don't mind paying for good pizza (Cibo, Joe's NY Pizza, Ciao Grazie, Il Bosco, etc.) but this pizza just made me sad and angry.\n\nTaking a look at the reviews it looks like an even mix between customers that shared my experience, and fake reviews from people that clearly must be friends of employees here."
1,"This hotel was the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. I wish I could give it 0 stars. The resort is actually an apartment complex. The room we were at was really dirty. The suite we had was also a joke, the refrigerator was so small that it couldn't hold a 12 pack of beer that we have brought. The sink was really small too. Everything in the room seemed dirty and stained. The worst part came when I was actually going to sleep. As i pull back the covers, I saw about  3 different kind of bugs scatter among the sheets. I complained, and got transferred into another room, which also had the same bug problem. At this point I went to the front desk and demanded a refund, but they told me that I had to contact Groupon for the refund. I didnt sleep at all that night, as I spent the night in the car with temperatures of 95 degrees. I'have never had such a bad experience, their customer service was so horrible. As I explained to the manager about the bug problem he never once apologized, he smiled and nodded as if he knew already. It was just disgusting and horrible. NEVER AGAIN!!"
1,"I have been in a few times, every time I wait forever for my food, and if I dare to order a coffee I am guaranteed a long wait and a luke warm drink, one time they actually forgot to put the coffee in my latte!!! My food order has been wrong more times then is acceptable, the service it SLOW and the staff seems not to care about their customers, terrible business!!! The only plus is they have good beer on tap and my husband likes that, but we will not be going back until the change so things."
1,"Normally an incredible place to eat, however I have seen a decline in the past few months. Today was the second time in 2 weeks I tried to order an item on the menu that was not available, but then my order was incorrect when it arrived. Very disappointed, will not order again, I'd rather drive further and my order be correct. Lastly called the restaurant and the owner answered the phone and told me I was wrong As he was reading the ticket. I am disappointed that my first review is a negative one."
1,"Caution!!  Caution!!  Caution!! Bait and switch.  I bought a $129 car detail for $99 on Yelp.  When I called to make an appointment they wanted me to pay $250 for the \""Arizona Detail\"".  That's roughly $150 over and above the $99 I already paid!!  It's the old bait and switch.  If you want the $99 deal you basically get nothing done to your car.  Stay away!!  YOU'VE BEEN WARNED."
1,"If you are searching for \""Southern\"" style food this is not the place for you.  The grits are awful. The grits are a HEAVY creamy-cheesy-dairy pudding concoction that lacks texture, almost a purred baby food consistency. My biscuit was incredibly dry, bland, and hard.  Every time I took a bite, it just crumbled in my plate.  I also tried the \""Fried Green Tomatoes\"" and was very disappointed. Completely lack luster, oily and undercooked.    \n\nThe only bright spot about this place is the staff."
1,"I met with Lexy to go over my save the dates- said she would be in contact with me in a week. I finally had to text her after 2wks as I still didn't receive the rough draft of my save the dates. After I sent her a text she quickly emailed me with what looks like a quickly thrown together save the date. I emailed her back about my changes to the draft- WEEKS went by and she never responded to my emails and text messages about changes to the invites. I understand people get busy but LACK of communication or really NO communication is just unprofessional-especially when you run a business. I finally texted her to cancel my order and you would think she would be professional enough to respond, apologize, etc but nope. Still, no communication. Luckily I found someone else to do my save the dates and they came out beautiful. Definitely would not recommend this person and her business to anyone."
1,"Got the all you can eat,  and they over rice everything.  Rice,  rice,  and more rice.  Ordered the super white tuna (ono),  seared salmon, octopus,  garlic tuna and yellow tail nigiri sushi,   they all came out warm with a thick ball of rice each and incredibly unseasoned,  no flavor what so ever. The ocean roll,  sunset roll,  and the yellowtail mambo all are exactly the same,  yet the descriptions are all different.  The garlic ponzu tastes like soy sauce.  The deep fried Shrimp heads tasted of old frying oil. \n\nThis place is crowded, we waited for a spot at the bar.  I thought crowded restaurant meant that people really like it.  Maybe they like the all you can drink Bud Light.  I looked around the restaurant, and  everyone was Caucasian.  \n\nAnyway I noticed that all the rolls coming out looked exactly the same. \n\nWhy would anyone give this place anything higher than  2 stars?  Have they not had proper sushi before?  Does this place not know what sashimi is?  Has the world gone mad?"
1,Ran into this place after no. 1 Boba was closed just to get some milk tea boba. Let's just say I will never go back to this place. The service was terrible the guy at the register was not very friendly and was rude to me. It's a shame because the boba was good and at a decent price but because of the way I was treated I will never come back here.
1,I completely agree with Ryan M. He could not have said it better. I had lived at this property since 2005 and left after it turned into a police state. Once you get on their shitlist they do not let up. I received a notice for hazardous driving in the parking lot when I was out of the country for that month! When I went to them to report this error I was told that when I am away I am responsible for anyone driving my vehicle. The vehicle sat in my garage the entire time I was gone. No one else has keys.\n\n It's BS like that that really stresses you out and makes day to day living really suck. I dont get how these people live with themselves policing other people like this. And the guy who reviewed the security company - yeah they were pretty cool at times - but that has nothing to do with the HOA. A separate review should be written for that company.
1,"Took a few different dogs here while we were fostering and the first time they did great. We took our dog back to get another haircut and they didn't do it anything like the first. We took him back a 3rd time and told them about the great job they did on the first go-around and asked them to replicate it. They didn't. They made a lot of notes on our card and when we brought him back a 4th time, they flat out told us to leave and said \""we weren't a good fit\"". The owner was practically hysterical, while we calmly told him that we weren't complaining, but just asking for them to recreate their first haircut. He told us that we were complaining. Apparently he knows more than we do, what we were trying to convey. We won't be back. We won't take any other foster dogs here. We won't recommend our foster friends return here either. What a huge mistake."
1,I have going there for couple years and there is always new people and they are just slow. I don't have time to be sitting here for hours just for a pedicure. Plus I hate that they are close on Mondays and don't open until 10. This is a 24 hour town. Open at least at 9 am. Time to get to a new place
1,"Caution consumers! Specifically this poor review belongs to the Mirror Maze part of Butterfly Wonderland. As annual members of Butterfly Wonderland they sent both me and my girlfriend an email that says this...\n\""As a member of Butterfly Wonderland we are extending a sneak peak at the newest must see in Scottsdale. Just print out this email and you will RECEIVE ONE COMPLIMENTARY WALK-THROUGH PASS.\""  Seems simple enough but it was at best a bait and switch and more accurately an outright lie.  Adding to the nastiness was a  discourteous staff that found pleasure in being very abrupt about telling us the offer was a mistake which they had no intention of honoring and was good only for a quick single walk through of only their laser area of the venue.  We had two choices.  Pay $9.95 plus tax  per person for each of us and our two children (6 and 4 years old) or we were free to leave. I paid the $43 bucks and we walked through the mirror maze. This Mirror Maze part is not worth the extra fee! My advice is to wait for the carnival to come to town.  The Mirror Maze you'll find in a carnival funhouse will be more entertaining and the carnie staff likely more courteous."
1,Had issues over parking. I went in to discuss them with the owner and found him to be most unfriendly. I will won't be eating here and would encourage others to stay away also.
1,Really high priced burgers for low end burgers and you have to pay 5 more for a combo it's not the cheapest eat in Vegas just the cheapest eat in planet Hollywood mall with horrible staff and serve yourself to tip them for nothing at the counter. Staff is not even happy at work and terribly rude when she was the one who messed up the order. Please just eat at chipotle when it opens at least you're guaranteed a certain quality of food. Worst 15 burger combo I spent.
1,"This was our second experience with the ER, and it was even WORSE than before!\nOur three year old daughter was brought by ambulance to this ER, and the staff had NO idea how to care for a child.  She was not in shock and not crying or fighting, but they were not able to get a proper temp or urine sample,  without MY help and suggestions. They took her blood pressure with a large adult sized cuff, and no one even checked her ears to realize she had a terrible infection. Worse, the \""STAT/emergency\"" blood and urine tests were sent out of the facility to take TWO days to return.  On top of this, the doctor was RUDE and seemed clueless as what to do. (Her name was Dr. Kent) Completely unacceptable.  We immediately drove our daughter to a different facility as soon as she was able to leave, and then she was FINALLY cared for after hours of waiting and not getting proper care.  What a JOKE. \nA year ago a family member was sent here after an accident and the ER was even worse.  And, my mother needed surgery and her doctor told her there was no way he would perform it at Mercy Gilbert, even though he has privileges there because the staff is that bad. This hospital is less than a block from our home, but I will NEVER, NEVER return.  This hospital looks beautiful and new, but the staff and system in place is broken! BEWARE."
1,"While the Wynn provides a rich atmosphere this cafe comes up lacking. I was wisked in wiith the idea of a Wynn's Special Hot Chocolate - FAIL. The drink was $7 and deplorable. I had to return it and get a tea just to wash the taste out of my mouth. For a hotel who prides themselves on luxury and elegants - hersheys powdered hot chocolate mix was insulting. Mr. Wynn considering Las Vegas is home to world famous chocolatiers, Ethel M etc., why would you bother to serve world war 2 chocolate rations?"
1,"I probably would have given moonstruck threeish stars when it was open, but I can't give it any stars any more because it's closed!  That seemed kind of sudden!  I wonder what happened / what is going to go in there instead.  Panera pleeeaaasssseeeee."
1,"my father and I went there for breakfast.  The place was empty except for two tables.  My dad ordered his regular oatmeal with two corn muffins.  how can you go wrong with oatmeal, well instead of serving milk with the oatmeal they served those little tiny containers of half and half the ones which go with the coffee.  I ordered the multi-grain pancakes which came out under cooked and pasty, sent them back.  The next order or multi-grain pancakes came out way over cooked and dry like card board, sent them back. Then the manager came out and said all the multi-grain and wheat pancakes are always dry, I said they should put that on the menu - multi-grain pancakes always dry.  Then I tried the blueberry pancakes, well it must not have been a pancake day as the blueberry pancakes tasted funny, all the blueberries were right in the middle of the pancakes and they too were dry and pasty.  The server was not much help saying things which contradicted the manager.  Can't anyone get an honest answer when they ask questions about the food."
1,This is the worst managed store in las vegas! absolute horrible people run and own this store!! dont support them!!!! \n\nI was almost attacked by a guy in the parking lot that parked right on top of my ada handicap spot and then proceeded to cuss me out when I get out of my car. I confronted him on what his problem was and he quickIy ran in the store when he realized I am not someone he can bully. The management then came to the door and would not let me enter and kicked me off the premises as if I was wrong and not attacked by some strange man that parked so close to the line I could even get out. I am a regular at this store and probably one of the biggest customers too. Now that I know how the managers are and that they support bullying in there parking lot I will never return. Be careful if you go and pack a gun or a knife as the parking lot is not safe. Also you may not be able to get the food you need to feed your family if attacked as management supports bullying and harassment of their customers. I will find a store that I can shop at safely and where the management cares about my experience rather than be cussed out and the bully being able to shop. Sad sad experience!!! Wont be shopping here again!!!
1,This is a large group review. We celebrated a friends bridal shower here. We went early around 11 or 11:30 hoping to beat the weekend lunch craziness. Sevice was incredibly slow and it about 2 hours to get our food. Our waitress was very inattentive and I kept on having to get up to go find someone to help us with drinks. We have been here before with smaller groups and have had a great experience so I was disappointed with our larger group. 1 server for 15 people was just not sufficient.
1,I really wanted to like this place but the portion sizes was tiny. I had there bento box with Chicken Teriyaki but there was more vegetables then chicken. It should have been called  Vegetables Teriyaki. Too much money for too little food. After dinner I went out to get another meal to satisfy my less than full stomach!
1,"Sons of fucking bitches. \n\nThree orders of food and when we pulled up to the drive-thru window and asked to add a taco to the order, we were told by the young man working the drive-thru window that NO, there are no \""extra\"" tacos, they are made to order. \""Yeah, we want to order one.\"" He then responded by saying we cannot add any food to our already existing order, and that if we wanted to add any food to the order that we would have to exit the drive-thru and drive back around and get back in line again. No joke, he said \""no seriously, you can't order a taco. It's business, you understand.\"" No, I don't understand. Your business is to sell me artery-clogging food, and you are refusing to do so? To top it off, when I called later to talk to the manager, a co-worker answered the phone giggling and then finally said \""uhhh. EHH ... HELLO?\"" \n\""Hi. Is this Jack in the Box?\""\n\""Uhhh. YEAH.\"" \nLooks like JITB needs to step it up on the employee training manual."
1,"My family has shopped at Apache Junction  Fry's location for 10 plus years and have been very pleased till now. This last week I was looking to buy bacon and a few other items. I noticed that the items near and including the bacon had sell by dates almost two months ago. One had may 4th 2014. I found five different items and total more than 20, yes 20+ i made a huge pile. It appeared that the stockers had not checked any dates for at least two month's.  When I talked to store manager he stated he would talk to that department. Didn't seem to be that important to him because he continued doing a walk thru with a  produce employee.  Nasty, now im wondering if the lunch meat is what got my son and I sick last week. CHECK DATES"
1,"I have on three occasions purchased a half-gallon of The Sassy Cow Organic 2% milk at a local retail market here in Chicago. On each occasion, regardless of the expiration date being well in the future, and in this case August 13, the milk is sour by the time I get 1/3 way through it. I have purchase many other brands of milk both organic and non, at this market and at others. I have never had this problem. I don't intend to waste more money on this product. It is clearly not properly produced or stored. Again, never happened with other dairy's products at this store, only with Sassy Cow. And 100% of the time, I had to throw out most of it within a few days."
1,"I  recently had my fist time (very possibly the last ) with this location and I wanted to express how horrible my order was in hopes that this will contribute to helping this location be better. I ordered online and I was able to write how I wanted my sandwich which wasn't a super difficult way and when I received it I couldn't believe how bland it was and disappointing.  The delivery service was fast and convenient which I appreciated but it was my meal that was not as great. My sandwich was mostly lettuce which overpowered everything else in it, I had 1 little skinny piece of bacon, my meat was 2 very thin slices of each kind I ordered to where  I couldn't even taste it, and I had one little glop of avocado on the bottom portion of the sandwich. Moving on to the soup which was mostly cheese sauce because there was maybe 5 little itty bitty pieces of broccoli in there. I had to make more broccoli (fresh from my house) to add in there which made it amazing after the fact. We ordered around 8:15pm so we received our order right before 9pm so I am not sure if it was the night crew not wanting to make things satisfactory but at this point I would NOT recommend this to a friend to try and I myself would not want to return to eat there again."
1,"This place wasn't for me. Had the mexiwrap, zucchini pasta and Acai bowl. The Mexican wrap was my favorite amongst the other dishes, however when I got home I started feeling sick and ended up throwing up. Not coming back."
1,"Coconut mango chicken was a disaster and the ship cocktail did not taste fresh and the grand melon mojito tasted like a jelly rancher in a bad way,  I should have gone with the Cuban sandwich it looked better not that the menu had any pictures of the shitty food . .  . Skip this place"
1,"We came here for my birthday - a friend planned it all out.  I was extremely disappointed.  We never tried any food, but the service - well, that's what I guess I have to call it was non-existent.  The drink prices were high for the quality and the size.  The staff was unfriendly to downright rude.  Granted, about 20 or so people came out for my birthday, but it was a calm group, and the staff should have been easily able to cover us.  People in my group were even clearly overcharged, and staff was not accommodating or gracious, even when they admitted it was their mistake. \n\nThe inside was seedy, but not in a fun, dive bar way.  The layout was awkward, and their excuse for a patio WAY too small for the size of the bar.  Their name is accurate, the Dirty Drummer was just that - dirty - and I won't be back."
1,"On Easter weekend, we called Animal Inn regarding their rates.  They informed about their price but failed to tell us about an additional rate being that it's Easter.  They did however, remember to tell us that they close early on Easter Day.\n\nWe brought our Tibetan Spaniel there and she absolutely did not want to go in.  The workers are not friendly and/or accomodating at all.  Terrible service all the way around.  We asked them why they couldn't tell us that there were extra fees over the phone when we called and they just said \""well that's how it is\"".   We would be happy to pay the extra money, but not when they intentionally fail to tell us to accomodate their business.  \n\nUpon picking our dog up, no one greeted me as I entered the door, so I stood there waiting as they were all staring at me, until someone had the descency to acknowledge a customer.  They were rude, very unfriendly, and did not seem to care about the animals.  \n\nOur dog seemed a little traumatized after we brought her home to bathe and feed her.  \n\nI DO NOT recommend this place to anyone!"
1,Yuck! The teriyaki chicken did not look or taste like chicken. The price for the portion size was too damn high.
1,"from the moment we arrived to the time we left completely poor customer service. our reserved room wasn't, the rooms are not well appointed (eg. no conditioner, no refrigerator, poorly cooled, all the businesses we delt with there were either slow service or just didn't care. we also tried to contact the manager and left a message with the assistant and we never heard back, clearly they don't care.\n\nwe go to Vegas for the whole experience not just to gamble and party. this place is not one we will return to...ever"
1,"The store was really good but the restaurant was terrible, the food and the service were awful. I found a hair in my coffee and on my breakfast plate."
1,It's 106 degrees outside and 90 plus inside the restaurant !!! Asked if the AC was on. Oh yes she would check??  It's 90 plus. AC is not working!!! Daaahh
1,"Horrible service! I ordered $145 worth of pastries and they overcharged me with sansrival that I never ordered. I called them to have them remove the charge, and the supervisor said, they can't refund the charge! Worst guest service ever!"
1,"Just to clarify something for our American guests who come to visit. As another review states that this restaurant is a better version of the cheesecake factory clearly has zero knowledge about food whatsoever. I drive 4 hours to get to the closest cheesecake factory form Montreal but you couldn't pay me to eat at l'academie. I have been cooking for 10 years and work with my brother who is an executive chef with over 25 years experience and this place should be illegal for how bad everything was. Most other reviews speak for themselves. If I can give negative stars I would. Big rip off \n\nJust left this resto and will never go back. The decor is nice but the food is terrible. Everything is pre made and nothing is done on the spot. The service was ok but I couldn't blame the waiter as he had a big section all to himself. I work in the kitchen and on the floor so take my word for it, if your looking for good Italian food and a Byob check out La Strada in Lachine where I work and is owned by my family or Vivaldi in the west island. Don't waste time at this place. I do not recommend it."
1,"I called this morning because my USB hard drive is not being recognize by my computer. I asked what it would cost to repair it. I was told to come down and they'd take a look at it. I took the morning off of work and drove 45 mins to their shop on Camelback Rd. I showed up and they didn't even look at it. They said it would cost $200 for the inspection and up to $999 to repair it and they would have to send it to another place that has skilled people and the tools to repair something . \n\nThey could have told me that over the phone and I would have not taken the morning off and drove all the way out there. I was definitely misled today and it cost me time and money. Their name is deceptive also because they cannot repair or recover data. They send it to someone who can. They should be called Data Mailers, or Data Parcel Services. A**holes\n\nI found this program called Get Data Back, it costs $80, but I was able to recover all of the files I wanted from the USB drive. That sure beats $1199 these scoundrels wanted to charge me."
1,"I hate this airport, friendliest my ASS! From security to gate agents to bus drivers to parking cashiers, this is one of the LEAST friendly airports I have ever subjected myself to. I've lived in many cities and currently have to endure the complete crap this airport is in every imaginable way. I'm so frustrated with it I will consider driving to LAX just to avoid using this shit hole. Yup, sitting here now after getting effed by United on a code share with Lufthansa. Umm, Lufthansa... why do you code share with this abomination of an airline? Maybe driving to Tucson is an option because I am not coming back to this place. PHX? BOO!"
1,"Ordered a grilled steak burrito for delivery and when I got it there was no steak.  The delivery service (Eats24) contacted the restaurant and said for sure there was steak in the burrito... so I guess the customer who's eating it is wrong!  What a joke, food was at best average otherwise.  Won't recommend this place to anyone."
1,"First off, I've cancelled my reservation with them out of frustration from their lies. I booked a room through their website because of their \""Best Rate Guarantee\"" promise. Having gone through all the hoops they make you jump through to beat the competitor pricing by 20%, I've found that their promise is a load of crap. Despite me sending the requested evidence, apparently the time stamp on the bottom of the page when you print from a website is not a legitimate time stamp because \""it shows when you printed it, not when the deal was active\"" on the competitor site. This is so BS!!! How else am I supposed to show a time stamp??!!!! How else can I print out a deal from a website unless that deal was currently active!???\n\nWorst customer experience ever!!"
1,This place is downright awful.  The only reason I'm giving it one star is due to location to Old Town and the staff were nice.  Otherwise it would get a negative score.  Pony up the extra dough and stay at the Marriott or Hilton... you'll thank me.
1,"I was harassed, belittled, embarrassed and even physically manhandled by Jay, one of the managers. When I asked to speak to his boss because I was so insulted by how he was treating a woman he physically laid his hands on me, rubbing my back all while telling me that he was so high up in management that he could do whatever he wanted. I have never been treated so poorly, will NEVER return or recommend this place. Jay needs to be fired... or arrested!"
1,"We were guests there once in about 2003 for one of the morning services.  We are used to megachurches with lots of praise and worship and messages where many Bible passages are referred to and explained with practical, applicable and content-rich teaching and even some humor.  We are used to churches that are ALIVE.  I felt like I was at someone's funeral.  I didn't feel the Holy Spirit there at all.  In fact, I felt really strange like I couldn't wait to leave not only the church but the grounds.  The greeters smiled a lot; I'm sure some of them weren't fake."
1,"I went on priceline and got a room for dirty cheap.  I was excited because of the right price.  However, let me share with everyone that you get what you pay for.  The room was a standard room...nothing out of the ordinary.  I did notice that the ironing board had no cover and it was just a ironing board with a flimsy pad on top.  Ghetto!  \n\nI also woke up the next morning and I saw dried blood on the sheet.  I thought I might have had a cut on my leg but I didn't.  That blood was not mine!  I hope those were clean sheets but still, if there was blood on the sheets, the cleaning crew should have thrown out the sheets out.  \n\nThe buffet was really disappointing with less than stellar food.  The quality of food there was low.  \n\nSo overall, I would never recommend the Luxor to anyone.  I will never stay here again."
1,"While they were accommodating to me walking in, i hated that they did not let you pick and choose the dresses you want to try on.  While other boutiques have sales associates that are more skilled at picking out dresses that might fit your personality, these associates had no clue and would not listen to what I liked and didn't like.  \nI had a very nice red head girl as my sales associate.  She tried really hard to help me and find a dress I would like.  But there was another associate with brown hair, who seemed to be a manager of some sort, who kept interrupting our session.  She was super frazzled and had a very fake, high pressure sales personality. I told them I did not like I did not like beading and every dress she picked with beading.  The same goes with satin.  She kept grabbing dresses out of the window or from some sale rack and trying to sell me discontinued gowns with beading all over them.  It drove me crazy!  I had to pretend I liked the gowns because I felt I would get an attitude from her if I said I didn't like them."
1,"- Very inconvenient location, its like in a basement area, really is a shitty location\n\n-In order to sit down and watch sports you need minimum $50 order PER PERSON,  EVERYDAY ALL DAY\n\n-Cashiers were assholes to me\n\n-Worst Sportsbook I've been to in Vegas."
1,"First off - great job by the technician that came out to clean the windows.\nIssue is that the price that he then wanted to charge us was TWICE what was quoted over the phone (Bait and Switch??).  It appears that the person who gave the quote over the phone did not explain how they count windows, did not communicate to the tech what the quote was - or if he did, the tech did not clarify the difference in pricing until after he finished the work.\nBecause of the amount they wanted to charge, and we finally paid, was significantly different than was quoted or clarified before work was completed - I would not recommend them unless they clean up their pricing practices."
1,"Do not go with young kids!  Expensive, bad food, small rooms, poor customer service and not stroller friendly.  They make you sit thru a 15 minute movie which was miserable with my little ones.  The food was terrible and overpriced.  People were literally returning rotten fruit in front of me and the cashier would l t take anything off the shelves.  The staff were rude - we got yelled at in the atrium because my toddler had a butterfly land on her and she went nuts I'm talking screaming ballistic.  We could t find a staff to help us so we took the butterfly off of her to get her to stop yelling and immediately a staff appears out of nowhere and is yelling at us for touching it.  I was not impressed with the customer service and was told we couldn't skip the movie even with 3 toddlers who just would not sit still and bothered the people around us."
1,Arguing with a fool only proves there are two!!!... a crazy lady will self destruct...trying to control everyone. And everything however just another duck....
1,"I'm only here...still waiting for a table because I have to use a gift card I received. I've watched 6 tables stay empty for 25 minutes. I understand they take reservations,  but their operations flow is slow and the front of the house staff doesn't seem terribly concerned with the starving patrons that have congregated outside.  This review probably won't matter because people love Pf changs no matter what.  I won't return though."
1,"In my 20 years of bar going, I have NEVER been  gouged before...... before tonight.  I'm not going to drone on and on.  Plain and simple. I had 4 beers and was charged for 6.  When it was brought up, they very gladly removed 2...  but, this was also on Monday (supposedly $5 Smirnoff martini night).   I ordered 2 Lemon Drop martinis at different times, and was charged $12 for Ketel 1 Martinis??  Ummm, either A) tell me you're going to pour Ketel, or honor your Monday night special.  Very disappointed.  I  guess be specific or get taken advantage of... shame on me for trusting.\n\nhttp://blissonfourth.com/specials/"
1,"REALLY BAD!!! Service was bad and the food was bad. Servers there have no facial expression, slow on collecting finished plates. Food was just bad, their king crab legs were small like baby crab legs and very salty. Prime rib tasted like beef brisket. They did offer a glass of wine for everybody and 1 lobster per 2 persons for free, but the lobster meat was so nasty, it separated itself when we tried to stick the fork in. Only has a few types of sushi, salmon & shrimp sushi, some rolls, no sashimi, the rice was soooo hard. Dessert didn't have much choices too, worst creme brulee I've never had. Overall, the buffet doesn't worth $36 and will never go back again. So disappointed on such a high end hotel would have such a bad buffet."
1,"So I used to eat at this location\n\nAnd I loved it\n\nBut slowly\nEach time I ate here\n\nI'd get a tummy ache\n\nThen my boyfriend was all like \""hey, everytime I eat chipotle I get diarrhea\""\n\nSo it wasn't just me!\n\nWe continued to eat here though, because we loved it.\nAnd we'd make sure we had no where to be for a few hours after eating it.\n\nI know, we're weird.\n\nBut we got sick of getting sick.  Poo.  Literally."

1,Not sure what place all the reviewers are writing about ..... This place was horrible!!!! How does an Irish food place have awful Corned Beef and Cabbage???? Fish and chips were equally bad as well. Had to go to Jersey Mikes after.
1,"I was at this Applebee's with my fiance and 2 daughter's.  We waited patiently for a waitress or even someone to acknowledge that we were there. No one came... As we were leaving the hostess at the door was told and her only comment was \""Oh I'm sorry.\"" But did nothing else. So we came to Chili's were we were seated immediately and our waitress Toni took our order and brought our drinks. I work at a casino and also handicap,  customer service to me is so important. Chili's is by far the better restaurant and just down the street from this messed up restaurant.  I would've gave them NO STARS at all. The sad thing is the manager was right across from us when I complained and she did nothing!"
1,"From the moment I waked into this place I was made to feel like I did not belong. Even with a reservation, they made me feel as though I was not welcomed. Rude host staff and bartender who seemed to truly careless about anybody other than some fat cat sitting on the end of the bar. \n\nOh, well, on to my seat, and this is where the fun begins. I should have trusted my gut instinct immediately upon entering the restaurant and gone someplace else, btu I was hoping the food would redeem the poor service.\n\nI was sooo wrong. \n\nThe food here was not what I expected for the price. My steak was tough, filled with tendon and not cooked properly, Escargot was amazingly bland, and sides had a \""pre-packaged\"" taste/quality I could not get past. On top of the \""okay\"" food, the service was disgusting. I dined alone, and was not pinching pennies; I wanted to spoil myself. At the end of the meal my server asked me if I had a coupon! This was beyond outrageous and I can venture a guess at to why he targeted me as a possible \""coupon carrying\"" person. I paid cash, no coupon, and vowed to never return to this place that clearly is use to, and wants to, cater only to the \""Good Ol' Boys\"". They should really be ashamed."
1,"Rooms are great but the front desk is terrible. Front desk was slow and not organized and charged my credit card for charges that were not mine.  Clearing it up with the was a nightmare.  The valet parking is also a nightmare.  They need to incorporate self parking because they don't have the staff to handle weekend nights.  \n\nI made a reservation at Fiamma, an MGM restaurant and asked the front desk for their phone number because i wanted to cal the restaurant to let them  know we were running ten minutes late and they didn't have the number and gave me much attitude about. \n\nAgain, rooms are great but the front desk and valet parking make the stay not worth it."
1,"I didn't buy my dress at Michelle's, only rented tuxes there, so I cannot speak for the dress buying experience at Michelle's.\n\nDO NOT rent tuxes from them. DO NOT! If you think about renting them there and speak with someone named Monica, run! I live about 3 hours from Champaign but had my wedding in Champaign, and I spent a lot of (needless) time emailing back and forth with Monica. For some reason I had to repeat things over and over...she definitely was not really reading my emails or just has really bad reading comprehension because she would ask the same questions over and over....things I had already answered. When I talked to her on the phone she seemed very scatterbrained.\n\nThe day of the wedding all of the guys were wearing different styles of vests!!! They were all the correct color (black...kind of hard to mess that part up), but they were all different styles! Apparently after the long string of emails she still couldn't get it right.\n\nMy friend recently got married she also dealt with Monica and all the guys ended up with the wrong shoes - she had ordered them the wrong ones! She was told Michelle's would give her a refund for the shoes, but she hasn't seen it yet."
1,If I could give this zero stars trust me I would. We had ordered Garlic Shrimp and Three Cups Chicken which both were supposed to have garlic flavor. The food came in 2 minutes indicating that it was not fresh. The food has no flavor of garlic.
1,Don't bother if you care about customer service. One stylist for the entire place resulted in two walkouts in 20 minutes. Amateur hour.
1,"besides the fact that this hotel was like 30 minutes from the strip, the staff was rude and mean.\n\nthey kicked us out at 5 AM over \""some girl passed out in the casino\"" who was NOT part of our party. They came into our rotom and woke up my friends, who were clearly quietly knocked out and forced them to eleave.\n\none word: RUDE!"
1,"Complete dump.  Hotel staff was rude, bed was not comfortable, and while I was there (which was during CES, Las Vegas' busiest trade show), the hotel was out of soap.  The desk clerk said it wasn't their fault because it was back ordered.  I guess all of the other hotels in Las Vegas figured this one out, but for some reason, the guys at Alexis couldn't see this one coming.  Never again.  This was booked through my work's travel department, and I'll be making a point to never go there again."
1,"so to say this place is horrible is the least I could do... This place is a mess!\nThey have cockroaches big and small crawling all over the silverware so please beware what you eat with because that is so unsanitary. A couple of friends I work with got some coupons from them to get $5.00 complimentary meal. Second, they kept a girl I worked with's credit card on file... And charged her fifty dollars the day after she bought her food from there. Who does that? And on top of that they mess up your order and there are really rude. I would not recommend this place. How do you know you're not eating cockroach legs or shells in your pizza? Gross right?"
1,"Worst Pizza Ever! They just lost a customer and with service like that Vincent's is on its way to being just another one of those short-lived restaurants near the I-10 and Ray.  I called in for the $19.99 one-topping  pizza and wings special and decided to upgrade to the bbq chicken pizza for $7.  Terrible decision because their bbq sauce and chicken are awful, but the crust is so terrible it wouldn't really matter what was on top of it.  \n\nSo I called in to possibly get a different pizza sent out and I got to talk to Jack.  Maybe he is a cook trying to act like a manager but he certainly lacks any sort of customer service skills.  His offer to me was half off a new pizza.  Half off a pizza that I paid extra for, which I was ok with only to find out the bbq chicken pizza is only sauce, chicken and cheese.  That sounds like the one-topping pizza special that i ordered."
1,"My husband and I had dinner here last week. The food was mediocre and the prices are on the high end. While we were there, we witnessed the owner, the waiter confirmed,  reprimanding a hard working busboy rather loudly, so that the customers could hear the verbal abuse. We also learned that at least 4 other employees have quit in the last week. Because of this persons behavior, we will never return to or recommend this restaurant to anyone. Too many other nice feeling restaurants in the area."
1,"Gag, they used an old bucket of water to wash down the inside, it reeked.  I had to drive home with the windows down.  Moldy old water and they wash the inside with that same rag for the tires.  Awful.  It's hard to find this place on the very South side of the shopping complex.  Skip it."
1,"If you're looking for some good reviews you'll have to keep looking. \n\nI have been here for a year and a half. Since selling this place and becoming The Huntington Apartments this community's level of quality has significantly dropped. \n\nThe office employees are rude, unorganized, and far from helpful. There is a bug problem that they cannot get fixed in multiple apartments. Their organization is so bad that they can't even keep up with the pest control company's schedule. We have had missed appointments, and not been ready due to miscommunication on their side. \n\nI would not recommend this place to anybody period. We do have community dumpster divers that make their rounds every morning at 6 AM however. \n\nThere are police here non stop because of the amount of crime and disorderly conduct from some of the life forms that live here. Its a complete disaster. No matter how much painting they do around here there is no covering up poor quality living or customer service. If you are apartment hunting, keep hunting and good luck, there are good apartments out there, this just isn't one anymore."
1,"They call this pizza? I went in for a slice and it took 30 minutes to make it. The crust was very good, but they put cold toppings and cold cheese on top. I am from Chicago and we have some of the best pizza around... Maybe my expectations were too high for this place, I guess anywhere in Arizona for great pizza. Worst pizza!"
1,The only reason to go here was the excellent low-calorie desserts. It turns out they lied about the calorie content and they are actually high-calorie excellent desserts. \n\nCheck the stories in the newspaper for more info. I will never go here again.
1,Showed up to get oil change. One car in garage and two open bays. Informed it will be over 30 minutes before they can even get my car in.
1,"By Las Vegas standard this hotel should be one star. The new Tropicana is \""lipstick on a pig\"". The rooms had no sound barriers, you can hear your neighbor talking, flushing, and ....  The service is even worst. No one in this hotel has any idea what customer service and guest relation is about...so don't bother complaining."
1,"I will be happy to provide a review of their service if I can ever reach a live person to schedule an appointment with!  I purchased a Living Social voucher for 3 hours of cleaning and have been trying to reach someone to schedule an appointment with for 3 weeks now and it seems there is never a live person working at this place.  I tried to just use their website but there is no place to indicate the living social purchase.  Very frustrating.  If you can't staff your business to take a call from a customer, what can I expect from the service itself?"
1,"We ordered a pizza at 12 noon and showed up at the house 1.5 hrs later, pizza was cold so I sent it back.  When I tried to talk to the manager a very rude female would not give me her name and said that it would take about 45 min to an hour.  She refused to give me any information on the manager saying that his name was private information.  Their only remedy was to give me 20% off and remake the pizza and redelivered.  I would never tell anyone to eat here and will tell all my vet buddies and associates to never order their pizza.  I hope the manager or owner sees this post and contacts me.  Navy.dav91@gmail.com"
1,"Stay away from this place, the owner doesn't want your business. We went in and he was yelling to pretty much all if his customers what they should or should not touch. Tanked guys did nice frame for a bed, but on the bed there was only one very nasty looking mattress left, where you were allowed to lay on, but as soon as anyone did so he started yelling to be careful with the $35000 bed!!! Really? Also the fish in the tanks had no oxygen coming in. How this guy is in business is beyond me. He really doesn't deserve to be in business."
1,"Beyond disgusting. Food was cold. And old. If you like eating bad leftovers that have been reheated time and time again, you will love this place. Restaurant was filthy. And while we were there the manager actually turned away a party of 5 because they wanted to sit at an 8 top. The restaurant was 3/4 empty and this was Friday night at 6:30. Save yourself and never come here. Can I give it less than 1 star?"
1,Needed to have my phone repaired today...checked in at 3:30...wasn't helped until 5:03.  This is the same case scenario everytime I have to go in...which is a lot because my phone blows!!!  :/
1,"I have been to this buffet once a few years ago when I first moved to Vegas. I wasnt that impressed with their food. Considering its not hard to like Asian food. I havent been back since then. Today, my wife and I were so hungry, wanted something quick and didnt have to wait for the food. I wanted to give this place another shot considering theyre still in business. They must have gotten better. WRONG! Not only was their food disappointing, it was worse than I remember & the \""other\"" room in the back right corner had this awful musty smell. It was like a combination of a porta potty & a senior home living. The whole experience was just horrible. I barely ate. Couldnt stand being in the place that long. If you have any thoughts of going here, dont even bother. There are better local buffets that will cost you the same but way better."
1,"Pizza looked great when It arrived, but after starting to dig in I was sharply disappointed. What looked great on the pan turned out to be a runny mess. The cheese they are using is runny and I don't mean soft and gooey, I mean running off the pizza and of the pan when you separate the pieces. I thought it might firm up as it cooled, but then it turned in to goo and I have to tell you it was a COMPLETE turn off..... GROSS!!!!! I can tell you I will never go back to eat at any Primos. It was the worst pizza I have eaten in years.\n\nThe service was also awful. No one was really on top us with service and the empty pans and plates were on the table in front of us for so long we actually had to clear our own TABLE!\n\nThe only good experience of the night was the entertainment of a live band.\n\nStay away if you know what's good for you!"
1,"FUGGHET ABOUT IT! I personally know one of the male cooks who works there and from what he tells me the pizzas are left out way past holding times, no one uses gloves, money is touched then the same hands touch pizza. You couldn't give that to me for free! Yuck."
1,"I used to love h&m until I came to this store. I had just arrive when suddenly the power went out! Some of the other stores were up and running and according to some bystanders the electric company was aware and working on it. So I headed to the neighboring stores in hopes that the power would soon come back up, and it did! I went back inside h&m and the sales people looked mad to be there. I over heard one girl say that other stores that were affected got to go home but they didn't.  The attitudes of the employees were terrible. Shortly after, the power goes out AGAIN!  This time i stayed outisde the door along with some others but the employees said they were closing for the night.  Within two minutes the power went back on and I watched as a lady knocked on the door and the sales girl open the door and yelled that they were closed. Its ok that the power went off, what's not ok is for employees to be rude just because their anxious to leave!"
1,"I ordered a special combination and received a free drink. It was a good start. I waited for 20 minutes to receive my sandwich. Frustrated, I inquired about my order. Apparently, a couple of customer after me ordered a set of sandwiches and decides to push my to the back. Not a very good customer service. \nFinally, after 30 minutes I received the sandwich and surprised by the lack of substance in the filling. \nMy first visit sucks! \n\nHowever, I will visit them again to give them another opportunity."
1,"This was my husband and I's first time coming to this restaurant.  At first we were excited about their pad Thai, but once we got to the register and were NOT greeted, we quickly wondered if it was a good choice to have come or not... We ordered. Were given our glasses and went to sit down.  As soon as I was about half way through my drink I noticed there was lipstick on my glass.  My husband took it up to the front to show them and get a different glass.  No apology, no nothing.  Just took the glass and gave him a new one.  The service here sucks, and I hate to say it, but it might be due to their staff which is all teenagers.  I wish young people had more respect for others.  \n\nNeedless to say we will not be eating here again.  \n\nOh, I gave them one start because their pad Thai was pretty good.  Not a lot of seasoning, but not too bad."
1,"Avoid this Einstein!! I work near this location and I periodically stop by to grab breakfast before heading into work. I keep on giving this location a chance but decided to only go to the location on Rainbow & Flamingo from now on\n(AWESOME customer service!!!). \n\nI'm always greeted with what seems to be a torturous smile and good morning from their manger (red head woman who always seems to be disheveled). I place my order, pay and wait for my name to be called. Why is it that I need to wait 13 minutes to get a toaster nova lox and bagel sandwich (there was only 4 people in front of me in line)? Why is it that I specifically asked for my bagel to be toasted and its not? Why is it that the people in line after me get their order before me??  Why is it that when I order coffee their creamer is ALWAYS out??\n\nCome on?? Get it together!!!\nI feel the only reason they have business is because of its location. \nNothings wrong with taking a little pride in your job?! Just saying!!!"
1,"The only thing I like about this casino is the Sobe Ice Rink thats attached to it. \n\nIf you live in east vegas, it sucks because you have to drive quite a distance to get to it. the other ice rink in henderson sucks, its too small\n\nThe sister casino, Fiesta Henderson? ha no comment."
1,"This place used to be great back in the heyday. Every time I would go on the hunt for gauges in the area (since I used to live relatively close to this location), they always seemed to be out on some sort of make or model of gauges I would want. I've also noticed a lot of their gauges don't come in pairs, and generally are missing or out of stock completely. If you're lucky enough to get a good pair that's discounter it could work to your benefit on saving money, but other than that this location has really fell in business and in service. What was a little aggravating is that the person I talked to in regards of spiral gauges didn't even know what a spiral gauge was or what they looked like. Really, now?\n\nI don't believe you should deserve to work at a tattoo shop if you have no idea what you are talking about or you fail to answer questions that are centered in your department."
1,"this was my forth time coming to this restaurant and things have changed (for the worst).\n\nthe burger which was the stable of this establishment was a dried out tiny perfectly formed and pressed portion of meat. now  being a burger aficionado, i swear was frozen! a sentiment of my entire group that ordered the burger or burgr. as gordon likes to call them.\n \nalso the hot dog was rabid.the party that made the mistake of eating it was sick as a dog that eve and could not make it to dinner later that evening. \n\nthe only thing worse than the food was the service which was non-existent. we actually had to run up to the bar to order our drinks.\n\ni'm thinking of starting a reality show where i review various  bad eateries and was going to start here.  a penny for you thoughts (just not one of these burgers), yes?"
1,"This place is no good now - HUGE portions of rice in the nigiri, and 3 of our group came down with food poisoning after eating here.\n\nThe yakisoba and other appetizers weren't that good either, even if you ignore the issues with the nigiri and our getting sick.\n\nWould not recommend, ever."
1,"I ordered a birthday cake with vanilla butter cream icing and white cake. When I picked it up it was decorated nicely, however after trying the cake the icing had no vanilla flavor at all it tasted like Crisco and sugar and the cake was dry. I will not be going back here."
1,"Total crap food\nI came with my wife for a long time awaited breakfast date.. This place served miserable food, poor taste in coffee. . Cold coffee s made from hot with ice added to it.. waffle was soggy with out and syrup. .\nwasted time and pretty expensive. Poor quantity.. old breads for sandwich. . Came out hungry. .\nWould have rather stayed home for breakfast!!"
1,"When you say your a vegetarian don't recomend the potato soup with Bacon. Then don't mess around with me about the refund, with no mea culpa."
1,"The person answering the phone might be the single worst employee I've ever encountered. I asked to order a delivery and he said, \""I'm too busy\"" and hung up the phone. When I called back (mostly in disbelief that a business would hang up on a customer) he and asked if he wanted another attempt at my business, \""I'm sorry you feel that way bye\"" and hung up immediately."
1,"This is the GHETTO! Awful and lazy customer service!! I booked a reservation online and when I came in, I waited half of an hour to be greeted/helped, although there were only two people in line, on a Tuesday. Then the customer service rep told me they were out of cars, even though I had a prior reservation. She also rudely interrupted my friend (who was thankfully there for moral support). She then directed us to her manager, who also did nothing to help the situation. That girl needs to be fired. Not to mention that this branch has a dreary front office with almost no furniture and outdated 90's posters on the wall. Felt uncomfortable all around."
1,Truly awful service and food!  Think of half the quality of Denny's food for three times the price!  I would never go back.  Very sad when you consider there are nice places in Golden Nugget like Vic & Anthony's but the nice places close before midnight on a weekend in Las Vegas?  What are they thinking!??!  Another terrible place to avoid in Golden Nugget is the Chart House.\n\nWayne Gorsek
1,"The cupcakes were quite a let down. We spent quite a bit of money to get cupcakes for our entire group (there were 14 of us), and unfortunately the cupcakes weren't anything special. I'm a cupcake fanatic and sweet lover, so it's not like I'm not a dessert person.. because I am.  However these just didn't do it for me.  The cake was dry and lacking flavor, and the frosting wasn't enough to save the cupcake. I knew everyone else felt the same as no one finished a whole cupcake. The shop was decently cute, but smelt horribly of tobacco from the store next door.  \nIf you want a yummy cupcake, but want to avoid the strip I'd suggest Gigi's or the whole foods at town square."
1,Do not go here. King of like maggianos. I hate it. Huge factory. We had bad experience with almost everything we ordered. If u love french fries then this is your place.\nWe both got sick after.
1,"The indv. to cut my hair was sent out to buy picture frames during my appointment time.  The salon has my phone number but elected not to call me.  After waiting 30 min, I left.  There was no damage control call or effort of any kind to apologize.  Perhaps they didn't want me as a customer.  After all, I did come in regularly, pay my bill, tip well and refer others to their business.  Yeah, I can see why it played out this way.  Well done, indeed!"
1,"First to state I was really disappointed with my experience at circus circus in general. But me and my brother were so tired by the time we got to the hotel that making the effort of going out to eat any where else didn't seem worth is. \n\nAs for \""cheap\"" yeah I guess so but simply adding a beer made the meal about $30 per person which didn't feel that cheap at all. The food all tasted and looked like it had been frozen and the decor was more school cafeteria then vacation. \n\nThe only nice thing I can say is that the staff were very nice. And if you had very picky children I guess there could be appeal. But other then that save your money if you want to eat mediocre food and go to mcdonalds."
1,Waited over and hour for our food our waitress never came near our table after taking our orders. We attempted to wave her down to find out why two tables who had only been seated 15 minutes already received their food and we had been there over an hour and nothing (keep in mind there were only two of us). After watching everyone around us come and go and waiting another 10 - 15 minutes we finally decided to just leave. We walked past our waitress on the way out and she said nothing. I give them one star because zero isn't an option which really sucks because we were extremely stoked to try this place :(
1,Waited in line to see how long a wait would be for three people. A gentlemen waiting in the opposite line psychically grabbed me and pulled me back and said that he was in front of me. I told him that there was clearly two lines and that my party was larger than his party of two so either way I'd still be waiting much much longer than him. The hostess told me to head to the end of the line and wait once again even though I had all ready waited in the double line for 10-15 minutes.\n\nAbsolutely terrible customer services and something I wouldn't expect from PF Changs...a place I often visit at my home town which I won't visit anymore.\n\nI'll never be back!
1,"Extremly Dissapointed, I came to this place thinking it was truly the best place in Vegas but its not even close to Good. Don't Waist your Money."
1,"BEWARE THE GRAVEYARD MENU.  Typically I have a great meal and time at shucks. living close by I have been there quite a few times. Last night a buddy and I shared some fried clam strips and peel and eat shrimp. When the clams arrived the first thing I thought was \""what the hell is this?\"" I have never seen clams that were almost 5 inches long. Was very unsettling, but I thought to myself, \""who am I? I don't know if maybe these are different from every other clam I've eaten, so what the heck\"" tasted OK, were very chewy, I still wasn't convinced these were actual clams, but kept eating.  About 5 hours later I woke up with stomach cramps, proceeded to vomit all of the food I had eaten, and dry heaved for another hour or so while I began to become feverish. I lost a day of work and needless to say they have lost a customer.\n\nThe plus side of the story is that my buddy did not get sick, I checked with him but apparently he did some heavy drinking afterwards so not sure if that affected his toxicity levels."
1,"I am totally baffled why this place gets such good reviews. I have been there a few times because it's close to my work and I received some gift certificates for my birthday. Unfortunately after the last experience, I can't go back.  Although they are very nice and have great prices, I have to reveal the ugly truth: \n1. They don't put any effort into sanitizing the tools or the pedicure bowl. I actually saw them clean the brushes and tools in the water I was soaking my feet in and then just rinse out the bowl after they were done... not spray, soap, nothing!\n2. Reason #1 probably explains why my heals cracked so severely after my pedicure that they began to bleed.  I had to use peroxide, neosprin, and bandages for almost a week to get it heal. \n3. They water down their nail polish... so much that it destroys the bond and polish never actually dries. \nI hate to bash a business with good customer service, but these practices are simply unacceptable.  I obviously won't be back. =("
1,"My boyfriend works in this shopping center and he likes deli food so I went to vons to get him some cheap bean and cheese burritos in the deli section- I was going to get a fresh sandwich made because I am not totally into the fried deli food and the menu actually looked pretty good--- turkey pesto something I don't remember.  ANYWAYS. I was standing at the counter watching the two employees do EVERYTHING but their job in helping me. Like literally probably close to 5 minutes \n\nPretty upset and annoyed I called my boyfriend and he told me that this was \""pretty typical\"" and that ordering food from the deli section seemed to be a HUGE inconvenience for them. And they are generally very rude needless to say  i didn't buy any thing from them."
1,"Auto Unlimited is the worst car dealership I have ever had to deal with. They break the law and the owner is a terrible person. I bought a car that pulled to the right, during the purchase I told the salesman that I would not buy the car if it pulls to the right. So he assured me that they would take care of it. After they looked over the car twice the problem was not fixed and the owner said tough shit I am not helping you. The car also has a DTC for a sensor that came on 2 days after I bought the car. I checked and they cleared the code right before I bought the car. THAT IS AGAINST THE LAW!! Never ever go to this dealership, They lie just to get you to buy a car."
1,"I am downgrading my last rating of 3 stars.  Some time ago, I stopped going to Shogun because of an unfortunate fish incident.  Time passed, and my husband and I recently decided to give their Happy Hour a try.  We parked the car, walked toward the door, and were hit with a bad oil smell that completely changed our minds."
1,"Curt and abrupt management.  Turned away on Mothers Day because, in fine print, my gift certificate had expired.  In my mind, along with a good massage should come quality customer service.  Though I had frquented other locations, I will never return and will relate this experience to my friends."
1,"This dentist is very nice but I do have question some of his suggestions. He wanted to put an enamel backing on my front teeth because he said they were cracked. I think I would have noticed if my front teeth were cracked. My two front teeth have a little ridge in the middle- it has always been there and that is just the shape of my teeth. My dentist says my front teeth are perfect and there is nothing wrong with them. He also wanted do a deep cleaning and I had no idea what that was and he explained what it was and that I had a $200 deductible for that. I told my mom about the deep cleaning and she told me that is for people with gum disease and that I don't need it since my gums and teeth are healthy. I told the dentist that I discussed it with my mom who had previously been a dental hygienist and he said that he would waive my deductible and just not tell the insurance company. I was so stunned I said fine and he took about 5 minutes in my mouth with using this tool to do the deep cleaning. It was a strange experience. I didn't realize until today that his \""deep cleaning\"" wasn't even as thorough as my new dentists regular cleaning. I'm glad I found a new dentist that I trust my pearly whites with."
1,"Cab smelled awful and the driver was extremely rude.  The hotel was only 3 miles away which he complained about the entire ride, the meter was $8, I had to pay $16 for airport pickup minimum charge, ok I get that, then he complained because I wasn't paying cash (if you only want cash say NO when a customer asks if you take credit before entering the cab). Then called me cheap because he didn't feel a $10 tip was sufficient for 5 mins of driving and rude conversation. Never again"
1,"This hotel is as awful as it gets. My stay at this hotel was terrible and the worst part was knowing what a profit they made off my stay. The hotel staff is really unprofessional and don't even understand the checking in process. The room was $109! I checked out the next morning and went to Fiesta Resort (5 stars--free wi-fi) for $72.\n\nHere are a list of things wrong with this hotel and my room:\n* Shower tub was clogged (I should have been given a discount for this)\n* Bathroom towels were old and smelled like chlorine\n* Air conditioner smells each time it automatically turns on\n* Beds are uncomfortable and never seem to be rotated\n* Carpet is stained\n* Decor is from the 70s\n* Bathroom is cramped\n* Accordian-style bathroom mirror was missing the mirror\n* Hair dryer barely worked\n* Remote only works from ~6 feet away from the TV\n* TV gets terrible reception\n* Hangars cannot be removed from the closet track\n* Sliding glass door couldn't be opened\n* Shower nozzle is small, corroded, and cheap ($8 nozzle)\n* They charge for wi-fi\n* Hotel has stains on the side of the building\n* The hotel staff\n\nit's a rip-off. Stay away from here! It needs to go out of business and be bought by a company that will renovate it."
1,"If I can give a 0 star I will !!!!!! I order a Tostada of ceviche there for 6,45 dollar a combo an they only gave me this !!!!! Never go back here !!!! Never order a tostada of ceviche !!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!!"
1,Too bad this place is now closed :( They had really good chai and frozen coffee drinks.... They will be missed
1,"I had two diametrically opposed experiences at this \""deli.\"" My first visit was pleasant enough as I had good, homemade latkes and a Chicago hot dog! I'm telling you the latkes were really good (perfectly spiced, moist and crispy), and my Chicago dog was prepared just right with just enough char!\nOn the second visit the the latkes were nauseatingly bad. They were the worst latkes I've ever had! Terrible flavor and preparation. Did a two-year-old make this? Were these made of rotten potatoes and onions mixed with garbage? Feh!!!!\nI also ordered the pastrami! This pastrami was obviously low-grade store-bought value-brand drek. Did this even come from a brisket, let alone a cow? It was possibly the worst pastrami I've ever had. It tasted like a cheap hot dog, and that, my friend, is not how the sexiest of the cured meats is supposed to taste! I would not chance eating their pastrami again!"
1,"Every time I have called to book an appointment I've been put on hold forever. Also, when I've gone in, I've been told to come back much later. DISLIKE"
1,"Moi qui n'est pas difficile, jamais j'aurai cru donner  1* \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al...mais bref. \u00c7a fait quelques fois que je mange un sandwich au Bocadillo qui sont excellents!

1,"Extremely disappointed and would not recommend consigning fairly new and nice furniture items.. I brought in 3 pieces of furniture that were purchased within a 2 year time period and were still in the store catalogs.  I gave them the receipts and they had priced them less than 1/2 of what they were purchased for and that was okay, but what disturbed me was, they were marked down within 2 weeks of being in the store and I was told that they had a lot of interest and it was priced to high.  The two desirable pieces sold as soon as they were marked down and the 3rd piece which was less desirable was never marked down ???.  I still can't figure that one out. When I questioned the man on the floor,  his response was we need to price that down too.  Very arrogant attitude and I learned my lesson the hard way.  There are many Consignment stores out there and they wait 60 days before they mark down an item and you split the purchase 50/50.  If it's a nice item, I'd go else where.."
1,"The highlight of our dinner was the beef ribs, prime rib and gelato. service was good but I couldnt reccomend this to family or friends visiting unless its comp."
1,"I used to go here often when I went to MCC.  I admit that the food was pretty good, but the owner ruined the entire experience for me.  At the time, I was learning Japanese and wanted to try it out in an actual setting.  He yelled at me the first time I tried and told me to speak English.\n\nAnother instance, and the real reason I don't go back there, is when a friend of mine went to eat there.  After he finished, he said \""Gochisousamadeshita\"" (a polite saying thanking the preparer of the food for the meal) and the owner muttered under his breath \""Henna Gaijin\"" (strange foreigner).\n\nI can understand not having the patience to speak Japanese with me, but really.....insulting someone who just thanked you for the food?  That's enough for me to never return."
1,Hotel and room were fine but I was very disappointed that they wouldn't let the shuttle take us to or pick us at the light rail station. The other hotels in the area had their shuttles running without trouble. Probably won't stay here again.
1,"\""That's mold!\"" my sister said to describe the green layers running through the entire cake that we had picked up only a couple hours earlier at the PV Chompie's.  The cake we had just put in front of our spouses and kids.  I loaded a picture of the cake that has to be seen to be believed.  How old does a cake have to be to have this much mold running through it?  It's shocking that food professionals would allow a product as dangerous as this one to be eaten.  We took it back from our family and back to the store. The GM gave us our money back and offered us something else.  She mentioned something about talking to the bakery about the cake.  This is one situation that a GM can't make right to the customer.  Dangerous food is unfixable, and a red flag to a potentially systemic food handling problem in the restaurant.  Nope.  Keep your replacement pastry.  In fact, keep anything else you've got to serve, Chompie's.  I value my family's health too much to risk serving them your food again."
1,"Went for lunch recently. The appetizers were good, but the main course was terrible. The beef broccoli was extremely bland and thee pad Thai was simply disgusting. There are several other Chinese and Thai places in Henderson that are far better."
1,My wife (a regular for over a year) had a terrible skin reaction around the edge of her hair after coloring. Called Vincent the manager who said he would investigate and get back to her - last we heard from him.\n\nThis was the last straw and she is switching salons now. $40 for a straightforward blow dry after a treatment too... Just crazy. Go elsewhere
1,"The sandwiches have taken a huge downhill turn. AVOID, even though they are dirt cheap at $2.99. This location uses stale bread, end slices of tomatoes, brown lettuce and the most minimal amount of turkey possible. Pathetic excuse for a sandwich.If your desperate, it still is Boars Head, so strip the turkey and use your own bread and condiments."
1,"Just AWFUL...  I was in town for a Bridal Shower and the service was horrible!!  There was only 12 of us women and they couldn't get it together.  They forgot to bring out 2 salads and missed 3 entrees.  Our waiter Kevin was the worst and the manager Kelly was non-responsive.  DO NOT ever plan a party here.  I felt bad for the bride.  The day was supposed to be about her, but everyone was focused on the slow, lousy, rude service"
1,"Would not recommend to anyone. We went on a Friday night, and this place was practically empty... Maybe due to the bad music. They had some good songs but mostly just crap. Not worth going to really."
1,"The donuts were meh, but local, until I got an earful of political garbage, I feel a restaurant is a poor forum for political banter, whatever your opinion. It seems like a great business model, small space, great smell, capturing a liberal market they're not a part of, low overhead, and high return (even better if their company car is biodiesel, which if it's not, then it should be) if their donuts can stop being so mediocre I might raise my review. I'll keep an eye out for the yelp score to jump a little, then I'll go back."
1,"This has got to be the worst car wash in the area.\nFrom the minute you drive up to the minute you leave the experience is horrendous.\n\nWhen you drive up the entrance sleazy ex con looking employees come up to you and try to sell you every single extra they offer. Even when you come in asking for a standard wash they will try to convince you to wax your car or tell you that you need a leather treatment done.\n\nAfter that used car man type treatment occurs they take your car from you and drive it through a machine wash with tracks that scratch your rims, while heavy beaters ruin your paint. \nFollowing that torture they drive your car to a covered area where disgruntled employees wipe up a few drips before yelling ready. I don't think your car is supposed to look worse after a car wash?"
1,The burgers and fries are good if you have an addiction to grease and salt. Also they are very expensive. When they first open and people got to experience five guys business continues to fall.
1,"Well this place is overcrowded. Also avoid the rudest security guard I have ever let. I almost never yelp and yet this guy has made quite the impression on me. His name is Brice and he has continued to to tell me that I should leave because I \""look\"" over intoxicated.\nI told him that I wasn't and he continued to tell me to get some water. I told him that I didn't need any and told him to go away. The security guard he was working with even told him to leave me alone. And yet he watched my every move, until I walked to another part of the club. \n Any how, I was really excited to come here until that experience. I'm very disappointed with the organization of the club and inability to get around without being harassed by security guards named Brice. I will be sticking to less newer clubs in Vegas for now on. \n\nHakkasan is simply overrated and not worth the time, money or effort!"
1,"The most horrible restaurant experience I've had in Montreal!\nIt was the definition of dirty, with the chairs torn apart and the tables barely standing the weight of the food. The food itself was the worst part: we had a sandwich that was made with old chewy bread and a few flakes of meat spread on it. The hummus was OK, and the salad was nothing more than bitter lettuce with a bit of dressing. In the end, the waitress didn't even have enough change to return the rest of the bill, and I was almost forced to give more tip than I intended simply because I didn't want to wait for her to ask every single person in the restaurant for change!\nIf you're planning to have some good time, I think Shahrazad should be your last option!"
1,"I didn't eat here, just walked in and tried to sit down at lunch time. The people were nasty so we walked out. Plus there's a $50 minimum per person. Gotta give it to 'em - they went all the way with the ridiculous minimum."
1,"I stayed two night in Vdara, and I had a unpleasant experience here. The first day we checked in Vdara, I took a nap on the bed. After a while, I felt one of my leg was itchy and I lifted the quilt, and found there were some black spots peppered on the sheet. I was shocked, because I didn't expected the hotel like Vdara would make such mistake. I called the housing keeping instantly and asked for changing the sheet. Then I asked the manager to come as well, the African American manager took a picture and said he would report it, and would compensate us for that. Yet, two days latter, I still didn't hear back from Vdara. :( It seems like Vdara is not value about customer experience. not recommended."
1,"All of these reviews seem to be hit or miss.  Mine was definitely a \""miss\"".  Service was AWFUL, and the hostess was a complete bitch.  And the place was not full.  Food was mediocre, when we finally got a chance to order and eat it.  Wine came very late.\nI was hoping to find a hidden gem but instead discovered a stinking turd."
1,"What was I thinking to step foot in this dump? I had family in from out of town that wanted t-shirts to take home to Nebraska. Bonanza has t-shirts, really good ones if you like lame knockoffs and hoochie mama type shirts but nothing you'll want to be seen in outside of Fremont St. much less wearing it in Lincoln, NE.\n\nIf you want 25 different Las Vegas themed shot glasses, CSI knockoffs, used decks of cards from Harrah's, and 6 different colors of dice you'll find it here. You'll also find overly aggressive security who treats everyone as thieves in waiting, and a checkout process that is a bit archaic. Oh and there's somebody at the door to check your receipt like that's going to keep someone from stealing something? And the staff has to be one of the most sourpussed group of unfortunate souls collecting a check in the city. \n\nAfter stopping here I kinda wish that all the demolition on the North end of the Strip, ie: The Frontier and such had been done a little bit further North. Perhaps once the SLS Las Vegas revives the Sahara some developer will come in and remove this crappy place. While I'm all for preserving Old Vegas, pictures of this dump will suffice vs. keeping the real thing. \n\nThis review is for the Gift Shop only and not the liquor store. Which might be about the only redeeming quality for this place."
1,"The ONLY thing I like about this dinasour is entering through the kitchen.\n\nUnfriendly bartenderS, two of them, food is ok, but let's not go crazy here, it's not great.  Just another \""institiution\"" that gets a free pass because...I don't know why they get a free pass.\n\nThe red-flocked wall paper is older than dirt; so are the waitresses.  Just so mediocre.  So many other places to go."
1,"At first, I thought I was going to have a great experience here.  They had great items ranging from wines to great decor for the biggest alcoholic and wine enthusiast in the city; however, my night was completely spoiled by the extremely rude and unpleasant ladies who were working.\n\nAs a newly turned 21 year old, I have grown accustom to showing my ID, and I do not mind doing it one bit.  I know the law, and I would never risk a business being fined by serving an underager.  However the ladies were extremely rude when demanding I show ID first before even looking at a wine.  Then, after showing my ID to the one nice ladies, the others looked over and saw me drinking and lost her mind.  She was obviously too busy with her computer to see I had already been carded.  Her redundancy about the fines that would be given if they served me underage were rather annoying and uneccasary.  \n\nToo bad the staff was so rude because we were about to buy some wine and a few decorations."
1,"I had my alternator die in 2007 with 75k miles.  At the time I was stranded and the tow truck driver recommended this place.  It took him 3 hours to change the alternator and he charged $385 parts and labor. He said quote \"" it was buried and hard to get to it\"".\n\nFast forward my truck has 120k miles and the alternator dies with only 50k on the one he put in. I called tho see if he would warranty it and he said no. I decided to watch a YouTube video to see if I could replace it myself. $134 later and 45 minutes later including drive time to auto zone twice to purchase new parts and return the old core I have new alternator with a lifetime warranty. Actual install time 20 minutes.\n\nDO NOT USE THIS PLACE. HE BLATANTLY LIED TO ME."
1,"Horrible service.  \n\nCould not understand the clerk taking my order, then of course it wasn't what I wanted.  The clerk then tries to blame me for the mistake - what???  \n\nThe person making my drink acts like it's such a pain to make what I wanted.  Then, she makes it wrong again anyway, so I just had to walk away, with no drink, or else many awful things may have come out of my mouth!"
1,"At lot of attitude and bad food? No thanks.\n\nThere's a vicious cycle when it comes to making assumptions about your patrons. You think, 'they look young and they ordered tap water. I bet they aren't going to spend much money here. I am going to ignore them.\"" Well you know what happens when you never see your waiter again and have to order through managers all night? You get a bad tip.\n\nWe ordered some sangria, the red, which was alright but not great. Then we ordered a few plates of tapas, to get us started. We had the risotto which was just terrible and a few other things as well. The only good thing was the ceviche, but I've certainly had better. It was a tiny bit of food for a lot of money and a lot more attitude.\n\nThere are much better options out there. I will not be back."
1,Not good. Sorry. I can get pass the decor if the food was good. Keep going. Big warehouse style with table and chairs at the end. Some good reviews???? Must be the workers.  No Flavor unless you add the sauce (a lot)! The server was very kind. So close to Mexico we thought it would be a no brainer.
1,I have used this laundromat for about 2 yrs now. The ladies whenever there is someone there are nice (if they're not on their cell phones talking away).... Then a couple of weeks ago I went in for the last time as I finally moved out of that area (Thank goodness)... Now I'm trying to call their customer service number and all you get is a damn answering machine saying they'll call back in 24 hrs. Well it's been about 5 days n still no call back. You're expected to pay $.50 for the card you get and of course if you have a balance on it good luck trying to get your money back. Also now there's bums and drunks laying asleep on the benches and no one seems to go anything about it. I'm so glad I don't have yo deal with this anymore!!!!
1,"Service?  What service?  From the moment you enter this place you begin to wonder about your personal health and safety.  After hundreds of times driving by this place, some friends and I decided to stop in for the Tuesday wing night, and we left with the opinion that none of us would ever be making a return visit.  I'm not sick YET, but I guess we'll have to find out what the morning brings.  YOU CAN DO BETTER in this neighborhood, so don't expect much more than a crappy beer poured out of a questionable tap system into a partially-cleaned glass.  And if you're getting something to eat, say a few Hail Marys first.  (Actually, you'd be better off going half a mile down the street and getting a Fiori's pizza to go!)"
1,"The food here is actually pretty good, but the service is absolutely terrible when the owner Rajiv is not around. And forget about the delivery, the food is always cold and then they blame you if they can't find the place.  They really need to work on the service."
1,"Took my boyfriend out to eat here July 31st, 2014 for his birthday. As I was eating my dumplings I realized that they were raw inside (note picture that was uploaded). I pointed this out to the waitress and she just took my plate and made no offer to resolve the situation. I have now eaten raw pork due to their negligence and have been feeling woozy ever since. I will NEVER be doing business with this company again."
1,"I wish I would have read some of the reviews before I stopped by this Korean BBQ restaurant.  I normally could care less about attitude however, from the first moment I stepped in the restaurant I was surprised that the hostess did not like the fact that I did not speak Korean (I am Korean by birth, adopted by white parents).  \n\nI didn't think too much of it until the waitress, who said 5 words to me acted as if I was a turd in the chair.  The food was very average, (pork bulgogi).  I only saw the waitress when I ordered and when the food was delivered to the table.  After that She decided to avoid the disgraceful Twinkie sitting in her section.  \n\nI wanted to see how long after I completed my meal it would take for some attention (or the bill).  I waited 25min until I had enough and I waved the waitress for my bill.  The stone face hostess didn't ask me anything just swiped my amex and off I went. \n\nI would be ashamed to work in an environment where my employees never smiled or cared about their customers.  If your food is sub par, at least give great customer service.\n\nI would only step foot in here to use the bathroom nothing more."
1,"The customer service at this store is horrible. I went in yesterday because I was having trouble with my iPhone. I walked up to an employee at the Genius Bar and told him what was going on, he looked at his iPad and told me I'd have to come back in 3 hours so someone could look at it for me. I was astonished because there was at least 5 employees standing in a circle talking amongst each other none of which were helping any customers. Needless to say, I turned around and walked right out. Went to T-Mobile instead and experienced the best customer service. Disappointed with Apple and I probably will never buy another one of their products."
1,"San Gennaro Feast has become an expensive no-reason-to-go money pit. It started out great and has devolved in quality with each passing year.\n\nHave sampled everything this festival has to offer and the only thing that is a constant is the lemonade stand. The sausage tend to be pre-cooked in large batches and end up drying out because no one is willing to pay $10+ for a shriveled sausage sandwich.\n\nThe entry fee is ridiculous, especially after moving to a non-casino facility away from the Strip. Total Gypsie fest."
1,This place has completely given up. I don't know if they have had new owners within the last 4 months or so but its gotten really bad. Unless your one of the regulars who have probably been drinking since 11am you don't get much attention here.\n\nJust went there tonight for the 35 cent wings on Monday night. Waited 5 minutes before the lazy waitress decided to come greet me. Placed my order right away as I could tell how often I would see her again. Just got 2 dozen wings. ....... 45MINS LATER my wings show up. Not exaggerating at all. NEWSFLASH- Wings take 8mins in the fryer...why would I have to wait 45mins??? When they finally showed up I let her know Ill just take them to go since Im out of time. She didn't seem to care at all I was clearly upset. Also NOT ONE TIME did she refill my drink...not one time. And to top of the whole fun experience I get the check to find out they have stopped the wings deal on Monday. \n\nIts sad cause I used to go here with all my friends every Monday and this place had good waitresses who cared but like I said earlier these people now don't care one bit. NEVER AGAIN. Thank Jackie for the great experience and hope you can find another dump hole to work in 6 months when this place is closed.
1,"this store started out nice, but within about a year it had already destroyed itself. The floors are already dirty, the lot is ALWAYS  a mess, the people inside are rude and HATE their life apparently. Ask them a question and they might just cut themself with their box cutter. This location NEVER  has enough lanes open and the self-checkout employess are never to be found. To top off everything else, the prices are actually really high. It makes me sad that people just let walmart lie to them about having the lowest prices, because they most certanly do NOT. I've price compared a few different places and the Target across the 215 actually had the lowest average prices on food and HBA. It's got a full grocery on the Garden Center side so that is where I will be going for groceries for now on, I will never step foot in this lying, filthy, horrid trap again. Now if only the moron \""security\"" guy would get the hell out of the way!"
1,"Hello! \nMy husband and I have been living in Crosswinds apartments in Chandler AZ. We are not very happy with the extermination that has been going on for roaches. The company used peanut butter in the cabinets which just attracted the roaches even more and now there is a colony of roaches living in our convection oven (which is a $300 wedding gift!)There were holes behind our stove in the wall where they were coming from! We will not bomb this place because of our two pets and the fact that we do NOT want chemicals all over our belongings, and if anything all of the buildings needs to be bombed because of horrible roach and bed bug problems! We are frankly getting tired of dealing with this issue and it should not be our problem! If our belongings get even more ruined we will have to send you guys the bill of everything we had to do in order to defend our apartment against the roaches."
1,"This place was absolutely terrible. The server had me YELL MY ORDER ACROSS THE ROOM.\n\nOur food was disgusting, wilted and contained mystery ingredients and missing others. The manager comped our entire meal and drinks then offered us dessert to go. It was so bad, we declined. So horrible! Be warned! Holy rotten macaroni! \n\nGuys seated nearby us left when we did, shook my hand for saying something to them. Absolutely beyond ridiculous."
1,"This place is absolutely the worst. First off, we went to check in and were told to come back at 12, we came back at 12. What did they tell us again? To come back at 3. So we leave and come back at 3. And we find out that people who had NO RESERVATIONS got their rooms at 12? What? That totally defeats the purpose of making reservations in the first place. This infuriated me and my family so much but we let it go. \nThen later that night I saw that the blankets on the bed were dirty. The pillow case had some kind of brown stain on it. I was disgusted. \nThe next morning when walking down the hall there was some plates and glasses on the floor, we didn't think much of it but when we came back later that night they were still there. This place has crappy maintenance. \nI'm definitely NEVER coming back here."
1,"With Walmart being so big, they lack customer service. Pressed for assistant more than 3x at the fabric section and no one showed up. They just keep losing sales over and over. Will it ever get better??!!!! Such a disappointment."
1,"I'm been in the hospitality industry for 12 years, so take my opinion as you wish.\n\nLocation is better than before, but much smaller.  I will never eat there again.  Food was bad not to mention cold.  We were the only ones there, should have been a hint, and the service was so slow you would think the place was packed.  I may take my son back to play, but wouldn't touch the food, especially with so many options in town square.  I've seen many of my customers with infinitely better food and atmosphere close shop.  Unless something drastically changes, I don't see this place lasting."
1,I would much rather give this place zero stars. I scheduled a pick up and they sent me a window when they would be there and no one showed up. However I got a call saying he's running. A few Minutes behind I can understand. Here I am not calling customer service talked to 3 diff people aside from the guy Jason who called me the last guy then told me that the driver just went back to the warehouse then left and the best the could schedule me for was 2 weeks from now. Annoying. Never going to them again now that I sat at an empty apartment and wasted 7 hours of my day waiting for them.
1,went to metro pizza on sky point dr. last night ordered a large triple play pizza. over $24.00 for a large pizza!!!! it was a thin crust ridiculous! one of the most expensive pizzas we ever ordered! it was ok but $24.00 wasn't worth it. if that wasn't bad enough my brand new car got keyed on the whole passenger side!!! car's 4 months old hasn't even had first oil change yet. I know it wasn't metro's fault but we were parked in their handicap parking {we're both handicapped and hung our sign up} trouble with this metro  their parking lot is way off to the side and far from the restaurants entrance so yeah makes easy target to vandalize patrons cars.called police filed complaint and talked to metro's manager on duty.advised him to maybe put camera out in parking lot and for him to call police so they can watch parking lot when cruising the area. told me he will have owner give me a call. of course that never happened! yesterday evening ended up making this the most expensive pizza we ever had.typical owner could give a damn about trouble we had outside his restaurant!!! we will never set foot in metro pizza ever again.just a warning to all the public be wary of eating in this establishment cause your vehicles will be at risk when you park in metro's parking lot.
1,"I ordered delivery because of the good reviews. I ordered garlic knots and a hawaiian pizza. When the food arrived, the garlic knots were stale and crunchy. I could not eat them. The pizza wasn't much better. The cheese was already rubberized andbthe grease soaked through to the bottom leaving a floppy, soggy crust. I wouldn't recommend eating this to anyone. It was one of those times that trying something new over the usual was a disaster."
1,"Sorry, this place sucked. It was crowded, the service was absolutely awful and the food was mediocre. I was literally asked for my I'D 3 separate times (I'm 45 by the way) AND you're only \""allowed\"" 1 drink at the bar per ID.... even though the waitress at the table took at least 45 minutes between rounds..... yeah,  NEVER going back to this establishment."
1,"My husband and I have been here before and LOVED the food. One star warranted because \n\n1. The line is ridiculous. Even with 4 people in front of you, be prepared to wait over an hour &\n2. No one under 21 can eat here! WTF... Okay what? Like WHAT?\n\nThis trip my husband, 13 year old daughter and I came ALL THE WAY OFF STRIP for this place... WAITED in line for about 40 minutes, which hadn't moved in the 40 minutes we were standing there, when someone came and told us we'd have to leave because you have to be 21 to eat there. YES. You read that correctly. \n\nNever going back WITH or WITHOUT my kids. Ever."
1,"We have been here few times and never in my life have I been in a place of business that blatantly targets a table of paying customers for their race and their heritage. A group of us sat, not bothering anyone, trying to have dinner, when we were attacked by the owner of the restaurant for being Asian. When we called him out on it, he just continued on. He even finished the night by saying \"" I will be here next week but that table won't be.\"" What a terrible waste of space."
1,"Disappointed... Went in with a friend, my coffee was quite bitter, and the service was unpleasant. It took 30 min to get our sandwhich while other customers walked out with their food in hand. This is my second bad experience so I doubt I will be returning. :("
1,Food was terrible. Do yourself a favor and head 1 block south to four peaks. This place will probably be shut down in 3 months.
1,"I would give them zero stars if it were possible. \n\nMy wife tore her ACL on a Saturday, went to the ER. Visited her PCP the following business day to get a referral.  SW Medical sent her here. They initially told her they couldn't see her until FOUR MONTHS LATER!!!! I fought through their BS after hours of hold times and finally got an appointment to see someone three weeks after the injury, only to have them cancel on her the business day before the appointment. What A-holes! They pretty much told us to go F ourselves....What is the reason you ask for cancelling? Apparently, they aren't contracted with the ER that she went to (even though our insurance is) and that is where the HMO sent us-so they refused to treat her. \n\nIn a way this review is unfair because she never actually got to see any of their doctors, but I am just giving you the facts of what happened and how terribly we were treated by the staff. I have worked for 13 years in healthcare and have never had an office treat me or any of the patients I work with so poorly.\n\nWe contacted our insurance and found another orthopedist who was happy to take our carrier and was able to get her in ASAP, so if your insurance tells you that Nevada  Othopedic and Spine Center is where you should go, tell them to give you other options to avoid a terrible experience like ours."
1,"Pizza quality never disappoints.  However, servers need to tie their hair back... same memory of the location by Mill Avenue.  Basic hygiene, please!"
1,"Terrible. Sergios installed sod at my house and didn't bring a roller. The \""crew\"" didn't even know what one was. When I called the office they told me another crew would come later in the day to roll it. I went ahead and paid. Big mistake. They never came back. The job came out terribly.  When I tried to follow up they ignore my messages. I recommend going with someone who's more honest and reputable."
1,"We went to Buddy V's for a late lunch around 2:30. The restaurant was less than half full, plenty of seating, no wait. There were 4 of us, with two more on the way. The not so pleasant manager said they do not sit incomplete parties...are you joking, there were so many open tables!! We said we'd like to be seated to order drinks, they refused. So we waited a few minutes, went back up to the host stand asked if they really couldn't seat us with all the open tables, it seemed a little ridiculous.  Still a very rude no. We left went to another Venetian Italian restaurant, got seated right away.  Will never go back, horrible service. I understand if your busy, but they weren't, just very rude and unaccomadating."
1,"the 1-star rating is based on my one and only visit, so take it w/ a grain of salt.\n\ni ordered the spic basil chicken lunch special which included a choice of white or fried rice (went with white) and soup or salad (went w/ egg drop soup).\n\negg drop soup was ok but the peas and carrots in the soup were horrible. they just didn't taste real.\n\nthe spicy basil chicken was indeed spicy (on a 1-5 spicy scale, i ordered a 3) but did not have a hint of basil in it.  it just tasted horribly.  \n\non a good note (which earned it the 1-star), their thai tea was good.\n\ni wouldn't call this place thai...far from it. most of the food on their menu is chinese."
1,"Then you guys call me liars. Great way to handle yourselves professionally, I bought 2 drinks and some cheese sticks which I PAID FOR. the inexperienced \""emoloyees\"" are your real problem. You OFFER me a hit of your ice bowl gimmick  then try and make me pay for it. What a joke."
1,Where is 2470 W Happy Valley Rd.  It's not near the large 2480 number on the building in the middle of the block on the north side of the street.
1,"I WILL NOT BE GOING BACK.  My insurance covers a standard exam, including dilation.  When I got there, the attendant gave me paperwork to sign which included an agreement to have an electronic scan instead of dilation for an extra $39.00.  Both her and the paperwork made it sound like it was basically mandatory.  I had to fill out a form declining it and tell two attendants that I did not want to pay extra.  When I went to the doctor, she told me my eyes were \""healthy\"" and I didn't need that portion of the exam, even though I've had it every other time I've been to an optometrist.  \n\nFinally, they REFUSED to tell my inter-pupilary distance.  I asked the doctor and she said that the eyeware people would not let her tell me.  I asked the eyeware people and they said the doctor wouldn't let them tell me.  Finally, after making a few fake excuses, the doctor told me that they didn't want people to know because they didn't want them to be able to order online."
1,"Up until Friday, this salon was my favorite. Unfortunately, I will not be back. I asked for the upgraded callous removal which I have successfully received in the past. My female nail tech went so far that I have raw, scabbed toes and heel...only on my right foot. Tom was my favorite tech but he was unavailable, even when I asked for him for my appointment. \n\nNice shop with pleasant staff but one tech ruined it for me."
1,"Me and my mom came at about 2pm to grab a late lunch before picking up my son from school. We didn't take long to order since we already know what we want to eat. We took a quick glance at their menu and I told the waitress to serve me the spiciest sushi roll that they have. My mom ordered a simple Teriyaki Chicken off their Lunch Special Menu.\n\n15 minutes later, my order came. My sushi was not really that spicy. But it's ok. I liked the fact that the slices were kind of thin, so I don't look like a starved panda when I eat it. LOL Not sure if that was a coincidence, or they really serve them like that.\n\nI finished my meal but my mom's order hasn't even came yet. She was really getting pissed at this point. Since it's a late lunch, and the fact that we ordered pretty quick, having to wait 30 minutes for food is really inconvenient, to say the least.\n\nShe decided to cancel her order and we left with no TIP. I feel bad but I can't really justify the service out here. Since it's 2pm, there were only 3 tables occupied in there, including us, and the other tables had 2-4 people in it. \n\nI'm not coming back here and I wouldn't even recommend anyone to this place.\nIt's just that bad :("
1,"AVOID ALL the Walgreens on the Strip!! They are nothing but TOURIST GOUGING BUSINESS'S & not your neighborhood store you may be accustomed to. For Example:\n\n I went into this store & brought my Arizona Iced Tea & pack of .99 cashews to the register & told the clerk \""The Iced tea is on sale this week\"". She then asked if I had the coupon. I told her NO & asked her dont you have a Sales paper for this week?\"" She answered \""NO.\""\n\nWTF?!! I then pulled out a reciept I just happened to have from a store I was at on Maryland blvd & showed it to her explaining that I DID NOT have a coupon then either and the store had a sales paper to accomodate me. She said she couldnt help me. I told her get the mgr.\n\nThe mgr came and explained that I needed to have a coupon. I showed her my reciept and told her I've NEVER heard of a Walgreens that didnt have a sales paper to accomodate customers and went on to say QUITE LOUDLY that all they were doing was \""gouging tourist\"" by not honoring their weekly sales paper or making it available.\n\nI left and will NEVER solicite any of these STRIP stores ever again & I will be venting with Walgreens mgmt via the 1800-763-0547 number.\n\nAvoid these STRIP stores at all cost!!"
1,"Where to start , I called for my birthday to make reservations for a party of 6 and was told by the rude hostess  that I couldn't get my party in until 1030 As they had other big tables that night I said that would be fine as we were gonna be dtown anyways. We showed up on time and told the again rude hostess that we had one more she told me we would then have to wait for another table to open up I replied we had one more and a few weren't even eating we could squeeze them in she told me no and with a bad attitude told me I could juSt talk to her manager if I didn't like it I told her I would the manager came up already with the same bad attitude as the hostess and told us to bad. I told her also some weren't eating and we could squeeze them she said no so when asked how long we would have to wait she told me well I don't know with a face like I was stupid for asking. I told them I didn't want the tAble and would take my party of 8else where. To bad we drink and would of spent money a loss on their part"
1,"so i wake up from my power nap with a super craving for chicken enchiladas. after talking my boyfriend into going with me on the epic hunt for food we take a drive to super Burrito i have never had before). Upon arrival we ordered a carne asada burrito, an order of beef enchiladas (for him) , and an order of chicken enchiladas (for me) with a medium coke. Pulling up to the window we wait and then receive our food. We stopped a few more places after that at the request of the boy and by the time we arrived back i sweating and breathing heavier than a fat girl at a chili fest. I opened the first take out box to find.....beef enchiladas. I opened the second box and found......CHEESE!?!?!? I definitely did not order cheese, that's like going to a burger place and being handed a bun with a slice of cheese. Wheres my damn patty?!?! So here i sit still hungry and now super aggravated."
1,"We were thrilled to finally get a Cafe Rio in our area.  However, after several visits we are ready to say goodbye to our new location and travel back to the Stephanie or Eastern locations.  The service here is horrible, the restaurant is freezing cold and the food is less than mediocre.  The servers are rude and when I ask for extra pico, I am treated like I am asking for something impossible!  \n\nIt is time for management to step-up and take control and make some much needed changes!!!"
1,"Well. We went here.\n\nWe were greeted by 2 peppy and upbeat cute 20something girls. We were expecting that to be the case when we were sat.\n\nStill waiting.\n\nStill waiting.\n\nStill waiting.\n\nI am not lying one bit when I say, we waited 18 minutes and not ONE person came to greet us, serve us water or even acknowledge us.\n\nWe left after waiting 18 minutes for someone to come over. When we walked out the same 2 girls said, \""bye, thanks for coming. How was everything?\""\n\nI literally walked out the door with my friend as our other friend filed a complaint.\n\nThey did NOTHING to get us back to eat there, NOTHING.\n\nThis happened around 2-3PM this past Sunday, 7/9/2012."
1,Do not order sushi from here. The rolls are 3km in diameter and the soy sauce is so salty you may dehydrate on the spot. They use chicken fried rice in their sushi  Chow mein is also questionable. Save your money and your taste buds.
1,"I would write a \""0\"" review if I could. I cannot review the food. I did not get a chance to eat there. Me and my Hawaiian friend went there to grab what I heard was some great Indian food, during one of the \""Unblurred\"" Friday evenings. The concierge looked at us disdainfully, and was talking about how the 3-4 empty tables we saw was reserved. No \""reserved\"" signs were in sight on these tables and dude did not mention when any seating would be freed up. \n\nWhether or not he was prick or or a racist prick, I have no idea. He seemed more interested in getting us out of there than he was in trying to serve us. It is Garfield, so may be he has had issues with the local denizens causing trouble, who happen to look like me. Dunno. All the white people get to eat, we do not? \n\nWith the exception of the Awesome Spak Brothers, I would not bother eating anything on Penn Avenue. Ever. I spend more time focusing on the surrounding crap than I do with actually eating."
1,"This is not a place I will return.  They are not very friendly and when you make a request for a design, they look at you like you're crazy.  My designs came out absolutely horrid and I ended up just going somewhere else for a new polish."
1,"I must have caught them on a baaaddd day because all I have to say is \""YUCK\"" and waste of money with their chewy food. Felt like I walked in to a gas station and ordered chewing gum.  Overpriced for the quality of food.  Threw 90% of it away."
1,"I was extremely excited to check this NEW restaurant out. I was craving BBQ and their menu was very enticing on-line.  I stopped in on a Sat night at 8:30 and it was pretty quiet.  Great menu options but very poor food, I had a combo plate with rubbery texture ribs  YUCK! and my Hubby had the pulled pork sand which was tasteless.  I would prob not go back.  Stacy's BBQ in Phx is much better as well as The Pitt's Again in Glendale.  Sugarbowl next door made up for the horrid meal."
1,I have shopped here off & on for years. I am always amazed I return due to the awful service & attitudes but with so few Needlework shops in Phoenix I have bit my tongue & gone.  I recently inquired about a Special Order Canvas for my Birthday. I FB them & called both. After 2 weeks of trying to get them to help me they responded by leaving me a phone message stating they had No Idea what canvas I was talking about. I have ordered from them before. The canvases are hundreds of dollars & I fail to see where the confusion came in considering I had Put the comeplete title & artist in my facebook message. I have ordered the canvas elsewhere. I don't know if it is just me they seem to dislike without knowing me or if it is just being outside the clique that is the issue. Order online unless your a Stepford Sticher.
1,"I came here years ago to see Henry Rollins Spoken word. (Totally awesome by the way: five stars.) The seats here though were absolutely HORRENDOUS! Now I'm 5'11\"" so I'm used to not having a lot of leg room so I'm used to sitting sideways so my knees aren't banging into the seat in from of me. Here, legs to the side and I'm still rammed up against the next row. It was like being in a three hour yoga pose. \n\nI have never before and never since seen rows of seats so close to eat other. Only my sister in law could sit comfortably and she's 5'1\"". Come on Celebrity Theatre, just a couple more inches. Size really does matter. If anyone told you otherwise, they were lying."
1,"Nancy Erdmann was very rude and insensitive. I felt rushed.  Sadly, I'm someone that's going through a tough time health wise and I'm just looking for a good doctor to listen and help me.  The search continues..."
1,The food was good ... the service at this location is HORRIBLE. They are slow never check in with your table and take forever to bring something once you ask for it. Never coming back to this location. Going back to the one on DI their service is amazing and the atmosphere is so much nicer.
1,"Don't do it. Just don't. You're better of with some frozen boxes out of the freezer section of the grocery store. \n\nOur dish was half hot, warm in the middle, and cold on the other side. The dessert was stale and bland. \n\nBF was BLOATED like he was in his third trimester and miserable for TWO days after. Ew."
1,"I went here in a Saturday afternoon and I have to say it was a mistake. \n\nThe beer was stale, soapy, and flat. The food was bad and our waitress was just slow. \n\nI have nothing positive to say about The Comedy Club."
1,"We hear the food is fabo. We'll never know. We made a reservation one week ahead for a party of 6. We watched a party of 7 be seated in front of us (assume they had a res, too). We were repeatedly lied to by the hostess. She even told us our table was about to free up because the folks eating there \""just paid their check.\"" Turns out no one was paying. She was lying to everyone there. We've eaten all over the world and never seen anything like this. Quite weird. We took our $ elsewhere."
1,"Customer service is left to be desired to top a less than average bakery. We have now been there a few times, always wanting to give them another chance, but after they decline to honor a coupon that allegedly expired 11 hrs prior (rather than 13 hrs later, who puts a time on their coupons BTW) and offered no apology of any kind, we definitely just won't be back, not worth it."
1,"This is more than a yogurt bar. They've got burgers and apparently waffles. The air was heavy with oil when I walked in.\nI like to try several favors when I visit a yogurt bar. My first attempt was the mango sorbet. When I pulled the trigger a bunch of thick liquid globbed out. We asked about the sugar free \""dairy free\"" vanilla and the cashier proceeded to tell us it's not really dairy free. \nThe flavors of my selection were disappointing.\nThis was the worst yogurt bar experience I've had."
1,"Never thought I would be writing a review for a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. I have worked for them in the past as a supervisor and have worked at several other cafes so I am typically pretty lenient and sympathetic with all baristas in the world.\n\nHaving said that, my girlfriend and I wanted to grab some coffee for the road before checking out from the hotel. They had one girl as an expeditor taking orders to speed up the line. We ordered a reg hazelnut IB and a lg Orchard Peach iced tea. We paid and stepped aside to wait for our drinks. We received two reg sized drinks. No big deal- we let the barista know we had ordered a large iced tea.\n\nConflict resolution at a coffee shop is quite simple. The cost of avoiding an argument and satisfying a customer far outweighs the cost of remaking their order.\n\nHowever, the employee here who decided to give us attitude, state that we had paid for a regular (regardless of the expeditor coming over and letting her know she had took the order for a large), and walked away after giving us back the regular sized tea obviously does not share my views.\n\nSo double and triple check your order when you ring up everyone, cus they will NOT fix it for you."
1,"I have been to this place plenty of times. I have always had good meals and service. But tonight was bad. I went ther with my wife's work friends. We sat at the bar tables and had a bartender named Bo(very red hair)   We had About 8 people and he insisted that if we sit at the tables we have to order food, which we had planned to do. He seemed annoyed with us because we just ordered fried oysters and lots of drinks(it was Friday and happy hour, so we were sitting around chatting and drinking)  we were actually going to order an entre and stay for dinner but Bo seemed very disinterested in us, until it came time to pay the bill, then he was really nice(tip time! Overall the food is good there, but Bo did not make it a pleasant experience. Smile Bo, it will get you far in life!"
1,"The food was pretty good, but there was a hair in my sandwich. I obviously couldn't finish, I was very disappointed!"
1,"When my fiance dropped off ten items to be cleaned at the Gilbert location on Val Vista, he was quoted $4.25 per item. At pick up, the price had increased 20%. Not only that, a $300.00 shirt was spotted with grease. We will not be using this location again."
1,"I had a pretty good time at this place soon after it opened.  The music was really good.\n\nCut to a year later- I spent 6 months planning my sister's bachelorette party in Vegas.  We went all out.  I decided on Tryst for our last night in Vegas and called a month ahead to reserve a table.  The manager said \""no problem\"" and took my name.  This was the first time I reserved a table at a bar and didn't have to put down a credit card- weird.  Well, I found out why we didn't need a credit card, when 8 of us arrived we passed up the line and were told at the door that they didn't have our reservation.  I called the idiot I booked with and he finally returned my call an hour later mumbling about being sorry.  No \""sorry\"" would ever make up for that, I had 8 girls wondering what the hell was going on, plus the night was ruined for my sister- which I can't stand to think about.  I can't redo a bachelorette party\n\nThere are a lot of nightclubs to choose from in Vegas!  I trusted this place to take care of us, we got f**ked. \n\nNow I am planning my cousins big birthday weekend.  Do you think I will suggest Tryst?"
1,"To the owners of NYW,\n\nI have been here before and I know you're about equal too but NOT better than BASHA'S fine bakeries for half your prices...however...you read the parts on YELP reviews where people say, \""the counter help is depressing\""...(?)\n\n...  and that's why I will never set foot into your 1950's dirty attempt to be a New York qualified establishment  in the respectful town of SUN CITY.\n\nThe OWNER, heavy female with glasses, mid 50's, has all kinds of issues with customer service and it figures the employees imitate her!!!!\n\nNew York...NO! \nLike with the PIZZA, give up the ruse."
1,"Not sure what they are serving here but being from Texas I wouldn't call this barbecue.  The pulled pork is very light on smoke flavor and our pork had no bark at all.  A sure sign of short cut smoking procedures.  The \""brisket\"" was a cut I have never seen before.  More of a roast cut.  The brisket got its flavor from a brine that the meat was swimming in.  \n\nService was slooooow.  We waited almost an hour on a Tuesday for our meals.  Why?  This stuff is already cooked!   Come on.  Throw it on a plate and roll it out.  \n\nOur waitress seemed bothered to have to wait on us on a TUESDAY.  There might have been 15 people in the place tops. \n\nThis was my one and only trip to this \""BBQ\"" establishment."
1,"And by one star mean no stars!  Mediocre ice cream, it's cold and icy, but lacks in creamy deliciousness. The \""bottled water\"" is simply tap water in a reused bottle. Total rip off."
1,"I've been a loyal Home Depot customer for years, and this is by far the worst one I've been to in the country. I just bought a home in the area and have been to this particular location dozens of times over the last 10 months. The staff is in not knowledgable, helpful, or responsive. It's extremely disappointing, to say the least."
1,"ordered online...got there at time I requested and they said they just got order. The pizza was burnt and the rest a wet soggy mess..when I talked to kitchen manager I was informed that it is the fault of ordering a thin crust and vegatarian. Yes they gave me a credit...Only an apology when I mentioned I had not received one,,,only excuses."
1,"I ordered delivery after a long day on campus and it cost $13 for a gyro, fries and a soda. I normally don't mind paying the extra cash for a delicious meal but the fries were room temperature by the time I got them and the gyro was just okay. This meal was not worth the money. I will not be returning to this place."
1,"Oh boy.... this time they really saw the last of me.... one time I waited 3 hrs for an oil change. Never went back. Today we stopped to inquire about changing our car. 600+ credit score didn't help. They came back with a ridiculous 13% APR. No deal but the leasing option was acceptable. However, we asked to FIRST see the car. They had to bring it from another dealer.... but... they wouldn't bring it unless they had a commitment from us to take it. All was cool with Monica until Mr. Big shot manager David Culp came over and loudmouthed us. So, we can't see the car unless we commit to buy it?\"" --- \""That's riiiii - iiiight\"", he said .... hahaha... who do you think you're dealing with little man? This guy is a big turnoff. We will never go back there courtesy of Mr.Culp. I know that car salesmen aren't the most courteous in the world but Culp takes the cake."
1,"I am not quick to give a restaurant a bad review, especially smaller local restaurants. I usually give second chances but this place was outright horrible! This place has bad, awkward, rude service & the food was between mediocre & bad. The menu said \""make any wrap vegan!\"" so I asked what that was about and the guy answered \""vegans don't eat meat or cheese so we'll just take out the meat & cheese\"" and I asked \""so you dont have vegan subsitutes?\"" He said, \""oh fake meat? No\"". This was such a rude & weird response! I was offended & I'm not even vegan! Don't fake and act like your restaurant is vegan friendly when its not & then mock the vegan diet on top of it! This place is just weird. No thanks."
1,"Epitome of \""Ghetto\"".\n\nIf you do plan to stay here, please don't have high expectations. They say that this hotel is 5 stars, pleeaase dont believe it. Don't expect a flat screen tv and don't expect your sheets to be changed! It feels like you went back to the 70s. The room was so small and so was everything else in the room. The beds are not at all comfortable, it is the first time i ever woken up with a sore back. The service and the manager could not care less about you, so if your expecting some \""great\"" service, please save your money for a better hotel. The buffet was bad, i feel like i wasted my 29.99+ tax. There is no wifi, you can only get connection through a telephone wire and they will charge you if you use more than one laptop. The pool was small and it seemed dirty ek.... the casino was small compare to the other hotels, not so many bars, so your forced to go outside.\n\nThe only good thing of this hotel is the location, right in the middle of Las Vegas Strip, so if your into partying it hard and getting no sleep this is your hotel."
1,It might be time to get rid of Time Warner and Road Runner. No email service today since before 8am and they are unable to say when their problems will be fixed. It seems I am on the phone weekly asking about email and/or internet issues. The worst and least reliable service ever! After 15 years with TWC... it's time to go.
1,"Last evening, we went to an event here and I had purchased 5 tickets through groupon. I admittedly made the mistake of buying one for the wrong date for my child for a circus. I called once I noticed the mistake and was told I would have to purchase another one. I asked if the general manager( their boss) could call me back ( she never did.) Then when we arrived at the event they again said we would have to buy another ticket and at that point the general manager stepped in.  I asked why I had to pay again when they had already gotten paid for the ticket and that the event was over 1/4 unsold so they clearly had extra tickets!!!! ISN'T THAT STEALING PEOPLES MONEY!!!! THIS PLACE HAS EXTREMELY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING IT WAS A TICKET FOR A CHILD FOR A CIRCUS!!!!!"
1,Poop. Poor service. Poor staffing. Had an issue there about a month when.........finally someone spoke with me he was a total jerkoff for lack of a better word. Almost certain his last name was Corona.
1,"Breakfast was decidedly underwhelming. My husband's bfast sandwich was average at best and my egg burrito was the worst I have ever had. The eggs were burned, almost black, and tough. How do u make eggs tough??? Service also horrible. The guy serving us was not familiar with the menu, we had to flag him down for more coffee, and would someone please buy him a personality?!"
1,My daughter and I ate sushi there last Friday night and came down with a terrible case of salmonella food poisoning!!!  This place needs to close ASAP!!!\n\nYOU risk your life if you EAT THERE!!!  BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,This place sucks. Was told to avoid hour and a half wait to go in the lounge. Sat at a dirty table (only one available) and was totally ignored for 15 minutes so we left. Never again.
1,"After reading some of the reviews I thought this pizza joint would be a good choice, but was totally wrong. I ordered a 14\"" pizza with fresh tomatoes and a Greek salad. The pizza was extremely bland, absolutely no flavor!!! The salad was also bland and soggy so, I couldn't enjoy that either. Waste of twenty bucks!!! I would not recommend this place to anyone or ever come back."
1,Filiberto food with high restaurant prices. Tried it once before and thought maybe I got something bad. But I was wrong. This is just average mexican good posing as fine food. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good Mexican food. I would recommend restaurant Mexico on mill if you want great Mexican food that doesn't try to church up it's prices
1,"Was excited to try this place because it had great reviews. However, we were really unimpressed. First of all the waitresses argued over which one was actually going to wait on us, after we had already been waiting for quiet sometime. The waitress barely understood basic English. My husband ordered no beans with his meal and I got no beans with mine which I wanted. My husband said his chicken enchiladas tasted like chicken from a can. I wasn't impressed with my meal as well. We ordered fried ice cream for Desert and it wasn't good at all the ice cream was hard as a rock and couldn't even spoon it apart. Don't think we will be returning."
1,"The fries are the best.  This place just isn't as clean as it used to be, starting to look like a Chinese buffet. They have changed managers a lot since they opened."
1,"Food tasted like if it had been reheated in the microwave. The only good thing about this place were the chips and salsa. Food didn't have much taste, but did make me feel sick later in the evening (perhaps because it's not fresh). I know Mexican food isn't the easiest to digest, but my stomach should be able to handle it since I've been eating it since I was born! This is definitely a no go for me."
1,I tried pumping gas at one of the pumps and the machine was malfunctioning. I notified the attendant who at first blew me off then when I insisted that the machine be reset so that no one could get free gas on my card told me to wait 5-10 mins then it will reset. When I told her I don't want any purchases on my card that I didn't make so if it happens I will let them know she starts yelling at me saying she is not responsible for any extra purchases made on my card and that maybe now on I should go to a different gas station for my gas. This was extremely embarrassing because she is yelling and other patrons are staring at us at this point. When I walk away she then continues to complain about me and showing other customers that the machines work! By far the worst experience I have ever had at a gas station. If I could leave zero stars that would be my true rating.
1,The broth is weak and there's a funny taste in the meatballs. The one on rainbow used to be one of my favorites. The food quality and flavor have really slipped with the expansion. Much better Pho one block either way.
1,"I probably shouldn't review PF Changs, but feel it's my civic duty to warn anyone who still believes this is \""Chinese\"" food, it's fusion, pretty Americanized and for whatever reason, always gives me the runs. ALWAYS! It's probably me, and you would think I have learned my lesson, but I try every so often to see if my stomach can handle it and every time, PF Chang's you bastard, you beat me."
1,"This place is a disaster!  The prices do not reflect the poor quality of the food.  I ordered the rib eye steak and it was ultra thin, gritty, and overcooked and it was topped with a sauce that did not complement the rest of the meal.  The steak was no better than what you would receive at Denny's at 2 AM in the morning.  This place is way over priced and the food flat out sucks.  Todd English needs to re-evaluate the direction of Olives.  I felt this way the first time around and I didn't say anything, but after my second visit to the restaurant I couldn't let my disappointment in the cuisine slide.  The public needs to know that this restaurant is a rip off.   If you want good food go to BOAS or the Stratosphere."
1,I think this place has closed. Couldn't find it and ended up at Cheeba Hut. I think it was in the same strip mall?? Cheeba Hut was great though!
1,"After getting diarrhea from eating the mediocre Mongolian Beef here, I think I would avoid any future contact with this establishment."
1,"Pamela's is an abomination of a breakfast place that represents the worst of everything.  However, to make up for the food being awful, you will have to wait on line for 20 minutes and then dine in cramped and uncomfortable seating.\n\nIt is, for some reason, unfathomably popular.  The best thing on the menu is their crepe-like pancakes, which are nicely crisped on the edges.  They are nicely crisped on the edges because they are cooked in a disgusting margarine-like substance that always leaves me, personally, feeling a bit ill.  The coffee is forgettable, the eggs are passable, the bacon is inevitably chewy -- which right there should cause someone to be marched out to the firing squad -- and their lyonnaise potatoes are insultingly limp (and, like the pancakes, soaked in margarine).\n\nIf you are dragged here by your friends, find new friends.  If you can't do that, then try to get one of the pancakes that come with some sort of whipped or sour cream.  Not because they're better, mind you, but because at least the cream will help balance the fat that comes from a machine with fat that, at some point in its history, came from a cow.\n\nBetter alternatives to Pamela's in Pittsburgh:  on the 'nice' end, Coca Caf\u00e9 or even Square Caf\u00e9, on the 'greasy spoon' end either DeLuca's or JoJo's.\n\nFrankly, I think I'd rather eat the completely boring and institutional breakfasts at Eat and Park than go to Pamela's again.  At least they have heard of this thing called \""butter.\"""
1,You had to pay $15 per day for Internet access.  The beds were uncomfortable.  The room keys did not work in the parking garage even though they claimed to fix them twice.  The bar us hideously overpriced.\n\nWant a sode in the middle of the night?  Gotta buy it from the gift store before it closes.  1 coke = $300.  \n\nI will NEVER be back.
1,"No no no no no. NO!\nSaw this with my friends on Saturday (5/31/14). We decided it would be fun to see a traditional Vegas showgirl performance, and, well, Jubilee! is apparently the only one left.\n\nLack of competition should be no excuse for the mess that we saw. Oh Lord!\nFirst of all, we bought discount tickets and my friends each said that the show wasn't even worth the 50% markdown. I didn't mind as much, because I was intoxicated and at least got a good laugh.\n\nThis review is not a criticism of the talent. Most of the performers were fit and good at what they did, although there were a few outliers... \n\nThere were a few scenes that had all the pomp and circumstance that I expected, like the Samson and Delilah scene... and the finale.\n\nBut overall there were waaaay too many males onstage (is that normal? Idk but it was unexpected), and it was SO SO disjointed. The show was just a thrown together mess of scenes- all over the place chronologically, not enough showgirl stuff, and some of the most God-awful music.\n\nThe classic recognizable songs were okay, but often matched to boring and redundant choreography.  The Beyonce references were random and irrelevant, which is sad because I am a Beyonce fan.\n\nAll in all, it was very much a middle-school caliber show in terms of plot/theme/cohesiveness, which is not Vegas-appropriate, to say the least.\n\nI sincerely hope someone steps in and fixes this mess because it would be SO sad if the showgirl went extinct! Help!"
1,Sucked. \n\nWe went there specifically to order the Breakfast Sandwich and were told they were out of the ingredients to make them (at 10:00am on a Saturday???). \n\nThey kids menu was $4.99 and consisted of a drink and one big cold and dry pancake. \n\nIt took 45 minutes for them to bring out our order. The waitress stopped by after 30 minutes and apologized. She said there was a large party in the back room that was wrapping up and they would get to our order soon...ugh. \n\nI asked her if I could change my order and she said she would go into the kitchen to see if they had started it yet...and never did. She went to the next table and hugged a group of her friends that had come in and talked to them for 10 minutes. After finally seeing I was giving her the stink eye she went into the kitchen and came back out to tell me that they had started my order (no crap lady). \n\nEverything was VERY run of the mill and we won't be back.
1,"Shame on International Marketplace,\nthey erase and create their own expiration\ndates on some of the food products.\nI confronted them on this, they were speechless\nwhen I removed an expiration date sticker\nshow the item was already expired!!\n\nThey also have the worse customer service I have\never seen!!!\n\nAlso beware of the filipino aisle, most snacks are expired, and they have no expiration dates!"
1,"Just came back from there, and was pretty disappointed. \n\nThe inside dining area was a wreck (dirty tables, food on the floor, table side order phones out of order, etc).  They weren't particularly busy, and several employees were hanging around talking to one another.\n\nMy food came out relatively quickly, but was not complete, and even after alerting them of this and waiting on them, I had to remind them five minutes later to give me my missing items, at which point they seemed even more confused. \n\nTo top it off, the restroom was filthy and there were no paper towels, and I even saw an employee go in and use the restroom, and come out without remedying the situation...hope he at least washed his hands :/\nGiven the state of this place, I have to wonder. \n\nI want to like this place, but it scored an F on this visit.  \nFast food doesn't have to be messy, crummy, and lacking in service...just look at chick-fil-a."
1,"Subs are okay. A little better than Subway but priced much higher.\n\nBut here's why they get 1 star: I paid $30 for 3 adults and a child, which is fine. A little high, but whatever. I didn't leave a tip because I didn't feel one was warranted. \n\nThe guy taking my payment (or another employee) obviously didn't agree because today, on my bank statement, there is an initial authorization for $30 and a final charge of $33. So they gave themselves a $3 tip without my authorization.\n\nI sent a message through the site and have received no response. That was about 7 hours ago."
1,"I'm absolutely APPALLED at this Taco Bell! I used to actually frequent it rather often, but went on a bit of a fast food hiatus. I had a craving for Taco Bell and thought, \""why not?\""\n\nOh, I found out \""why not\"" in short order! First- the wait at the drive through was kind of ridiculous. Not just sitting in the line of cars, but once I'd placed my order, I sat at the window for quite awhile waiting for the food to be ready. When you're hungry and in a hurry, that's not the best thing. It is called \""fast food\"" for a reason, right? Apparently not here.\n\nOk, food obtained. I get home, get settled, and go to open the mini chicken quesadilla. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? First of all, the cheese is so melted that I can barely unrwrap the aluminum foil. Once I do get it open...my stomach lurched. The pile of BURNED, gooey, mess that is in the foil is absolutely disgusting. I can't believe that anyone thought it was a good idea to pass this off as food and serve it to anyone. I took (and posted) a picture, but it went straight into the garbage.\n\nThe chalupa was luckily in good shape, and the only reason this wouldn't get a ZERO star review. (other than the fact that we can't award zero stars here).  Obviously, I won't be returning."
1,They are the biggest and one of the better looking among the modest restaurants in Terminal 4 B gates. The big pig on the wall with the retro typeface tries to subvert the overwhelming and inescapable airport food court vibe.\n\n\nThe waitress was friendly and the service was prompt.\n\nI ordered a grilled cheese with tomato soup. The cheese was just tasteless and the soup was more salty than if it had come out of a can. I asked for coffee to go and it was barely lukewarm - made me think if the service was really as genuine as you can expect at an airport eatery.\n\nI will remember this place enough to not go there the next time I fly to Vegas through that airport.
1,"I wouldn't stay here again, ever. I was in town for a technology conference and the Internet didn't work in the conference area or in the rooms. It was very spotty wireless and wired. The room decor  was very dated. But here's the worst: First morning my sinks back up while shaving. One sink backed up with my water and the other backed up simultaneously with a black smelly liquid. I also complained about the lack of seal at the bottom of the connecting door between my suite and the one next door. I could hear everything in that room like it was happening in mine. (Imagine that) I insisted on being moved to a new room. In the new room on my last morning... I hear a gurgling noise and then smell something foul. I walk into the bathroom to see black liquid coming up through the shower drain. I reported it on check out and they didn't seem to care. Any other hotel would have tried to make it right. Not these guy... Harrahs should be ashamed of this property."
1,"I've stayed at most of the hotels on the strip, but Bally's has been one of the worst hotels I've been in.\n\n- It's the oldest looking with air bubble filled wall paper and crusty chipped paint. \n- They try to charge you $16 if you checkin before 4pm.\n- All the other hotels always had toothpaste and other amenities, Bally's doesn't\n- Furniture is from the 80's\n\nThe regular room at Palms Place makes the Suites at Bally's look like a joke."
1,"Nice 50's atmosphere albeit noisy. Had breakfast of eggs, ham and \""home fries.\"" Potatoes were frozen from a bag, not fresh. Biscuits were frozen from a bag. Service was OK. Seems to be popular with the 70+ crowd."
1,"Worse service, we had a bday there and the boss didn't even let us fridge the bday cake says it can be contaminated, but yet any other restaurant would've done it for us, the food was not good, we got the salmon and it literally tasted like they just added soy sauce to it, my friend ordered the glazed salmon and it tasted bad for her as well.  The only part that we might have liked was the appetizer fish sushi, not recommended and definitely my first and last time there, last but not least the bill came out to 800!! I could've had better food and service at Mcds"
1,"This place kills me, it really does. I fell in love with a sad-looking kitten there, only to reach through the bars to pet it and find it sickeningly skinny. I *really* don't need another cat, but I was all set to rescue this little girl, because I was pretty sure she wouldn't last another week.\nSince there was no signage, I asked the nearest sales person how much the kitten was, and was shocked to find out it was $899.99. For a nearly dead \""pure bred\"" persian that had gunk in it's eyes and was the saddest thing I've ever seen.\n\nIt should be illegal to sell an animal that sick looking. My heart is so broken, knowing that kitten is suffering. I'm terrified to go back to see it. I can't afford it, and I'm beyond frustrated that I can't do anything about it.\n\nThe dogs all looked pretty sad, and their cages weren't clean. The only positive thing about this place, was the man in the bird section that obviously knew a lot about birds and we could tell he really cared. They need more people like him."
1,"Waited for an hour during lunch. They took my order, waited forever, and ended up having to leave without eating because I needed to get back to work."
1,I was there in the afternoon on December 31. Someone took a sharp object to the side of my car and the rear panel. They did $1200 in damage. Called Harkins and wasn't even told by manager that he was sorry. Had to write Harkins to even get an apology.
1,"I've eaten at quite a few waffle houses in my day, so I know not to expect much. They're usually pretty good and this one was about the same. BUT I was VERY disappointed at the service at this place. It took almost 5 minutes just for someone to get our drink order(the place was not busy) and the table was still dirty from the previous customers. I saw 2 employees on their cell phones while cooking food. Another employee was actually walking around talking on her cellphone while working. But the one thing that got me, was seeing 3 employees drinking beverages around the food. One server kept her coffee cup on the tray that held the syrup(which was right by our table). Another server had his on the counter near the stove. And another had hers near the coffee machines and I saw them quite frequently drinking from them. I know this isn't the grandest place the eat, but I was expecting a bit more than how I saw the employees behaving..."
1,"The food was good. The service was horrible. The waitress spoke 10 words if at all to us. She was not happy being there. Manager was walking around but never checked in with us to see how was the food.  I ordered an ice tea and got one glass of it. no refill even after owner/manager passed by table saw the empty glass at the edge of the table 2 times. Waitress brought food, served over empty glass and did not asks us for a refill. The busser passed the table 3 times and saw the empty glass and did not offer more. I had to ask her for some more after that. I had a coupon for dinner and it stipulated that we had to leave 20% tip.. waitress ended up with a tip of around $17.00 for the worst service ever.. very disappointing and vouched not to go back. the restaurant needs a new decor also.. very dated. Save your hard earned money and go somewhere else.."
1,"If you wanna have honestly the WORST wannabe Mexican food in sin city , well go to Diablos !!! Taco Bell food is gourmet compared to this crap ...  I went during happy hour & there's no happy hour food just horrible tasting non discounted margaritas . I ordered a pitcher of mango margaritas & from where I was sitting I saw it being prepared from canned kerns nectar & house tequila instead of the premium tequila from the menu . The nachos were sooo soggy I thought I was eating 2 hour left over nachos from a gas station and the taco platter I orders were beyond tasteless .... I would so not recommend this to anyone unless u don't care but to get drunk on cheap liquor , bad food & HORRIBLE customer service"
1,"Awful service.  Did not get my full order going thru drive thru.  Realized it after I got home.  Drove back and went inside to complain.  The guy actually tied handing me the bag of food that he forgot to give me after it had been sitting there for 20 minutes.  Asked for a refund for compensation, but they refused!"
1,"Before I actually set down and ate I had been feeling pretty pleased with myself.  I saw the huge line, I smelled the delicious smells of French fried potatoes and I also observed all the literature on display about all the awards that Five Guys had won for their famous burgers and fries.  I knew for sure that I would be well fed. Yes, that of course was before I actually took the first bite of my burger.  My dream quickly turned into a nightmare.  My bun was wet with perspiration.  My hamburger had a chunk broken off it and was smashed to smithereens and the cheese on my sandwich was cold.  Another swing and a miss for me and Oakland dining.  How many guys does it take to ruin a lunch 5 hahahaha?"
1,"I don't understand how everyone is giving him 5 stars (unless he's the only one they've been to). I did 4 sessions with him and my tattoo didn't fade one bit. I've been to another lady twice and it was amazing how much it faded. But I bought a groupon for this place for 4 sessions. This first time I asked \""that's it?\"" He went over my tattoo but it was like a kid scribbling on paper, I'm used to my lady going over each line of ink carefully. My tat didn't scab with him or anything. The last 3 sessions I asked him to be more aggressive but he didn't. I kept telling myself he was just trying to get a feel of my skin but, from the first session to the last, it didn't fade one bit. Maybe it's because I had a groupon?  If so then that's not cool, he's wasting everyone's time and money. Sorry for the negative review."
1,"5 years ago when I lived in this area I love the Montana Meat Company.  Sadly, that has changed.  I have dined there twice within the last month and it seems everything has gone south.  Food quality, food portions, service, speed, friendliness... all have grossly deteriorated.  Montana Meat Company is now on my personal list of \""never again's\"", which is not an easy task to accomplish.  If you are in the area and looking for a decent steak there are few options, other than Giuseppe's on the weekends or the Summerlin venues which are a bit further of a drive."
1,This was just bad pizza.  For the money I expect that the toppings will be cooked on the pizza.  The cheese and pepparoni were added after the crust came out.  Also the mushrooms were out of a can.  Do not waste money here.
1,"I told them I was in a hurry and they told me they could \""look at my car right away.\""  So I sat and waited, expecting to see a mechanic pull my car into the garage any minute.  Ten minutes went by and my car was still parked outside the garage.  I started seething, but I continued to wait.  In another ten minutes, I got up and told the mechanic who I'd seen \""looking\"" at my car while writing notes on his frigging clipboard that I was in a hurry and was told my car would be taken care of right away.\n\nHe said something like, \""We're on it, bro.  We'll have you out of here in no time.\""  I bit my tongue and folded my arms and waited another ten minutes.  My car remained untouched.  Finally, I'd had enough, got back in my car, and left.  I won't ever take my car to Purrfect Auto again."
1,"To all those who join Planet Fitness, make sure that you read your contract!!! I thought that my contract automatically ended in 1 year and it did not, according to Planet Fitness your contract renews itself month to month after 1 year; Planet Fitness \""Say\"" that they review your contract with you, and they do not, so make sure you understand your contract!!!"
1,I'm all about the tiki thing and the patio but this place is just trashy. It's obvious that this is first on the list for every guy who just turned 21. Everything had a thin layer of barf on it.
1,yuck.......Is it me or has McDonalds food gotten smaller & grosser?\nI saw they had the McRib making a limited time comeback so I was feeling all nostalgic and thought I'd give it a go.\n\nBig mistake..worse than any school lunch pork patty-by the 3rd bite I was already nauseous. How does McDonalds stay open the food is sooo terrible and its not even cheap anymore.\n\nDo quality food establishment have to have a drive-thru because people have gotten so lazy they will eat any damn thing as long as they don't have to get off their asses to do it.
1,"I found a half-foot strand of thick hair in my Pho Dac Biet. I give props to the waiter for not apologizing and keeping a smile on his face the whole time there. Also accompanied by noisy waiters, dull atmosphere, and crappy foreign music, I could not stay a second longer. If you're a tourist reading this review, let Vietnamese wait until you get home. There are better ways to spend your money in Vegas and gambling is one of them."
1,"It hurts me to give The Bellagio Buffet 1 star, but the food was absolutely horrible. If my husband says the food was bad then it was bad. I had to ask for a fork 3 times because every fork I received was dirty with either dried food and soap scum! The rotisserie chicken was drier than a sponge, the homemade mashed potatoes taste like they were made with spoiled milk and the beef brisket looked like a patio desk, it was completely dried out. \n\nFor $49 at The Bellagio, I expected mouth watering selections and got the total opposite. So if you're hungry and don't care about the taste and it's convenient, then enjoy, but I just wasted $50. \n\nOh and no Crab Legs until 3:30pm and no creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, I'm SO done. The buffet at The Paris hotel tasted MUCH better than The Bellagio. Only gave this review one star because I had to and that goes to the poor waitress Cici! Thanks for a HORRIBLE last meal in Vegas. I won't be back and I do NOT recommend."
1,"Very rude service.  Asked for more sauce for some food and it didn't come till 15 minutes later, after I was done with the meal, I was not told it would be $1.50 more for the sauce until we got the bill.  I don't mind paying for something but it should be told to me ahead of time not at the end of the meal.  Food was salty and the waiter never came by to bring me more water, even after asking for more water.  With 5 adults and 2 kids we were automatically charge a 20% gratuity!  That's not right since the service was not there.  Gratuity should be based on service.  Will NEVER go back there again!"
1,Gross! I decided to try the hotel restaurant this time. It took like 40 minutes to get my food and the pasta sauce tasted like it was canned. I could have microwaved better food in my room.
1,We had high expectations with the good yelp reviews but did not have a good experience.  I ordered my rare bone in fillet and a bunch of appetizers.  The first steak was way overlooked to the extent that I needed to send it back.  They brought out another steak which was cooked well but it was the worst cut of filet mignonette that I've ever had.  There was a fatty gristle everywhere through the steak.  When I asked about this I was gold the chef was extremely insulted that I sent the first steak back.  I ate about half of the second steak but didn't finish because of the strings of fat running through the steak.  I feel like the chef gave me a shitty cut because he was insulted that he overcook end the steak.  The problem is that a $83 steak should be as close to perfect as possible and unfortunately the steak can't be uncooked.
1,Horrible how the hell do you lose my package when I'm less then 10 mins away from your facility? Also the driver marked it was delivered twice for some reason. I wasted a whole day with these people and the weren't even sure if the driver even dropped it off at all and supposed the driver lost it. After a 2 minute call with Amazon they were very familiar with OnTrac's inconsistencies and gave me an instant refund. They ruined my first and last Amazon experience. Looks like I'm going back to eBay and ups.
1,From the moment we entered the building we knew it was a mistake.  The staff was a bunch of kids that didn't appear to be the least bit concerned with offering genuine customer service. The menu was extremely limited and the food was marginal.
1,This review is only for the food and drinks on the patio.  The view is beautiful!  But the food and drinks were lame.  \n\nI used to work here in the late 80's and the kitchen was so filthy that I swore I would never eat there again (food was good back then) - I can tell you stories!\n\nThis past weekend we were at the Renaissance Festival and since my mom lives near the resort  we thought we would give it a try on the way to her house. I don't know if the kitchen is clean (one would hope) but the food quality is definitely poor.
1,"My wife ate at LoLo's, brought home a dinner for me, chicken dinner. The chicken was dry and over cooked, no taste.  This dinner is not cheap, for the money, not worth it."
1,"If you think making an appointment will prevent you from waiting - think again!  This salon is located near my house so I have tried it many times - each time hoping for a better experience.  Unless you are the first one in the door in the morning, plan on waiting.  If you have an appointment, you may even wait longer.  What is frustrating, is they will always tell you that will be a \""few minutes\"" even if the wait is really 40minutes.  The last time I was there,  I had an appointment at 1:00 and wasn't seen until 1:40pm!  When I asked how much longer, the male owner, kept saying, \""few minutes.\""  When I gave him feedback on how it would be really nice if they could be more accurate with how late they are running so people could run to walgreens or come back, he said, \""If you don't like it - go someplace else- we have plenty of business!\""  Since I tip so well, I was shocked at how I was treated.   The fact that my gel polish would ALWAYS come off after only 1 week and the pedicures weren't that great made me wonder why I was even trying to make this nicely located nail salon work for me.  I will never go back!"
1,"I will not return to this burger king Ever! Being new you would think they would have a higher standard. The forgot the fries with the meal order. When the fries did come they tasted like they were cooked the day before, luke warm  stale and card board texture! The two sandwiches I ordered were not much better, they tasted as if they cam from a am pm connivence store! Very disappointed with this location. I wont be back!"
1,"BS \""Bait and Switch\"" 2 for 1 cards being handed out because they are so desperate for business. The rudest most aggressive bartender I have ever encountered in my life. Moved and shoved around so that \""other guests\"" could be accommodated? What? There money is better than mine? I have never felt more unwelcome in an establishment in my life. I'm a Caesars Seven Stars member, they didn't know that, but my casino host is very unhappy with the way I was treated. It takes a lot for me to write a negative review, 99 % of my reviews are positive. I will bet you within a year Fizz, will fizz out. Writing is on the wall."
1,"I wouldn't recommend going here. Apart from very poor service, the food wasn't really great. The only thing good on my plate were the fries. The lady who served us forgot a couple of our drink orders and when she finally did bring them to us, one of them had something floating in it."
1,"Bad. Very bad. I had to walk down 16 flights of stairs yesterday with my luggage. Our toilet didn't work our lights didn't work. And we got stuck in handicap room when all i wanted was a bathtub. \n\nWe waiting to \""complain\"" but the lines were FOREVER long. Just don't go here, avoid at all costs."
1,"The Skinny: Encountered rude staff. \n\nThe Fat: Pit stop, the mall seemed decent but because it's also Arizona, they get a one star anyway. I absolutely hate dealing with rude staff."
1,"the food was good and so was the iced coffee but they really did not want to give me much coffee. the first time i went there i got a regular size iced coffee and it was more like a cup of ice with coffee. it was delicious so i decided to go the following day, i ordered another iced coffee, this time i asked for less ice. when i got my coffee, it was filed up 3/4 way, i asked the cashier sarcastically \""you guys dont fill up the cup\"" and all he told me was \""u asked for less ice\"". it was disappointing, i would look for  new place with good iced coffee because they just dont really want to give you your money's worth,"
1,"Have Big O Bigfoots all around on my truck.  One on the rear came apart on the freeway, the entire tread came off and damaged the rear wheel well and quarter panel.  Tires were still under warranty and I even had extended coverage.  Waited for an hour last week to find they didn't have the tire in the store!   Been about a month since the blowout and getting jerked around by their insurance so feeling like I'm SOL on the damages.  Ahhh insurance companies and lawyers what keeps our country great!"
1,"These people are the worst.  They get a little power over you and they treat you like garbage!!!  They are like Nazis!!  Just mean for no reason.  I hate dealing with them.  Curt and impersonal.  Avoid at all costs!  They like to call themselves a law firm, but they are a collection agency with absolutely no personal touch.  They obviously do not depend on repeat business from anyone they deal with and they show it.  I have never written a review before, but I was compelled to after my last phone call with Christine.  Good luck!"
1,Not review for this location.\n\nThe bathroom was so gross and small. GROSSSSSS! I thought I would give local coffee a support. Too disappointed!
1,"I've been a member for over 3 years but this place has really, really gone downhill. The trash and mess isn't cleaned up until approximately 7 a.m., unfortunately, they're open 3 hours before that and the place is a pit. I just couldn't stand it anymore."
1,"FRESH & EASY has become a JOKE!!!! Advertising \""Specials\"" that are Nonexistent. I've just developed a New \""Pet-Peeve\"" Stores(Fresh & Easy) that don't give \""Rain-Checks\"" for Out-of-Stock items (Advertised Specials) and then when they are OFF SALE they magically reappear on the shelf. But you can pay FULL PRICE again. Example - Tri-Tip Steak Sale $2.99 if you scout around(call) half a dozen stores and find one. Same, Pineapple .99 cents but they're OUT OF STOCK!!! Oh, but they just arrived again...Yay if you want to pay $2.99 and the MANAGER said \""TOUGH LUCK DUDE....RAIN-CHECKS are NOT OUR POLIC\""Y!!! Wow that's a real quote... I'm back to driving a little bit further to Trader Joes where they have some respect for their LOYAL customers!!!!! So, GOOODBYE FRESH-N-EASY I was a LOYALcustomer but now when your stores get boarded up and turn into Trader Joe's or another worthy competitor I won't shed a tear for the FRESH & EASY CORPORATION!!! BYE BYE \""DUDE\"" !!!"
1,I had been here once before and I thought it was okay.. But since it's close I decided to try again and it was awful. The girl was not friendly at all and all she did was gossip with the other lady. I tried asking a question and she was rude. Then she was buffing my toe nails and buffed my skin. It hurt so bad and I had a a cut for awhile after. I would never go back ever.
1,Crime is a problem!  I had my phone and keys stolen from me while I was in the pool at Dowd.  My babysitter had her car broken into in the Dowd parking lot as well. Both of these events took place within the last 2 months.  It is not worth working out at a place where you and your property are unsafe.
1,"We love eating at Chipolte, but this location was the worst experience I have ever had at one of their restaurants. \nThey were out of chips (no chips at a Mexican restaurant?!)\nThey were out of lettuce.\nBlack beans were crunchy (must have just come out of the can).\nBathrooms were gross.\nTables had not been wiped down and cleaned.\nThis was on a Saturday night at 8 pm, so it was inexcusable to not have the basic food items available."
1,"Worst customer service, extremely rude, my wife had a horrible experience and they would not give her the physical copies of the xrays she brought in. They said they would only email her copies. I was scheduled to go in and they canceled my appointment becauSe she left a bad review, without speaking with me or my wife first..... who does that.\n\n**Edit** to your response I can comment on your business because SOMEONE canceled my appointment based on her review not my wife she called and they said they couldn't find my appointment because it was already canceled. So either you are very uninformed with how your business is actually running or lying."
1,Typical buffalo wild wing. A little bigger than normal . Got seated quickly only to have 5 servers walk past us. 3 of which sat and had a conversation what tables they had or didn't. We where the next table over. Waited about 8 minutes until walking out. Servers all seem to be more into talking to each other than working.
1,"I decided to make a last minute trip to LV to join my family celebrating a birthday.  They were staying at the Bellagio for four nights.  I was only going to stay for two nights, and by the time I had decided to go the Bellagio rates were higher than I wanted to pay for given the quick stay over.  Since Planet Hollywood was just across the street from the Bellagio, and the rate seemed reasonable, I decided to stay there.\nI won't say that it was a horrible experience, but I was definitely disappointed.  The rooms are dated and didn't feel exceptionally clean.  The decor has a 1990's vibe to it.  I'm not sure how much of it is carryover from the Aladdin revamp prior, but it wasn't up to what I would consider \""current Strip standards\"".  It seems appropriate that this is Britney Spears anchor arena for her shows - it has a slightly \""trashy\"" feel to it. \nSome of the issues that I had regarding the room were:\n- missing front of one of the drawers\n- strange odor from the faucet water in sink\n- pull chain shades that kept sticking\nI can see being in my 20's and coming here to have a raging time, but those days are a little bit behind me at this point and would rather opt for comfort and modern amenities (like at Aria) than \""just a place to crash\"" at the end of a long night."
1,"I wanted to like this place, but the service was so horrible that it ruined my evening. Our waitress was blond and arrogant and really couldn't be bothered to serve us. She took our food order and then literally never came back. Our starters came and I bugged the delivery waitress for another drink, but soon realized that not only were we not getting our waitress back, but we weren't getting the rest of our food. Finally, after an hour we cancelled the rest and went to find dinner elsewhere. It wasn't just us. The rest of the guests were ignored as the staff sat and chatted among each other. Not worth the time or effort."
1,"This place used to have awesome food.  It was a great buffet.  Then the location changed and I am guessing the cooks did too.  The food was terrible.  Buffets in Las Vegas that are good are slammed with people even the mediocre ones have lines.  This place, was dead at 7 pm on a Wednesday.  We go out to eat on Wednesdays and we sometimes go to Buffets.  When we do go to Buffets they are slammed with people and have long lines.  This place you just walk right on up, pay you money and go grab a plate.  Problem is, is that buffets rely on turn over so the food doesn't just sit under the heat lamps and get old.  This place had nothing but food under the heat lamps that looked old.  They had Prime Rib but every last piece of it was cooked well done.  The whole place was terrible food.  To many good buffets in town with a comparable price to eat here."
1,"This was the biggest ripoff and most terrible Japanese I've ever had, which is disappointing because I live so close. The teriyaki vegetable consisted of STEAMED carrots, cauliflower, and broccoli made from frozen vegetables.  There was a minimal amount of some kind of ginger soy sauce almost sprinkled on. The veggies were floating in water since it appears they were microwaved and barely drained. This was $8 and the worst attempt at a teriyaki dish that I've ever seen. I've never written a review for any restaurant before but I was so turned off by the poor quality of food, especially for the price. Even the rice was below average.  Would not go back."
1,"Parking is a joke, limited seating (especially inside) is among the worst of all popular restaurants in Arizona, and the crowd of college kids and self-styled Mill Ave. area business professional types makes for one annoying dining experience.  I've wondered why the owners bother to choose these locations, especially in areas that have horrible street parking when the daily event of overflowing parking occurs.  You have to realize this ruins the whole experience from the start.   It's all fabricated hype - excessively limit the seating and parking, always have a waitlist, and viola you've created the appearance of overflowing demand.\n\nIf you go immediately when they open you can often get a seat at the bar and then things are tolerable - just get the individual slices with beer and they'll get you in and out of there fast.  You won't have to listen to complicated explanations for why their pizza takes so long.  They also haven't adjusted the music volume up louder and louder yet either, so again... go when they open.  The fried spicy ravioli are tasty, but I'm struggling to say something positive here."
1,"I used to work at the Starbucks across the street from this place, but after a few bites of a friend's General Tso's chicken and the single greasiest mouthful of egg roll I've ever tasted, I refused to order anything but dumplings from this place.  I've seen them pour the dumplings from a bag straight out of the freezer, so I figured the grimy kitchen couldn't infect them too much.  My fried dumplings usually came charred, but I soaked them in sauce and they got me through a lot of closing shifts at the Bucks.  Still, this is the worst Chinese restaurant I've ever been to."
1,"I recant the above mentioned rave on Riverview Toyota.  Paperwork lost multiple times, things wrong with car (like gas cap is broken) have been waiting on that call for 3 weeks now.  (good thing it's good on gas and haven't needed to put gas in it) \nFinally, I speak to the corporate Manager (after multiple calls not returned)  Funding has not occurred yet for some reason, so I took it into my own hands...I'll keep you updated when funding happens...so far there is NO service after the sale though...Damn!!!"
1,"In response to Just J.  Corliss actually sold his business to H&R block last year. Prior to then we had been using him 8 years. All of those years we had perfect service. \n\nSo that being said this is not a rating on Curt himself but H&R block. Because he sold the business name and his customer contacts they keep calling us! They are trying to use his name to drum up business! If you ask them if you can get an appointment with Curt they offer you one with one of their accountants but at no point say they are  in facr H&R block. \n\nCurt told us last year that he sold and was retiring. Last years was a terrible mess. Horrible office service, the office manager was bad but I'm pretty sure they went through a few. \n\nSo don't be fooled folks...this is no longer Curtis' business it belongs to H&R block and they suck. DO NOT GO THERE."
1,"Yikes!  After reading all of these great reviews I really thought I was in for a treat, but boy was I hugely disappointed.\n\nFirst off, there was way too much time spent on my face, ears, forehead, and neck.  Like I counted over 100 strokes on one side of my neck alone and it was the same maneuver over and over that it felt like he was burning my skin.  Like sheesh!  Add some lotion man!\n\n2nd, my back was the most tense but apparently my therapist disregarded that because he only spent 5 minutes in the area I needed it the most.  \n\n3rd, as my therapist hovered over me, he burped and it smelled awful!  That pretty much ruined my entire experience.\n\nI did 1/2 enjoy the foot massage portion except again, way too much time rubbnig my big toe alone.  Weird!\n\nI found the entire experience quite awkward, and being someone who gets massages quite frequently, I wouldn't come to this place ever again."
1,"I and a friend dined here tonight, following the suggestion of a friend who said it was outstanding.  It isn't.  Though it starts off well with the perfunctory greetings, it went downhill.  The wine sommelier had a hard time opening the wine we brought.  My soup arrived at barely above room temperature.  Our entrees took FOREVER to arrive, and once again, mine was barely above room temperature.  The waiter, to his credit, did apologize for the delay in getting the food out to us.  And he did so twice.  That was a bad sign when he had to inform us twice.  The manager tried to make it up with bring out desserts and dessert wine.  I just don't like sweets.  For the wine we brought, the restaurant did comp the corkage fee, and the desserts and dessert wine (which were unwanted) were also comp'ed.  I will NOT go back to this place."
1,"Based on their website (cool, fun images, happy hour pricing, selections) we thought it would be a good place to check out. The place was definitely clean and decorated nicely. We came on a Thursday night and it was semi-packed. The guy working the bar seemed like it was his first day and had no clue as to what they offered. Our charcoal wasn't replaced even once during our stay. On my way to the bathroom, I ran into our server and had to ask her to change our charcoal and she said yes. She never came. Minutes later, another lady popped in asking if we were ok, I said we need our charcoal replaced. She appeared to be an owner or manager or something as she walked over to the area behind the bar and talked to someone, then came back saying someone will be right out. No one came. We decided to just walk to the bar area to pay our bill. We were the only two Asian guys in the entire place and I'm led to believe that had something to do with it as one server changed the charcoal in the booth to our right, blatantly skipped us, then did the booth to our left. If you're not one of them, I don't think you'll be treated well in this place. We sure were not."
1,"The room and service were fine. I had a studio so the fridge is 18ft (5.5m) from the bed and the compressor can get noisy. The hotel is nicely situated in downtown. The walk from the Via Rail/central station is slightly uphill and 10-15 minutes, a nice, scenic walk. A ride from the hotel to Old Montreal via taxi was $12CDN with tip, and a taxi to the airport was a fixed rate of $38CDN w/o tip. I stayed in a room on the 14th floor, in an odd-number room, floor#\""03\"", and there is a nightclub across the street that pounds music all night, and has loud patrons outside until I don't know when (I put in ear plugs). If you are a light sleeper, stay on the even side room numbers of the hotel and don't face Peel St. Or, stay somewhere else. \nThe workout room is good sized and on the top floor with two treadmills, two elliptical, some free weights, and lots of room. Breakfast is on the mezzanine and was, meh, pretty average, but included. I'd spend the extra $40/night and stay at the Marriott-proper just a bit south again, when I come back. Views are better from there too, and it's more convenient. 1-star for the all night boom-chick-boom-chick music which made the stay very unpleasant, as well as the screaming patrons exiting the club. Eliminate the noisy music, it's a 3-3.5 rating."
1,"Wait, so let me get this straight...  You seat me at 5:40am, but you won't let me order anything off the after 6am menu because \""certain chefs specialize in certain foods\"" so I can't order anything with bacon or sausage.  Wow, I never realized frying breakfast meats was so damn hard.  And even after I order off the limited before 6am menu... you don't even bring me my food til after 6:30?!?!  \n\nLet me straighten another thing out... my friend CAN'T order scrambled eggs, bacon, and home fry potatoes.  He can have scrambled eggs, NO bacon, and french fries.  BUT, my other friend CAN have chicken fried steak, a biscuit, gravy, and HOME FRY POTATOES!?!?!\n\nAnd explain to me how I CAN'T order the salad that IS on the menu... BUT I CAN order the ahi tuna or chicken & waffles that AREN'T on the menu!?!?\n\nThen after I jump through all your hoops to order, you leave me with a menu with crosswords and puzzles on it, but you have the ONLY writing instrument in the whole restaurant??  And I think you better have a word with your \""specialized\"" chefs in the back.... cause none of the food tasted good.\n\nLAME!!"
1,"I've been here twice first time we had poor service with dry cupcakes, second time we had the same with a different cupcake girl and I told myself never again! Today at a get together these were brought and once I tasted the dry cupcake and funky icing I knew it was from this place. Yep! I was right. 3rd times the charm for a review. Just nasty-"
1,"The wait staff were non-existent, the food was atrocious, the mixed drinks weren't drinkable, and the atmosphere was filthy. What more can I say? Ick."
1,"Not impressed. Decor is nice but that's about it. Waited to be seated, waited to have order taken, waited for food the came out undercooked and wrong. Expensive. I do not recommend."
1,"What the hell. I gave the guy $20 and the gas would only fill up to $19.89.\n\nIt's not about the 11 cents, but the principle of the matter. From my experience, most gas pumps stop before it gets to the full value, but you can always keep pumping until it gets there. This was not the case with this one. The trigger was loose and just wouldn't go anymore. That's kinda fucked up if you ask me."
1,"Korean bbq is so good and I was excited to try this place with all the good reviews. The restaurant is pretty small and grills are at each table. \n\nThe staff wasn't very excited to help my friends and I. It was a quiet night and they could have been a little more excited to have people. They never came to refill our drinks, refill our meat, or our sides. All you can eat- yeah right! :(\n\nThe staff also sat up by the very loud TV the whole time and ignored pretty much any one who didn't need to be seated. They also took 20 min to give us the check. They asked the table next to us to \""hurry up, people need their table,\"" which was pretty rude! The bathrooms were a disaster which makes me wonder what the kitchen/fridge looks like..\n\nI have the feeling had I been Korean the service would have been a bit better...Even my Korean friends agree the service is bad! Major disappointment!! \n\n*Try some place clean where people actually want your business!"
1,"Disgusting.\n\nI've been to Kelly O's twice.  The first time the food was anything special - so I decided to give them a second chance.  \n\nI order the Eggs Benedict.  I received a plate with raw potatoes, over cooked eggs, and yellow syrup that they claimed was Hollandaise sauce.  I sent the dish back.  \n\nOn the second attempt I asked them to leave off the Hollandaise.  This time I received cold potatoes and undercooked fried eggs - the whites of the eggs were mostly clear.\n\nI asked the waitress why the eggs were fried (if you can it that) instead of poached.  At that point she decided to lecturer me about their kitchen, the cooking methods of their chief, the speed of the wait staff, etc. etc."
1,"Oh my god. that's worst service. The staff is not very polite. I feel very bad, food is OK, one star, I won't go back to eat."
1,"This place is horrible if you're sent here by your employer for a work injury, just go to the emergency room or your own doctor.  The staff here is rude,  you literally wait for hours to he seen.  Dr.  Klausner will delay getting you xrays, mris and anything that costs extra just to save money,  and he will try to send you back to work while your still in pain or still injured.  Avoid pain and aggravation,  go somewhere else."
1,i thought pharmacists were supposed to help people. if i could give less then 1 star i would. the woman here treats every patient like a drug addict. my sister had just got out of the hospital after having her gall bladder removed and this woman wouldnt fill her prescription. i would go anywhere but here. and i wish i could do more than just leave this review.
1,"If you like sausages, EDM and the smell of bleach, this place is for you! Trying way too hard to be swank in a town much better suited to chill lounge. The only good thing is that I discovered Ami's next door."
1,This place has the WORST customer service.. complete a HOLES!\nThey cut my dog.. gave him razor burn and then denied it.. so months later we said ehh we will give another chance and called to make an appt. and they said we cant come back.. HAHAH wow .. you messed up!! \nPRICES ARE SOOO CRAZY HIGH ITS INSANE!\ntry.. best friend groomers on grand /dysart
1,"A ghastly excuse for an airport, LAS is grossly undersized and can't cope with the amount of passengers that pass through it's doors daily. \n\nThe C/D security is nighmarish, several times I waited near 1 hour in these lines. A/B is much better, but it seems like you end up in C/D much more often due to the airlines that fly from there. \n\nGetting a cab from LAS is insane. Thankfully I lived in Henderson and usually drove when I used this airport so it wasn't an issue. \n\nThe noise of slots and the repeating advertisements in the baggage claim area are enough to drive you to want to off yourself."
1,"We haven't eaten here in several years and now I remember why...ordered the flatbread pizza app. , when he brought it out he dropped some pieces on the table, I said we aren't going to eat that so he said well I'll see if they can make a couple more..pretty sure they just flipped those over and returned to table..gross!! Didn't eat that!! Then came the cobb salad, old lettuce no romaine, no bacon either..very lame! Server was pretty much like casper..disappeared the whole time...."
1,"Ate there on August 15th at 8:30pm. Not crowded service was good and the BLT was good. Good thing I did not go to the restroom before my food. Bad sewer gas smell in the Men\""s restroom. When I mentioned it to the waitress she oh yeah it's been like that, \""i said get it fixed\""  \""yeah\"" from her. Paying the bill I mentioned it and the lady said we know  \"" I said call a plumber\"" her response \""well it's been like that \"""
1,Every single bartender is a rookie. Not one of them knows the basic ingredients in any common drink! They didn't hire these chicks for their brains or abilities!
1,"We ordered 4AYCE sushi buffets on a Friday evening for 90. I received a coupon in the mail, Buy 3 buffets, get 1 free.\n\n- Wonderful welcome. Nice smiles and quick to order drinks. \n- We got there at 6. As it got towards 630 - 7ish, service fell apart big time.\n- When you enter, it will say SERVER WANTED! What they need are more EFFICIENT SERVERS. \n- Servers can't spell! I had to spell out LASAGNA for her. It literally took 1min. Others also, Jones roll...ect..\n- Our orders NOT going to our table. I saw my hamachi nigiri being handed off to another table. It wasn't just that, it happened on 2 other occasions.\n- We ordered UDON, and our ICE CREAM came first. WTF...no more udon. CANCEL\n- Servers look so CONFUSED. we had ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD to OBSERVE their every move bc there was NO FOOD on our table. \""UHH, WHAT TABLE? 7! 7! no, 9! HUH?\"" LOL. you can see the sushi chef popping a blood vessel. \n- BTW, only one sushi chef! ONE!? WTF. the other guy was probably the sous chef.\n- We had quite a bit of sushi rolls. In general, all I can say that they tasted SOGGY! they DRENCH their sushi in this spicy sauce. it makes it worse..ughh FAIL\n- Salmon skin roll is good. WIN\n- This establishment is going down...that coupon wasn't even worth it. \n- AVOID.."
1,"Quite disappointed, my green beans had worms in them. Customer service was bad, still charge me full price for everything. Nobody even apologized. It was just a plain horrible experience."
1,"Had better service at motel 6. Advised front desk of drunk patrons kicking my tires while awaiting valet with my toddler.  Front said \""I'm sorry to hear\"", then walked away. Dirty towels and bed linen did me in... going back Motel 6 on next visit."
1,This place blows. They never have shit & what little they do have is expensive. If it wasn't the ONLY place within walking distance I'd never come to this Shithole. They need to put an AM/PM or a QT around this motherfucker! At least the cashiers are nice.
1,Customer service is always and I mean always bad here and the food is just ehhh also but I continue to go here for a bowl of white rice which that they can screw up.
1,"This store is expensive, dirty, and basically a place to walk to when you're too drunk to drive to a real grocery store for more beer."
1,"So while I was at this club, one of the security guards who must have been in a bad mood on this night said \""stop dancing before I step on your face\""... Customer service in VIP at its best."
1,Well I can't really say anything seeing as I wasn't able to get in. I know they do not take reservations and it is walk in only. I tried calling to see what the wait time would be and nobody answered the phone. I was transferred to hotel concierge who wasn't able to get ahold of anyone either. So far not a good impression. I'll try again another time
1,"I order Za Jiang Mein noodles from them before many times.  Za Jiang Mein suppose to be hot.  I went there and waited 35 minutes for the noodle and there were only two other customer there.  So I ask my server why takes so long? she replies because you came here at this time. We only have one chef is making the food.  OK fine, when the server brings me the noodle i notices its cold noodle! So, I ask the server again why its cold. first she thought its not right and should not be cold.  She went to ask the chef.  I can hear the chef yelling from the kitchen because the noodle is rinsed in cold water so we can stir in the za jiang sauce.  (even if its rinsed in cold water, it still should be at warm temperature. ) I told the server maybe the chef forgot about our noodle is being rinsed.  Maybe its being soaked in cold water too long.  after I heard the chef and food server is talking shit in Chinese in the restaurant. At this point, I don't want to eat there anymore.  It was their mistakes and they do not admit and blame to the customer."
1,"Dave is an amazing person who will do well at whatever he does, but I am afraid he stood us up this morning and when we contacted him to find out where he was, he told my husband that he is really no longer in the sprinkler business.  This makes me very, very sad! I loved him and I adored working with him."
1,"If you want to have the worst pool experience ever then this is the pool for you!  We went on Saturday around 11 am, and the water was already murky and gross looking.  Plus its super small, and I am sick of snobs who think they are too cool. Plus to top it all off the bartender mixed up our credit card with the only other person at the bar who just happened to have the same looking card!  We were left without a debit card for the rest of the trip, and when we tried to get it resolved the people that work her are the most incompetent people we have ever met! Never again!"
1,"Not a lot of options as far as food. On top of that you can tell the food has been sitting there for hours, yuck! I'd enjoy my McDonalds meal better then this joint. Service is also lacking. Where the heck is management cause you've got workers just standing and chit chatting!"
1,"Dirty, filthy counter and floor. Rude cashier, probably cause we're not vietnamese, or because we interupted the conversation she was having with her friend that was hanging out at the counter. The one table inside was filled with someones trash, it was never cleared. The two tables outside also had a ton of trash on them, so we took them to go. If hard crusty week old bread, with wilted veggies and dried out meat is your thing, this is the place for you."
1,"Burnt garlic toast. Oh there's supposed to be garlic on that? Decent wings but half of the 1 pound plate was comprised of batter \""nuggets\"". And the pie. Uncooked soggy dough crust. Extra napkins provided to soak up the grease on this half baked abomination. Service was abysmal too. Do you think that when 3 of 5 have left the place we might want the check and aren't going to stick around for dessert? Sorry I just cannot recommend this place to anyone."
1,"Horrible service for a half empty restaurant.  45 minute wait before being sat in an empty station.  My friend's knife was dirty ok things happen but then after our meal the table behind us sends a plate back because their's was dirty as well.  Really slow service granted yes we were told kitchen was backed up but again 45 minutes for sundaes.  The server asked how everything was going and left before getting an answer.  Overall the restaurant survives on the hype, don't go for it.  Save your money; this place is not worth it."
1,"Had the worst experience I've ever had in my life. General manager was super rude when I asked him to substitute pancakes to something  else, he said he have to charge me but He can give me maybe a \""SLICE OF TOMATO\"" for free. \""In his own words\""  Like seriously, was that necessary & having a attitude on Saturday afternoon & you happen to be the GENERAL MANAGER? No wonder this place gets bad reviews. It's these people make the restaurant look bad. But food can't save this Original pancake house ANYWAY. I fell the like the GM hated his job & didn't want to be here. For food, Worst taste of pancakes I've ever had. WILL NOT RETURN back to this place ever."
1,"I LOVE CHIPOTLE!!! \nJust not this location -_____-\nI feel horrible giving this place a one star but even Steve Ells (Chipotle GOD) would be appalled to see the long, stagnant lines in this place!! I mean 30 minutes to actually get your order in and another 10 minutes as you go down the array chipotle goodness... 40 grueling minutes just get your food! All due to inexperienced, always flustered, untrained staff... BYE FELICIA. \n\n*take note I usually go here around 230pm and 8pm... Not really peak times for it to be crowded. \n\nIt's like this location messes with my emotions , I get so pissed waiting almost an hour for my chipotle bowl ... But once I take a bite out of that chicken... I fall in love with chipotle all over again.... Ugh! Management please do something about how your staff is trained !\n\nAnd PLEASE teach your staff to change their gloves,,, wiping your nose and touching food is only okay if it's your own not for customers ......"
1,"Not very nice...I have been twice because I am in need of a good manicurist. This makes the 4th salon in my area and still no luck!!!! Anyway, the owner is \""barky\"" if that makes sense...she is very stern and abrupt and in the middle of my 2nd drying session she yelled at me \""You pay now!\"". I kinda looked at her like lady..calm down and get out of my face with the yelling. My first visit was similar she abruptly kicked me out of the massage chair after my pedicure and barked, \""you sit in there!\"". Instead of sitting I just walked out the front door. The other staff are decent but the owner should get a mussel and not be allowed to interact with customers. Will not be returning..."
1,"I just had the absolute WORST massage in my entire life. I will NEVER go back to this place. If you feel like paying $80 for some one to wipe oil all over your body with absolutely zero pressure and call it a \""Massage\"" then this is your place!!!! HORRIBLE. I have never posted a negative review on any service, this was so bad that I had to let people know about it."
1,"Food is good and came out quick, but that's about it. Customer service here is nonexistent. Lunch special ends at 4pm. My boyfriend and I came in around 3:55pm (I know, I know... really close to 4pm), and tried putting in our order for the special. The waitress tried telling us only before 4pm. My boyfriend showed his watch to her that we still had a couple minutes. She spoke to the man sitting to the table next to us who was eating, I'm assuming the boss, manager, or owner (someone along those lines) to see if we could still order the special. The waitress said, \""Just this once he said it's okay.\"" She then went on to say they didn't have any fried rice or noodles, just steamed rice. How can you run a business called Rice n Noodle, but not have it? Also, their employees eat in plain view of the customers. Definitely won't be coming back."
1,"Maybe it was the oppressive heat, maybe the diarrhea brewing in my gut, but I truly hated this place.  Didnt like the long line to get in, didnt like the music, didnt like the misting nozzles driping god knows what bacteria in my beverage, didnt like the 50 year old dude claiming he was 30 something trying to make time.  Anyway, I got the hell out of there and spent some quality time on the toilet.  What happens in vegas stays in vegas."
1,"They can't get the orders right.  I always have to double check my bag before leaving the drive thru. They're open late, but they have no lights on at night. Poor service. I'd rather go to Sonic's down the street.  This Mc Donald's needs improvement.  Bad"
1,"I'd recommend you check you credit card statements and all transactions with this merchant.  I was charged $113 tip on a bill of $97.58.  I wrote $110.58 in the total and after I left, they added $113 to the tip line and changed the 1 to a 2, so the total would be $210.58, instead of $110.58.\n\nThe owner, Schuyler is not willing to accept the fact, his staff **might** do something unethical like this and insists I left this tip.  He also told me it is common for his staff to get large, gracious tips like this.  It is very disappointing now I have to protect myself by working through the police on fraudulent activity, which costs all of us in the end."
1,"We stayed at the golden nugget, feb. 8,9,10, five of us. It took us awhile to figure it \nout , their slot machines don't  pay nothing, absolutely nothing. Nothing to keep\nyou around, not even little something's  to keep you playing. Well, we just ambled\nout the door to greener pastures and slot machines that weren't so tight. We're from\nout of state, just thought of giving people heads up."
1,"Go anywhere else to eat!!!!\n\nI came here during a lay over at the Charlotte Airport.  As soon as I sat down and opened the container, I regretted it.  The food just looks overprocessed and gross.\n\nI ordered the Kung Pao chicken and rice.  They didn't even have regular white rice, only fried.  Way too heavy of a meal when you're about to sit on another airplane for another 4 hours.\n\nThe food was absolutely disgusting.  I took 2 bites and threw it away.  I can't believe I wasted $10 on this crap.  \n\nI then walked over to BK for a $1.75 cheeseburger that tasted like it came from a 5 star restaurant compared to this dump."
1,"Brought a friend to this store to ship a pkg to her daughter for her birthday.  The counter person, Bill, would not ship her pkg because she could not read and verify the address that he had on his printout.  My friend told him that she could not read it, not that she wouldn't, but she could not.  She had the address on the pkg, but he needed her to look at his printout and verify the address. He told her that he would not ship the pkg unless she did this.  My friend cannot because she is legally blind.  He would not help her and refused to send the pkg."
1,"By far, the WORST dry cleaner in the area.  I brought a rather expensive shirt for cleaning and when I got it back, the front pocket was on the inside!!!  How did that happen?  I can only assume that it was ripped off by accident and they tried to sew it back on without me knowing.  Only thing is, they put it on backward!  When I went back to the store to complain, they became confrontational and they said there was no way that it could have happened.  I offered to provide pictures of the shirt from when I wore it last and they continued to be conrontational.  I would NEVER use this place again and I have reported them to the Better Business Bureau.  Do not go to this place!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Given the big salon, I think your experience will be highly related to which stylist you chose. I bought a Groupon for a level 3 haircut and moisture treatment. The stylist Ken spent 5 mins for the cutting, 40 mins to blow the hair dry and chatting and forgot the moisture treatment. The technique of the haircut is so poor. There is no layer of the cutting and it is not horizontally on the same level. I think he is not serious about what he did. I will not come for the second time. MCN is much better in this sense. You should definitely try to avoid him as your stylist if you choose to go to Dean of Shadyside."
1,"I trusted this criminal with an expensive weighted 88 key MIDI controller that I was very fond of. All it needed was to be opened up and an internal battery replaced.  After 3+ months of excuses (a different one each phone call) I just gave up on it. I'm convinced this individual is a scam artist that gets people to leave their valuable gear with him, and he turns around and sells it."
1,"I want to start off by saying that for the most part, I really enjoy Macaroni Grill. The problem is not with the Macaroni Grill, but simply with the service at this restaurant. My wife and I went this Macaroni Grill a few weeks ago and had a terrible experience. The waitress wasn't attentive. She kept forgetting about us. We left upset.\nI am a forgiving guy, so my wife and I tried again. We had a different server this time with the same result. The place was virtually empty, so I would expect that they would pay a little closer attention to us. I didn't happen. I had to flag down a waiter to get the check and get out of there. Very Poor Customer Service."
1,"Went to the one near cave creek. I had the bacon chicken fajitas. I GOT FOOD POISONING !! BE CAREFULLLLLL :/ I have always been coming here, but for now I'll be taking a break from here !!"
1,"always loved this place but, the last time i got my nails done I didn't have time to have them painted  I had to get to work. I came in a couple times after that to have them painted but they were to busy to do them. So, today I had a new set put on and maybe   thought they would give  me a price adjustment for not having my last set painted  but they didn't and I always tip at least 20 to 30% and have been a customer since they opened up.  Very bad customer service!!!!  You should always take care of your regular customers. Im very disappointed in Vy's and will never go there again and I will let my friends and family know not to go there, too!!!!"
1,"I gave this sushi place a try, since it's around Summerlin(where I live). It was a to-go order. The sushi were not well made. They rolls don't look presentable. One of the rolls I got is a salmon roll. To my surprise, the salmon is cooked not fresh."
1,"Way to much salt on everything and I like salt but this was over the top. I was looking forward the the veggie fries but I couldn't eat more than a few. The chicken was fatty, really fatty and flavorless aside from the layer of salt.\nMy friend raves about the burgers so maybe that's the way to go....\n\n\nHonest to god I wouldn't eat here again for free. Gross."
1,"This conservative POS rag makes faux news look like NPR. You got Scaife, himself pumping ten million a year from his own pocket to keep the paper up and running. No one reads it, the Post Gazette is the REAL newspaper in this city."
1,"The wife, baby and I stopped in for Brunch this past Sunday due to my friends kept raving about this place.  Upon entering the cloth curtains, the room was 75% full. In the room we were in, there were only two waiters waiting on everyone and we stood for 5 minutes unnoticed.  The bartender to the right didn't bother to greet us either.   It felt awkward and after noticing many customers still waiting to be served, we figure it'll be a long wait since they're under staffed.  It was a dissapointing first impression.  Maybe we'll return again in the spring and hopefully they'll be better staffed."
1,"I absolutely love, love, love Best Buy. But not this one. Rude, unfriendly and under trained staff. Until the company and management do some training with the employees I will go somewhere else. On this occasion I went to Sams to purchase a new TV. I will be back, but if I'm treated poorly and ignored again I will walk right back out empty handed and drive to a competitor. Shame on you Best Buy for not even trying and assuming we have no where else to shop. It's a proven fact that consumers will pay a little extra and drive a little further for better customer service. I did."
1,Nothing special. Not nearly as nice as Hard Rock Hollywood/Fort Lauderdale. Good casino to lose at machines. Nobody seemed to be winning. Def not me. It's more like a long hallway than an open casino. Not impressed.
1,Purchased a six inch with combo at this subway and I was charged $8.50. The soda and the drink was half the price of my sandwich? When I went to a different subway for the same meal I was charged $6.30. Won't be going back to this subway.
1,"Only 2 things bring me to McDonald's, the coffee and.cheap desert. I do give credit for McDonald's on how they operate like a machine. They get you in and out, but unfortunately not this one. 10 minutes for a cup of coffee? Only 4 tables in the place and every single table got up to complain about their food quality, missing food etc. Where's management? Obviously they didnt graduates from hamburger u."
1,"Do NOT waste your time to visit this restaurant.  Denny's quality food at top dollar prices.  Altough the service is fine... Bottom line, if you want to pay a inflated price for a fast food meal, eat at Addiction."
1,"Dilapidated, overpriced, loud, dowdy, cheap, spring break crowd, wait in line for EVERYTHING, $4 for a little bottle of Dasani, service is indignant...I mean, why go here?"
1,"How do I give less than one star?  Not sure.  If you are Asian and know Taiwanese or Chinese food, this is not the place to go.  Service is horrible and the owner of the place has an attitude.  Our food wasn't serve timely.  The main dishes came, finished, then appetizer still didn't show up.  Drinks are horrible.  Beef noodle soup was the worst I've had.  \n\nJust don't come"
1,"Walk in one afternoon to a restaurant thats crowded with one server. He tries his best to cater to all the customers but at the end I think he gets lots of funny stares.\n\nDo I think Mr. Tofu is good, honestly I think not. I ordered the tofu soup and add extra $7 for short ribs. Not only the short ribs are tasteless and burned, it is chewy and really low quality. \n\nI ordered the bulgogi too and to be honest with you, you should go to SOYO for korean food. I vow never to come back and would only eat at SOYO for korean food. One and done mr Tofu. U are not for me."
1,I got a horrible haircut...will never go back...I am not very picky and all I asked was for my stylist not to take much off...she cut almost 5 inches...unacceptable
1,"This place sucks!! The cashiers at this location don't know what they are doing! I asked for a carne asada burrito with red sauce on top and  aka a wet burrito, she told me no, she doesn't feel like making it! First of all, that's rude!  2 I'm the paying customer I get the order the way I want even if it means me paying more. And three where the hell is customer service!! Never again!! I has to talk to the manager and she said they don't have one???? Really??"
1,"If all you care about is taste, this place is good.\nBut I can't get over my horrible experience last time. My boyfriend and I ordered one dish each. I got my dish kimchi stew about 15 mins later. And we kept waiting and waiting for his food to arrive - which was bulgogi btw. When I saw the huge group who arrive much later than us getting their food, I had already finished my food. \nI asked the waiter about it and he told me we didn't order the other dish! That really pissed me off. I distinctly remembered ordering his because my bf fumbled on saying bulgogi and I corrected it. That shameless man cannot get 2 orders right and tried to act like he did nothing wrong...AND made us wait another 20 mins before it came. \nZero apologies and absolutely horrible attitude."
1,"I have a misleading cited to shop at best buy again. I bought my laptop there in December, after an update it stopped working. Spent hours on the phone with the manufacturer who told me Best Buy would cover this they didn't care to even look at the computer. Its funny I brought it in the original box and packaging and everything. Horrible customer service."
1,"I've dined at Max's in Glendale, Ca a few times. I was ecstatic to hear of an opening in Las Vegas. I had my mind set on eating Max's Beef Caldereta (dish served at Max's in Glendale, Ca) with Garlic Rice.  Unfortunately, its not served at this location. This location is just serving the basics.\n\nI had the Chicken Sigsig, a Whole Chicken, Garlic Rice and the Halo-Halo. \n\nThe Chicken Sigsig lacked flavor. It tasted like mayo mixed with day old chicken and slices of jalapeno. For a better tasting Sigsig , I recommend dining at Cafe Moda.\n\nThe Whole Chicken was moist and tender. I enjoyed crunching on the crispy chicken skin. Though, I still don't know what the hype is over the chicken's flavor. My guess it lacked in this chicken.\n\nThe Garlic Rice was good. \n\nLastly, I ordered the Halo-Halo. Delicious! The best in all Las Vegas.\n\nThe wait staff were polite and friendly.\n\nBy the way, don't ask for water. Its tap unfiltered hard water. Ask for bottled water.\n\nIn conclusion, the food is bland and lacks authentic flavor and the menu items are over priced. I wouldn't come back for the entrees until Max's Beef Caldereta is put on the menu to try.  For now I'll continue to dine at Max's in Glendale, CA. However, I will come back for the Halo-Halo.\n\nMy recommendation for this Max's is to lower the prices (especially when the food is not that good and you are just starting out) and serve authentic food."
1,"The most convenient Starbucks, but unfortunately, management needs to spend more time with their employees. Got my name name wrong after spelling out (MARTIN is not a difficult name to spell), asked for several pastries and got served one, and apparently a caramel macchiato doesn't have caramel at this location. On a positive note, I got a beautiful smile from one of the beautiful girls working there, which is the reason for the one star."
1,"Awful. The service was so-so at best and I believe our server was the owner. She seemed sour and not super friendly. I ordered the corned beef hash and it CLEARLY came straight from a can. It was like mushy, shredded washcloth. The appearance was so terrible I didn't even eat it. Obviously this place has little respect for food. Our toast was cold and the toast was really the only redeeming thing about the place. I took my leftovers because I felt bad for whoever runs the place that it's just that terrible, but I tossed them in the trash on the way home. There's totally a \""we're headed down the tubes\"" type vibe. I will never go back. Definitely go down the street to Bagel Cafe and get their corned beef hash. FAR superior."
1,As of 11/03/13 they appear to be closed by order of the courts and there is a for lease sign in the window.
1,"I had more than one bad experience here. My first experience here the nail technician piled the acrylic on my nails so thick it was impossible to use my fingers. I had to go to another nail salon to have half the acrylic filed off and my nails reshaped because they were so big and bulky. \n\nI suppose shame on me for returning but, I did to get my eyebrows waxed. The waxing experience was pleasant and I was pleased with the outcome. The problem occurred several days later. I noticed my skin was very irritated with red bumps around my eyebrows. Apparently, the technician did not use fresh wax. \n\nI would not recommend this salon to anyone."
1,"Eat first before you go!!!!\nOk food, but kid portions, spent $90 for a family of four and left hungry!\nAdded insult is 18% mandatory tip for parties of 4 or more( I thought the IRS changed the rule about that).\nSo in short, first and last time!"
1,"If I could have rated NO STARS I would have.  When we walked in the hostess' are cleaning the menus and rolling napkins(didnt think this was the appropiate place for that).  Asked for a kids menu, they couldnt find them, said would look some more and bring it to the table.  She never came back, had to ask our server, she said she was looking for it. Mean while shes hugging her friends when they come in the door, almost groping lol.  So she walks by I say , hows that kids menu coming? Oh we ran out.  We get out apps, onion rings and irish nachos.  Cold stale fries onion rings barely warm.  I dont send food back because I heard what they do on comebacks at some places.  Get our food, wife had corned beef and cabbage, the cabbage was spoiled , absolutely tasted so bad.  I had shephards pie, came out luke warm, not very good at all. Mother had a cheeseburger. Came out well done and cold. I bought a groupon for this place and wanted my 25 bucks that spend on that back. The hostess sucked the waitress sucked the food sucked. The manager ended up taking care of our bill. But I still had to pay 25 bucks for shiite ! Stay away from this place."
1,"I came from the east side of town were they had the little taco stands in every corner.. So moving to this side of town, I was disappointed to find that there isn't a taco place that screams out \""hey! Try these street tacos\"" so when I found out that they were opening this taco bar I was excited I thought it was going to be my taco place.. Well when I finally did go.. I was disappointed in the price, the taste, and wrong order.. First the they are very expensive!!! I payed 30$for 2 burritos and 4 tacos with 2 drinks.. I usually pay around 22$ and that's with a few more tacos and drinks added to that.. Second it didn't taste like real Mexican street tacos and the burrito a were super thin!! They look like I could go make them at home.. The beans tasted like the ones you buy in the can...  I wanted rice with my burrito aswell and they did not add it to it.. I mean a really good mexican bar would add rice and beans in their burritos! No one or the other especially for $7+ .. I wasn't impressed... Now I'm stuck driving back to the east side for good tacos.."
1,"PLEASE READ FOR YOUR SAFETY:\nStayed for one night. Checked in and had to change rooms at midnight after discovering a used drug needle in the bathroom.\nSpoke to the front desk manager who rudely said, nothing he could do about it.\nNo discount, apology, nothing.\nIf you don't mind taking your life in their hands!\nJust want to warn others of the unsafe conditions!!!!!!"
1,"This place is dirty, and the staff are more interested in talking amongst themselves and eating than helping customers.  One dressing room (the second is filled with junk).  Not for me, but you go! animal lovers."
1,"We came here for the Nachos, which many people seem to order and my friends had seen it and couldn't stop thinking about them. Well I have to say, what a disappointment!! We ordered the 4 cheese Nacho platter (we have a vegetarian in the group) and asked them to add black beans, which they charge extra for! The nachos come out with very little pico de gallo, and literally a sprinkle of black beans. The good thing was the waiter came out with a bowl of more black beans b/c he realized how very little we were given (so yes A for service). \n\nThe nachos were just not good. One of the 4 cheeses tasted like Velveeta. I think for this price the nachos need more substance such as jalapenos, onions, pico de gallo, salsa, beans... \n\nOh and another think this place has pretty bad smell in certain parts of the restaurant (poor sewage perhaps?)"
1,Service A+.  Staff was very accommodating and great.  Food was overpriced and terrible. 1 star for great service but would have rather had crappy service and great food
1,"I would go to many fast food chains with happy hour and had no issues with paying happy hour prices for takeout. Unfortunately, not at America's Taco Shop on 16th and Camelback.  For two carne asada tacos and one order of chips and salsa-$8.09. My first time here in the city coming from another state,  and for that price, I thought a burrito was a better deal. I had to change my order right away.  The guy taking my order was not happy that he had to \""delete everything\"" and a bad attitude went with the deleted order; talk about terrible service and understanding from someone who can speak good english. I would understand if the place was busy but it was empty. I had to leave that place QUICK! Never felt that uncomfortable being in a fast food restaurant and I would certainly not want to try the food after that experience. I can take my money elsewhere!\n\n After reading the reviews on yelp, so happy I didn't try it and went with a healthier option. And the guy who stood at the cashier  happily shouted as I walked out the door, \""Thanks Annie!\"" How condescending can he be, and its not good for customer service. He really sucks. Never coming back. Stay far away from this place."
1,"My experience here was horrible. The water for my pedicure was cold and the eye brow wax was less than thorough. Also, they only accept cash tips which caught me by surprise. I will not be returning.  \n\nIf anyone out there has a great nail place, I'd like to know."
1,"Does the management not check their Yelp account? Because it seems like that they STILL haven't done anything about the terrible service. \n\nJezabel, or whatever her name was, took my order over the phone & answered impatiently to my questions with \""YEA.\"" \""OKAY.\"". I figured they were busy so I brushed off her snooty attitude...until SHE HUNG UP ON ME WITHOUT EVEN ASKING FOR MY NAME OR EVEN SAYING BYE.\n\nAnother time I came in there were two workers in the kitchen chatting away & laughing obnoxiously while they saw me standing in the front, all while I was in a rush. Then after I got my smoothie it was tasteless. No taste of fruit whatsoever. I thought it was just mine, but other people who got a smoothie from the same location said they had the same crappy, tasteless smoothie. \n\nI usually come here because it's convenient for me, but I've had it. I am never coming back to this horrible location.\n\nI wish Yelp gave the option to not give any stars."
1,"The wife and I joined another couple on a Hoover Dam Tour.  Part of the tour package was lunch at the Miracle Mile Shops upon our return, along with a voucher with Whittlesea Cab to get us from the mall back to our hotel.  Sounds like a winner, right?\n\nAlas, not to be.  At the end of a VERY long day, I called the number on the voucher, and got the dispatcher.  This incredibly arrogant and rude woman proceeded to tell me that Whittlesea does NOT send out cabs to pick up customers with vouchers.  I'd have to wait at the mall until a Whittlesea Cab showed up by dropping off other customers.  BUT...if I wanted to pay, she'd be glad to send one out for us.  Given that we were seeing one cab (of ALL the cab companies) show up every five minutes, we all decided to just jump in the next cab.\n\nBased on this dispatcher, you could not PAY me to ever utilize Whittlesea Blue Cab.  I'm in Vegas for business six to eight weeks every year, and NONE of the cabs I jump into will say Whittlesea on the side, I assure you.\n\nStay away.  Stay far away."
1,"I ordered pizza for pickup, once I arrived home I realized there was hair in my food. I simply called back to this location and asked for a remake and for them to deliver it to me. I didn't think this was to much to ask considering it wasn't my fault. I was told that's wasn't an option (all while being super rude) and when I asked to speak with the manager was told there wasn't one even tho when I picked up my pizza I clearly saw a man with a solid red polo shirt on which was different from the rest. They need to work on customer service."
1,"Poor service (repeated my order three times and it was still wrong), loud music (probably the reason the girl could not hear me and got the order wrong), wrong change (even after I pointed it out, they did not correct it, the cashier walked away), no selection (no pastrami, no swiss, cheddar, only provolone, etc). Why would anyone want to eat here?"
1,the food is really great good drinks  but terrible atmosphere the music so loud the waiters cant even hear you i work in clubs and their music is alot overpowering than anywhere ive been not good i understand the loungy feeling they want to put out but not to the point its uncomfortable i had their foie gras french toast which was amazing and i think i tried mac and cheese too i ended up leaving and sitting outside and had my meal packed to go i couldnt take the music and i got a migraine. they could do better. the food is amazing but i would never come here again for the sole purpose of the environment. we did ask the waiter if they could lower it a tad bit but if they did it was highly unnoticeable
1,"I had the pleasure of encountering a faculty that could care less bout their student.\nAll the accolades this faculty received may have been warranted. But during on a one on one session ... this is not the case. Am glad that I've completed my studies here, and no longer have to deal with this inconsistent self-righteous faculty. *whew*\n\nUnfortunately, a faculty like this person, ruins the rep of an ok to good city college."
1,"Regret to inform, but last Thursday night, 11/29, the place was dark and the chairs and televisions were gone. CLOSED... I'm wondering where my friend goes to get back the $35 he paid for their beer mug program last week...\n\nPassed their address on 12/10, their signage is down. They're toast... R.I.P. Nimbus"
1,"I wanted to like this place, but the service is not that good. Even if the food at a restaurant is good and the service is terrible, I won't go back."
1,We booked a room at the Luxor and they gave us free tickets to attend the club. This nightclub is whack and probably one of the worse clubs in Vegas.\n\nThe layout of the club is like a hallway and there are people shoved together in it. It's uncomfortable and totally cramped feeling.\n\nWas not a fun experience and will never go back there again.
1,"Do not waste your hard earned dollars here. For a Saturday night the place was almost empty.   Appetizers (onion rings and fried zucchini)  came out cold.  The wings were very good. My wife's chicken dinner was COLD, beans almandine had no almonds and mushy.   The so called smoked ribs were NOT smoked (1/2 rack was a 1/3 rack).  The waitress added $40+ on to our bill,  The peaches and cream martini had very little alcohol.  After the adjustment the bill was still $175 and we drank very little for 4. .  Oh, they were out of half of the deserts.  I would have given this joint zero stars but you cant.  Dont get me wrong I can afford a 5* restaurant but we decided to try Charr this place is doomed to closing.  Oh NO cold glasses.  The waitress brought glass's with ice water in them to chill them and emptied them but left 3 oz of water in the bottom.  This place needs a visit from   Gordon Ramseyor David Irvine."
1,"I try and I try and I try to like this place but the only thing Fleming's does consistently is let me down!  Simply said... our shrimp appetizers came out sans deveining.  Yes, the digestive track of the shrimp were right there for us to see.  Next, my veal chop came out raw.  RAW!  Cold and uncooked in the center.  I sent it back twice, and finally just gave up.  Amateur hour again.\n\nTo their defense, I had an amazing steak at the Dayton, Ohio location.  But at least four other locations have let me down.  Sigh..."
1,"I visited this shop a few months ago. Awesome clothes. I had only looked at clothes on their website and they have a much broader selection in the shop. As I was shopping, the snotty store manager seemed very annoyed that people wanted to try on their clothes before making purchases. I've worked retail as well and I get it's stressful when it's busy but it's just apart of the job. Probably wouldn't have a job if it weren't busy. She continued to be rude to me, my friends and the other patrons in the shop. When we got to the register, the girl wanted to make sure we found everything we were looking for, politely we said yes, and the line behind us was growing. When a second girl tried to open the other register, the store manager humiliated her by rudely telling her not to do this and she needed to count stock. And the stock was just tank tops on a table that there were plenty of. It surprised me that she would speak to the staff so harshly, especially when she was trying to get the patrons to make purchases. I hope she's decided that this is not the job for her and has parted. She was terrible."
1,"I'm not usually one to leave negative reviews and usually give the benefit of the doubt when I have one bad experience, but our family came here and finally left after waiting forever and never getting served. Too bad, because I LOVE places like this and have heard great things."
1,This place is awful and does not meet McDonald's standards by a long shot. Do not stop here. Servic3 is terrible dood is xold and usually comes out wrong.
1,"Worst customer service in existence!   It's kinda funny to see this in this day and age.   But,  if of don't mind the attitude the food is good."
1,Dim sum food came out cold.. Service is poor.. No detail on check out bill..I will not come here at all ...
1,"Someone call Robert Irvine we need Restaurant Impossible!!!  This is Green Lantern gone terribly wrong.  I had driven past this place quite a few times and fully excepted a DIPPING BAR.  I had this mystical idea that I would walk in and have tapas of different items to dip into different dips.  Straight forward right.......Well I think not.\n\nI have to start out with the most obvious.  I ordered lamb with goat cheese fondue.  Fondue which is melted cheese that you DIP IN.  What comes out two lamb cops on a s*** bed of rice that seems to come from a bag with peas, corn and carrots in it and is on every dish.  With a cheese sauce on top.  Need I say anything more.......\n\nThe dips that they offer are actually on the back side of the menu, they do offer suggestions under each dish and burger, bit isn't the whole concept a dipping bar, would you not what the dips to be front and center??????  The dips are not that good anyway and are served in normal restaurant ramekins.  \n\nDecor:  Oh help, green everywhere are the pictures don't go together - again not clear cohesive theme.  You have flowers on one wall and martini glasses on another.\n\nThis place could have been great, but it just got lost - I give 2 more months,"
1,Cant believe that this place got 4 and a half stars. Im asian and I have been driking a lot of bubble tea with tapioca from many places. This place has the worst tapioca that Ive ever tried. Who rates this place above 2 stars should go to california and try their tapioca over there.
1,"maybe because i went there for the danity kane album release party, but gosh darn it, it was grossly unorganized!  there was no line to get in--it was just a mass of people crowded around the door.  i felt like i was in a mosh pit for an afi concert.  my friends and i called ahead to get on the vip list a few days earlier, and then we confirmed our names that morning...i guess tiffany (or whoever) \""forgot\"" to write our names down and then lied about it.\n\nthere were a lot of promoters who pretended to work for the club--they made a lot of empty promises to get us and a group of other ladies in.  anyway, after 30 minutes of getting elbowed and stepped on, my friends and i got in.\n\nsurprisingly small venue. way over crowded.  random soap foam falling from the celling.  shotty music transitions by the dj.  shot drinks not served in shot glasses--served in regular cups. wth. i guess that's upscale.  thank goodness we didn't have to pay."
1,"This place had terrible service and piss poor food to boot. It was a combination of our waitress being new and not interacting well with the chief that cause the bad experience. However, there are plenty of better Italian resturants in Vegas than this."
1,"I really hope Native Newyorkers CORPORATE is paying attention to these reviews. Most people here are complaining about the same things over and over and with my recent visit I can assure you none of those problems have been fixed.\n\nHere's my experience from my recent visit on the Mayweather's fight past week.\n\n- When we walked in, after telling the host how many, he just handed the menu to us and told us to sit wherever instead of walking us to a table. This is the worst you can do to a customer. Hand them a menu and tell them to go sit down. Are you too lazy to walk them to a table?\n\n- Place was disgusting. Beer all over the floor and sticky seats and tables. \n\n- Like most people complained here, this facility seems like a depressing hotel from the 90's. No ambience, not hip at all. Also has a weird smell.\n\n- WINGS = EXTRA SMALL compare to any other NN location. \n\n- Rude waiters, specially the guys that work here. No smile, Not friendly. \n\n- Our chicken strips came out burnt. Returned the order. No manager came out to talk to us. \n\nAll in all this NN has worst service than a moms and pops Pete's fish. Not worth it."
1,"Bad service... Staff are very rude!!!!! Went to this place with 12 friends from San Diego, ordered our drinks, ladies went to the bathroom and when we came back our drinks was been taken by the waitress , I said why she doing that when the glasses are full??? I told to the employee who's cleaning the table what happen but he said I don't know nothing about your drink and you should not leave your drink.. I said this is our table with full of drinks and now your cleaning our table? He is aid I don't know what to say and don't care! I said you are being rude to me, he he said FUCK you!!!at this point I'm very upset:(. When I talked to the bartender they all ignored me. Finally an old man (bartender) asked if he can help I said employee here are rude!!! He said I'm sorry I will help you. I spoke to the manager told him what happen and he said he buy us a drink I said no I don't need any alcohol, all I need is for the employees to apologize to me. But no one came and apologize .. I will never bring any one to this place ever!!!!! It's terrible!"
1,"I came here for a routine oil change... they came back and shoved a bunch of unwanted information at me saying I need to have X and Y changed. The repairs would cost me over 2000, so I said no. Aside from making me feel stupid, when I went to check my oil a couple months later, I realized some screws were missing from underneath the hood. The ones that were there weren't secured properly. And somehow my hood prop rod also magically broke somehow. \n\nAlso, I came here once before that (this is before I noticed the missing pieces) because I noticed my check engine light was on. The first thing they threw at me was a 100 dollar diagnosis check. I could get those at other places for 15 dollars. again when I refused service, the technician just kept giving me the weirdest look like I was the dumbest customer to ever grace his presence. \n\nbottom line: Sub par service and work. I will never come here again even if it is close to my house."
1,"1 week after being charged the $25 no refund.  We called back today and a \""manager\"" will need to call us back.  If that manager doesn't call back today and handle it then we'll have to file a fraudulent charge with our bank against the bar."
1,"Life's too short to eat bad food and this place wasted an hour of my life.  \nI ordered the Chicken Pot Pie.  What was put before me was not a twist on a classic but a total insult to a classic.  A large portion of food was thrown on to a platter sized plate to make you say \""wow\"" when you see it.  I did.  Partly because I thought I had received the wrong dish.  \nThen I tried to eat it.  A dinner plate sized \""cracker crust\"" that was about 90% inedible.  The crust had the texture of a medium/hard jerky.  I couldn't even cut it with a knife and fork.  Seriously.  \""Cracker Jerky Crust\"" might be more accurate.  At the bottom of the pile there was some mash that was just mash.  Slopped on top of that was the \""filling\"" that was OK.  Lots of chicken but there better be for the price they charge.\nEvidently no one on the tv shows that I've seen ordered this dish.  I saw a picture of it in the photo section.\nThere are a lot of good meals to be had in Vegas.  Don't waste an hour of your life at this place."
1,"Never again....I have tried this place twice now.  First time was a NYE party and now just to hang out and gamble.  Each time sucked!  I got suckered into bottle service for 500 bones and now just dropped 100 bucks at keno.  What a complete waste of time.  Also, why didn't anyone tell me there was a freakin loer yuppie convention in town???"
1,I go to Starbucks all over and this one is super slow and super rude. This is def the worst starbucks in town!!! Avoid it like the plague!!!
1,"Came into Vegas for business/and also to attend the SEMA show.  Our company decided to stay here.\n\nThe major complaints are as follows:\n\n1. the non-smoking rooms reeked of cigarette smoke.\n2. After my meetings - went back to the room to do some emails, and pull back the covers to the bed - only to find the bed was soaking wet with what I do not know!\nI called the front desk - and they apologized and said they would clear it up first thing in the morning.  You can imagine, how I feel after jumping into a bed that is soaked with the unimaginable!\n3. I ended up sleeping in the chair by my computer because they would not help me change rooms until the following morning!\nAll the Mandalay Bay could muster up was a big $50.00 credit (no new room) \n\nDo not bother with this hotel, with the way the economy is - all the other 4 and 5 star hotels in Vegas are so much better........with much better customer service.  Try Bellagio or Ceasars."
1,"My credit card information was stolen after I purchased lunch from this location. I called the manager the next day to simply alert her that there may be an issue with their machine. She absolutely denied any possibility of the fraud charges coming as a result of her store, she even went as far as to tell me that \""None of my employees even know anyone in California\"" (CA is where the fraudulent spending came from). Her reaction to my call was that of a remarkably poor manager, particularly considering that I didn't call to complain, just inform.\n\nBe warned-- fraudulent charges appeared on my card after paying for a meal at this Jason's Deli. That, coupled with a ridiculous reaction from the manager are enough to keep me from returning."
1,"The service was really bad here! Our waitress was rude and such in a rush? Really strange the restaurant was empty only one other couple sitting at the bar. I was doing the ayce, as I was ordering the waitress walked away and I wasn't even done ordering???? I would never come back here again.. It's sad really nice place but so clueless!"
1,"If I could give it a 0 star rating, I would.  The awful service sent us right back out instead of eating there.  We arrived at 7:00 on a Saturday evening, which I know is a busy time.  All I wanted was to order a snack from the sushi bar.  When we got there, 4 girls were up front in some kind of disarray.  We stood there for a few minutes; no one greeted us, told us they'd be with us soon... no acknowledgment at all.  The sushi bar was practically empty, so we asked loudly if you could seat yourself.  No one replied, so we started walking to the sushi bar.  A girl then came running after us, not to greet us, but to rudely state that the bar wasn't self seating and that there was a wait since the staff was behind.  We then promptly walked out.  I did call the manager, who was very apologetic, but I still won't go back."
1,"This so bad! My husband and I walked in ordered a beer, hot tea and nachos without beans. 20 minutes later we get the nachos with beans so my husband asked if we could get them without from a different server because our server went on break. The manager came over and was so rude and blamed everyone else for the mistake. Because of the management I would never go back. He yelled at the bartender for trying to help us with our order!"
1,"Ok I give the park 3 stars but 1 star for the surf hour it's a bummer because of the locals that go there.  The guy that runs the surf shop is a d-bag. Me and my buddy were sharing my board so I would wait in line till there session was done and then he would bring the board to me and vice versa. So I waited in line my buddy brings my board to me and mr surf shop says I need to go to the back of the line if I'm sharing a board and wait.... I just waited I told him and I'm not going to the back of the line, he said its a rule. I asked who's rule? He said its an unspoken rule the regulars made.... Kiss my.... I just waited and you want me to wait again just cause I'm sharing a board what kind of bs is that I paid money to ride just like everyone else. If you want to have fun don't surf here, not worth the wait or the bs or the 3 second ride  or the money......."
1,What a joke. They would get a negative rating from me if that were possible. I stood in line for almost an hour waiting for someone - anyone!! - to just pull a cell phone for me to purchase (without plan upgrade) & the only person that talked to me was another customer??! Sales associates were walking around as if myself & several other customers were invisible. The prices aren't all that so I'm taking my business elsewhere...as apparently are the other customers that walked out also.
1,"This is my first time dining here. My friends have been raving about how good this place is so I decided to try it with other friends who have eaten here before. Prior arrival, me and friends noticed their rating has gone down but we didn't care much, and now we know why. We had all you can eat sushi. One of my friends said their oysters are really good so he ordered 2 dozens at one time. He regretted after the first bite. He said its not as fresh and sauce is bad. \nI don't wanna list all the stuff we ordered. All I can say is there's more cons than pros. \n \nPros \n1. There's an option to get sashimi instead of sushi(with rice)\n2. Server is friendly \n3. Salmon is fresh \n4. takes reservation\n\nCons\n1. a lot of orders were not fresh that day \n2. server got confused and gave us the wrong amount of orders \n3. the seats are too close to other people. Feels like we are all eating at the same table\n4. Less items on the menu then similar restaurants \n5. Ordered 4 sea urchin sushis. 2 of them appeared to be dark brown, and 2 of them were gold. I mean....at least give us sea urchins of the same color so we don't notice how not fresh they are! \n\nBottom line, wont come back again!!"
1,"Sadly, I was starving that I forgot to take a picture of the food! I ordered the croquetas and tamales. Both for $5. I also ordered congri on the side which is $3. The food is way over priced for the small portion they serve. There's not a lot of options on the menu either.\nThe food all together? Including my mother in laws and my husbands food; it taste like something that my mother in law can make at home but a lot better. Moving on to customer service? My husband dropped his fork and the owners wife immediately gave him new utensils. So that was a plus... There are a few tables and chairs outside if you feel like eating out in the sun or at night. This place is eh, not all that great. It's not a place i would ever come back to."
1,"Naw, I went to this club at 10:31pm on a Saturday night and there were no strippers on the dance floor! I asked the bartender when they would come out and she was like, \""I think they could be getting dressed.\"" All of them??"
1,"Rude, rude, rude.  The clerk today was put out by my business.  My fiance warned me but I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt.  She failed to greet me; didn't want to count the items; delivered 2 pieces of disappointing news with a look and a tone that spoke volumes (TOUGH),\nNo, little girl, tough for you!  We will be going elsewhere in the future."
1,This location has really gone downhill. Whoever runs the grill really needs to be retrained by corporate. Last three visits chicken has literally been black. Not just a bit overcooked but completely black and disgusting on both sides. Whenever I bring it back to have it replaced staff acts like I'm being such an inconvenience even rolled their eyes at me once. The last time I complained about it they told me I should check the chicken before I leave to see if it's burnt? Really? I don't feel it's my responsibility to make sure it's not black burnt and disgusting. Mashed potatoes were literally soup. Go to other locations they are much better wish there was another one closer to me.
1,"I've never eaten here, just had a friend describe to me how he was kicked out for \""speaking spanish\"".  A bit in shock that a business in America thinks this is helpful in anyway.  If it's true then I suggest nobody eat here but Separatist douchebags."
1,"I really don't like this place. Their service is so terrible. They always give me an attitude, and they're oh so rude. The only reason I come here is my friends like some of their drinks. I don't want to be a picky snob and insist we go somewhere else. I'll never have a day where I'll be like, \""hey, let's go to tea station!\"" Icy juicy will provide a much better service."
1,"Never again! This place is gross. Dirty stained sheets, windows that don't open, bathrooms with no locks! \n\nStayed here for 4 days.. housekeeping NEVER ONCE CAME. Why don't you care?! :(\n\n\nOh, they give AAA discounts but you need to tell them before you book.."
1,"I have to say, I don't get it. \n\n$30+ for bread, a mediocre salad, veggies, soup, horrible prawns, a poor baked potato and a half decent steak in Madison? There has got to be better steak for cheaper elsewhere... \n\nAnd table salt and table pepper? Sorry, but if you're trying to be serious about meat, you've in the least got to have some sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper. \n\nThe beer selection was OK, but you can get the same stuff elsewhere at places that have better food.\n\nI don't know... I've heard that supper clubs are big in the Midwest, and that this place offers a quintessential experience, but maybe I'm just too much of a urbanite-city boy-hipster to enjoy this."
1,"Garcia's earns 1 star  because there was one person at the table who enjoyed the meal. Garcia's is definitely not gluten free friendly inspite of the so-called gluten free menu which I can almost recall by heart it is so short. Chicken Gasedo  (shredded chicken in soup bowl one of my tablemates called chicken slop) Beef Machaco, see chicken description, Veggies, Salsa, Black beans or charro beans, house salad with vinegar and oil. So for $9.99 I got a bowl of chicken slop and a cup of black beans. I thought when I got the bill I would be charged ala carte for both items but I wasn't. So don't know if the waiter didn't charge me or what. Word to the wise at Garcia's, add some corn tortillas, maybe keep a bag of tostitos in the kitchen."
1,"When you sit around and have a debate about whether or not this was the worst Mexican food you've ever had, well, that exemplifies what kind of experience this was.\n\nWe went on Cinco de Mayo, and were in somewhat of a hurry as we had other obligations to attend to. I thought that at 5pm, we could slip in, grab a table in the bar, grab food and beverage and get on our way.\n\nTo be quick, and to the point, the service was good, but the food was absolutely garbage. Bland, flat, uninspired... \n\nBetween the purple power rangers (Pro-Tem Rent-a-Cop), the 20 year old manager, and the horrific food, I'll go out of my way to not go here again."
1,"Seen this place a few times, decided to walk in to ask for a menu,  they said no menu, just like that not helpful at all. Place was completely empty besides me then this security guard walked in and they offered him a sample but not me. Wanted to order a soup but was completely ignored then this lady who didn't understand English came out and couldn't help me at all so I left frustrated. With no food or tea!"
1,"Man pho was bad yesterday. I hate to rip on my people but they need to step it up. Noodle tasted like one of those instant pho from Lee Lee's supermarket and was extra soggy. I could have sworn the \""special combination\"" was a lot better last time. The fatty piece they added into the special combination tasted weird. Won't be coming back anytime soon until I see better reviews."
1,"I had the absolute worst experience here yesterday when I came here for my friend's birthday dinner. The waitress could not have been any more rude. I really don't think I've ever had such a rude waitress. \n\nOne of the many instances where she was rude was when she messed up my order. I politely asked about the missing cheese in my order of cheese fries. After she picked up the plate, my friend asked for his appetizer (she brought my order but hadn't taken his). She cut him off y sternly saying, \""How about I fix his fries first before they get cold?!\"" Then walked away. When she brought them back, she said, \""Next time you want cheese, tell me!\"" Our entire group was speechless.\n\nI have never had a worse experience at any restaurant in my life. I highly recommend you avoid the place."
1,"I ordered 60 balloons a month before my daughter's bridal shower.  Two days before the party I called to reconfirm my order.   Pick up time was scheduled for 10am.\n  We arrived to pick up our balloons at 10:15 and the employees were JUST starting to fill them!!!   We had to wait about 20 minutes!   I had food in my van, and other things to do to set up for this party!   Needless to say I was quite upset with the horrible service!   They didn't apologize, or offer me anything to make up for the inconvenience.  Cripes.... at least throw in a few free balloons!   AWFUL!"
1,"The food here was TERRIBLE. Really, Really bad. We had ceviche. It tasted like ketchup with chunks. I had shrimp, which was very over cooked. My husband had a hamburger which he ordered medium, but was very well done. My friend had chicken lettuce wraps, the chicken was dry and over cooked. The place was empty. I can see how the patio would be nice on a pretty night, but it was too hot to sit outside so we were stuck inside, which is like any other chain restaurant in America. The beer was fine. The service was good. Would NEVER GO BACK."
1,"Too bad it isn't possible to post zero stars!  Do not waste your time with this company.  If your insurance company tells you they are sending 777 Towing, tell them to send someone different.  If they tell you that 777 Towing can be there sooner than any other service, don't believe it.  After being told they would be there in 45 mins to 1 hour, the next message was that it would be 90 minutes.  When that time had passed, it would then be another 30-35 minutes.  When that time passed, it was then going to be another 30-35 minutes.  After a LIVID discussion with them, got a call from the insurance company that their truck had broken down and they couldn't make it at all.  That was never mentioned in any conversations directly with them.  Insurance company contacted another towing company, and they arrived exactly when they said.  BTW, this was all in the middle of the night with the car in a dangerous location on a freeway on ramp.  Stay away from 777 Towing."
1,"Customer service here is the worst!  Don't even bother ordering ahead of time because they won't have your order, or any record of your order.. Although I really like the food here, I won't be back.  2 strikes is all it takes for me,"
1,"No doubt that the coffee was excellent- but the barista was rude and very cantankerous, despite attempts at being friendly. Not to mention the bathroom was out of toilet paper and just had a sign that said 'sorry- public bathrooms available down the street'. I wish I could give a better review since their coffee is great- but the experience was lackluster."
1,"First, the cheap PURFUME is so STRONG and PUMPED throughout the place.. it overpowers everything and hits you like a ton of bricks when you walk in each time you enter.\n\nSecond, the rooms are dated, run down and not very clean. (we were in three different 'suites' and all were rundown.)\n\nThird, There was 3ftx3ft area of black chunky MOLD on inside of the sheets and we had to change rooms because they couldnt get housekeeping to come change the bed. waited and waited. Tired and ready for bed but did the move in order to get to sleep. (took pictures of mold)\n\nFourth, The new room had a man's whiskers all over the bathroom and covered the round magnatized mirror in the bathroom off the wall  ..which I touched before I realized. The new room also had quarter sized holes in the new sheets that looked like a rodent had gnawed. Moved again in the morning. (have pictures grosse!)\n\nLast, moved to a room with a \""view\"" but the windows were so dirty you could barely see out. (sounds crazy but really true)\n\nI think the place will be out of business soon, but until it does, I wanted to warn others of these conditions."
1,"Wish I could only give them 1 star.  We had a pretty large order delivered to us.  One of the girls found a roach in their food.  Not a little bitty thing a big freaking roach. After that no one ate their food.  If you have one roach you have thousands or roaches.  When we called them, they said well it was only a problem with one, we will bring you a new order... Yeah No, you will come and pick up all your food and refund us the money.  After arguing about that for a bit, they finally did just that.  Will never be eating their again!"
1,"Wow. If you want to buy something here, be prepared to be assaulted if you don't want add-ons. I can't believe the change of attitude in our salesman when we said we didn't need cables, and did not want their warranty. The \""sales manager\"" came over, (who was younger than the salesperson--I'm not buying the \""manager\"" thing) and tried to sell us also. We left without buying anything. When they mention Monster Cable, RUN!"
1,"Gate C has to be the worst gate I have ever tried to pass through....horrible slow service and the TSA agents do not care if your handicapped or having a heart attack......they just ignore you....this gate takes the \"" Hurry Up and Wait \"" to another level.....still trying to get through the x-ray part 1 hour later.....not kidding.....I feel sorry for the First Class people who paid more money to get through the line faster....when they too have to wait....there must be about 20-30 people waiting to check into 1 st class....something seriously needs to be looked at in this airport!"
1,"We (party of 6) stopped in after my son's graduation for an early dinner.  Just before we stopped at Starbucks for an iced tea.  My mother still had her iced tea when we walked in and the bartender immediately said that we could not come in with the iced tea.  I asked to speak with his manager and he said \""he will tell you the same thing\"".  We walked out and went across the parking lot to NYPD and spent $125 on dinner & drinks and had great service.  I will NEVER come back to this place.  *** Update *** Following is a message sent to me from what was obviously an employee of APC:\n\nWell not to be rude but it is against the liquor laws to have outside food or beverages In a restaurant and I know first hand there is a sign outside the door there that states it. So if you get mad at a restaurant for following the rules then you are not a customer that restaurants want.  Tara S\n\n* Just another reason to never go back and to make sure I tell all my friends and family about the experience."
1,"The WORST sushi in my life. Too undercooked sushi rice (like long-stored bad grain), not fresh,smelly and dry fish (low quality). \nWhat should I say more? In my dinner menu, wine was only thing I could eat."
1,"FILET MIGNON NOT AS ADVERTISED\n\nWe ordered the filet mignon with chicken hibachi.  The flavor was ok, we asked for the filet to be medium and it arrived well done, was very chewy and we suspect a chuck roast or some other inferior cut of beef was substituted for the filet.  False advertising at its best--shouldn't that be illegal?\n\nThe fried rice that came with it was ok but we were not offered a choice of steamed rice or noodles.  Other hibachi places we have been to plate noodles and steamed or fried rice together.\n\nThe miso soup was very salty and murky and not very flavorful.  The salad had a lot of water at the bottom of the bowl and was made up of head lettuce only (anyone ever heard of a salad spinner)--not very appetizing.\n\nWe also ordered sushi (all cooked ingredients) it was just ok and not the best I have experienced.\n\nThe waitress was slow and had to be asked for refills on our hot tea.  The whole meal took almost an hour and a half and cost $75.00 tip included.  Not worth the price, time, gas and wear and tear on the car to get there."
1,"I have been going to this golf course for over 15 years it's a hit or miss on coarse, as far as the condition.    You have a fun little nine hole family owned place to go.  They recently have remodeled the club house. I have been going once a week since last October with my dad.  Not any more I complained to the manager of the restaurant of the poor service you get it is hit or miss weather or not your going to get acknowledged or served especially in the late afternoon when I have gone with neighbors.   My dad went to the Valentines day dinner thought it was great so we decided to go for Easter Brunch Mistake...  we arrived at 12 most of the food like the fruit and deserts were picked over they had three scrambled egg dishes salad ham and turkey I think marginal Brunch not very attentive staff although they actually had plenty.  There was three in my party they added a 20% gratuity and the bill came to $88 I will never go back and I live in the neighborhood.   I gave you many chances and complained and you still couldn't figure it out. ."
1,"I saw their TV commercial for sirloin steak and all you can eat shrimp so I had to check it out. When I got there, at lunch time, it was so dark that I couldn't even read the menu. When the waitress came over and asked me if she could bring me anything I said Yes, a flashlight. I tried moving to several different tables where there was enough light to see the menu and finally gave up and left."
1,"Utter disappointment.\n\nWhen my boyfriend and I came across this restaurant I got so excited because I love the Garfunkels restaurants in London and so I forced him to come in with me. We'd read the reviews it had already got on Yelp but I was convinced that they couldn't be true. Unfortunately they turned out being completely accurate. The menu wasn't particularly varied and their weren't very many choices. I ended up getting the BBQ Chicken Melt while my boyfriend got the Chicken Carbonara and we got Garlic Bread to start. We were served our starter fairly quickly and I can't fault the Garlic Bread - it was definitely the best part of the meal. Our main meals took a while to come out and when they were eventually brought to us my chicken was pink/undercooked. I ended up eating a few chips and accidentally ate half a chicken fillet before realising it wasn't cooked properly. We didn't bother staying for dessert. The service was subpar and the restaurant is definitely overpriced for the portions that you get, when we got our bill we were certain they'd counted it wrong. The interior of the seating area is nice but the toilets were fairly horrendous. The ceiling had some kind of mould or something growing on it. I was so so gutted that my visit here was disappointing but hey, at least I'll know never to return."
1,"Only giving one star for the price.  $60 for a hotel room in Phoenix is a steal but doesn't mean the business has to be happy with that.  Start off with cigarette holes in the bed spread, loud housekeeping yelling at each other at 8 in the morning outside our room.  Also when we asked for an extra pillow my wife was told \""oh those are on back order\"". Are you serious, you don't even have half your rooms rented out and we can't have one extra pillow?  All around if you have the ability to stay ANYWHERE else I would do so. Being in a cheap and poorly run hotel isn't worth ruining your stay in a fantastic city."
1,"First timein. Last time. Not impressed.  Started off with waitress not knowing what an import draft was I. E. Sam Adams , Goose Island. Hello. Any training going on here.  No enthusiasm.  Ordered wings steak Philly my wide ordered chicken salad sandwich. Wings had no sauce on them. Steak Philly was terrible.  Minced meat on a roll not much cheese. Wifes chicken salad was huge chunks of chicken. No seasoning. Oh yeah onion rings were hard as a brick. How Fricken hard is it to make Orings from scratch?  Been in this businesses 35+yrs. It's amazing how you can serve crap and still pack the place. Oh yeah the manager never came over to say a word to us or any other table. But he did have time to ST and schmooze one guest for 15 minutes.  Never again."
1,Took a chance and stopped at this Barros my original place is on thunderbird I regret it!! Cashier was rude asf once you get that nasty attitude walking in and having them take your order in a rude matter you can't enjoy your stay there and can't help NOT coming back to this location. (No name tag on the cashier)
1,Horrible job on my nails!! Never go there! I had a smudge and the fixed it by putting three extra coats on and then the polish still smudged!
1,"this place is a dump.  and worse, it cost 180$/night to stay here!!\nthey put us all the way in the back.  in a whole different building.  and made us walk through what we called chicken shit alley.\nour room had 2 beds that felt like the sheets were made of sand paper.  our toilet was one like in a public restroom where it didn't have a back part.  our shower didn't drain so none of us could use it.\nwe asked for a cot when we check in, and clearly it never came.\nhonestly terrible."
1,"We purchased a French bulldog puppy from here two days ago and today I took him in for his free vet check up. He has a respiratory infection and he has blood in his stool, both since we brought him home. The free vet is a very far drive for me and I'm worried they won't be honest regarding results of the fecal analysis so I will be taking him to my vet closer to home. The dr. at black mountain animal hospital stated that if I did so, my health warranty would be  void. \n\nOur puppy was very overpriced but I wanted to get him out of there. Our salesperson was nice but I did notice the other girls in the store were just trying to make sales. They also don't require any kind of adoption application which is scary. I thought that selling sick puppies was illegal in NV?"
1,Tried to order from claim jumper tonight and wow am I disappointed. Usually I really enjoy eating here at least once a week. Tonight I placed my order and 3 min later I get a call that they are out of steaks and out of sweet potatoes. I know this is not a major issue but to me if you are a landrys affiliated establishment this is unacceptable. \nI WILL not be ordering from claim jumpers for a long time now.
1,"1 star an only because 0 isn't available. Back again, for more punishment. GOD I can't wait for a better place to open nearby. There is nowhere else to go nearby so we have to come here out of lack of options. The customer service is the worst I have ever seen. Food is good, patio is nice, service is atrocious! How the servers will drop something off at one table and not even address the new table who just sat next to it is unbelievable! HORRIBLE SERVICE!"
1,"Our server served us water and that's all we ever saw of her.  She NEVER returned to our table. The restaurant wasn't full. Our server spent her time at other tables. We got up and left after 20 min. We told the manager why we were leaving. He said \""ok. Have a good night\"". Thats it. We won't return."
1,"We ate a late dinner at Burgr last night.  It tool about 20 minutes to get a table... Not bad. We ordered a shake, and dinner. It took about 15-20  minutes just to bring us our shake, I ordered a burger and my husband ordered a salad and shared fries.  It took another 20 or so minutes to bring our meals. My husband's salad looked like a pile of over cooked noodles.... Tasted nasty. My burger was fine.... Nothing to brag about. The fires were undercooked and over seasoned... No one was really even good about water refills. We did speak with the manager Benjamin, his only comment were we locals????? really.. This place sucks. I am so shocked, this was a place that I would have thought would have been amazing... Save your time and money there are to many other Burger places in Vegas"
1,"Ambience: Ordinary, The owner is afghani and his wife(?) is turkish\nFood: Hmmm since this is my first tryst with Afghani food so I wasn't sure if the food was authentic or not. My take on it is: Aush (beef yougurt soup with mint, garlic etc) A bit too tart for my liking otherwise sublime ( I'm also assuming less spicy than usual)\nAubergines(or Eggplant), again too tart for my liking and less impressive than the indian version( more caramelizing of ingredients in the Indian one). Afghani naan: seemed home made but tough and chewy always a bad bread ( which naan is essentially) recipe.\nTurkish coffee: good \n\nService: Good and very helpful though I suspect they were a bit wary of all the questions I asked\n\nSecond Try: A resounding failure. Went in for the Lunch buffet and was hoping to get sone good nosh seeing their choice spread. However each item was poorly made. Their Lamb soup with lentils had gone rancid ( and was to cause me to taste this meal several times that day). The only think which I found slightly edible was their kabab which had become tough ( I think they had laid it out for too long, even though the time was only 12:45 pm)."
1,I can't anymore. It's too busy here and service is not as fast as other Mickey D's with this kind of volume. Customers are rude too.
1,"Fuck you and your worthless bum casino. \n\nI was having my way blocked by a bunch of crippled old fuckers that kept blocking my way with their old people walking crutch things. So I decided to cut across the casino tables until a rude pit boss stopped me. \n\nI only go to this piece of shit crackhead spot because I wanted the free parking. I have never, ever, frequented the methhead slot machines. But I did go to Cafe Cortez, which is overpriced for their shoddy tasting food. \n\nDon't come here in a suit, crackhead \""hustlers\"" that sell you CDs and bother you for cigarettes are right OUTSIDE the automatic doors."
1,I hate that I have to come here for my packages now. This is the slowest post office aside from downtown.
1,"The whole service was awful! We got seated and it took about 15 min to get our drinks ordered, then they had the dishwasher, chef, waiters and the manager all taking orders. When the food was delivered about 30 min later one of our orders was wrong and the other was burnt also the table next to us had the same issue. And in the end when we went to pay they didn't have change so they asked myself if I had change for a dollar and when I said no the poor waitress had to use her own tips to give out change to the customers! Never again will I go there"
1,Absolute ripoff.  I took 3 shirts in and they charged me 19.47.  I'll never go back.  That's what I get for not checking yelp first.
1,"first off, i would like to say I really like my PCP, Susan Schuder. she seems to really care and i trust her. the praise stops there. i went in to see her yesterday for some pain, swelling and grinding in my wrist. she gave me a brace, sent me for xrays and said she would send a referral letter to Steinberg diagnostics right away bc i need an MRI. She told me to call the following morning to make an appt for my MRI. I was on the phone twice with Steinberg and twice with SMA between 7 and 10 am bc the referral letter still hadn't gone through and I was unable to make an appt without knowing what kind of MRI i needed. when I explained to the guy that answered at SMA at 10 am that my Dr. hadn't sent the referral  and I wanted to check on the status of it, he snottily told me Susan Schuder was not a doctor, she is an APN, and then proceeded to tell me it can take 5-7 days for a referral to go through. that's fine, but first of all, i don't care about her title, stick to the point, and second of all, she was the one that told me to call the following morning to make my appt! it didn't just make this s**t up, and I don't appreciate being talked to like i'm an idiot."
1,Unbelievably uninspiring breakfast. Chilaquiles was cold so I got the biscuits and gravy. Dry biscuits and gravy under seasoned and lacking flavor. I have never posted a review on yelp but this meal was so bad I felt I had to. Nothing original on the breakfast menu..will not return.
1,"It was my fault...I read the reviews. \n\nWe wanted to stay here when it opened and it never made the cut as we always chose another location. The age of massive themed casinos is dying and the Excalibur location is prime for a new casino. \n\nThe smell is shocking and we never were able to acquire the ability to withstand any long term gambling inside the Excalibur. The timeshare / \""free show\"" salesman were overbearing and rude;  One Asian saleslady was by far the most annoying .\n\nWe stayed in Tower II and it was fine with no problems. The room was clean and did not smell like the casino. \n\nWe have no plans to ever stay in the Excalibur or even walk through it again. Their are way to many affordable options to  ever have the Excalibur in the mix."
1,"I have simple request...no tomatos.  Not because I don't like them, but because they can KILL ME!!\n\nThat means clean gloves, clean knife, cut the bread on a clean cutting board or as a minimum a clean piece of paper under the bread.  I only want onions on my sandwich...can you please get them from the back...not from the tray where you've previously dipped you tomato contaminated finger into every vegetable on the line.  To include the onions I want.\n\nI know you have a system where you make sandwiches quickly.  But for gods sakes, slow down, listen to my instructions and do it the way I ask you.  You screw this up I end up in the hospital because my breathing has stopped (BTDT...no fun).  On the other hand you slow down for 1 minute, you save a life and make a customer happy.\n\nIt only took you 3 tries to get this right.  First try I just walked away because you clearly weren't listening to my needs.  Second try you delivered a sandwich, when unwrapped, had several tomato seeds (enough to KILL ME) between the paper and the bread.  Last try...success.\n\nWouldn't it have been better for you to listen to what I had to say and slow you crew down so they understood exactly what they were dealing with?\n\nIf someone tells you they have a food allergy, especially one that is easily accommodated, pay attention, do what they ask...you just might save a life."
1,Sucks! Wanted to do baby registry. They tell me to do at kiosk. After create password. It said password not match. Asking for help. Nothing we can do at the store. You have to call the hotline!! Why I'm here for!?!
1,"Took my car in with a known issue. They proceeded to inform me that the issue I told them was not the issue at all, instead they would need to take apart my transmission, costing nearly $1000. Funny how engine oil coming out of the rear main seal looks like brand new transmission fluid (hint: it doesnt). He cited a clean area near the transmission pan as his reason (even though the leak was further up on the other side of the engine). They might be fine, but certainly worth getting a second opinion. They seem to prey on people they perceive to not know a lot. Bottom line, i knew what my issue was and how much it should cost with my particular vehicle, so I was able to recognize when they tried to take advantage of me (its either that or they did not bother to do very much troubleshooting, or lack of expertise)."
1,"I just had the worst experience of my life.  I have been a member for 6 months but my 1st time going was tonight. I was told that I can bring a friend when I come so I brought my friend... he is the one that motivated to go.  When I get to the desk they tell me that he can not come in. Brandon the manager was very rude and condescending. I asked to talk to his manager, Pat another manager called her and she would not talk to me.  This took about 5min and then all the sudden the police show up and tell us to leave. Brandon did not even ask me to leave he just called the police and had them tell us to leave.  I have  never had the police called on me. Officer Stranger then took my info and treated me like I was a criminal and literally escorted me and my friend out. If Brandon asked me to leave I would have left. I will be canceling my membership and praying to never have an experience like that again.  Absolutely no customer service and apparently don't care."
1,"First of all, it's an absolute crime that in a city this size, there are not cabs available on the street.  In one of the main bar districts, at 2-3 am when places are closing up, there are no taxis patrolling around?  Seriously??  Do you actually WANT to make money or are you just in business as a hobby?\n\nSecond, how about when we call for a cab, you actually fucking send one, assholes?\n\nWe waited thirty minutes and called again, received assurances that the cab was on its way, waited another fifteen minutes, and then gave up.  Thanks to Yellow Cab, we had to hoof it 1.5 miles back to our hotel, which normally would not be the end of the world, but it was 3:30 am, we were all dead tired, and my one poor friend has a bum knee.  \n\nSo fuck you, Yellow Cab.  I'm putting the Green Cab number in my phone and we'll be trying them next time."
1,Horrible horrible horrible service. We sat for 10 minutes and were not greeted so we got up to leave and all they did was wave us goodbye
1,"This was by far the worse MG I have dined. All 5 entrees (big family) ordered were served cold. Not warm, not luke warm, COLD! After being re-heated undoubtedly in a microwave we discovered that each guess was discussing who had the more bland tasting dish. We have always enjoyed MG and it was a complete shock to have this type of experience. We will not return.  There were 2 exceptions to this tastless cold meal....the house salad dressing and the bread."
1,"Not happy at all! They have a frequent user program that they screw you on because they can't keep track of how many times you've been there & refuse to give you a print-out or card to prove your visits. They've screwed my friend over two different times & refuse to correct it even though we are only talking about a few $'s. The service is slow as all get out. Took over 2 hrs to get a full set of nails put on. Don't go there. They lost 2 good customers today & they could care less! It's okay, there's nail salons all over the place."
1,"I am so sad to say this is the worst customer service place ever. I went there a couple of times when they were on Dunlap and they were always cold and very unfriendly.\n\nI do not know why they were so cold.  They did not say hi to me and they said hello to my husband when he walked in way after me because he was parking the car,  I told my husband to stop there to see  what they had.  It was my idea.  I walked in smiling and made eye contact by nothing.  I wanted to spend money there. They greeted and welcomed my husband but not me?  I was dressed well.   The only difference was is my husband is not Hispanic.  The last three times I was there it happened each time. I walked out and will not  go there again.  Sad."
1,"Okay, so I always order here for a delivery. I'm always getting a lot of order each time, and have been satisfied with the food. Just that everytime I order curry, they'll ask me what scale between 1-5, i'll say 3 and everytime I receive my order, everyone that eat it says it's so hot that it's like 5, it's always 10-15mins late, I mean they shouldnt of said a length of waiting time when they can't be sharp on time, especially when I always place a large amount of order and I pay for delivery charge and give a good amount of tip! But I disregard those things and continue to order, one time i ordered curry again and i said 1 out of 5, mind you it's no difference in the hotness of the curry with the scale of 3 we used to order, it went on for how long... Until today, I'm sick and ordered soups and curry, she asked me if i like it spicy and told her i dont like it spicy, not even 1 out of 5 cos im sick. she said 30-40 mins of waiting, i said okay. And guess what? It took an hour! And the curry? It's so spicy! I'm just so mad of how always late they are with deliveries, and pls dont ask customers on the scale of spicyness, cos you guys dont keep up right with the scale, 0,1,2,3,4,5 taste all the same!"
1,"Save your money.  I grew up with Michael Jackson's music and this show was awful! It was so boring and kiddish we walked out after 20 min's!  And, the seats where not high enough to look over the person in front of you."
1,"Worst service ever.  No one cares, was lied to, wasted my time, twice and ended up demanding a refund and taking business elsewhere.  NEVER AGAIN."
1,First time at Rio - check in at 5 took 20 minutes - now at taxi everyone trying leave Rio - this place suck & will never stay again - I stay cuz of friends - not worth my time or money!!! Stay away if u under 35
1,"Genghis Khan could never make it past the great wall of china, unfortunately Arizona's border is not as secure.\n\nWe walked in and at 8 pm on a Saturday and I though they might be closing as it was empty inside and there were just two tables in use on the patio.\n\nThere is a menu, however you basically then go and fill a bowl with protein and veggies. The bowl itself is much smaller yet the same price $9.99. The veggie options are a bit lacking as some things exists only in a mix, some items were frozen, and others were not well stocked. The sauces are a real shortcoming with a few thick gloppy sauces that you put in to a metal ramekin. As for your \""starch\"" they add the noodles or rice, there is no rice after cooking.\nThe bowl is brought to you meaning you do need to tip.\n\nMy bowl was not enjoyable, it was not well cooked with some veggie items still being raw, the sauces were bland despite copious amounts of them, and again the peanut condiment tray was empty. \n\nI will be sticking to YC's or MuShu and I recommend you do the same."
1,"Wow...we came to this place by accident -- well my friend's husband wants to see their largest pint advertisement and it was huge, but that's about it.\n\nThere was live music playing, sound system wasn't the greatest so it was really really really loud. Be careful with your eardrums! \n\nI got my usual drink - a long island and man, they messed it up! They put a whole chunk of tequila instead of balancing it with rum, vodka, and gin! It was nasty. \n\nThe boy got a cider and that too was eh. \n\nOverall, definitely a locals only bar..."
1,This place is not the same anymore.... Waited about an hour to get mediocre food... even the atmosphere is pretty lame now.
1,"I created a yelp account just so i could comment on this restaurant because I w disgusted by the experience.  The waitstaff was horrible. The restaurant was not even busy. As people arrived, they made them wait 30 mins and then seated them at tables that had been open the entire time. The food was good but I will never go back given the horrible experience."
1,"Overpriced and underwhelming, I understand when green beans are called haricot verts they are going to be pricey but when you order a dish and they ask you what side you want and one of your options is haricot vert, please don't charge me $8. Let just seems wrong. It's located next to the ritz so I guess you can charge what ever you want but locals this is not the place for you. \n   The server was more concerned with the employee meal she was sampling than our needs. Thanks but no thanks"
1,"If I could give this place less than 1 star I would!  The drive thru service here is totally ignorant. All they have to do is read the screen and put the right food in the bag, in my case put the right amount of food. I've been here 3 times and every single time they have forgotten something. This is my first review and last from this place. Go down the road and get your orders right!!!\n\nThis management here is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE."
1,"My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights. We needed an inexpensive room for the weekend. Checking in was easy, staff was quick and courteous. We were told we would be staying at the Manor. The benefit to staying there was our car was close for us to use. However, you are not attached to the casino. The room was older as was the furniture. The king size bed was very new and very comfy, as were the pillows. We had a keurig for am coffee (something our friends at a higher end hotel didn't have). \nMy huge complaint is that 1 1/2hours prior to checkout our water was shut off. ( no flushing the potty, hot water to shower, washing your face/brushing your teeth). Water was returned 10 mins before we left. \nThis was not my first time in Vegas but it was the first and last time I will stay here."
1,Very disappointed! My husband and mother went to go pick up burgers for dinner.. Since I am 9 months pregnant and not in the mood to go eat out somewhere. They ordered our food and brought it home. They neglected to  give them all of the orders and we didn't realize this until they got home. To top it off it was my order they left out! The milkshake we got basically was this... Flavored milk... And for charging $4 something for the Oreo chocolate shake that is unacceptable! So my husband is  enroute to go fix the issue meanwhile his dinner is getting cold! We tried to call the store and no one answers but it gives you an option to speak with headquarters.. What good will that do?! Ugh. Will most likely not be returning to this smash burger!
1,"So I'm waiting in line to order take out and watch the 2nd round of the NFL playoffs, and the hostess informs me I have to be seated to order take out. Really? Fail!\n\nI'd like to give no stars if yelp allowed!"
1,"I'm aware that reviews should be written in a timely manner after experience, but I'm making up for lost time. And putting off writing a paper.\nI went here last summer after trying to get into Tryst (What was I thinking, I know.)  I'm sorry, but this place was G to the HETTO.  It was packed to the maximum at about 4 AM. You could barely get through the crowd.  And no joke, immediately upon entry, this guy's hand went precariously toward my bosom (yes, bosom) and I whacked him against the wall with a strength I hadn't realized I had, much like a mother pulling a car off of her child.  Anyway.\nI did have a majorly strong, majorly expensive Tokyo Tea here.  AND the skanky bartendress didn't give me back any change, when I should have gotten twenty bucks back.  She finally gave it back although I know she thought I was lying. It was majorly busy so who knows.\nToo crowded to dance, too meat markety.  Go here if you're looking to get laid and have questionable standards. Not that there's anything wrong with that. What happens in Vegas gets talked about on Yelp, I guess."
1,"This place is Garbage. \nWe had bought two tables bottle Service the works. \n\nSecurity is a joke, need i say more.  \n\nI got the boot for literally saying something about pot, in a joking manor.  Security came lit my cigarette and then escorted me out.\n\nPs. they allow smoking inside etc, if you didnt know already\n\nBunch of Gorillaz in there save your money hit the Marquee do something else but the Luxor in my opinion is going downhill.\n\nFemales = minimum\n$50 dollar entrance for a sausage fest.  Do like me and role with females.  Youll be treated much better..\n\nDONT FREQUENT THIS PLAE THERE SO MUCH BETTER"
1,Had the taboule there. If it wasn't for me being as hungry as I was with little other options at the food court I would not have ate it. What was supposed to be bright green was bordering on brown. It resembled the color of canned spinach! Of course it looked like they threw a handful of fresh herbs in there to make it appear fresher and to get away with extending the life of this salad that should have just been tossed!! I had an upset stomach for 2 days after eating here. Yuk..
1,"My buddy & I went here for the last 2 Sundays to watch Da Bears. The Ventura Grill has a terrific patio & a decent beer selection & pretty good food. What it is sorely lacking in is service. I'm talking epically poor service. We sat there for 15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. Over 45 minutes for a hot dog & fries? And if you want a refill on your drink, you'd better order it when your current one is only half empty. So what is it? Understaffed? Poor planning? All I know is I gave them 2 chances & they blew it with me."
1,One hour till closing and the teenagers they have running this place are shutting down the line and leaving the nastiest looking food on display --- and 8 customers walked in expecting something professional.\nI'm heading over to Signal Butte next time.
1,"Terrible pharmacy! Can't say how many times they have messed up my prescriptions. And even when it's been their fault their answer is \""once it leaves the pharmacy nothing can be done\"" if they just had an ounce of customer service instead of just being flat out rude I wouldn't mind so much. From here on out ill drive the extra 15min to another just so I don't have to deal with them again."
1,"I'm actually less of a fan or Revs post their renovation. The food arrived cold and over-cooked, since my table wasn't drinking, the music made 'cranking it to 11' seem like child's play, it took forever to catch the eye of a waitress and no sooner than I had put my fork down, they were taking my plate and handing me the bill... Poor show and 'reinvention'. I don't think half-priced Monday's is going to draw me back anytime soon."
1,Just called for reservations was told to call back they were busy. Wow really that's how you treat customers? Thank goodness there are soo many other great options -restaurants who understand what good customer service is
1,"Wanted to try Beach Pizza, since it's closer than the place I usually go to, Roccos NY Pizza.  Large 3 item Pizza, chicken parm sub, and an order of buffalo wings.  \nThe whole order of food, was sub-par, at best.  The buffalo wings, were terrible, smelled weird, oily, little wing sauce, ate a few, dumped the rest.  The Chicken Parm sub was mushy with too little chicken and too much sauce and cheese.  The pizza was kinda like Dominos, cardboardy crust, not the worst ever, but far from good.  For the prices, not a real good value.  For 1/2 the price, might be worth consideration for folks who usually order Pizza-Hut, Dominos, or Papa John's.\nNice friendly staff and fast service, was the only bright spot.  Will not return."
1,"I really want to like Zoe's Kitchen. I do. I really, really do. \n\nI have been to Zoe's more than 5 but less than 10 times, and yesterday was my last visit, unless I want to stop in for some limeade and chocolate cake. \n\nI have tried MANY things at Zoes, and I try to listen to what others like .... I don't like their bread at all, so every sandwich I've had has been bad. The quesadilla is OK, but I'm not a big fan of flour tortillas. The chicken roll ups (I think that's what it's called) that I had yesterday (after a good friend's recommendation) were kind of soggy and yuck-o. I don't like the pasta salad .... or the potato salad ... or their slaw .... or cold rice .... \n\nDo you see my challenge here? The decor is adorable, and I really want to love the place, but I think I've paid my very last visit to Zoes. \n\nSo, so sad!"
1,The worst apartment I've ever lived in! I've only been here 2 months and I'm miserable. If you are thinking of renting here DON'T! The apartment staff has been rude and have harasses us 5 times in 2 months! They have also entered out apartment on two separate occasions without our consent. If you are considering living here I highly encourage you to look elsewhere.
1,"We spent months with our child in the 2s and 3s class & we had many concerns. I wrote an email to the 2 teachers. I praised them for their dedication & effort. I also expressed our concerns. After so much time spent with the 2 teachers, I had grown to admire, respect, and like them both. They never returned my email or talked to me again. We got an email from the director who, despite our time in the classroom, dismissed all of our concerns and disinvited our son from the school. This was very painful and unexpected. But it was the best thing for him. We got him into a play based school & helped toilet train, & provided food, & was cheaper, & had better hours, & had fewer holidays . I heard the teacher is now teaching older kids which I think is a better fit for her skills. The staff & faculty, parents, grounds are nice, & the kids are great. But it is not a good value, very friendly to working parents, & has too many holidays. Love & Logic is not for us. I don't know if it was a culture of pride that interfered with their ability to discuss my concerns. But the idea that they are beyond criticism was arrogant & cost them a great kid, committed parents, & a favorable review."
1,We came here for breakfast and were really looking forward to it based on the reviews online. I think we came here at the wrong time. We got seated and it took a while to get drinks and order taken (about 10-15 minutes). We finally got to order our coffee but we received without a creamer. The gentleman mentioned he would be back but he did not return. We asked a bus boy for the creamer cleaning the other table and he brought us a dirty one with fresh jam all over the bottom. We asked our waiter for another creamer. We both decided to order their eggs benedict (I ordered the Florentine and my boyfriend ordered the crab).The Florentine was the worst I have ever had. The eggs were sloppy and the asparagus was small cut up piece. I almost sent it back because I thought the asparagus was missing. I am a big fan of eggs florentine and I was surprised to not see fresh asparagus. The asparagus looked like cut up pieces of artichoke hearts. Our English muffins were overly buttered and took away from the meal. My boyfriend didn't finish his crab benedict. It was salty and the overly buttered muffin didn't help. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing here today. The coffee was the best thing about our meal.
1,"Terrible service, waited 10 - 15 minutes for someone to show up at pharmacy and she was the most disgusting, nasty and inhospitable person I have ever encountered in my life.  Also bums hanging out at front door asking for money and when you do not give them money they curse at you, what a disgusting, nasty, awful place!"
1,"Saw the five-star reviews here (2 of them) and thought I would give it a try. It was a mistake. \nI have had sushi in many places such as Tokyo's fish market, San Francisco, NYC, Stockholm, Buenos Aires.  Some were good and some were bad. And this place is one of the worst. Look at the picture I took and you can see that the fish was not fresh. The owner is Vietnamese which was a sign. I should have trusted my gut feelings.\nThe service was bad. Not even a thank you. I did see that they had a wifi on my phone network but the owner said it's for private use only. Many other restaurants have free wifi in the area. They have done such a good job not trying to provide any service at all.  Ordered 15 pieces combo and 7 pieces are avocado sushi. With a bottle of water and its almost CAD $20.  The two five-stars reviews must have come from the owner's friends.  What a disappointment!"
1,"So I decided to venture out around my neighborhood and found this place. Here is my review: Upon entry I knew this would be an odd experience. It looked more like a smoothie place versus a Thai food restaurant. Other than not having proper Thai spices (think fish oil, chilies, etc..) the pad Thai was sub-par at best! My boy got the sweet and sour chicken and was not to happy with the familiar taste of mediocre food! This was a huge disappointment. The Thai Ice Coffee wasn't too good either. And to think about it, the Thai iced tea kinda sucked as well. Over all this was a fake Thai food joint. I will NEVER return to this establishment."
1,Went back there because I had a flat tire and was towed in. They wouldn't honor warranty on tires. Said had too many miles. I had spent $2100 on rims and tires there. They tried to pressure me into buying sumitomo tires which are garbage. I drove across the street to discount tires to avoid their bullshit. They are horrible. This happened 1 1/2 years ago.
1,I am sorry to say but it's the worst indian food I have ever had. The food is not fresh and tasted as if it was from previous day's buffet. I am from india and can tell easily by eating indian food if it's fresh or not. Waste of money at this place.
1,"Had the same issue with the 45 minute prior check-in.  I heard of such a thing being 30 minutes prior to check-in due to security reasons, we were at the 35 minute point so they definetely said no.  Their computers had already siezed up is what we were told, a security measure...federal rules to be exact.  Funny cuz Allegiant does no such thing.\n\nSo we were stuck in Reno for the night and got the next flight out, said my buddies bag was to large for the over head compartment, yet it was fine on the arrival.  So he had to pay.  The couple in front of us had a bag that weighted 51 pounds, 1 pound over and gave them grief.  The lady freaked out and started taking out shoes and clothes and shoving it in carry ons.  I don't blame her, 1 pound over really?  They don't know what customer satisfaction is, I'll stick with Southwest and Allegiant thanks !"
1,"Absolutely the worst choice for our first meal in Vegas. This place is completely overpriced and the staff was inattentive. Miguel seemed annoyed we didn't want to order right away, but chose to enjoy an appetizer first. The sushi is about the same as the local convenience store. I would rate it zero stars."
1,"We got there late at 9 am.  Such A LONG line, but there were tons of tables so I don't understand.  Waited thirty minutes and left.  It was 11/11/13 .  I'll use open table next time."
1,"One of the least pleasant hotel experiences I've had. First of all I should say that we only paid $62 including tax and resort fee for one night, so our expectations were not high - I realise you get what you pay for. But we paid for a non-smoking room, and got a non-smoking room which stank of cigarette smoke - yuck. \n\nWe did actually get upgraded from the smallest/most basic type to a \""King suite\"". However, this just meant a bigger bed (this was admittedly comfy) and a bigger but weird-shape room. Our TV was so far from the bed that the remote wouldn't work without us getting up and walking across the room!\n\nThe room was clean but dated, and despite having our AC set to 66, we both woke up sweating in the heat in the night. \n\nWifi, often free in cheap hotels, was $12 for 24 hours, but whereas with the Cosmo I could use the Internet anywhere in the building, here I could only get a (patchy) signal in the room. The speed was appalling and it kept dropping out completely. \n\nFinally, our shower only gave us lukewarm water in the morning.\n\nOverall we couldn't wait to get out of this place."
1,My daughter got very sick from eating a burger here and when we complained the manager did give us a free meal if we returned. We went back a few months later and my husband got sick this time after eating some wings. I have not been impressed with the food  overall here and the service has been even worse. I have never been to the bar area here...only the restaurant. I would never go back and would not recommend this particular Native New Yorker.
1,"So, I feel like a complete idiot for getting sucked in by Winder Farms a second time. Too many extra fees, you have to babysit the delivery man and accounting for credits due, overpriced milk, bread and produce that never lasts until the expiration date, and of course the small print in the contract that requires 40 deliveries before cancellation or a $50+ cancellation fee. It doesn't seem like a big deal until you realize what a waste of money it all is and find yourself skipping every delivery. You are better off buying your milk and bread at Trader Joes or Fresh & Easy and your produce at the farmers' market."
1,The employees seem to hate their lives. We waited 15 minutes before the server even acknowledged us! They need some vitamin D in their lives!
1,"This place is for \""locals\"" and it's ridiculous.  The machines really never win if you talk to people who live here and they charge too much for drinks.  If you want to have FUN then go to South Point Casino on Friday nights where drinks are $2 for well drinks and the people there are nice unlike the staff at GVR.  It is just a pretty casino out to get money from you to be prettier period.  OH and NEVER use their pay phone there (I had to because I didn't have my phone with me and the desk wouldn't let me use theirs, lovely).  Anyway, used the pay phone and received a bill for $70.00 for 2 minutes because they go through some group that's a scam, fyi."
1,"Let me start by saying, I had hoped for great things  at Rao's. I mean the place was packed, we had to wait to get in. The food looked and smelled great. But then after waiting over a half hour, we finally get seated, and then reality hit! Rao's is great if you have no sense of taste and love bland food. They are known for their meatballs so a few of us ordered those. Let me tell you, the meatballs in the frozen section at the supermarket were better. Very bland. The lasagna? Again, not the worst I have ever had but very far from the best. Again, the ladies at the local church make better pasta dishes than Rao's and their lasagna does not cost $30. But the worst of the meal was the peas, onions and prosciutto.  What were they thinking? The  prosciutto was so tasteless! How do you make it so bland? \n\nAnyhow if you are thinking of eating at Rao's, don't. If you want to spend big bucks on a meal in Vegas, go over to the Bellagio and try their buffet, the locals love it. Or try FireFly Tapas over on Paradise Rd. I'm a foodie that's been coming to Vegas for 10 years. Don't waste your money here, unless of course, you enjoy spending big money on food with no flavor at all."
1,"I really been wanting to try this place for a while but unfortunately my experience was a sad one :(. The good stuff i saw: a good variety of beers and drinks, extensive menu  and online ordering available.\n\nI got 3 tacos and 1 arepa, the food was really good but I don't think I'll be waiting another 45 minutes for some tacos, especially when the concept of the restaurant is fast food. \n\nThe tables were really dirty and no one was checking this aspect of the place after people were leaving their tables. I think that it has great potential if it's properly staffed and some training is involved for customer service.\n\nHaving so many fantastic establishments in Charlotte, I won't be wasting my patience here again :("
1,"I'm sitting at the bar at this moment and have been sitting here for 20 minutes now and haven't been greeted by a single bar tender, waitress or any staff at all."
1,"Unless you have no other options, don't come here. The place looks old and dirty and the food is NOT good. I had the taco salad which was basically iceberg lettuce, canned olives, dried shredded chicken and one scoop of guacamole and sour cream. Ick! I rather go across the street to the 711 and grab a bag of chips and beef jerky."
1,"My wife and I were only in Phoenix for a night, and figured we would try some Mexican food  seeing as we had never been in the Southwest before.  Our 1st restaurant down the street never got around to serving us, so we came to Rosalita`s figuring it might have authentic Mexican cuisine.\n\nIt was brutal.\n\nThe service was atrocious, as one poor guy was working both the bar and the \""lounge\"" area which had about 8 tables full.  He was pleasant, but completely overwhelmed.\n\nThe food itself tasted as if it had been left out all day and simply reheated.  The chips were stale and the salsa tasted suspiciously like the crappy Ortega stuff you buy in the supermarket.  My shrimp dish was so disastrous that I only ate half of it because I was afraid it might make me sick.  The shrimp were overcooked to the point of turning into rubber, and the sauce was nauseating.  The rice was overcooked and dry, and the green salad of lettuce and carrots was steamed!   This was without a doubt the worst mexican I have ever eaten in my life.\n\nMy wife thought her tacos were bland, but much more edible than my shrimp, even though the cheese was not authentic, or tasty at all."
1,"wasn't the ownership change at the time in 2004... It was the cook, and recipe change that killed it. Went there for lunch, new owners... Horrible... Zero stars"
1,"Sloooow service. Basically they seat you and forget about you. I watched it happen to everyone who came in. Food wasn't very good, either."
1,"Tick, tock. Tick tock. This line is not moving. Tick, tock. But ooooh, I think I'm still drunk and I NEED this coffee. Tick, tick, tick. I even have a Starbucks RedCard so I can donate a bit of the money from my hangover healant back to AIDS research and take advantage of some wifi! This will be worth it... I hope. Tick. Omg, now I have to pee!! Tick. Tock. Tick. This is torture. Tock.\n\nFINALLY, it's my turn!  But wait... Out of croissants? And there's no wifi?? Seriously, you don't accept your own Starbucks cards?!? Well you didn't have to be rude about it. Time's up, this place is an absolute waste."
1,"I can't even rate this bar due to the very upsetting experience. I use to go to this bar and brought 5-8 people every time. We love the food and I even enjoy gambling. The servers have been wonderful. But I went in with my boyfriend on Sat Feb. 11th, 2012 to have lunch, drinks and to watch the UNLV game. When we arrived at NOON every table and chair was reserved with half of the place empty. So a large well built gentleman came out of the kitchen and I walked up to him and said, if every place is reserved can you help us find a place to sit. Without asking us, he turned to this couple and said can 2 people sit with you? I do not mind sitting with people, but it was a set of seats that had our backs to the large TVs and we had to look across the room to very little tvs. We asked for another area and he gave us attitude. VERY VERY BAD service.... apparently they did not want my business and word of mouth has hurt other businesses that I have gone too. Too bad they do not know how to treat their customers and a great idea would be first com first serve!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Stopped by this location after a doctor appointment because we we're starving...\n\nThe girl at the cashier station didn't acknowledged us because she was having issues trying to figure out how to split a payment...\n\nOnce she did say \""hi\"" to us and took us to a booth that still had the tip from the previous customers we waited for about 15 minutes and no one even offered us drinks so we just walked out...\n\nFound a Farmer Boys a mile an a half away & had a great meal there for half the price of what we would've spent at Denny's..."
1,"If you are searching for a Condo, find a Condo.. THESE ARE APARTMENTS!!  Not condos.  The speed bumps are horrible, parking is ridiculous.  And since they are privately owned, ANYONE and I mean ANYONE can move in.  Some of the loudest and rudest people.  And to get Security to get off their lazy bums is not going to happen. Unless they happen to be out on patrol.  Its a gated community yet cars are broken into, or spray painted on.  HOA is of no help either, not to mention if you end up buying be leary.. They allow HUD!  Which brings the property value down on your home.  But alas some of us are stuck here in the POINTS recreation.  Until we can get out of the screw ball of paying mortgage too high for an APARTMENT!  Its just not worth it."
1,"After my previous bad reviews I vowed to only come to this Sonic during Happy Hour for half price drinks. Turns out they can't do that right, either! Came with hubby and daughter who both ordered those drinks with the Nerds in them. We went through the drive-thru...get halfway home and ask my hubby if I can try his, so I do and I say \""well the cherry part is good but I didn't get any Nerds\""...he says \""yeah I didn't taste any either\"" so we open it up and there are NO NERDS. Open up our daughter's and...NO NERDS there either! Not worth driving back just to get Nerds...just highly disappointing, although not surprising."
1,"I wouldn't recommend this caf\u00e9.  DH had a hankering for beignets.  I asked three people in the restaurant if they had beignets that night, and they said yes.  Then we sit down, order beignets and French onion soup.  The waiter comes back a few minutes later to say that they don't have beignets after all.  The French onion soup was also extremely salty.  I could not eat it.  There are plenty of French cafes on the Strip.  Seek one elsewhere."
1,"Went there today and the waitress was beyond rude. Another waitress came over and gave us chips and salsa. Our group thought chips and salsa came with the meal, so we started eating then. Our waitress then asked who was going to pay for the chips they gave to us.... We refused to pay that was not our mistake.\n\nThe waitress then asked us 3 different times how we are going to pay for 8 of us. We asked every time to please separate the bills. She not only rolled her eyes, but she said \""okay then...\"" in a rude tone. I would not go back to this particular location. \n\nWe also had to asked 3 times for waters and the drinks that we ordered. Finally the manger came over to help.  The only thing that evened out the trip was the fact the food was actually good...."
1,I knew I shouldn't have stopped.  All my other visits over the years had been terrible but I was really craving fried shimp and couldn't imagine how they could screw it up.  Well...$8 later after eating 3 flavorless greasy shrimp and picking at the fish I threw it away because I knew I was going to throw up if I ate any more.  It was THAT bad.  Where is the corporate or owner quality control on this product and to make it worse the cashier was an idiot lost in his own world - What's a combo...dah it's a number 9 with chicken.  OK what's a number 9?
1,"Have you ever gone to a restaurant and the food was good, but the service and customer service was so bad that you can't ever walk through the doors again? For me that is my experience at Rosati's tonight. I placed a phone order after looking at their menu that was posted on their website. I had the order amount in my head based on the prices on the website menu. When I questioned the total to the cashier, she printed out the prices. I asked her if she knew that the prices on my bill were different than those on the website menu. She told me something that really didn't make sense. I replied that I thought they should charge me the prices from the website menu. She just gave me my change and didn't even say thank you (I guess the attitude started). I asked to speak with the manager, but she said he wasn't there. If it were my restaurant, I would have gladly matched the prices that were on the website menu, no questions asked or attitude given. Another sorry example of good food that is outweighed by bad and/or rude customer service."
1,"For reasons I don't fully understand I tried to eat here tonight.  As usual getting a seat was a chore...whether the place is crowded or not (not in this case).\n\nAnyhow I sit down, menus arrive and then some moron walks up to talk with the folks in the table behind me and he's smoking a e-pipe!!!!   Really!!!!????  WTF!!!!!\n\nCheesecake Factory I'm putting this one on you for allowing it to happen. \n\nI'm done with you.\n\nIf zero was a choice I'd go with that."
1,"It sounds like the food here is spectacular and I wish I'd have been able to try it. Unfortunately, I'm not cool with being pointedly ignored when I walk in somewhere and say hello to the person behind the counter. \n\nLong story short I walked in, was ignored. Went to counter, was ignored. Got order taken, tried to use a coupon, the lady said \""No.\"" \""I can't use it?\"" \""No.\"" \n\nOh. Alright.\n\nI was ordering the daily special and wanted to use an Entertainment coupon. I'd have understood if she had been really nice and just let me know that she would be losing money on a coupon. Then I'd have pocketed the coupon and went about with the order. I just don't like being treated like a stupid jerk. I get ignored and given attitude like this when I wear a name badge, I don't need it when I enter an establishment to spend money. So I told her I'd just go somewhere else and she shrugged.\n\nNo big loss for either of us, I suppose!"
1,"I eat at cafe rio at least once a week. Not once has it crossed my mind to write a review because the food speaks for it's self. Unfortunately I had a horrible experience with the cashier at this location so I felt the need to write a review. The line was extremely long and not to order your food, to pay. Might want to look into hiring competent workers, who actually want to work and not gossip while the line backs up."
1,We had a group of 13 of us today for a birthday/football get together .. Let me tell you that this place SUCKS \nWe never even made it thru the door and this goon of a door man was looking at us \nGeez dude it's Sunday football and it's Scottsdale\nWe were dressed appropriately . Bottom line is\nThis place SUCKS way better places in Scottsdale\nThen this doucher don't waste your money here
1,"I rarely write reviews so for me to sign up and write a review means it was THAT BAD!  Where to start...I paid over $40.00 for an oil change and upgraded car wash-when it was all said and done, the interior of my car was not clean, the side door panels hadn't been wiped off at all and my car started leaking some fluid. The mechanic kept trying to get me to pay for extra services...he would say, \""I just noticed one thing...\"" then when I didn't want to pay for that \""thing\"", he proceeded to notice another \""thing\"" and another \""thing\"". Additionally, I noticed scratches on the outside of my car that I hadn't noticed before and my son witnessed one of the employees flashing gang signs. Needless to say, even when my car was leaking fluid after my visit, I wasn't about to take my car back...NOT EVER."
1,"I have always had a good time at Top Shelf, but last nights visit proved different.  Are server was preoccupied with a baby at the bar then taking care of his customers.  I ate 2/3 of my dinner without anything to drink because he didn't check on us.  My food was cold and my tacos were so greasy that the grease was pouring out the bottom and the shells fell apart. While still finishing my undelightful  dinner, the server finally asked if we needed anything else or wanted desert.  I asked for water and my husband asked for more tea.  It took over 5 minutes to get the drinks.  My husbands tea glass was completely packed with ice and 2/3 full with tea, there was so much ice that he could not even mix a sweet n low in it. I will try one more time, but think I may have to love on to somewhere else."
1,I gave this place a chance. Numerous times...but I now feel 100% confident in saying I will NEVER walk into this location ever again. The clothes are cheap and worth the one or two wears...but I refuse to look or speak to any of those RUDE employees. It's like you ruin their day asking for something. HR did a great job hiring the worst group of people ever. Have I mentioned that awful high pitched alarm that is constantly going off at the register?? I'll take my 20 bucks to one at Fashion Square.
1,"I took my 3 kids here, spent $40 and regretted every dollar! We won't be returning. There's much better buffets in town, I definitely don't recommend this one."
1,"Horrible. I wasn't thrilled the first time I went. My gel manicure came out bubbly and started cracking. When I went back a couple weeks later for a polish change, Cindy the Mutilator had me \""soak\"" my fingers in acetone for all of 1 second before she took a dremel to my nails (mind you, my REAL nails, NOT acrylic!) and proceeded to cut the cuticle and skin of six of my fingers. How the other four escaped her wrath, I don't know. Then she had me soak again in acetone and then alcohol - ow, ow, ow! I was in tears. Now here I am with six bleeding phallanges and was still expected to pay full price. Never again! There are hundreds of nail salons out there, DO NOT GO HERE!"
1,"I went to the bar last night (sat) and it took FOREVER to get my drink. I order a Long Island, when I got it the drink was CLEAR! I told the bartender \""Ashely\"" that my drink wasn't right and she had the nerve to take a drink out of my drink and told me \""it taste fine and I not making you a new one\""! WTF don't ever go here!"
1,Purchased a LocalDine and was anxious to try the place.  Went on Fri 5/24/13  to find out that their contract expired on 5/20 so they would not honor my July expiration coupon.  Food was very mediocre and not impressed with any of our three choices.  One slice of turkey in a $9 sandwich!!  Yikes.  We will not return.
1,"I'm a snob when it comes to restaurant service.  I expect good service and tip accordingly.  The service did not disappoint.  The food, however, needs some major revamping.  I had a half a rack of their supposedly award winning baby back ribs.  The meat was dry and had absolutely no flavor.  The two sides I ordered were the fried okra and the mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese looked and tasted like it came out of a Kraft Mac and Cheese box.  Also had the three item sampler:  onion straws, fried pickles, and burnt ends.  I kid you not, there was literally a puddle of oil under the wax paper in the basket that held the appetizers.  TGIF's baby back ribs are much more flavorful and their meat is much more savory.  Will definitely not be returning to this place.  Plus one star for the service experienced."
1,"I went in and asked if I could get my computer that was repaired. The employee responded with, \""I don't know, can you?\""\n\nHis response was rude  and very uncomfortable. He then made me wait for 25 minutes as he continued to just stand around. \n\nOnce again, terrible experience. Do NOT go to this store."
1,The servers were extremely rude and rushy. \nThe man wouldnt allow us to get our table until everyone arrived. Even though 5/7 people were already there. We didnt get our drinks until 25 mins after we were seated. Food wasnt that flavorful. The servers don't make eyecontact with you and The tables are extremely close to each other.
1,"Food is not anything special and hibachi is way overpriced. While dining an ant crawled off my sisters plate and when we told them about it they made it seem like we were making it up, however later on in the night more ants appeared on our table and when we told the sever she wiped the table down with a dish rag and went on with no care. For a meal that was over $150 I expected better service and a much cleaner atmosphere. If you're thinking of coming here maybe try Ohjah instead; cleaner atmosphere, tastier food, fresher sushi, and much better customer service."
1,I have been with sprint for 10 plus years..I have never had a 4G phone with fast service.. I use to pay for it each month.. They have been saying the same shit for 5 years the towers are not up yet.. Don't buy it.
1,"Not sure wha happen?  Have been here a few time but normally earlier in the day for lunch but this past Friday about 4pm the service was simple bad and rude. Understand I am a long time Wahooer (I lived in the O.C. and have gladly wait in line at the one on Bristol many time for lunch) but walking into a place for a taco and getting the cold shoulder (it was thefirst time I have every had to ask for a menu and had to flag down the server/bartender to take an order...I would understand if they were busy but they were not).  I was in the bar area and was told by the Manager \""that I would have to move because their we people how would play the machine (while patting her hand on the bar counter in front of the video gambling machine -- Now, that was a first...Vegas is very much about the drink and the gamble but that does not mean simple service  go to \""shit\"".  The cold shoulder and the curt atitude was just uncalled for, so I will just reserve my Wahoo fix for when I am back in OC since this one does not have the spirit of atmosphere of the true WAHOO.  And that's just sad"
1,"The staff here are unbelievably bad , they have no business working here, it makes me angry to think of all the unemployed people and then they hire these snot nosed kids to work here..they are polite to who they want to be and rude to others. Right in the middle of my order at the counter the girl walks away and starts working on other tasks for over five minutes!! Unreal!! I had to yell back at her to get her to come back over, the food wasn't anything special and tasted like I warmed it up in the microwave at home, not to mention it took over 20 minutes to get a sub sandwich and a slice of pizza. I was ashamed to be spending any of my time or money in this \""business\"". They need to learn the meaning of treating ALL customers with respect."
1,"Simple Pros & Cons:\n\nPros:\nGood Location if you're close\n\nCons:\nExtremely unprofessional and rude staff (3 of 3 times I went)\nBy appt were behind in schedule even in the morning - attendance?\n\nPlace was like mid 60s or below, people were staring at each other with fear when AC woudl turn on, while it's 100 outside. \n\nWithout appointment I waited for over an hour then asked staff when might I be finally taken in approximately and was told, \""I don't know\"", so I finally left. \n\nIn Sum - Unless you want mental abuse from the staff, waste of time for the wait, and flu from other people and mid-low 60s freeze, go to the \""normal\"" Summerlin Labcorp, if even a little drive more."
1,I just purchased a glazed and chocolate covered donut here. Both were very stale and must have been sitting on the shelf for a  very long time. I took one bite from each then threw them into the trash where they belong. You would think Dunkin Donuts would keep fresh goods on their shelves.
1,Beware! If you're a darker skinned person or do not fit the culture they will discriminate against you.  Waited 20 minutes fir pho that takes a few minutes to prep.  Went with my best friend and we're never going back.  I thought that we were beyond that. ...smh
1,"Overpriced and food wasn't good! It was a wild place with all the going on with the employees dressing up going around giving free shots etc., but food was bad and pricey!"
1,"i usually do not take the time to do this, so please hear me out to make a different hotel choice!  rude is the word of the weekend...from the waitors to the vallet to the house keeping. so extremely let down..i was looking forward to staying at \""the paris\"" ..the room was dirty (stains), out dated (no ipod plug in), chipped up bath tub. i have stayed at nicer hotels in downtown... btw...make sure when someone knocks on the door you run to the door fast, house keeping will open the door and find you naked!!! will never ever stay here again!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"I purchased an $8 Groupon good for $16 for this Quiznos.  You'd think it should be pretty simple for someone of High School graduate age to ring up an order, subtract $16 and then give me the correct total, right?  WRONG!!!!!  They took off $7.36 pre-tax and then $8 post-tax.  The entire $16 should have been subtracted PRE-TAX like a coupon (in fact, like their combo discount).  But no!  Their method gyps the Groupon user out of an additional $1.34 on a $16 Groupon, on top of their outrageous prices because they're located in a strip casino food court.  STAY AWAY!!!!"
1,"food was 7/10, however the service was absolutely atrocious.  the place is understaffed and nobody took our order or even offered to get us drinks for 15 minutes. the couple sitting next to us had been waiting even longer.  this is such a shame for a restaurant to be held back its service, of all things."
1,"What can I say about this place? I've been here three times and every time it was the same and I tried to give this place a chance because I really enjoy the selections here. Coming into the lot there is garbage everywhere and the building itself looks pretty run down. The wait times for food in drive-thru and while parking are outrageous, I thought this was supposed to be fast food?! There are never enough workers here and they look exhausted trying to limp through the rush and on my last visit when I went inside to complain I noticed one of the cooks had what looked to be like sores all over his arms. The inside was a disaster and there was no organization or real leadership here I'm honestly surprised this place is still open."
1,"So, we went here late one night craving donuts. We ordered through the drive-thru, and when we drove away we found they messed up our order. No biggie, it happens, so we pull around and ask to replace them. What do they do with the donuts we didn't want? Put them back on the shelf to sell to someone else. We had the donuts in our possession for 3 solid minutes. Fortunately, we're not crazy people who would sprinkle cyanide on donuts."
1,The taxi never showed up. I had this experience twice. They didn't show up after I called at 5 am when no one else would need a taxi. They suck. Don't use them.
1,"i hardly can remember this course without seeing the scorecard. Its nice and affordable and you can't miss the big water fountain and i can't stop talking about it when ever Kokopelli is in the discussion. i guess i will go back for a refresh.\n\nEdited Nov 3 2013:-\ni managed to revisit this course and i would instantly drop my rating from 4 to 1. If you like to see your score in lower numbers by all means go to this course. Flat, straight, no trees to intimidate and very forgiving and you don't have to think, just swing. i dont stay here long enough and play often enough but this course to my short observation is not as pack as the other courses around, say Superstition, Ken MacDonald, Dobson.... etc. i tee off alone and ended up foursome at 11th hole. anyway the deserted course couple with very forgiving course layout i managed to finish the 18 in less than 3 hours, and i might add, shooting in the mid 70s. to boost your ego yea play Koko or else, for visitors spend your money at Las Sendas, Southern Dunes, Foothills, Clubwest, Ocotillo and many more. (these mentioned above are the ones i like better) and they are better course design compare to Kokopelli.\n\ni will not revisit this course as a visitor with limited time to play. not even $5 a game entice me to play here again."
1,My friends and I had broth that was sooooo salty. And this was our second time coming here.  The waiter brought out an order wrong and blamed it on my entire group. We were completely baffled as to why this waiter was blaming us.  We just wanted to get the what we ordered. \n\nExtremely rude service. I rather go down the street to lemon grass.  The waiters are nice and the soup taste cleaner and not pumped up with MSG.
1,$45 for two frozen machine margaritas and two shots of Sammy Hagar's shit tequila.  They print on receipt suggested tip of $12.  This place stunk like they had sewer issues behind the bar.  It left such a bad taste in my mouth that I will flip the station next time I hear a Sammy Hagar song.
1,"After taking three afternoons off work to wait for technicians that never showed up, my internet was finally installed, at which point I was informed that even though I ordered wireless, wireless isn't available unless you pay an extra $11 monthly fee for the router. The technician (a very nice guy) advised me to purchase my own router, which I did. When I called Time Warner to register the IP, I was informed that there is a separate $7 a month fee to use your own router.  HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE COMPANY. I hope all the CEOs get halitosis and their wives leave them for John Mayer."
1,"This is the closest grocery store to me, but I try as hard as possible to avoid it. I now only go for certain items like milk which they can't over charge for. Most things are too expensive here. The Fruterie next door has better produce at much better prices. Constantly understaffed. Last time I was there they didn't even have plain pitas and when I got to the cash, the clerk was blowing her nose. She then proceeded to touch all my groceries without washing her hands or using anti-bacterial foam, with both options right next to the cash! Disgusting."
1,"If I could give this salon negative stars I would! I had the worst experience with the owner Eli! I went to the salon for highlights and extensions. I was at the salon for 6 plus hours! He jumped from one client to another. He started with my hair and did 4 other clients in between while I waited!! Finally he finished and I just wanted to get out if there. When I got home and took a closer look at my highlights, they were yellow. I asked if he used a toner and he said no. He didn't offer to tone my hair or fix the color. I had to go to another salon to have them tone it. In a matter of days my extensions (that Eli did) started to fall out. He told me to come back and he would fix them, which he did but in a matter weeks all my extensions fell out! So AGAIN I had to go to another salon to redo/fix my highlights and extensions. I asked Eli for a refund due to the poor job he did and the lack of effort in which he tried to fix my hair! I bought my own extensions which cost $400.  He charged me $400 but only offered to refund me $100! I had to threaten to take him to small claims court for him to only refund me $150. This was months later so I just took the $150. I would never recommend this place to anyone!!"
1,"This is, by far, the WORST Corporate Starbucks I've ever been to. The service is horrible, it takes longer than necessary to receive my drinks and everything is always so messy. The only reason why I keep coming back here is the convenience because I live right down the street.\nI work at the Starbucks in the Mandalay Bay next to the House of Blues, and even though it's not a corporate Starbucks, we still hold all the same procedures and values. \nWhenever I go into this particular Starbucks, it takes forever to be acknowledged if it's not busy. When my order is being taken, they're usually very rude or preoccupied with things other than their actual job- for example they're talking to eachother about their personal lives or how their shift has been going. If I just order one drink it will take around 5 - 10 minutes, depending on how distracted by conversation the baristas are. If I need milk from the condiment bar, it's usually expired already or there is no milk at all.\nForget it if I'm going through the drive thru. I have about three different rewards accumulated on my Starbucks cards because when I let them know that I have a reward, I just get ignored and they charge me the full price anyway.\nLong story short, the workers give off a nasty, snarky attitude and they take forever to make the simplest of things."
1,"This show was awful.  I've been to many Cirque shows and I have no idea how they allow this show to exist.  There were minimal acrobatics, just a lot of toplessness and bad jokes.  That's $88 and 2 hours of my life I'll never get back."
1,"I really do not have words to describe the awful customer service. AMEX notified me of a potential fraud alert. Turns out the taxi driver charged my card $1,200 for a six-block taxi ride. When I called to try to get the problem fixed, the customer agent informed me that this was my problem and their was not anything she could do. She informed me to call my credit card company. When I told her they informed me to call them, she said \""well, I can't help you.\"" Please do not support this business."
1,Use to come here all the time! What happened? Very rude staff. Sat inside dust all over every where lamps etc. food does not carry the same quality! Sad to experience this... NEVER COMING BACK!!!!!
1,I want to like this place because it is near the house but the incredibly poor service makes that impossible.   With so many people out of work you would think they would be able to hire someone mildly competent.
1,"Bad service\nPubic hair and make up on \""clean\"" towel\nDirty room\n3 out of 3 restaurants on property\nDelivered sub-standard food quality and service.\nInsect in bed (see photo)\nWill never return.\nEnough said."
1,Service was fine but the worst corn beef hash I have ever had. Really ruined the whole meal. The server was polite but didn't seem to know what to do. There are so many better options around here.
1,I would stay as far away from this place as possible. I bought a 2007 Cobalt from these rip off artists and it had 80K miles on it so it should have last more than four years. The car died this week and I had nothing but problems with it from the time I drove it off the lot.
1,"The size of the servings is almost immoral. There is a $3 charge for sharing, which if you come to think about it, would not make it a bad deal if you both happen to want to partake of the same disgusting sandwich. The quality of the food and its size are in inverse proportion; our meat was dry, tasteless, visually revolting,  anchored by two slivers of bread to justify calling it a sandwich and not a chunk of dead dry beef. The worst sin was the chicken soup, that traditional icon of soothing relief; yellow liquid with a taste of having recently sprinkled or dissolved from an envelop or a cube, sodium being the preponderate flavor. \nCan't believe the place is so popular, but in Las Vegas everything is possible, I guess."
1,"Blown away at horrible my experience!  I'll keep it short as I don't want to waste any more of my time in this place.  I took my wife and her parents and we went on a Sat afternoon - busy but not incredibly busy.  What went wrong??  .....ordered a bowl of soup and received a cup (without soup crackers).  I had to track down server and tell him.  He said he would bring another cup...it never came.  I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and it came out with LESS THAN ROOM TEMP fries.  If that wasn't enough...the grilled sourdough from the sandwich was COLD!!  Needless to say, I provided feedback, did not accept any other food or compensation and will NEVER return!  Even though I can't stand Denny's I would have rather eaten there!!!  YUCK! Save your money and avoid this place!"
1,"Whole Paycheck prices, over $400 for a small cart of food is absurd!  Vitamin products are full retail prices in most cases, buy online and you can save 50%!  Wayne Gorsek"
1,"Incredibly slow service (25 minutes to get 3 basic tacos) and tacos are average at best.  My batch was very salty, but seeing the wait and the relative absence of attention to customers, I didn't bother to do anything about it. The menu is very short and routine extras like added cheese or salsa require added payment. Maybe the other yelpers had an exceptional experience with the burritos, but this is my review based on what I sampled.  There is just nothing redeeming to explain the level of loyalty this location garners.  There is no indoor seating;  you cant eat outdoors on the provided plastic picnic table on a sunny day without risking a skin burn!.  On the inside you face a server who takes your order from behind a grill; there are at most 4-5 plastic chairs to sit on while you wait.  Reminds me of a traditional western jailhouse except someone is actually taking food orders."
1,"After being asked by a fellow yelper to elaborate, here it goes. \n\nWe approached the hostess and asked for a table for 3 plus a high chair. When she jokingly said \""no\"" I laughed and proceeded to ask for a menu to which she again replied \""no\""! I guess this was her attempt at humor, however after the first time, it seemed to have lost something. By the way, she never really indicated that she was joking.\n\nSo, $50, 1 ceasar salad, 1 spinach chicken whatever salad,  a kids chicken tender meal w/ browning apples, and a failed attempt at a pollo poblano burrito later we were on our way to catch our flight. \n\nOh, in between sitting down and paying the check, the service was sub-par to say the least and worse than the cold, soggy burrito and rubberized tenders. The waitress never picked up our menus and never once smiled. \n\nWhile I understand we ate at an airport, this is unacceptable. Next time I'll be sure to read up on more yelp reviews before I waste a meal here. \n\nThey'll be hearing from me soon."
1,"If I was allowed to give just one \""Worst of Yelp Awards\"" this would be it.\n\nThe Cards must have about 10,000 fans show up for games because the logistics for the National Championship game was a disaster. It was like this was the first event they ever held.\n\nProblems (So many - I'm sure I'll leave something out)\n\n1. No concessions to be found anywhere outside stadium\n2. Inside concessions ran out of hot dogs, cups and beer any many spots before halftime.\n3. Parking lot security was yelling at everyone\n4. There were only 4 gates for 70+ thousand fans\n5. Jumbotrons - small\n6. Barely could hear the stadium announcer\n7. They wouldn't show a replay and then they would put an ad up saying replays brought to you by....\n8. Only a couple of escalators for the upper decks that fit one person at a time.\n\nThis stadium does not deserve a BCS game and I hope it gets yanked from the smallest of the stadiums involved."
1,"As I am writing this review I have yet to see my food. We have been given complimentary chips & salsa. However, I have seen 2 other tables get their food before me. This is terrible service...please beware of this chili's as you will wait for food for it to be warm."
1,Worst service ever!!!!\nThis office doesn't answer phone calls. They were supposed to pick us up from the hotel and never showed up. This office should be closed!
1,"They charged me \u00a32 for wi-fi!\nAny place who charge for bread, water and or wi-fi will get a bad review.\n\nAnd food is average, average prices, average service.\n\nIt used to be such an amasing place ( 5 yrs ago) - what did happen?\n\n\u00a32 to use the wi-fi...."
1,AVIS is the WORST. Terribly high prices and they don't even care about lowering their price when you find a competitor is lower (which is all competitors it looks like). Booked days in advance so we chose the pay now option since it was cheaper. When we found an option on Alamo which was HALF the cost and cancelled they charged us $25. If we had chosen the pay later option (at the airport) we wouldn't have been charged. Contacted customer service and they didn't care. We are never renting from Avis ever again and neither should you.
1,"Only ordered from this place because it was convenient. Last 2 times was very disappointing. Probably will not go again.  Too many kids running the place with no visible manager to give them direction.  They forget about orders, don't care how they come out and really are going to take a good investment and ruin it for the manager/owner.  Try another place if you can help it."
1,Been going here forever. Today they lost a string to my maternity shirt. Really disappointed. Time to change dry cleaners.
1,"Ugh if I could give this place -10 stars I would. What a nightmare. To start, the first time I ate here, I almost swallowed a giant shard of plastic that was in my salad. Then to my horror, the bar tending goes \""whoops.\"" and tosses it on the floor!! \n\nFast forward a couple months, I decide to give this place a second chance. (I must have been delirious from hunger.)\nFirst off the bar tender was rude, slow as hell and terrible at making drinks. My friend and myself order our food and 20 min later out comes my friends food. After almost an hour of waiting, I still had NO pizza. When I asked the cranky pants bar tender in the NICEST possible way, where it was, he just shrugged and walked away. I asked to speak to a manager and was told he was \""busy.\"" Finally someone came to talk to me and after an hour and a half I got my shitty pizza. \nThank you to the kitchen manager for doing his job and coming to talk to the customer. But, to the bar tender working earlier New Year's Eve. You DO NOT DESERVE THIS JOB AND SHOULD BE FIRED."
1,"Josh was our pool guy, he never communicated with us about what he did with the pool and then when he did talk he had a lengthy explanation or excuse about every circumstance. After the pool turned green I had the water tested at Leslie pool supply and there was zero chlorine in the water a mere day after he had come to see the pool. Upon confronting him about this he ended his service with us but did not tell us that he had done so for 2 months after. Very disappointing and a poorly run business."
1,"Just like the club, TAO Beach is waayyyy overrated.  Sure, the girls get in for free, but the boys have to pay $20.  I have to admit that when I first came here, I was super excited!  The music that can be heard from outside the place was awesome! If you like top 40 music mixed with electropop then this place provides.  The thing is..you seriously don't need to be in this place to hear the great music.  It can be heard from the regular Venetian pool that's right next to it bc it's so freaking loud.  Plus you have more room to swim, let alone walk around, cuz TAO Beach is so DINKY! Unless you have a cabana or whatever, this place isn't worth going to.  My friends and I were seriously in and out.  We got a cool bracelet though! Hahah.  That's really the only thing I would go there for- the novelty bracelet (sad huh? ahah).  \n\nBasically, everything's the same for TAO (club).  Small, crowded, and stinkin' overrated. Sorry guys but usually first time noobies (i.e. just turned 21 year olds) hit this place up and will soon realize what a sucky place it is.  On the plus side, there are hot naked girls in the tubs inside the club! Other than that, blah to everything TAO."
1,"This place is awful! I'm pretty sure the whole \""discounted\"" term they use is a gimmick to fool people into thinking they're paying less! \n\nI went into Michael kors looking for a watch and was told it was $350...that's how much they are at the store inside fashion square and they're only $275 at Dillard's. so don't tell me it's a \""discounted\"" place. \n\nCharlotte Russe has their shoes for buy one get one for $12.50...at the non outlet store it's buy one get one for $15.50. \n\nThe H&M has the same prices as the one in Scottsdale. \n\nI've never liked outlet malls, but this one takes the cake for being the worst."
1,Place sucks...long lines poor customer service. First u stand in a amazingly long line to get the fabric cut and then a equally long line for checkout... darn my kids art project.....
1,"Bad customer service here and people are super slow.\n\nI asked the waiter to add one more item to our order and he said he doesn't know who our table helper is and simply left - without letting us know whether he added or not.\n\nSecondly, it took an hour to get the order.\n\nOverall super bad experience."
1,"The reason I Yelp is for entertainment and because I use the reviews from others to choose where I spend my money, so I like doing my part by sharing my own experiences. My intention is not to get free stuff. Ever. I rarely write negative reviews, and the reason I wrote a negative review for Zoe's was because I believe the conditions of the restaurant were a health risk. That being said, here is my update. So one of the managers from Zoe's asks for my phone number so he can find out more information. I give it to him, willing to share my experience. He calls me, hears me out, and apologizes. Then he asks for my address so he can send me a gift certificate. Unnecessary, I tell him, but nice touch. So I give him my address. Now, 2 weeks later, nothing. I messaged the customer service person who had contacted me initially just to let her know the gift card had not arrived. Just pretty surprising the level of poor management. I am no longer wondering what happen to Zoe's because it is pretty self evident."
1,Their regular customers are not very friendly if you are not a packers fan. We had great service from our waitress. This place is perfect for a Green Bay packers fan. Their wings were good.
1,"I thought I'd try this place again, but that was a bad decision! My salad had watery brown lettuce, brown watery guacamole and was honestly just gross. It is over $10 for a salad here and that is crazy to me since its neighbors are Gadzooks and Chipotle where I can get 4-5* quality for at least a couple of dollars less."
1,"over rated crap\nwanted to go bad to this place after i saw man vs food.  Of course they see that it will go on TV and give Adam the biggest and juiciest crawfish but for us we get crappy tiny crawfish that were not even fresh.  Most likely they gave us frozen.  Ordered 2 lbs and probably got few ounces of meat only.  The weight of the head and left over skin came out to be 2 lbs.\nI know they got popular cuz of man vs food.  but they should come out on man vs crap\n\nDON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE,  JUST HEAD TO WYNN AND HIT THE BUFFET"
1,"We went here on Labor day 2014. We walk in and there's at least 20 open tables, (no lie) and they tell us there's a 15 minute wait. and they have at least 3 other parties standing around waiting for a table. I asked, \""why would you make us wait if you have at least 20 open tables?\"" The hostess replied, \""well we have a few large parties so, we're not seating.\""\n Let me tell you, I've been here before and the food is just ok. Basic diner style food, so they should be doing everything they can to fill those empty tables, especially in a competitive restaurant market.\nVery disappointed, won't be going back. Too many better choices to waste my time here."
1,Went here with some coworkers for lunch. Was not impressed with the pizza at all. The garlic bread tasted store bought. Will not return.
1,"I came the week before Thanksgiving, which generally feels like a off-season time, so many things were much quieter and less crowded overall in Vegas.\n\nPros:\nMy room was dead quiet. I never heard a peep from any other people my entire stay, let alone really saw any other people.\n\nThe location was perfect - I prefer off the strip.\n\nGreat decor. I picked this hotel for that reason - something different. Cozy, no gambling, or shows, or late night bars, just quiet. Ahhh... :)\n\nFree parking, free wifi....I think (noticed a funny charge for $100 this morning...)\n\nCons:\nThe CHILDREN in charge of checking people in need a lesson in manners and customer service. Extremely unhelpful.  I booked through Priceline and paid the room in full MONTHS ahead. Even called days before to confirm my reservation.  I get there after a 5hr drive and they say I need to pay $75/per night for \""incidentals\"".  I've NEVER been charged a fee that huge at a hotel. I didn't have an extra $150 as my paycheck didn't go through until midnight. They said they couldn't help me. I was able to convince them to charge me just $75 for the first night and that I would settle the second $75 in the morning - no f&*ing way was I going to sleep in my car till midnight when I had already paid for my room.  That's just BAD BUSINESS.\n\nStay somewhere else. The business ethics of this place are shady and the staff are bored apathetic teens."
1,"I'm sorry, but this is not a Pad Thai, the food was awful... the service.. nobody checked on us, I have to look for somebody to bring me the bill. Never ever back here!!!"
1,I sought out Jamba Juice their highlighted drink with the giant picture- that's what I wanted. But they were missing two of the four ingredients! I'll never go back there again
1,"What do they fill the windshield washer bucket with? Swamp water? Port-a-potty \""juice\""? I'm all for recycling but this was so disgusting.  My husband spilled one drop on his shoe, and even though he wiped it immediately with some baby wipes we had in the car, it didn't matter.  As we drove away from the gas station I was noticing the skunk scent, I couldn't stand the smell.  I made him turn around and go to the grocery store bathroom to wash his shoe.  YUK!  Those shoes are going in the dumpster."
1,"The pizza is decent, but delivery is an epic failure.  Put an order online at 6:50 PM.  Estimated delivery was 7:50 PM, which is long to begin with considering that Wolfman is only 2 miles away from my address.  At 8:00 PM called and was told the order went out the door.  At 8:20 PM called and was told general manager was now delivering the pizza.  At 8:50 PM (2 hours after ordering) called again and found out the order was never pulled from online.  Bad process and bad employees who lied twice times.\n\nPizza maybe, technology no.  Don't order from Wolfman unless you are going to sit there or pick it up yourself.\n\nEpic fail!"
1,"Worst Apple Store Ever. (If you're an American)\n\nThis is a store that is frequently visited by Las Vegas foreign tourists. I'm not slamming anyone for pointing that out, but it is a major factor in why this is such a different store than the rest. The employees simply don't care or try. You walk in and there is NOBODY that will greet you, and thats because they know they'll make their sales regardless of their efforts. The \""tourists\"" are going to buy no matter what and they know it so the employee (and management) effort is minimal."
1,"Its not Tacos El Gordo!! I came to this location twice, first time it was good enough for us not to make the drive to Tacos El Gordo for a fix. But the second time (which was on the same week) just failed. The lady at the burrito area was talking crap in spanish calling us stupid and mentally slow. Now this is all due to a warmed up tortilla that she had to throw away. We ordered two burritos, when she was done making the first i politely asked to change the order to carne asada fries. Thats when she started talking crap and didn't realize i understood her. So everyone was laughing at us and then i ordered two tacos, one seso and one cabeza. The guy tells me just pay your order and ill get it to you. Both tacos smelled rancid and tasted old. I didn't touch it after that. \n\nWhats really terrible about this is that it all started by that this older lady at the burrito area named Veronica who had to throw away a warmed up tortilla and the fact that it only took a thrown warmed tortilla too intentionally try to give you food poisoning. \n\nThis experience is at the Tropicana location. Well were never coming here again. Unfortunately, we wont even try the other location."
1,These reviews are so right this is the worst store I have ever been to. There is a man who works there named Jason that is the rudest person I have ever met.  I have only found one sales person in there that knows what they are doing and has a good attitude.
1,I wish there was less than 1 star because now that they don't have flour chips there is no point..... It is just another Mexican restaurant :-( Super bummer.
1,Worst food I've tasted since 1995. Service was terrible and the filet mignon was cardboard. Very disappointed. Will never return
1,"Please go elsewhere!!!\n\nI was the first one in at 7:30 am to replace my tires and get an oil change.  The shady service writer tried to sell me his own tires from his personal vehicle that he stored in the back. That should have been the first sign to get out. \n\nSince he said it was going to be 2 hours, I decided to wait in the lounge. Two hours later, the mechanics were just chit chatting in the shop, taking their time and my car was still on the lift.  After 4 hours of waiting, I was pissed and they knew it so I was offered a ride home.  \n\nTo my surprised, after the service was finally done (8 hours later), they delivered my car to my house.  So, I thanked and tipped them.  Well, 2 months later, I traded my car in and the dealership advised me that my oil dip stick handle broke off completely. Those MFer's at Goodyear broke it off knowing full well I would not be looking under the hood for sometime! Who knows what else they did to my car?!!\n\nI'll tell everyone I know about my experience so it doesn't happen to them. KARMA."
1,"Everytime I go here, I leave telling myself that their [wash once and throw away quality] clothing and their incomparable high prices should be reminder enough not to return, but somehow I digress.  So on my last trip to Kohl's, Scott, my checkout cashier, greeted me with a monotone voice and flat affect. That coupled with the fact that he didn't know how to count back change [but rather held out his hand and dumped all my coins and dollars into my palm] was the last straw! Terrible!  The store should be embarrassed. Please. Try to hire young employee's with even a little bit of professionalism."
1,"I have been here many times because it's right by my work and convenient to go at lunch, but I'm not going anymore - it's just not worth it. \n\nif you have to wait, there is no where to sit or stand basically. everyone is packed in there like sardines. I also don't like how the nail technicians try to push all th extra services onto you when doing the pedi\n\non the last pedicure I got from them, my pinky toe was totally messed up and after about 2 weeks, my toe nails began to turn yellow (the polish that is). I hadn't been hanging out in the sun or anythign so there's no reason it should have done that. once I had the polish removed (somewhere else), my nails were fine, so it was definitely their polish. \n\nin addition, my friend had a gel manicure here and it chipped within minutes of leaving.\n\nI'm done giving this place chances"
1,"First off this place is slow, ordered 25 minutes prior for a take out order and still waited another 15 minutes there. It was a Wednesday at 7 and didn't appear busy.\n\nWhen I walked in the door I went right to the counter, and there was 3 people standing there, 2 older guys and on lady at the register.  The 2 guys were going over the orders and the lady was fumbling with something.  They completely didn't acknowledge my existence.  It felt like I was waiting at the microwave waiting for the popcorn to be done, may of only been 3 minutes but an eternity in the customer service world.\n\nOnto the Food,\nI can forgive bad service if your food is awesome.\n\nI ordered 6 garlic knots and a large pepperoni and mushroom.\nThe garlic knots were a little bit larger than a quarter see the picture, and cost $2.50, seriously?  \nAverage quality.\n\nThe pizza, first off they showed me the pizza when I picked it up, unimpressed.\nIt was cookie cutter perfect, this is not a complement. Reminded me of frozen pizza.\nThe crust should have variations, bubbles in the crust, color differences.\n\nLast but not least the taste.....\nCrust was horrible the sauce almost none existent, and the cheese and toppings were definitely under profit control.  \n\nFinal Thought\nI feel robbed, very disappointed.\nI will not be back, I'll continue to drive by on my way home and you will never get another dime from me, or quarter for that matter see picture....."
1,"f I could give them no stars I would, but for the sake of the rating system, one star it is.  While I did like their selection of glasses, the place has less than mediocre service.  The doctor's appointment was fine.  All I wanted to know was if my glasses prescription needed to be increased.  The final bill was for more things than what I needed, which meant I paid for more than what I'd hoped to receive.  Also the glasses I purchased are transition polycarbonate lenses.  Up until a year into it, they were fine.  Since then the transition film has become covered in tiny cracks covering the entirety of both lenses.  Naturally they only guaranteed their work for 1 year.  \nBeware of the transition lenses from this place.  Do your research first! Transitions Optical, the company that created these lenses that darken in sunlightt, says you should get a certificate of authenticity at the time of purchase and are warrantied by Transitions Optical for two years.  I did not receive a certificate of authenticity.  The multitude of tiny cracks going across my transition lenses make things appear blurry, as if I weren't wearing glasses!   I wouldn't advise doing business here.  Although I still like the frames, I'll get my lenses replaced elsewhere and make sure the customer service is better if I should have problems later!"
1,I must say the worst sushi experience yet  not only was the hostess rude the toilet seats in the restroom were both broken the children prices are apparently applied if the staff working  that day feel your children look like children my 10 yr old is very tall for his age so the staff charged me adult prices for him and when I addressed the issue they didn't disclose the children age till after I told them how old my son was after the fact didn't make an attempt to fix the charges then we were charged 18% percent gratuity for our party to find out later that night that it is no longer legal for merchants to charge 18% anymore if you do visit this place watch out for the gratuity ! I will not recommend any of my friends to ever visit this place
1,"Despite the bad reviews here on Yelp, I was in the area and craved chicken wings. \nGot the wings & tenders combo. Totally gross! The wings tasted like cardboard and the tenders tasted like dirty socks. It was soaked in oil. A cholesterol overdose. \nThe fries were ok. It was disgusting."
1,By far the slowest Jiffy Lube I have ever stopped at. Thought I would be in and out in a few minutes because no one was in front if me but it took over an hour.
1,"I tried this place because it had good reviews on Yelp. Big disappointment! As soon as I walked in, I thought to myself, \""what the hell?\"" The decor in this place is non-existent. Both my lunch order, as well as my girlfriend's was just as appealing as the decor in the place. Would definitely not come back here!"
2,"My friends & I have been to the San Diego location & have been raving about Hash House A Go Go ever since.\n\nUnfortunately, the Las Vegas (Quad) location sucked. It was pretty boring. Staff seemed rather blah. You would think that being in Vegas the staff would be more lively. \n\nWhen we got there we sat for almost a good 20 minutes before anyone approached our table. The only saving grace was that our waiter who was an older gentleman was super nice. Other than that..this place is boring & even the food isn't the same. What a shame! San Diego location is MUCH BETTER."
2,Mittagspause gemacht. Essen und Trinken waren flott am Platz. Bedienung nett. Zum Abkassieren war dann aber irgendwie keiner zust\u00e4ndig. Am Ende hab' ich das Geld auf den Tisch gelegt und bin gegangen. Trotzdem den Bus verpasst. Nochmal 20 Minuten warten. Mist!
2,When you first walk in it looks like you're about to have a great experience. However I was highly disappointed. First of all they UNSANITIZED tools on me. I was charged for a glitter that I didn't even want AND my gel nail polish chipped the next morning!!! I was not happy to pay $60 for a gel mani and a regular pedicure that didn't even last 24 hours. The one positive thing I can say is that they were extremely friendly.
2,"(bald) Bartender, extremely rude. This review  would be too long if I listed our conversation. I spoke to a manager, about his \""treatment\"" toward us. The manager apologized and bought us a beer. That was nice of him but I hope the bartender will work on his \""people\"" skills. \n\nThe place wasn't very busy, an hour or so, after a Dbacks game. We didn't eat. I've heard good things about the food. Baldy Bartender put a downer on us wanting to stay longer.  I do like that they have a few tvs. There was no way that I was going to ask the bartender to change the station, lol."
2,"Wasn't able to secure a last minute reservation at Craftsteak (which I love by the way) while in Vegas so I reluctantly went w/ Delmonico.\n\nService was good, as expected, but not as warm as I'd like--you know the feeling you get when you can joke around with your server and have that \""rapport\"", I never really clicked w/ the service.  Whatever the case that shouldn't matter because I was there for the RIB EYE!!!\n\nDisappointing... hardly marbled... flavorful yes, but tough enough where I couldn't enjoy every bite.  My pallet favors texture over flavor and although my wife felt the steaks were flavorful, in my opinion the toughness completely buries any goodness from the flavor.\n\nWhat really lowers the score for Delmonico is the sheer fact that it's surrounded by so many other steak houses, I mean it's Vegas after all!! Because of this, I don't see myself EVER coming back"
2,"This was one of the more of the expensive buffets I had in Vegas, $21 a person dinner on Monday and it just wasn't that good.  Just down the street at 4 Queens we had a great meal for $9."
2,Can you say- alot of food. First time patron and wasn't that impressed. It's alright nothing spectacular. Just feels like and taste like your at olive garden on steroids.
2,"For being so patriotic and the \""All American\"" that TK portrays himself to be, it's a wonder that I Love This Bar & Grill can tout they are a love of...well, anyone's. Went to see Rev. Horton Heat (which was quite great) here on Thursday which is why I give it the 2nd star. However, I was shocked to discover that PBR's were $5 a can and a well rum and diet was an eye-popping $8! I cannot judge the food...nor will I ever...as I will not return to this establishment ever again. From the looks of it, the food resembled Applebee's, the bartender didn't seem to know his a$# from a hole in the ground and the prices kept fluctuating throughout the night. Bad service, bad drink prices, Good entertainment (bonus) but overall rip-off."
2,"I really wanted to really like this place.\n\nI have gone there twice during my visit here...\n\nFirst off, when asked what you would like to drink, if you say water, it's a bit alarming when the waitress asks (tells) you, are you sure you wouldn't like a lemon in that water?  It's cause the water they serve tastes terrible.  Seriously.\n\nSecond, I'm a huge fan of Kreplach soup.  So when I saw it on their menu, I got rather excited.  That excitement didn't last for long.  The Kreplach looked like they were mass produced, all identical, not hand made.  They were skinny.  Don't bother ordering it.\n\nIf you order a half sandwich, the cole slaw that comes with it, well, you need a magnifying glass to see it... really, why provide a serving in a thimble?  It's a shame, cause the cole slaw actually was good.\n\nThe corned beef sandwiches were ok, they seem to get pleasure out of their size... for $13 or whatever, I expect them to be big.  They were good, not great, but good.\n\nThe entrance is a dizzy array of the check in area, the register area, the take out area, and a merchandising area.  The seating area is pretty plain.\n\nAll in all, if this is Tempe's definition of a wantabee Jewish deli, it has the advantage to most places away from the two coasts, but it really doesn't pass the appearance or taste test.  Better than none, I'll concede that.\n\nBut disappointed, perhaps cause it bills itself as something it's not..."
2,"Crappy service. Good food..... Ordered, then got food 50mins Later then didn't see the Waitress for another 30 mins..... When she dropped off the check..."
2,"This theater isn't nearly as scary as people make it out to be - it's just a relic from the early 90s when Mills malls were the rage all over the country.  Now they just look dated and have a different crowd.\n\nI was dragged here on a Thursday night to lose a few brain cells watching a mind-numbing comedy with five other people in the entire ghost town of a theater. I'll never be able to get those hours back, but even if they offered refunds for that at the box office I am sure Harkins would direct us to the self-service machine only to have it break down on us.\n\nMelinda's card wouldn't swipe when we were trying to buy tickets on one machine - so we moved to the other machine where the transaction was successful, but the tickets and receipt didn't print.  We then had to go to the box office, which is exactly what those machines were meant to prevent, to tell them our tickets didn't print.  The manager simply just let us in.  I suppose we could have made up that story entirely.  Maybe we will next time."
2,"I used to love this place when they were located at von's shopping center. Then they moved to Food4Less shopping cnter, I still like it. The business closed for several months, don't know why. Now they're back and I'm so excited. Today I came back for my favorite, pad thai. It doesn't taste as good and they no longer have lunch special."
2,"Website does not reflect accurate stock levels, company fails to inform customers of out of stock items and processes the order short, when you call to address the matter, they very rudely talk over you and hang up. I take that as a sign they don;t want my business, I will be happy to oblige."
2,They have gone severely down hill. Have gone here for a couple years for close by chinese. I wouldn't go back.
2,Positives:\n* The waitress was very nice.\n* They were open on Christmas Eve.\n\nNegatives:\n* The waitress was not remotely competent.\n* The beer was skunked.\n* The fries--which took 15 minutes to arrive--were pale and ice cold.
2,"Do you want to die shortly after being slapped in the face with a cover charge that shouldn't be charged and then having your girlfriend gang raped on the dance floor?\n\nIt receives two stars simply because I used to like the place.  Pool, good music, dancing, reasonable drink prices.  But, after a couple of tense situations, witnessing fights on a near weekly basis, and a parking lot shooting....I'll pass these days.\n\nI don't do karaoke so that side of the establishment might be okay."
2,Nothing special here. Average tacos and below average service. If you are drunk and hungry this place might suite you.
2,"so after driving around south phoenix for an hour on a sunday, in search of an open mexican dive joint to get a breakfast burrito, and extremely hungover and tired, i somehow ended up at fili b's.\n\nthey serve breakfast all day, which is quite an amazing thing.\n\ni think that if i hadn't had spent so long searching for a joint that was open and starvingly had to stop here before hunger completely overwhelmed me, i would have just gone to a more familiar mexican drive-thru, like the one at 5th ave and camelback, or 40th st and indian - all which serve some pretty dank breakfast burritos.\n\nbut i ended up here, and the food was meh. it didn't really hit the spot like i was hoping it would have. too much cheese and the bacon wasn't cooked long enough and was fatty. my friends got chorizo burritos which were bland and extremely greasy. i usually try to avoid fili's and go to one of the sister/knockoff joints like rollbertos, eribertos, armandos, etc."
2,"Meh. The location and the venue is great, but the food is only okay.  I liked the drinks, though! CREATIVE!!"
2,"I ordered lasagna, dinner salad and soup.  The Italian wedding soup tasted just like Italian dressing.  It used to be so good. I was so disappointed in it that I saved it for a week to get a refund since I only took two bites but never found the time to take it in and deal with the manager I spoke to that seemed hesitant to provide a refund vs. a replacement product. All the herby delicious flavor was gone and sweet, sweet, sweet took over. Don't they know not to mess with a good thing. Either they changed the recipe or they have a lazy cook.\n\nThe lasagna was good but also really sweet. The portion for the price was disappointing. For that much money, I will just make a pan at home and freeze some portions.  \n\nThe dinner salad was fantastic. Full of yummy, crispy veggies. If the lettuce had been drained and the dressing didn't come out of a bottle with so much sugar it could gag you, I would get that salad twice a week. \n\nI won't be returning for anything BUT the salad, and only if I have my own dressing.\n\nBummer update."
2,"I had pants hemmed here and, while the guy did a decent job (though they still ended up too long even though he pinned them while I had them on?) it was absurdly expensive and took A WEEK.  \n\nCome on now."
2,"The food was okay( something you can get at a regular Italian restaurant), the service was amazing, very friendly. Me and my husband were celebrating our one year anniversary and a day that special I would of prefer spending it some where, where they don't take your plate when your not finish. It was a Sunday and not that busy but it was like they were trying to kick you out. Not the best experience, never coming here again!"
2,"I ordered a mozzarella and tomato sandwich, a small order of pasta salad, and a drink and it came out to $13. For $13 I could of gone to a restaurant. Paradise Bakery has some of the best cookies around but the food is a rip off."
2,Great for the beer but not for the food... You get what you pay for food wise. Great prices on beer and decent selection.\n\nI had the fried macaroni brick and it was mostly forgettable.\n\nThe big plus is the very nice and large flat screen tv's all over the place.
2,We went here and it was very disappointing.  My HUSBAND had the vegetarian skillet and the veggies were cold with a very sad melted cheese on top. I ordered pancakes and Bisquick makes better tasting pancakes!!! I will never go there again and the sad thing is we live down the street.  Ugh never again!!!
2,"I was getting my nails done here on Tuesday night, and while my nail lady was fabulous, the ambiance was not. There apparently who is a hairdresser there, Barbara, and she lets her kids run around the entire salon as she works. I think it is highly unprofessional. I was in a complete opposite area of the hair salon, and I could hear the kids. Not to mention, the same lady, was on the phone screaming at someone...also very unprofessional. My nail lady said that was pretty normal and the kids were always at the salon being loud and the mother is very loud herself. I just wanted to relax for an hour or so, and could not do so in that atmosphere. I will not go back, just because I don't want to be bothered with an employees children running around....again....highly unprofessional."
2,"Free soda beverages which is nice, but that was the only real positive I experienced here.  Was incredibly smokey inside (even for a casino) and coming home doused in smoke wasn't too pleasant.  \n\nAnother minor annoyance was upon sighing up for the awards program, which we were generously given $10 of free slot play, were only to be used on certain crown-marked slot machines.  These machines were few and far between and usually were being utilized by people who didn't appear to be stepping any time soon. \n\nOverall, probably my least favorite casino Ive visited in the Phoenix-area.  I wont sat I wont ever go back, but I wont be making the trip out there any time soon."
2,"We had brunch here this morning and while the food was great, the service was horrible.  Also, it was great to find a steak knife on top of the toilet paper dispenser in the ladies room, glad no one's lottle girl found this.  I'm soo disappointed, now I'm gonna have to find a new place for brunch!  This place needs to get their s**t together, not pro!"
2,"2.5 stars, but I'll round down.\n\nReading review online, this was suppose to be one of the best buffets in Vegas.  It was decent, but not something to ride home about.\n\nThe theme is a world buffet, with different stations including Chinese, American, Mexican, Mediterranean and I think Japanese.  Though creative, each station only had a few dishes for each theme, which limitis the buffet.  \n\nMy husband complained that the crab legs were undercooked.  He was not impressed by their selection of seafood, however this is not a seafood buffet.  I had a roast pork that was very juicy, but nothing spectacular.\n\nI'd say, skip this and go out to a restaurant instead."
2,"Lunch buffet is medicore at best, def. better food to be had elsewhere.  I usually only go there for the chaat.  However, today we were informed that the restaurant wasn't taking any chaat orders as the kitchen was too busy, all after the waitress had already taken our order.  Meanwhile, one or two other customers were given chaat orders to-go, I'm guessing they called ahead of time."
2,Very disappointed!Heard so much about this place so we were very surprised! Walked in and immediately greeted... Very good service.\nThe place was dead!!! It was after 9 so drinks weren't on special.. But 8 for a corona!? No thanks!
2,"I have fond memories of the 'wichcraft in Bryant Park from a few years ago.  Maybe it was the sitting-outside-and-actually-being-outside that made the experience so enjoyable... but no, I really think it was the fresh, hot sandwiches that made it such a memorable lunch spot.  It's too bad Vegas has Vegas-ized it into mediocrity.\n\nThe line was to the door at 4pm on a Saturday.  I was surprised, but I guess I shouldn't be - I forgot how time means nothing when you're in a casino.  Considering the sandwiches were pre-made and just needed to be plopped onto the panini-griller, it seemed to take a while - but I wasn't in a hurry, so I can deal.  \n\nI ordered the ham/cheddar/apple on pumpernickel and got it to go.  I was so excited to savor the awesomeness remembered from Bryant Park that I ripped it open in the car to take a few bites.  \n\nOooh, messy!  I don't know what happened - maybe the water content of the apples was too much? - but half of the sandwich was so soggy, it was like it had just been bathed.  The other half was just fine - so strange.  I think cheddar was the wrong cheese choice on their part - it made the whole thing so bland, like it zapped out any flavor the apples and ham had brought to the table.  I hate to say it, but I've had a Subway sandwich or two more exciting than this.  Maybe their other creations are better?"
2,"Sadly disappointed\n\nNot sure if it was an \""off\"" night for this 4 star yelped restaurant but I was quite surprised.  Someone needs to tackle quality control.\n\nNothing seemed fresh, the food looked as though it was presented well, but tasted like stale leftovers (I hate leftovers).  ALL the cut  meats were completely dried out and tough (yes.. Ribs, prime rib, turkey.. Dry and tough).  The Asian cuisine made me sick.. Seriously the only things worth eating 1) pizza was editable, and 2) the ice cream was yum.\n\nI will not be returning!"
2,"It was one of the first nice weekends in Montreal and we had heard that there were some nice rooftop restaurants open for brunch.  We arrived and sat down and were quickly surprised to find that they were not offering brunch, only lunch.  The sign in the elevator said brunch was offered from 11 to 3:30 but that was apparently just for the restaurant downstairs.  I'm honestly not sure if that's true.  We decided to eat anyway because we were starving.\n\nWe got some drinks and ordered an appetizer.  The appetizer was excellent, but that was the only positive point of the meal other than the weather and the view.  I ordered a veggie burger and it tasted / looked like a cheap patty that came out of a frozen package.  \n\nAfter we ate we then proceeded to wait for what must have been at least a half hour before our bills came.  The place was filling up and our waiter looked busy but unfortunately we were tucked away in a corner that was essentially forgotten about.  The waiter was apologetic when he finally did return which was appreciated.  Overall I would definitely not return as the food was below average and the service was pretty poor."
2,Most crowded bar I've ever been to on a Sunday. My experience there left me feeling very overwhelmed.. We started with margaritas at the Hefe on Mill and then Uber'd our way on up to the one in Old Town Scottsdale. \nI think if this bar was in a smaller city it would be more fun; just too many people for such a small spot. Or management might want to think about having a limit on how many people at one time.... It was ridiculous.
2,"I cannot stand this DMV. I refuse to ever go to inside again unless absolutely necessary and will use the kiosk outside.\nI was able to go at 2:00 AM this morning and renew the registration on my car at the kiosk outside without having to deal with any worker on the inside rolling their eyes and disliking being there. It took seriously 2 minutes and it spit my registration right out. That was convenient! With the kiosks popping up all over town, I hopefully can just use those for renewals. \n\nI don't like how the employees treat the customers. They know that we have no other company to go to and have no choice but to use the DMV. \n\nThis location is always to packed with lines at times wrapping around the building outside. There is a snack bar LOL. If you want a hot dog and nachos while you wait then you are in luck!"
2,"Never a great sign when you enter a giant restaurant for dinner and the place is completely empty. The next red flag was the menu that was enormous, I am talking on par with the ridiculousness of Cheesecake Factory. Since the menu had my head spinning I went the safe route with the chicken tender plate. My girlfriend ordered a Thai chicken inspired meal and her mom ordered a salad. I will say again the restaurant was pretty much empty, it took nearly 45 minutes for us to receive our meals. My chicken was decent, I think I expected it to be worse but it was nowhere near the wait I could have went to Bojangles for the same quality. \n\nAlso, this place had the saddest beer menu ever."
2,"Visited this place on a night when they had some bands. Had a very difficult time getting attention of wait staff. Finally walked up to the bar and ordered two draft beers which ended up being close to 10 bucks. Several people - including us - tried to flag down a server and finally after about 40 minutes our orders were finished. The appetizer (an italian burrito?) was served to us still frozen inside. Soups were nothing special. Ribs were pretty good but unless you like LOTS of sauce, ask for it on the side. Bands were very good on this night. I ended up only drinking three drinks that night because that seemed to be all they wanted to sell me. Couldn't seem to get anyone's attention for more. Seems like if you are going to pay a band you want to sell the food and drinks a little better."
2,We walked in for happy hour... took a look around... smelled like a funeral home...\n\nWalked out....\n\nMaybe this place is good if you are retired....
2,The staff was friendly and accommodating. I had an arrangement made for my grandma. After I left I looked at the flowers and some of the roses edges were dried/dead. I think the flower arrangement was over priced for what you what you got. :-(
2,"This was our first experience at this location.  We had been to other place and the pizza was amazing but service was beyond horrible.  Had some friends in town and good pizza seemed like the common thought, we came here to get a good pizza that wasn't a 'normal chain' type place.  We ordered two pizza's and they were both just ok, and the staff here was not as bad as the other location but it amazes me in such a small place such as this that your drinks being empty for extended periods of time as well as the one waitress not being seen in the dining room for extended periods of time.  I will order to go from the other location before I do this stop again.  I'm assuming the drinking and the proximity to UNLV is what keeps this location open."
2,"What the hell happened here?? The service is slow, food is mediocre, quality is slipping, dining area is dirty and decrepit... This used to be an inexpensive alternative to PF Changs.. Now it's a half step above Denny's. You're off your game BIG TIME."
2,In todays tight economy I really hate to speak ill  of a restaurant unless they deserve it this place does not... really.... BUT I was the only patron in the restaurant and had to get my own salt and pepper and i sat without a water refill as i ate my dinner untill i was almost finnished on the high note the baba ganoush was fair  at a  decent price  the salad was quite good fresh and crisp and the kafta kabob was dry should have had some tazeki with it to help moisten the meat . the lady/waitperson/maybe owner was nice enough but not overly intrested in making sure I had what i needed as I ate my dinner 3 stars is kinda pushin it .......the real question is would i go back?????   we'll see they did have some lunch specials 11am 3pm
2,"Not terrible but nowhere worth the price.\n\nWent there with some friends. Our server was borderline creepy--- when we asked for more time to view the menu he sarcastically asked if we'd be ready by tomorrow. uhhh, k?\n\nThe food was alright. I split 3 dishes with 3 friends. Eggplant parmesan from the appetizer menu, Caprese, and the formaggio raviolis (I forgot whatever fancy name they slapped on them). The eggplant parm was boring and very greasy... I've had better from coffee shops. The raviolis were good, but lacked any stuffing. They were seriously flat. The sauce that accompanied them was a little thick I thought, but tasted fine. Best part of the meal was the Caprese. Very fresh and presented nicely. Only thing worth the money that we tried. \n\nAlso after eating there we asked if we could see the collection of cars they have next to the restaurant, as it is one of the \""draws\"" of this place. Nope, cover charge. Forget that.\n\nIn short, skip this place. Overpriced tourist trap."
2,"A very tight parking lot for this Walgreens and I would seriously recommend that you monitor your surroundings when you're going from the store to your car. It is a very tight parking lot.\n\nI didn't go in on this particular visit - we used the drive-through and had a great clerk taking care of our prescription. Top notch and just for her, she gets a star. Otherwise it would have been a one star visit."
2,"Attente atrocement longue \nChocolat chaud \u00e0 la limite du buvable (et clairement en poudre, pour quelque chose annonc\u00e9 comme \""chocolat noir 56% blablabla\""\nErreur dans une des commandes\n\nMa cassolette n'\u00e9tait pas assez bonne pour rattraper tout \u00e7a.\n\nD\u00e9\u00e7u"
2,"I went here with some coworkers for happy hour and was not so impressed. The restaurant itself has a nice location overlooking Market Square, but the service and food were not great.\n\nWe took advantage of the happy hour special on margaritas and those were decent. Everyone enjoyed their drinks, which were huge and pretty strong.\n\nAppetizers are also half-off during happy hour, so we decided to order a bunch to split for dinner. Among the things I tried were the sopecitos; four thick corn tortillas that were topped (one each) with chicken, steak, carnitas, and chorizo. The meat was okay, but the tortillas did not taste fresh. Also, the dish was only lukewarm when served.\n\nI also tried the empanadas which were okay. I ordered them with beef. There really isn't much I can say, they were just bland and \""meh.\""\n\nThere were a few other dishes that were not very memorable. The one thing that we all loved were the flautas. I wish we had just gotten several plates of these instead of everything else!\n\nWe also had issues with the service. The food took almost an hour (for appetizers!) and one of the dishes was incorrect once it was finally brought out. I sent it back and did not request a replacement, but the incorrect dish was still on my check. I had them remove it but the whole experience was annoying."
2,"Pretty much meh.  It wasn't terrible, but nothing worth making a special trip for.  I tried the al pastor and lengua tacos.  The pastor was a little dry and lacked the usual sweetness.  The lengua was tender, but didn't have enough seasoning or something... just kind of bland."
2,"Staff was ok except one. Went there during lunch hour and as we are getting ready to prepare our bowl. one of the members of their staff yells at me with an attitude \"" you cant be back here\"" what she is talking about the area between the 2 self serve veggie/ meat station. One bar was closed but with all the respect it is hard to reach to an item that is way in the back so I went to the other side to make it easier to reach and this girl yells at me from across instead of coming closer to me and warning me it is not allowed to be on the other side. How rude! what is ur location's goal here? go big or go home! I wont be visiting again."
2,"After my friend had been super excited and raving about this place, I was disappointed that it's really not that great for vegetarians or vegans. The burger I got just didn't have a tasty flavor. Just kind of sour and sickly sweet. I actually got sick of eating it and stopped..which HARDLY EVER happens to me."
2,"Veggie omelette was way over cooked,  hard and dry ... Not good at all ... Very disappointing since I had had better food there a couple of years ago. My companion experienced the same with her omelette. So my advice ... At the very least ... Don't order an omelette ... Especially given the price."
2,"I am what you would consider a mexican food snob. Small, hole in the wall type places are what i live for. \n\nI had the mini chimis (5) with beans and rice... Cost me $10 which is a little steep for me especially given the quality of food. \n\nThe chimis had cream cheese and beef in them. More cream cheese than beef. They were sweet. Almost tasted like they were made with a flaky pastry dough or something. The rice was nothing special but their refried beans were delicious. I wish i would have had the option to get chicken ones. \n\nTheir salsa bar salsas were nothing special to me, flavorless.  Their avocado + salsa verde one was pretty unique and delicious though. \n\nThe restraunt was super clean and a little over the top friendly. Im from the south and enjoy being greeted with a smile, but 4 different times while i am trying to eat? Overkill. \n\nThey have a fried ice cream milkshake that i would love to try! I might go back to try that, but that's about it. This place definitely isn't Carolina's/los dos melinos status."
2,"Flying here is great. It's vegas. You arrive and you're excited to have fun...\n\nThen you lose all your money gambling, can't afford dinner, you can't get into the clubs, you feel terrible, and you decide you need to go home.\n\nSo you arrive at the airport greeted by the longest line you have ever seen in your life. Hundreds of people line up back to walls that typically would be a vacant part of the airport. After an hour or two of this madness you get through security... whew that's over with....\n\nThen you realize you need to get to the D gates. But wait! You need to take the tram to the D gates. What's that? The tram is broken? Well, crap. Start walking a mile to the D gates with 100 lbs of luggage that wouldn't fit the 50 lb maximum for a checked bag (of course you brought WAY too much stuff back from vegas). \n\nAh, yes you arrived at your gate! 2 hour delay?! Sh*T!\n\n\nBottom line: \nWorst security line I have ever seen\nTram was down and required about a mile walk\nThe only thing redeeming this place is the free wi-fi which allowed me to write this review."
2,Enjoyed my veggie burger with fries. Service sucked the last 2 times. We had to flag down a waitress to get our refills. Next time we'll do take out to avoid tipping poor service
2,"Nice place, friendly staff, but I can honestly say I've had better. The therapist was super friendly and worked on every spot I asked, but actually created a knot that has been bugging me now that I didn't have before. The place is really nice and the front desk staff was very pleasant... but it is a little pricey and you can find the same quality massage for cheaper at other places. I was referred here and had really high hopes because the person who referred me has always been pleased. Maybe I am hard to please or expectations are too high, but I doubt I will be back. Nothing special or out of the ordinary here... And that's what I look for... Especially if I am going to spend that kind of money."
2,"Okay, unfortately SW Airllines needs to train their employees better.\nSW Airlines can only issue to a passenger two (2) boarding passes in a travel day. Example: Travel day 12/1; traveing from PHX to GEG with connecting flight in OKL (changing airplanes), got two boarding passes; got to GEG did my business and got an boarding pass at GEG with stop in LAS (no change of planes). It's frustrating because GEG was a full (over booked) flight."
2,"had a $20 slow cooked pork dish (cochinito pibil) that was described as a house speciality.  Nothing special.  Salty, a little dry...lots of spices. Obvious sauce drips on plate rim were partially wiped off...made the plate look unapetizingly dirty at first.  The $7 Modelo tasted great!"
2,"I am not a big Yelp contributor,  but I am so disappointed in The Haymaker.  I loved this restaurant when it first opened and I would always take friends and family there when they visited from out of town.  Each time I have visited in the past few months, it has been going down hill.  When I used to visit The Haymaker, my glass would never be empty. Now, I never get a refill.  They used to put a leaf of lettuce on the burgers/sandwiches,  now it's shredded. They used to offer a to go iced Coffee when we left, now they do not. They had the best Toasted Almond flavored iced coffee, now they do not. They didn't have marinara sauce for the mozzarella sticks, no marinara available (Saturday afternoon). They have $2 Bud Light drafts for happy hour which is fantastic. There was a butt end of a tomato on my \""medium\"" burger which was medium/rare. I asked for an onion slice on my burger, there was one ring of onion (see picture). I will not be visiting The Haymaker unless I hear things change."
2,"We actually eat here fairly regularly so you think I would rate it higher, but when I really think about it, it could be a lot better. I think we mostly end up here for the chips and salsa, lol!\n\nThe positives:\n\nThe \""endless\"" chips and salsa are pretty yummy.\n\nThe margaritas are usually really good\n\nI like the new pretzel stick appetizer they have\n\nMost of the servers we have had have been friendly and attentive\n\nThe negatives:\n\nThe FOOD! Really that is the only thing, but this is a restaurant. I have pretty much given up on trying to get a good meal here. I have tried a million and one things and while parts of it are sometimes good, I have never gotten a consistently good meal. The margarita chicken is good, but the sides suck and seem old and stale. Same with the burger, decent but the fries are usually bad. The kids meals are TERRIBLE, to the point I never even pick this as a place to take the kids for dinner anymore. \n\nUsually if I come here, its the hubby and me for lunch.  When we come we generally get the chips and salsa endless lunch with soup and salad, but lately even the soup and salad kind of sucks. \n\nWith all that said, will I be back there at some point enjoying a margarita, chips and salsa and pretzel sticks? Yep. But if I want an actual dinner or lunch, not just a salty (in a good way), carb fest, I would pick somewhere else."
2,"I have been here a few times now, and just not been impressed. The stylists are OK, nothing great. There prices are decent, but I think a little on the high side for the quality you get. My biggest complaint comes from the customer service. I have called after hours or on Sundays when they are closed several times and left a message. They will NOT call you back. If you are going to have an answering machine then use it and call people back. I guess business is good if they can afford to not return calls and go else where. I will not be returning here."
2,This is the fourth hawaiian barbecue place I been to is by far the worst. No teriyaki sauce and katsu sauce which are a given of any Hawaiian barbecue place! Was given soy sauce/glowing red over processed sweet and sour sauce with my food instead. Macaroni in the salad was over cooked and mushy with some type of seasoning that looked like pepper. It was also runny using a low quality mayo and missing the sprinkles of carrot shavings that I'm so used to in a good Hawaiian macaroni salad. The barbecue chicken was dry and could not taste any of the marinade it was supposed to be cooked in. The bed of vegetables was old dry cabbage resembling the fake grass you see in an easter basket. This menu was confused if it should have been hawaiian barbecue or ghetto chinese food of south phoenix. The elderly Asian couple was very friendly and service was quick which should be expected being the only customer in there. The place was clean compared to the next closest one in Avondale. Location is among a lot of other fast food places and can easily be overlooked. I might give this place a second chance the next time I am that far west again and am have a craving for something hawaiian.
2,"Hallo, ich gehe ins Milano seid 1990, diese Bar WAR der absolute Kultleider ist dem nicht mehr so. Zu wenig Puplikum, oft launiges, wenig motiviertes Personal, oft zu laute Musik, so das man sich wirklich anstrengen mu\u00df beim unterhalten zu h\u00f6ren und geh\u00f6rt zu werden.Deshalb dann auch die Fenster geschlossen werden, damits von drau\u00dfen keine Beschwerden gibt, die alte kleine Klimaanlage \u00fcberfordert ist und dabei die T\u00fcr vom Raucherzimmer aber offen bleibt, damit das Personal zum bedienen schneller rein und raus kommt. Du stinkst nach verlassen der Bar genauso nach Rauch wie fr\u00fcher. Ein Plus - die Tische drau\u00dfen, das macht Spa\u00df."
2,"This is one of my regular stops for breakfast. Normally a great breakfast joint but not today. The greeter wasn't friendly and the food was average. This place has been around for a long time with a good reputation. The kitchen needs to try harder and they need a friendly, happy greeter. It will be a while before I go back."
2,"The staff is friendly, it's all downhill from there.\n\nRoom 1122 don't book this room if you need to sleep, between the train, the ice machine and the AC/heat wall unit no sleep.\n\nPeeling wallpaper in the common areas, outdated.decor.\n\nFood was cold at lunch.\n\nNo outlets available to charge anything."
2,"I'm a thrift store junkie and this particular Goodwill location is just junkie. I've never really been impressed with the finds at this location and it has that stale grandma's dead cat smell when you walk in. That being said, they seem to have an OK selection of older furniture if you're looking for something to fix up or paint. \n\nYou should really go to the one on 20th St. & Indian School if you're in this area. They just built that one about a year and a half ago and it's clean and has great stuff."
2,"we came here for lunch I ordered the sweet Deal pick 3 for 4$ just had a regular cheeseburger ,onion rings, and a drink . The food came out quick a little too quick cause they did a poor job making the cheeseburger had way too much Mustered and Ketchup and was all over the wraper just oozing out the sides the onion rings were pretty good"
2,"Not really very good.  The place seemed nice and other reviews mentioned good pizza.  We ordered a large thin crust with tomato, mushrooms, pepper, cheese, and pepperoni.  The crust was not thin at all--and was just a touch doughy.  Lived in Italy for 4 years and this is not a \""Palermo\"" crust.  Mushrooms tasted like that out of a can.  \n\nThe young guy taking the order was stone-faced and didn't even say hello.  On the way out another guy (owner?) was cheerful and seemed courteous."
2,"I heard many good things about this place and so was excited to try it out.\n\nMy friends and I ordered the Thai Beef Salad, Asian Chicken Salad, Monsters Meatball and Spaghetti, and Grilled Salmon. We were extremely disappointed. I don't even know what the meatballs tasted like. The spaghetti and salad dressings were BAD. The rice was hard. The salmon was a-ok, but the portion was small compared to other dishes.\n\nOn the bright side, I tried their famous frozen hot chocolate, and I loved it! We all loved it! Totally made my experience better. \n\nI don't know if we didn't order the right food, but I'm definitely not coming back here for their food, ONLY FOR DESSERT!"
2,"Waited 10 minutes for menu and water. Didn't help it was 100 degrees outside.  Anytime the server was at our table, he never looked at us once. He was always looking around at passerby's. Took our wine list away before we even looked at it, then asked if we wanted drinks. I politely told him he took our drink menu away so we never had a chance to look at it. It was very obvious he would be very quick to get an attitude in any situation. Plus, it was Mother's day and it wasn't a very pleasant customer experience. But customer service is huge and they easily failed at that. The food was not very good. Caprese salad was just \""ok\"" and the calamari was HORRIBLE!!! Bland and overly chewy. No flavor. No one thanked us for dining or wished happy mothers day as we walked out. Not a very pleasant experience. We DEFINITELY won't be returning. Their name shouldn't be Luna Rossa.....it should be Luna Grossa."
2,"I expected so much more. The food here was eatable, there wasn't much variety. The \""sushi\"" was rice and veggie rolls. I'm not coming back."
2,"2 stars for decent service. \n\nThe sushi rice however, is always mushy and falling apart. \n\nI love kabuki in California and they never seem to have this problem. I've given this place multiple visits and chances to see if maybe it was just off days, but they just don't have their sushi together apparently. \n\nWork on that Alaskan roll sushi chefs! \nMaybe Los Angeles locations can help you have better quality sushi.\n\nThe table booths seem dirty. The walls are nasty looking. The little glass separators always have finger prints. The sunshade has sauces all over them. It's dusty in table lights. Not a very clean atmosphere. \n\nWhat is going on with this KABUKI in Las Vegas?!"
2,"Blah!  This was my 2nd visit to Bravo, 1st time I got a grilled chicken salad & had to send it back b/c the chicken was pink.  This time we started w/ the sangria rosa, way to sweet & was more like a daiquiri.  I got the chicken caprese & the chicken was very thin & like rubber, I could barely cut it, the orzo had zero seasoning.  So disappointed & we will not be going back!  Only reason for 2 stars instead of one was because we had good service."
2,"This place use to be my go to\nFavorite bargain store however things have changed. Word got out and the eBay sellers have taken over this place. They are crazy!!! Trying to compete with them is impossible as they clearly are \""friends\"" with those that work in the store in order to get first dibs. Last time I was there one of the eBay sellers had brought the store employees lunch, I mean come on where are your morals? I'd rather pay full price at Nordstrom."
2,"\""Tourist trap\"" pretty much sums up this restaurant with mediocre food, service and atmosphere. I don't mind paying more money for quality, but things were far from exceptional. A 12oz beer was $10, and steak and fries was $30. The girls were nice to look at, but nothing more."
2,"Went recently, and the sushi did not seem as fresh as I remember. I am not sure I would go back."
2,"Do NOT order the wings. For $14 you get scrap parts of the wings, which they call \""lollipops\"" and their way of trying to convince you that they make it easy for you to eat...YA, because there is no more meat for you to eat to even get messy. They basically strip off all the meat and leave you with the bone and the driest parts. There are no drums(middle pieces). Literally there is no meat. I had ordered the General So wings. Anyways I would assume the flavor will be amazing but it was terrible. It was too salty and tasted like sweet and sour sauce out of a packet from Panda Express. What does it take to be a good chef? Just making the food look pretty rather than taste good or even filling? I was basically served chicken bones cleaned up and presented to me on a plate with some sauce on the side. I am so offended that they could get away with serving this garbage and charging for it. What do they do with the actual meat? I don't know if I would be more upset if they threw it away or used it on another dish, which means they get paid twice for it."
2,It's a kool spot I guess.. But I've been going there for a few yrs now and the staff is great but the food is good at best but not great and this place is slowly getting worse.. Bathrooms are never clean if you show up at 7am but wish them well but I've given more than enough money to this place and its not getting better.. Sorry guys
2,"This is a painful review as I really used to like this place.  Echoing most of the other reviews as well as mine, the service here is still horrible.  The portions  have gotten smaller and the prices higher.  The quality of the food, DOWNHILLL..\n\nThe Wor Wonton Soup, compared to what you get in ANY other place, it was the smallest pot I have ever seen not to mention they use imitation crab meat.\n\nThis is the second time in a row I have ordered the Spring Rolls and they are cooked on the outside but still cold/frozen on the inside.\n\nLike I said I used to really like this place but after this visit with continued CRAPPY POOR service, NO communication between the staff and overall they just don't seem to really care about customer service or quality of the food any more.  The portions have gotten smaller and the value for the price along with the service, this place is NO LONGER a place I can recommend."
2,"WORST PEDICURE EVER. I was just there this morning for a full set and a pedi. The man that did my full set was patient... he had to pry off an old set as I wanted a new fresh one... and I had just gotten a fill so it took a little bit of work. My only complaint with him is that he cut me pretty good with the drill and if it hurts this much now, boy is it gonna smart tomorrow. But I do love how my nails look. Thin and shaped perfectly. The pedi however is where things really head south. She did an ok job on the scrubbing, cutting and filing but that's where it ends. When it came time for the best part, the massage, it's like she was a zombie. She barely rubbed my feet, she rubbed my shins a little bit and my knees (???) but would NOT rub my feet. Thats the part that hurts after being on them all day!!  She squeezed them, pinched my toes, slapped the bottoms of my feet but still no massage. It was like she had no clue what she was doing. Definitely the strangest experience at a salon ever. The polish job was sloppy, polish on my cuticles that she didn't clean up. WEIRD WEIRD WEIRD.  Won't be going back."
2,"Ended up here since Mill was slammed for the ASU game..ordered the souvlaki, one beef and the other lamb.  The lamb was pretty under seasoned, the beef had a better taste except it was chewy and hard to swallow.  Had to spit out a piece in the napkin so someone got a surprise unfortunately.  Didn't think I got enough for what I paid for either.  The veg was also under seasoned, just bland tasting food.  I looked around and most people were ordering Apps like the hummus, so I may have missed something.  The waitress was very good and friendly, the extra star is for her.  Not sure I can go back with all the choices around there."
2,"Bouchon is one my favorite places to go when I am in Vegas,\nMy last trip in March was marked with a scar. I left a comment on their website and have not heard back so I decided to post here as well.\nIf you have been there you would know that the food is good and prices are on the expensive side. So what stunned me when I got my bill is the charge of their house water for $7 a carafe. ($21 for 3). Seriously! You are charging me for tap water at a place where we pay more than regular prices for food. Shame on you for trying to rip off your customers. And btw I didn't ask for any special water, I said tap water when I was asked what do I want to drink. \nThe good news is that they adjusted the price but that was embarrassing in front of my business guests."
2,"Slow service. Waited over 2 hours for oil change. Watched others come and go. Clean place, friendly service but mismanaged. I will take my business elsewhere.\n\nSlow service.

2,"Remember when Pomo used to occupy that touristy faux-Mediterranean space in the most upscale part of Scottsdale?  They served one of the best Napoletana pizzas I have ever had in one of the most pretentious, snooty atmospheres imaginable.  I am thrilled to report that my experience with the downtown Pomo was not at all the same.\n\nHaving just walked from Cibo, where we enjoyed a decent pie (I'm still not convinced that Cibo comes anywhere close to its level of hype), we stepped into Pomo, expecting to be lambasted with stucco, fake accents, and photos of Florence.  Imagine our surprise when it turned out to be... trendy?  That's right, it was modern decor, and the waitstaff was of the hipster variety.  Wow, that was unexpected!\n\nMy biggest problem with the original store had been taken care of.  This was turning out to be an excellent dining experience.  We then ordered our pie, expecting the same quality we had enjoyed from the old Scottsdale oven.\n\nNope.\n\nWhat happened?  The pizza was not adequately soupy.  It lacked the amazing flavor and attention to detail that made it somewhat worthwhile to brave Scottsdale's most self-absorbed patrons.  In short, it was underwhelming. \n\nAfter we left here, we proceeded to walk right down the street to La Piazza Locale (also VPN certified), for our third and best pie of the evening.  I suggest you do the same.  They have the same modern vibe with a much better Napoletana pie."
2,"This place was ok. I was with great friends on a birthday outing, so we could've been anywhere to have a fab time (and we did sample a few places that night). We had a good time by virtue of being the fun girlies we are, but I won't go out of my way to return to this particular bar.  I will, however, return to the Cosmo just for the secret pizza place...it's unmarked down a long dark hallway and has awesome pizza AND an old-timey arcade game and pinball machines. Sorry...did I digress? That's how interesting the Chandelier Bar was to me.\n\nIt's a multi-level bar with decent bartending (in fact, the barkeeps did present a touch of class to the place). The chandelier over the liquor bottles  was kinda pretty, but the plastic \""chandelier\"" that draped from floor to ceiling...meh. Was pretty tacky looking, actually...reminded me of a giant version of the Mardi Gras beads you get for showing your boobies. Maybe they were going for Diva but got closer to Dive-y. I know it's Vegas, but there are plenty of less tacky places to hang. It felt very dated and old-fashioned. Dated can be good if there's at least a pinch of glam, but the obviously plastic almost-shimmer fell short of that pinch. Call me a snob, but it felt good to leave the verging-on-suffocatingly naff decor."
2,"MENU CAHNGE: So I've always enjoyed the flatbread tapas at happy hour. I dragged a bunch of friends for full price dinner here last night and...\n\nthey have replaced their flatbread with what appears to be straight up from the box Matzoh Ball CRACKERS.\n\nI think any toddler is familiar with the difference between crackers and bread.\n\nSo $10 for some crackers and tiny scoops of hummus, bruschetta and tapenade is steep. But then I realized my friend had ordered the flatbread pizza and was struggling to eat it because CRACKERS can't support the weight of pizza toppings and sauce.\n\nAnother guest politely asked the waiter about the crackers and the server said it was a permanent change.\n\nHere's a permanent change: I will be going to one of the other couple hundred gastro pubs in town with great atmosphere. Or hell, just walk across the street to Firefly for actual tasty food! \n\nAnd the fresh brewed beer isn't worth it--a lot of the brews are heavy with a syrupy honey taste. bleh."
2,"1st time there, went to buy a toy helicopter for my child.  Didn't hold charge so we had to take it back for exchange and manager took care of us since I didn't save receipt.  While he was helping us he took on another task or decided to take a call rather then finishing our transaction.  The whole process took about 15 minutes since I had to wait for him to actually help but the actual exchange took 1 min.  He was still on the phone the entire time and customer service wasn't actually priority there.  Bad quality in toy helicopters and not very good customer service. Not a good 1st time experience."
2,"UPDATE:\n\nThe owner is very personable.\n\nThe bid made to my insurance company was the highest of any bidder, I needed repairs, however, the bid submitted was for total replacement of all siding on my house.\n\nThe company did not get my business because the insurance company would not fund total replacement of all the of home's siding."
2,"Unless you get a \""Go Room\"" you are in for a dirty filthy room. They don't care either. We had to move three times. The first time we moved after complaining there was another guest checking in our room before we fully moved out. No one from the Hotel checked on our complaint before sticking another guest with the problem.\n\nThe carpet was beyond dirty. It reaked and had stains and dirt all over. If you stepped into the tub after walking on the carpet you would leave black footprints. There is no excuse for such filth and no excuse for ignoring it and pawning these rooms off on the next guest.\n\nThe Hotel is old and smells like it. They are trying to improve by updating, but have a ways to go. With all the lovely hotels in Vegas, why would anyone want to stay here is beyond me. It was my first and last time. I've never been treated as badly. A kennel would have been cleaner.\n\nThere is one shining part of the Flamingo left. Junius Johnson, Jr., a server in the buffet. The man has been there for 30 years and he is the ultimate for customer service. He needs to train the rest of the staff. Hats off to the man."
2,"5/29 - waaaaccckkk!!!! the only thing nice was the view! other than that, crowd was wack! there was no where to sit! small danceflr! thank goodness it was free! Rain is better than this spot."
2,"First let me say I'm a HUGE fan of all things cheesey and a growing fan of food trucks. For weeks I had been tracking Chedda on instagram waiting for him to be in the neighborhood. Zia Records, on records day, we were there. I was stoked! \n\nHusband and I both got dirt bags (burger & cheese) & tots. Both lacked flavor. Both weren't cheesey. Both were disappointing. I almost cried. So much built up anticipation for... nada! And it set me back $19.\n\nBurgers were huge, bun was thick and burnt. Tots tasted like bland mashed potatoes and the sauce was super odd. Wouldn't recommend."
2,Came here again after my last review and we had to get gas for our rental van and so I pulled up to a pump and I went inside and said the the same lady I seen last time if I could get $120 on pump 2 regular and she said its ready and if u need change or/and receipt come back inside and so I went back outside and put the nozzle into my tank and lifted the nozzle holder on the pump and I talked to my family while getting gas in the car and after the pump clicked off at $100.10 i went back Inside for my change and the lady gave my my change and receipt and I ask her if there car wash was ever going to reopen an the lady said yes it's going to reopen in a month and we are going to have new gas pumps and another gas island and I said ok and thank you. \n\n\nThis place is now improving. My last review was on this place and I said to stay away. But I will give this place 2 more times.
2,"I suppose when it's Gordon Ramsay's restaurant you expect more or better than average.\nLike everyone else I have watched his shows and he seems to be a passionate chef.\nThere was a 45 minute wait to get a table- that's fair it was a Friday night so we went and killed some time until our text message informed us the table was ready. The staff uniforms are RIDICULOUS, so blatantly inappropriate, ill fitting and unflattering. Please change them- what a joke they are. The umbrella girls at motorpsorts events are wearing more clothes than the poor girls working at BURGR.\nThe burgers took another 45 minutes to come out and they were okay but not great. My husband got the truffle fries with the truffle aioli, which frankly all just tasted like garlic and not much else. I cook for my family most nights so the burgers were not earth shatteringly good or something I couldn't whip up in 15 minutes. i just expected more.\nWell I did get more when the bill came $150 for 2 adults and 2 kids for a burger meal. \nWe won't go back to BURGR, but there certainly is a slew of Gordon Ramsay restaurants to choose from in Las Vegas. He seems to be a hard worker and he's making hay while the sun shines."
2,"Tequila Bar, I came here after reading reviews on yelp. I was looking for a cheap bar with decent drinks. When I saw they had a 128oz Blue Fishbowl for $20 I YELPed! But was disappointed to hear they had no \n\""fishbowls\"" and would service it in two large cups. The two cups turned out to be 64oz Plastic pitchers, which was pretty fun. What wasn't fun was that 1. It has no \""fishies\"" in it (like the picture) and 2. It was 90% Soda. Boo! But hey, for the novelty- the price wasn't bad!\n\nThe Nacho's at the next table did look pretty delectable, but I just came from a big dinner so I just ordered the \""southwestern corn on the cob\"". I was curious. What made it southwestern? I should have known when I ordered it and the waiter said, corn- you want the corn? ok. And Corn is exactly what I got. Just boiled corn with a square of butter... for $3 - FAIL"
2,"Four stars for the two appetizers (calamari and spicy shrimp)' both were very enjoyable.  The salad was also very good.  \nOne star for the main entrees.  Both mine and the wife's were awful.  I had the tilapia with asparagus.  The asparagus was way over cooked the the fish was very dry.  Wife had a pasta dish and was very disappointed. The kids meals were okay.\nAtmosphere wasn't very appealing since areas were dirty in the waiting area and the dining area near the fireplace.  Wait staff was very inconsistent, our waiter was very neglectful, while the waitress at the table next to us seemed very attentive to her tables and we had to ask her for refills on bread, salad and drinks while our waiter was MIA.\nBottom line, go somewhere else while in the Concord Mills area."
2,"I've been to this office several times in the last year and  strongly agree with Joan C.'s review.  The hygienist  pushes extra dental work and cleanings.  I got the deep-cleaning 2 months ago and my gums feel worse than before.  I \""saw\"" the dentist once--she peeked in, looked at my x-rays and told me I needed fillings.  She barely smiled or made eye contact.  I've been at the front desk when she's walked by and she didn't even acknowledge me.  I am now looking for a new dentist."
2,"Dos Gringos is definitely bringing trashy back.  And I think the whole trailer park theme has really gotten the best of them.  Two cases in point.\n\nA) Drinks are EXTREMELY weak.  They give you tall glasses, but have very thin pours of liquor.  Thinking maybe it was the vodka, we switched to rum, but alas, the trailer park was just being cheap. \n\nB) The vomit stench wafting from the mens restroom really takes the trailer park theme a little too far, right?  After I reported to staff that puke was all over a men's urinal, it was still there an hour later.\n\nDoesn't that make you yearn for the good old college days??\n\nGranted it was a Sunday afternoon and all, and the DJ and crowd was fun.  A definite fun place to day drink, and bring the pooch.  Call me an old-fashioned prude, but the puke-fest and sucky drinks kind of killed the mood.  And believe it or not, I didn't have the appetite to try any of their award-winning tacos."
2,"Nothing special.  Wandered in on a weekend afternoon and it was all about the game(s)... So our service was fine, but not really friendly or attentive.  Tips were obviously going to be made at the men tables, oh well.\nWe read the reviews about the crispy tacos and they were ..... Okay.  So that was disappointing.\nAll in all, it was okay, with the other restaurants in this neighborhood, we could have chosen much better!"
2,"One of the worst coffee shops that I have ever gone to.  I went to this Crazy  Mocha location three times because of the convenience factor (I had a class next door at the Cultural Trust).  \n\nFirst off the chai is WAY too sweet and under spiced to boot.  I couldn't taste any spices that I could identify.  I suspect that they simply put milk in black tea and sweeten it.  Very disappointing.  \n\nSecond the coffee:  I generally order drip coffees as they are the true test of a coffee shop.  Crazy Mocha seems to universally brew weak coffee.  I also suspect that the coffee has been sitting for a while by the time I got to in in the mid afternoon.  It was so bad the second time I got it that I dumped it out after drinking about a quarter of it.  \n\nThe services is OK, not terribly fast or friendly.  They do however have decent wifi."
2,Was a huge fan of subway but they got rid of my favorite sandwitch chicken pizziola. I was able to still get it but they said that they couldnt anymore. I had to find a new fav but would like it more if they would bring it back. Most the subways in las vegas favor their own people or if you speak the language. Other than that could be better.
2,"I will eat here when a friend insists, but I think almost every time I've eaten here, I have gotten diarrhea.  And the food isn't worth the diarrhea.  Its kind of bland.  And its overpriced.  Just my opinion though.  I know lots of people are ga-ga over this place."
2,"They must have mistakenly put the chilled chicken for the grilled chicken salad into my sandwich and the fries were room temperature at best in one of the two meals! The good is that the service was friendly and I like the new options that stay up with the trend of hipster food offerings such as brioche buns and pretzel buns and also I like that there is an option for supposed \""fresh lemonade\"" as well as salad options."
2,"Had fried tofu, fried pork, peanut butter dumplings and eggplant. The fried foods were dry and tough. Pretty much every dish here can be found in a much better version elsewhere in Montreal. Only try this if you're desperate for Chinese. (The pickings are admittedly slim in this neighbourhood.)"
2,"Pretty lame, even for Casa Grande. Went on a Thursday night when they are supposed to be open until midnight. They apparently decided they wanted to close early because hardly anyone was there, so the waitress told us it was last call at 9:30 even though we had not even been there very long and were clearly planning to stay for the evening. Awesome.\n\nThe beer selection is very basic. Maybe two of the taps rise above the level of barely tolerable, for anyone who's into flavorful beer. But, I guess that's a function of their clientele more than anything else. I'm not a beer snob by any means, but give me something more than light domestics."
2,"MONTE CARLO, an awesome name brand.We asked for a non-smoking room and we were sent into a SMOKING ROOM.I noticed that the carpet floor near the window had a minor crack.The room was NOT clean.The hotel was not nice because it is old.I will never stay in this hotel again and this hotel made me wonder why MGM Mirage made horrible hotels and never keep the old ones clean for there customers.Also,MGM's customer service need improvements.Stay at the Monte Carlo if you want a bad stay and want a feel of BARFED OUT EUROPE.This hotel is Sub-standard and below average.\n\n\nMonte Carlo,a great name,and a great disappointment."
2,This was the first groomer we tried out in the Phoenix area. They had good reviews on yelp and good prices so we gave them a try. I was not impressed and left really missing our groomer back in CA. I asked for my dog's tail to get special attention. She was given back to me with matts still in her tail and her face hadn't been cleaned thoroughly. Pretty disappointed will not be returning.
2,I really hate cold buffet food. Nd today all items were cold. Maybe we arrived too soon after opening but we had to leave and I asked for a refund. I was given a gift card for a return visit which was nice.
2,The peanut butter & jelly cake was served hot. So the peanut butter was runny and the cake was really dry & hard. You couldn't taste the jelly until you got into the center of the cake. Warm grape jelly isn't too great to eat. The latte tastes like any other latte.
2,I usually like this place but was a little disappointed this last time. I tried the eggs Benedict and did not like their own made hollandaise sauce. Next time I'm sticking with my usual blueberry pancakes. Boyfriend liked his meal (he had the wolf pack). Service was good. We got in quickly for a busy Memorial Day Monday morning. Unfortunately we both got sick later in the day and it was the only meal we had eaten so I'm going to be a little hesitant next time I think about going to over easy.
2,The new owners are wrecking this place. Just returned to Montreal for a short vacation and the staff are way overworked. Won't be going back - it's better in my memories. The food has gone down hill.
2,"Fell way short of all the hype. From what I'm reading, LA is better, but I can't imagine them being that much better. For starters, I did not care for the hard casings on the dogs. Flavor was not that great either. I really think this place gets by on their image more than their food."
2,"I've been here twice now and the first time was great service and the Mac & cheese was delicious!!! However, today was ridic. I called at 5:54 to see if they had hh and I was told \""yes! Until 7\"". We arrived 10 min later and then I was told \""no we don't have hh today\"". This is why I'm giving this place 2 stars."
2,This is NOT the best brunch in Charlotte. It's a small chain located in a shopping plaza full of families with their 2 strollers and screaming children. The food was decent but I'm sad I made a drive this way for brunch.
2,"I was definitely not impressed with this restaurant. There wasn't enough variety and my street noodle dish was subpar at best. It lacked any wow factor. The only dish I would recommend is the steamed pork bun. Literally the only thing I will go in there for. Otherwise, I would not suggest going here. It is overhyped."
2,"I went to Caramel because I heard that it was great. It was a nice, simple, very small lounge. I was surprised at how small it was. I had the Oreo martini, which cost $20. I could care less about drink prices, and don't mind paying a lot for drinks in Vegas, but $20 was a bit much for a so-so martini with Oreo crumbs at the bottom. Or possibly Hydrox - who knows?\n\nLove the Bellagio, not wild about Caramel. Take the ten steps to the Sports Bar, put $20 in the video poker machine and get a free martini instead. The bartenders were much friendlier at the sports bar, too."
2,"Came here on a Saturday night thinking I was going to enjoy , as Kaskade was playing . Bought tickets online and the line for people with tickets was ridiculous we waited and waited and waited to get in. By the time I was at the door to get in it was a hour and 30min later by that time I knew the club was packed and sure enough we walk in the dance floor is CLOSED!! NO Tables!! So why let people in if you're at capacity and security kept on people to move along move along , ok? Move where?! The club is so small! They kept letting people in but with nowhere to go . Aside from that the dance floor is pretty small . And When we walked in we had to go down what looked like alley stairs to get inside the club smh that's horrible . The little I was able to see of Kaskade he was great"
2,"The food is good. I would give this restaurant 4 stars if it weren't for the bad experiences I keep getting from the staff. \n\nI've been here twice now, and the waiters and hosts have always been horrible. The last time my party ate here, the service was lousy, the food took 1 hour to arrive, and we even paid them their required 18% gratuity. We complained to the manager, and he promised to have a $100 giftcard for our next visit, but that never came. \n\nSo:\n\nPros:\n1.) Decent food\n\nCons:\n1.) Horrible service\n2.) No follow through on their commitments. \n\n\nI will never eat here again."
2,"So I've been to this location and the one in Phoenix off ray and the 10. My friend has a membership here. So we've been gym buddies and trying to encourage each other to go more often. Sometimes u need that extra push to get you there! \n\nIf you want something super basic, nothing flashy or fancy then this is the gym for you. It's about $10 a month, or you can do $20 a month for all locations and bring unlimited number of guests. \n\nNow I'm torn between a 2 star and 3 star rating for this place. First, I've been a member with 24 hour for years. Not switching, they're pretty basic as well, nothing fancy, has everything I need for a very reasonably priced. However, my gym has a sauna, basketball court, classes, pool, etc. which Planet does not. The big thing for me was no sauna! what!? AND what is up with that lunk alarm thing? They're supposed to be a judgment free gym supposedly, but then they have this alarm which screams and flashes when someone drops a heavy weight, grunts, or actually exerts effort.  what the!!?? Doesn't really make sense to me. & is that really necessary?"
2,Very RUDE management- we had to wait over an HOUR to get our car out of valet while we watched people leave left and right...we mentioned this to several people - we were offered many excuses to find out in the end that they completely misplaced our CAR! I would have been satisfied if they had offered us a drink- our table spent over $200 on our dinner- we didn't even get an apology...I wrote a letter and everything!\n\nThe waitstaff was friendly- the meal was ok - nothing special considering Charlotte has plenty of great restaurants . Restaurants have a lot to do with relationships- and they killed mine with this one.  Bottom line the food wasn't THAT good to warrant my return...
2,I take back what I said about II Vinao being mismanaged.  I guess they where just having an off day.  The owner contacted me wanting details so that all problems could be fixed.  How great is that?  We will definitely be dropping by again sometime soon.  This place has what it takes to get a 5 star review from me I'm sure of it...I'll make sure to keep everyone posted.
2,"Should change the name to Lobster Mehhh. I felt like I was at the food court in the mall when i saw how this place was set up. It would have been better if it were since the mall has more seating.\nHad the lobster roll combo that came with fries and a drink. The Lobster roll was not a traditional one in my eyes. It was filled with plenty of lobster but was not tossed in the mayo/scallion mix a Maine lobster roll would have. It seemed to have a vinegar based medley that overwhelmed any on the natural flavors. The item that was the best was the fries, theses were actually very tasty. The lobster mac and cheese was so-so. A few lobster chunks on top but none throughout, not worth the $9.95. Definitely not returning!!"
2,"Food is ok. Hot foods are never warm when they get to your table. They recently took a few items off the menu which is bad because they were the best. But, the biggest problem is the noise. Way way way too loud. Not only are the TV's loud but the worst is the customers at the bar who are screaming. There is no seating for those that want a meal in peace. Server told us it was like that all the time. Unfortunately we do not go because we don't want to risk there being a game on."
2,"I guess I just don't get it.\n\nIt's advertised as a Madison favorite.  I hear people talking about going there all the time.  But the food just didn't leave me with a great impression.\n\nThe chips and salsa are great.  I suppose that's one thing that's pretty tough to get wrong.  But my burrito came out rather bland, as did my daughter's quesadilla.  Unless there was a kitchen mixup, my \""hot\"" salsa sure did taste like mild.  \n\nThe service was good, the bar selection is solid, and the atmosphere is a neat one.  The food, however, just doesn't do anything for me."
2,"If you didn't know where it was you'd miss it.  Dining area is sparse, basic tables and booths. Open deli-style.  \n\nGot the chicken parm sub as recommended by Yelpers.  Mine was a little dry but a decent sandwich.  Still not sure i would order it again.  Fries are standard crinkle-cut.  \n\nSummary: good place as alternative to nearby fast food joints but I wouldn't go out of my way to come again."
2,"SAD! Wanted to like this place! Just got back from my first (and probably) last time to Elliot & Co. . . . . NOT worth the money - even with yelp discount!\n  Services Recieved :  Haircut and a Shave Package  (getting rid of my beard!)\n     First off let me say the haircut was/is very good (hence the chance, albeit slim, of a return) However,\n SHAVE LEFT MUCH TO BE DESIRED.....LIKE A CLOSE SHAVE FOR INSTANCE!!!  When i got home girlfriend and i noticed 1/4 inch hairs in spots on neck (must have missed it with razor?!) and stubble that i was able to remove with a simple disposable razor (which cost A LOT less).  All the fluff was nice; the towels and oils but at the end of the day the shave just wasn't there.\n\nBottom Line: Nice People, nice environment, good haircuts TERRIBLE SHAVE!"
2,"Your typical Sally's Beauty Supply. Have a good amount of items in stock, but unfortunately the customer service wasn't great. The manager of this store was kind and acknowledged me, but the other employees didn't seem to have a real drive to help me in a friendly manner. A smile goes a long way, as well as looking like you enjoy what you do."
2,"I had lunch today at this joint with family... My sis-in law, big fan of this place and makes it a point to stop here when she is in town...  The place is not very big at all but the line was out the door...  I ordered the mixed plate.. I thought it was ok,,, it included a beef, chicken and some fish... The beef though in sauce did not have much taste,,, the chicken was good, i liked it.. tender and moist, it was de-boned thigh,, the fish was ehh,,, rather had extra chicken.. The portion was large, too large for me to finish...  I will try the Mami or Udon noodles next time....  I hesitantly recommend this place... I would eat here again but i wont make a special trip....  Hope this helps"
2,"I stayed at the Excalibur the last time I was in Vegas because I was meeting friends and this is where they chose to stay. Ugh. I do not know what is wrong with them. This hotel/casino is not cool. It was very expensive (160$ a night... what?) and the first room we went into smelled like someone poured water all over the floor and let mold grow for a few weeks. After over an hour, they gave us another room which was fine, but still overpriced. The casino is in a bad location, so far from the central strip. Who wants to go to New york New york? cuz that's about the only place that is close to this hotel, oh and the MGM. All of the food in this casino is bad. Overall, I was not happy that we had to stay at this hotel. Never again."
2,Not very impressive ... tables and floor dirty .. I spilled accidentally and staff watched as I cleaned up with no offer of help.   Left sticky residue and nobody would wipe down properly
2,"The atmosphere was nice and impressive. I myself ordered the Chicken Meatloaf which was very tasty. My partner on the other hand had the Chicken Royale which was very unsatisfying. It had no flavor and to be honest the green beans and carrots that were the side dishes had lots more flavor and were more pleasing. \n\nMy waiter was attentive once the food came out, but before hand he was out of sight. \n\nI probably will not be back."
2,"What a dissapointment when you see such an exciting menu, unable to make a choice then you are served frozen hashbrowns and low quality ingrediants.  The chicken fried steak was consumed by a porky/ smoke flavor. The service was friendly and charming but I can't get over the dissapointment in food quality."
2,"it's partially my fault for not checking the lunch menu before i came, but i was very disappointed in lunch. i came on a recommendation, and was so excited to have tapas, bouillabaisse, spanish, italian, and french food! so i brought my family here at lunch only to see BORING sandwiches on the menu. we had a cuban and the chicken sandwich. lame. vegas is supposed to be a 24 hour city. i felt sad and embarrassed for bringing them here. the restaurant should at least have a few of their signature dishes, even in smaller portions, on the lunch menu."
2,We just bought a house with an evaporative cooler on it in Mesa.  The previous owners said that the building of Tempe town lake cut 3 months off of the time they could use the coolers due to the humidity being raised.  \n\nAlso the dam has popped so there is no 'lake' at the moment.  That's a negative!
2,"Overall I just wasn't super impressed with this place.  I heard good things about it, so I decided to brave the very long wait...which is always present and eat breakfast here.  The food was decent, don't get me wrong, but there was nothing that truly stood out to me and it's quite crowded.   Sorry, but I would rather go to the Gilbert House down the street any day."
2,"Sunday brunch, is just average, nothing special. As for the selection I felt it lacked in variety...basic breakfast foods and flatbread pizzas. (Upstream set the bar high for brunch) the food wasn't cold but  could've been hotter. Previous reviews said the beer was watered down, it must be a theme w/their alcohol selections b/c the Bloody Mary was watered down as we'll, I'm not sure if it's the mix they used...have definitely had better.  The atmosphere is cool and it was packed, but just don't see what all the hype is about."
2,"Located in The Golden Nugget On Fremont Street Downtown Las Vegas. Ok so I hate to do this but, this place is just ok. the drinks were good, the service even better. The food was average to not so good. The fish and chips were saturated with oil. The 'tempura' lobster was more like funnel cake. There are much better choices downtown that are a lot cheaper. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"
2,I DON'T LOVE THEIR BURGERS.\n\nI like it but I don't love it. Food took way too long to come out and my medium burger was well done. I like the different sauces and their fries though. I had a better burger at serendipity and they don't even specialize in burgers. We ordered I love bacon and thanks to the bacon otherwise It's just an overpriced carl's jr. Plymouth's pride... don't even think about it might as well get a frozen turkey patty at the grocery store and microwave it. \n\nI do love that their have variety of flavors and cuts for fries.
2,"I've had a lot better Ethiopian than I was served at Buraka. There is a decent percentage of veg options, which I appreciate, but the menu overall isn't very broad. They also don't have sampler platters for individuals, except for a two-entree combination option which costs more than one entree for approximately the same amount of food. \n\n I ordered a combination of the misir wot and the black beans, both described as spicy. Wary due to other Yelp reviews, I emphasized to the server that I like my food spicy, and she assured me that the two dishes are indeed quite spicy. They were not. More significantly, they simply weren't very flavorful. Nor was the injera, usually a highlight of my Ethiopian restaurant experiences.  Halfway through the meal the server offered hot sauce, which helped,but I ultimately expect more flavor in the food itself. \n\nThe ambiance is nice, and they have patio dining, but I'd give this restaurant a definite pass in the future."
2,Well for starters I am not a big fan of the Beatles (Yes we do exist) so I was not really looking forward to this. We had reasonable seats and the venue is quite large and with stage being 360 and they way main stage is set it is possible to miss out somethings. Cirque tried to cover it with something going on each side but I found it to be a sensory overload. The soundtrack is good as it is a take on legendary music here. The acrobats are ok but not amazing like other shows. My friend enjoyed it but I wasn't impressed so my take is if you are a Beatles fan by all means go for it but if you are Cirque fan there are much better options.
2,"This is a review of the meeting facilities, and NOT the rooms.  I have no experience of the guest rooms at this location.\n\nI attended a two-day training here and was largely disappointed by the meeting facilities lack of power outlets in the space we were using.  The training was a computer-related course and all of the attendees were forced to fight over probably five power outlets. \n\nAdditionally, the first day of our training there was some sort of awful plumbing problem occurring in the building that caused the entire place to smell of sewer gas and sewage.   The property was not able to combat the smell and we all just had to endure it until the cause was resolved.  Gross."
2,"Rather disappointed, ordered the kare-kare, although the meat was tender,vegetables were soggy.  The lechon kawali was pretty good, came with the gravy dip and rice. Perhaps will give them another chance due to the A/C not working on one of the hottest day of the year 122 deg,"
2,"Now that I have your attention, let me qualify the 2 Star \""award\"". The good: the rooms are excellent; great design and better views. The architecture is captivating, and the prices are acceptable.\nHowever, the shuttle they claim to offer from the airport is pointless for most. Check the online schedule BEFORE you book a flight. The pick up times are sporadic at best.... who wants to wait 2-3 hours for a shuttle? the Taxi will cost $40 w/o tip. When you see the M Resort offer anything \""complimentary\"", its NOT. At best, its a 2 for 1 offer.  Forget the buffet if your time means anything to you.... we stood 15 minutes and moved, I'm not joking, 4 feet! We arrived looking forward to relaxing at their gorgeous pool only to be told that the area is closed through March. We tried to get a glass of wine at the Hostile Grape; oops, closed 3 days a week! And if you like to shop, plan on renting a car because there is none at M, and the hotel is in the middle of NOWHERE. Next time I'll try Green Valley Ranch or South Point."
2,"I want to give more stars and really like this place.  Service was ok, carne asada tacos pretty good.  Price is cheap.  They have beer.  Nice layout and good location.   All great things but................The place is filthy.  If you can't or won't maintain the dining room and bathrooms then just imagine the kitchen.  We didn't catch them on a bad day either.  What a shame."
2,"Hash House A Go Go in the Plaza is a family friendly diner with portions meant for sumo wrestlers and competitive eaters.  The food pile is truly a spectacle in a place where quantity seems more important than quality.\n\nWe tried the Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffles, the Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict, and a House Salad.  \n\nThe Fried Chicken and Waffles was average.  The chicken was crispy enough, but wasn't juicy and didn't have a lot of seasoning.  The waffles didn't have a bacon-y flavor, we wished they had just given us some strips of bacon instead.\n\nThe Fried Chicken Benedict was like three separate dishes piled into one--literally stacked right on top of each other.  One dish would be fried chicken and mashed potatoes, another would be a biscuit with gravy, and the last would be an eggs and bacon scramble with spinach, tomato, and mozzarella.  With all that on one plate you can't really distinguish one flavor from another, but you can make every bite different.\n\nThe House Salad was the standard bag mix of iceberg lettuce, nothing special.\n\nIf you do want to try Hash House A Go Go split a plate with someone and come for a true diner experience."
2,My second worst crepe experience ever!\n\nI ordered a cheese and prosciutto crepe. The crepe was almost thick as a pancake and really doughy. I like doughy crepes but they should be much thinner. It was also not very hot. The prosciutto was too thick and it was kind of too strong in flavor. Worst of all are the flimsy forks they give you. I had a hell of a time trying to cut the prosciutto.\n\nMy BF ordered a decent veggie crepe. Mushroom and spinach I think. This crepe was also doughy and thick. If it were not for this decent crepe I would give this place one star.\n\nThe coffee here is awful. I will never return.\n\nParking is a breeze usually and it's free. It's in the Paris parking structure.\n\nWhen we got here it was not too busy but when we passed by later on it was really packed. I really wonder why....The only cool thing here is checking out the stereotypical Parisian outfits the employees have to wear haha!
2,"first time here was a year ago. went with 2 of my friends, and we ended up going to their walk-up counter because the wait for an inside table was about an hour. we ordered small frozen hot chocolate. \n\ni must say - i wasnt really impressed. it tasted like a chocolate shake with sprinkles. maybe its better if you go inside to order it? i dont know...\n\nsecond time i met some friends in town. they were eating dinner (i didnt eat because i just ate). everything looked really good and portions were pretty decent as well. \n\nthird time we went in was a few weeks ago with my sister and some friends back home. ordered a frozen hot chocolate and a frozen white hot chocolate. i couldnt remember how big they were or how \""eh\"" they were, but my sisters never been and we were already there. my sister ordered the frozen hot chocolate for two because her and her boyfriend were gonna share it. and it was waaaaaaaaaaay too much frozen hot chocolate! and as rich as it is, you really dont need anymore than a small. \n\nservice was alright - the cashier there was a little slow at ringing in orders/putting the tickets up on the rail. and it seemed they were short staffed or something because the girl making the drinks seemed overwhelmed the whole time we were there. agian, maybe the hype was built up so much i expected a lot?\n\nmaybe i'll come back, stick out the wait and eat inside?"
2,Should have never changed the recipes. I have been back twice since new ownership. I have to say I will give them one more shot. The place has lost the touch of service that was given. I feel while talking with workers that they can do better since everyone was really nice.
2,The Peking duck was good- but it's hard to mess that up. The walnut prawns should be labeled dessert as it's so sweet- likely can cause a diabetic to go into shock. The crab was like licking an ashtray full of garlic and was overdone. \n\nService was nice. Gentlemen. Too bad they got stuck at a crap restaurant. \n\nThis morning I'm paying the price for eating this stuff.
2,"After a year of basketing, I have  to downgrade Bountiful Baskets. The quality was never exceptional, but nonetheless I'm seeing the quality continue to decline. Too much produce that is spoiled within a day or two. I'm really getting tired of certain staples they throw in EVERY week (lousy apples, romaine lettuce). I bought a case of honeycrisp apples when they were in on special - extremely disappointing. They were tiny and started to spoil after just a few days. (That may have been my fault for not taking them out of the case immediately and checking for \""bad\"" apples.) \n\nBountiful Baskets is more concerned with quantity over quality, which is fine because that's their whole M.O. I'm just tired of it and will have to look into a CSA."
2,1hr wait for our food after we got a seat.\n\nNice scenery and awesome vibe. That's were it ends.\n\nThe Blueberry muffins was unbeatable and dry.\n\nThe biscuits and gravy was pretty dang good. Should come with sausage or bacon though.\n\nThe Carne asada burrito was pretty bland.\n\nThe sandwich made out of French toast was the best thing and it was decent at best.\n\nWe will be back to the Perch but not here.
2,"Ok this place just wasnt funny.  The only good thing about it was the opener.  If it hadn't been for him I might have walked out.  It was also $39 for a one hour show, which seems steep.  In new york its $25 and is more like 2 & 1/2 hours.  The worst part about it was the waitstaff.  Maybe if they had let me get a slight buzz I would have had a better time.  Most comedy clubs have a 2 drink minimum, but I swear this place seemed to have a 2 drink MAXIMUM.  The waitress gave us the first round and didn't come back anywhere in sight for at least 40 minutes.  Plus, we were paying cash and she wanted us to pay each time she brought the drinks, then stood right in front of us so we couldn't see the show while she was demanding the money.  I mean, it was a wednesday night so maybe I shouldn't have expected much, but for this kind of experience I would say the ticket should be more like half of what we paid.  my advice is to wait for a weekend for comedy in this town"
2,"Moe's is very average food. There isn't anything that stands out and falls behind similar places-Qdoba, Chipotle etc. \n\nThe food was fresh and tasted alright, but was nothing special. The burritos are on the smaller end and has smaller portions inside the burrito.\n\nMy biggest problem was the value. There is NO way a burrito of that size with that little rice, beans, meat should cost over $7.50 for an original size. I've had bigger and better burritos that cost around $5. A small soda for $2.50 is also a bit much (free refills).\n\nWith each order you do get chips and salsa. I really liked the chips. Salsa was okay.\n\nOne other thing that baffled me. My wife ordered a Triple Lindy burrito in a bowl. You get this in a white box. When you try to throw it away, you can't fit the box in the trash can as the top is configured in a weird way. Good thinking.....\n\nI was amused by the name of the Burritos-Homewrecker, Art Vandelay etc. Good stuff!\n\nMoe's won't be high on list to go back to around Jobing.com for me. There are other places that are better.\n\n2.5"
2,"Food is really good but Damn the service is really terrible. This is my 3rd time here and I thought they were just busy before but as much as I enjoyed the food, I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. Wait time for your food is crazy  then they bring you food you didnt order, so u wait, only to tell you that your food was probably laid on someone else's table so u wait some more. Food came, you asked for a bowl and took another century to come and had to physically tackle the server on the other table. You wait some more and the bowl was probably still in the factory. Worst part, Nobody even apologized. Another incidence, ordered food and never came in so you cancelled it coz the appetite just went away, check came in and they still charged you for it and they even fight you and say they delivered it.. OMG. I guess have your food to go? Wheres the management here?"
2,"Dirig\u00e9 par les m\u00eames propri\u00e9taires que Sushi crescent et Sushi st-denis, je dirais que cette succursale est celle que j'aime le moins. Service presqu'inexistant (ce qui est probl\u00e9matique dans un all you can eat!), le poisson ne goute pas frais et les employ\u00e9s ne pourraient pas \u00eatre plus b\u00eates. Tant qu'\u00e0 avoir envie de sushi \u00e0 volont\u00e9, marchez un 5 minutes plus loin et allez vous remplir l'estomac au Sushi crescent. Je sais que ce sont les m\u00eames propri\u00e9taires, mais je n'ai jamais eu de probl\u00e8mes \u00e0 cet autre succursale."
2,"We had a reservation on July 4 and we came few minutes early to check in.  Noticed a lot of people waiting and tables empty. We had to wait over  20 minutes to be seated.  Asked hostess what was the hold up she explained they were still seating people that had reservations 20 minutes before ours and the computer tells them who is next.  Got to outside table 108 out there and finally got water 10 minutes while other people seated after us got drinks and bread.  Dinner was ok my husband had seafood and some of the clams were not open sign of bad clam no pasta with dinner they should of not served the non-opened clams daughter's pasta was fine sauce was good, I had lemon chicken and chicken was fatty. Asked for bread sticks never got them.  Also outside there were steamers and they were so overpowering we couldn't see and my daughter got really wet."
2,Barely mediocre bar food.  Our beers were warm and the food was blah and greasy.  I've had better food from a fast food joint and at half the price.  Not worthy of a return.
2,Stayed last weekend and did not enjoy. I am a Marriott Rewards member and have to say that I got better service staying at a Fairfield.  Room was not cleaned despite calling room service twice. Light switches in room did not work. Either all lights on or off. Elevator access with room key was a joke because it often did not work right. Never received bill portfolio thru email despite multiple calls. System not working and transferred to another number to leave a message. Would recommend not staying here.
2,"This PO is convenient for me and has the godsend of an Automated Postal Center, where you can breeze in, buy stamps or set up to send a package, and breeze out.  However, the special hopper where you are supposed to put those packages is frequently full, which means it can not be opened.  Have stood there and rung the bell and banged on the door and tried to tell the counter workers, but NEVER get a response.  Why make it so easy for us to send stuff and then we can't physically send it?  Ugh.  Answer the dang bell, it's called service.\nAnother time on a Sat morning, the APC was on the fritz, so I had to wait in line, as did everybody else who wanted to use the APC.  When it was my turn, I told the worker that the APC was down.  She had no idea and said, \""Oh, that's why it's so busy in here.\""  So I was the first person to tell them about the technical issue? \nUGH again.  I try to support the PO; I don't want to lose this service in the U.S.; but OMG they need to meet us halfway!  just a little customer service, please!"
2,"I had heard wonderful things about Rossario's (best restaurant in Monona, great Italian food, etc.).  I was extremely disappointed after dining there last night.  I ordered the portabello mushroom lasagne, which consisted of an indiscriminate mass of limp noodles, cheese, and mushrooms drowned in sauce.  Not lasagne.  My husband, who is Italian, ordered the chicken Puttanesca.  He took two bites, then stared despondently at his plate.  Even the salad was disappointing.  In three words: Ugh, Ugh, Ugh."
2,This 24 Hour location is really busy and the equipment is worn out. I did not like this particular 24 Hour.
2,"I had high hopes that this place was on the same level as Salt River in feel and character but I sure did not have that after visiting it last night.  Maybe as I never have been at Wrigley I am missing some of the customized elements.\n\nBy far the biggest issue, minus the stupid prices for t-shirts and concessions, is the exceedingly poor scoreboard.  We sat in the lower level of the first base side and had a heck of a time reading the scoreboard.  Here are my gripes on the scoreboard:\n\nToo small to be useful\nAt night it is not very well lighted so seeing the non-lighted sections is impossible\nAbout 1/3 was being used for advertising\nNo stats provided for the batter (take a lesson from Salt River)\nThe line up on the left side did not highlight the batter but with the letters so small it would not be of much use.\n\nBy the way the parking lot lighting but there was no signage as to how to exit and the entrance was blocked off!  \n\nI never have been to a ballpark above a crude kids field that did not have the distances from home plate to the outfield fence shown with signs hanging on the fence."
2,"I went on the indoor ride and we shared a gondola with random people. This was a slight mistake because they were silent the entire time and weren't up for having fun, plus the guy had a huge disgusting wart on his temple that I couldn't stop staring at. Um.\n\nThe gondolier was wonderful. He was really nice, really talkative, had a great voice. He made it fun. But the gondola ride itself, enhhhh. I go in for cheesy fun touristy ripoff stuff like this all the time, but I wouldn't recommend this. It looks way more fun than it is and costs far too much for the level of fun that you have. When you reach the turnaround point, you'll think to yourself, THAT'S IT?? And yes, that's it. Seriously. It's nowhere near as exciting as you'd think it would be. Outdoor one is supposed to be better, so maybe go for that instead. The indoor one can be skipped."
2,This grocery store gets 2 stars just for being open 24 hours.  \nI only shop there if it's after midnight (when the other grocery stores in the area have closed). \n\n- overpriced\n- very annoying security 'guys' follow you around the store\n- limited selection
2,"You know, I don't venture in to chain restaurants often, and even less often a chain steakhouse.  So how did I find myself at Outback Steakhouse?  It was a quick business trip to @Vegas.  I was treating for dinner and they asked for steak and convenient.  We were both staying at hotels well south of the strip so this limited the choices - nothing on the strip is convenient.\n\nDidn't I see an Outback by the Outlet Mall?  Yes.  Weary business traveler settles for dinner...\n\nI must say I have not been to an Outback in probably 6 years.  It was not as bad as I remember.  That would not make a great advertising slogan, by the way.\n\nMy 6 oz sirloin was fine.  The salad was fine.  The service was fine.  By fine I don't mean \""fine dining\"" I mean \""ok dining\"".\n\nSee you in another 6 years, Outback."
2,"Average food for average prices.  I came here with a $30 for $15 deal from Groupon and if I was actually spending the listed price on the menu, I would definitely not be satisfied.  Since my meal was basically half off, I would say that the food was okay and well worth it, but I would not spend more than that. \n\nI ordered in total about 6 dishes worth $90 that I paid $45 dollars for, and out of all of them I only liked the calamari.  Every other dish was either meatless, tasteless, or overcooked. \n\nThe restaurant was absolutely stunning and nicely decorated.  The lights were dim and perfect for a date, if the food was better.  \n\nThe server was very attentive and friendly, one of the better servers I have ever interacted with."
2,"The airport is in need of an update.  It is very lack luster, there are very few healthy options for food (although this is common for airports) and there are still random Oxygen bars (do people still use these?).  The bathrooms are pretty dirty.  They have some corporate sponsored \""charging stations\"" but they are typically crowded and you can see people up and down the terminals either sitting on the floor or hustling to grab spots when they open.  Unless you are coming to or leaving LV, there are much better spots to have to lay over."
2,Food was ok and service was really bad.\n\nWe went there for the Christmas Eve dinner. We made the reservation at 11pm via OpenTable which shows that they have reservation available at 11 or 11:30. However after we arrived the waitress said they will close at 12. We decided to just eat very fast which turned out to be a really bad idea because during the dinner the wait staff were really impatient and rude.\n\nMost of the food were also not as good as the other yelp reviewers said...although I am not sure if it was because it was the Christmas Eve.
2,"This restaurant was horrible. We ordered the special murg tikka and the chicken tasted as though they threw a frozen chicken packet into the oven, sprinkled some salt and pepper and served it to us. We also ordered the paneer makhani and it was sub standard.\nThe naan was tasty, so if you're up for some naan and pickles.. go for it. Otherwise i'd steer clear of this place."
2,"One star for food and one for their awesome bartender Emmanuel who redeemed the offensive service I got here. I've came here twice and both times Emmanuel was working the bar-so friendly and personable! He's just an all around nice guy, likes to make sure everyone's having a good time. If I could've taken the tip back from our waiter and given it to him, I would've. He gave us more service in the 8 minutes we were at the bar than our \""waiter\"" did in the 45 minutes we were at our table. \n\nI get it, not everyone likes their job every day. I don't like my job every single day! But when dealing with customers you pretend to like your job and don't make them feel like their presence is a burden. Our waiter didn't get that memo and his inattentiveness bordered on neglect. He came to our table three times, once to take our drink orders, food orders and then to bring the check. The way he asked if we wanted the check basically said \""I want you to leave now.\"" The busser came by more often than he did to see if we needed anything. \n\nThis place isn't worth the time if you're coming from out of your way. If you choose to go for the simple fact that yard house is the cluster that it usually is, sit at the bar!"
2,"When the owner comes by to apologize, I'ts not a good night. Service is slow, pizza is nothing special in a town with some good pie. It's also weirdly loud in there."
2,Here for a Respiratory Convention and got a hotel not to spend my whole day in. More for a place to sleep. Rooms are nice beds comfy but the seepage of smoke which in fact is a non smoking area is pretty strong. Who am I too complain when of course this is Vegas!!  Another minus was the resort fees WTH!!! Thinking I scored with the reasonable fees heck no!!!  Treasure Island is more like Pirate Island. They take your money.
2,"Come for the endless variety of BBQ, stay because you can't make a decision. Realize the selection of sides is equally expansive, and just sit there eating biscuits with apple butter until someone tells you to get the tri-tip sandwich with a side of cornbread.\n\nI understand why people are lamenting about how stupid the prices are, but come on, y'all. You could totally share a meal with someone here and leave satisfied (as long as you eat yer biscuits.) Now, now, I know what you're thinking, \""We don't take kindly to sharers 'round these parts...\"" But put down your pitchforks, because the portions are proportionally reasonable to their stupid prices.\n\nLucille's lands at 2 stars for good biscuit and cornbread game, solid tri-tip and peanut slaw, and subpar brisket and mac 'n' cheese. In another region, I might toss Lucy a fourth star, but anything less than the best in this BBQ-splattered town just won't win my stomacheart."
2,"For the kitsch factor, for something to do for a day, this place is fine.  It's got games and the carousel bar and cheesy circus acts.  But it's dirty, it's run down, it's poorly planned, and I wouldn't stay here if my life depended on it.  (OK, MAYBE then.)  I tell people who come to visit all the time to not be taken in by the cheap rates here and at the Tropicana.  There's a reason WHY they're cheap."
2,"I have used irrigation with SPR for over 30 years. They have really dedicated people who go out of their way to be helpful. The Zanjeros were always available and  ready to work out some water issue, and they  are varied and frequent (like a neighbors dead animal in a canal) . So for many years I have been a big fan of SRP.\n\nUntil today!\n\nI needed to pay my water assessment so I went to the main office.\n1. Now a security guard tells you you are in the wrong place, no more receptionist.\n2. The payment  center was closed and turned into  a closet with some machines in it.\n3. Customer service is now a telephone on a brown wall with a sign over the phone saying call for customer service.\n\nZanjeros are now computer baby sitters for the nee Water Master system. Getting a consistent flow is a real challenge now. They are ready to add time but after you get shorted 20 minutes you have to move to a new user and it really does not work to then get 20 minutes delivered the next day. The person responsible  for the Water master needs to be required to meet users at 2am when the order gets shorted by the system.\n\nWhen I called today I spoke to an old style SRP person but you might as well visit the prison as use this facility, So no matter what the literature says SRP is now just another big faceless utility doing their level best to isolate the customer."
2,I had a craving for good BBQ and this was a disappointment. Ordered $35 worth of food and did not enjoy most of it. The pulled pork was okay. The brisket was mediocre. The chicken was okay. The beans were under cooked and pretty bad. Threw that away. The sauces were decent. I just ended up asking my father in law to make some brisket since I couldn't find anyone to buy some good southern style brisket. \n The staff was extremely nice and the place is really clean. Inside and a little outside seating. The portions were really small though so I was not impressed.
2,"As someone from the Philly area, driving by had me pretty excited. Pop's looks like Pat's! However, I got a cheesteak, with whiz, onions, and peppers- but they forgot the flavor.  Everything about it was bland.  I couldn't differentiate between the meat and the onions. It was weird. And the bread was awful- it was soft and did not taste like an Amoroso. Looks were most definitely deceiving. That said, the patio is great! And so were the sweet potato fries."
2,This was my first time trying Culvers. It's nothing special and is comparable to Wendy's or any other fast food burger place.
2,"Walked in to pick something up from the ship to store department, and the register is closed but next to it is layway and there were 5 people in line and the gentlemen at the register said that the other lane/register is closed.  I told him \""call for help then, because I'm not here for layway\""  2 other ladies in line agreed and said they were waiting too because no one would come help him.   Well it happened that we were near the employee back entrance or something and I told someone in that back hallway to immediately go call someone to help this guy out because we are not all here for layaway and no one is helping him.  Within 2 minutes someone came to help him.   They were still a little slow but not nearly as bad as before.  It still took almost 30 min from the time I came in, to the time I finally got my 2 items and they allowed me to pull around back to pick it up because it was too large to wheel through the store on a flatbed cart.  \n\nNot necessarily poor service but definitely LACK OF HELP to properly take care of customers!"
2,I guess I didn't order the right sandwich because out of all the awesome reviews my sandwich was just.... OK. I got the Italian and was not really impressed. It was just a small amount of meat and a slice of cheese with stock Italian dressing. So what's the big deal?? Ok I'm gonna have to go back and order something else because I gotta see what all the hype is about! To be continued...
2,"I live in the neighborhood and have been eating here for years. (Both take out and dine in). I don't know if they have new cooks or what, but the quality of the food has slowly gone down hill in the last (6) months to the point I don't think we'll eat there again. The refried beans WERE FROM A CAN. I know homemade versus canned and these are canned. The Cheese Crisp was really lacking and very oily. The shredded beef taco had a lot of fat on the beef. This place used to serve really good Mexican food. Not so anymore. We're going back to Sylvia's La Canasta or Macayo's. Much better food, and not from a can."
2,"I thought it was over-hyped for what  I spent and received service wise. I was overall very disappointed. i went there to celebrate my BF's birthday and told the hostess it was his birthday, then told the waitress, and even told the water guy....and my BF still DID NOT receive the birthday dessert. :( I ordered sweet potato tempura and a king crab California roll and could not believe how dry the rice was. I get a better California roll at my local place back home for a quarter of the price. When we finished eating, it took them 30 mins to bring us the check!? I was so annoyed at this point. I always tip, but in this instance i did not. I did explain on the receipt why I didn't tip too. For how much hype this place gets I am sad to say I was not impressed."
2,"I'm conflicted about this place.  The wife and I were in LV for the first time since 2003, so we were exploring new places.  We saw this restaurant on our travels before heading to a show and we love sushi so we stopped.  The food was very fresh and drink selection was excellent, however portion size was tiny.  After $72 with tip my wife commented that is was the first restaurant that she had ever left feeling more hungry than when she arrived.  We then had to hurry off to get more food before the show."
2,First time there and sat at the bar. At first we were over whelmed by the customer service (two waitress helping us out) then after awhile there was absolutely no one we could get to order a second drink. We waited about 20 mins just to get our bill and to leave after waving down someone. The place was busy and I had ordered a sample drink but after getting no service we decided to leave.
2,"Very disappointing.  The evening started off well when I noticed they had foie gras on the menu and it wasn't just a foie gras pate, but the whole foie gras seared.  It was pretty good, although the radicchio didn't go well with it.  It also could have used another 30 seconds of searing.  \n\nEverything was downhill from there.  I have never seen a smaller or eaten a blander ceviche.  Ever.  If you're going to call something ceviche, it should be served in Peruvian fashion and taste something like ceviche.  \n\nThe lobster risotto was pretty good and had a nice little kick to it..  All three bites of it.\n\nThe black bass was forgettable.  The prime rib eye is misnamed.  If you aren't going to include the eye, which is the best part, then call it something else.  It was ok.\n\nEven with the complimentary soup and appetizer, we left unfilled and went to Smashburger around the corner for our second dinner."
2,"Not four seasons worthy! Food was salty and amateurish, as was the staff. the transition from the bar to the restaurant was awkward. Our sides came after the main dish had been eaten and they were the wrong side dishes, which might have been ok if the entire salt shaker had not been dumped into it!  The only saving grace was the manager who realized how awful the service and food were.  Don't bother driving that far north, stop when you get to Mastro's."
2,"If you want quality, quantity, and reasonable prices--don't go here.  The food could hardly be deemed within an authentic deli realm.  The service is poor, the offerings minute, and taste lacking (chicken soup too salty, sandwiches bland, and desserts hardly unique or fresh).\n\nEven though they are open 24 hours, you have 24 hours to find another venue.  This is a side-show at Circus Circus that is not worth attending."
2,pros:\nThey showed up on time\n\ncons:\nThey took 5.25 hours to LOAD my PODS (I did 95% of the packing before hand). It should have taken them 3 hours to do that work. And they charged me $446 in materials!!  So todays damage was $1150. Buyer beware.
2,"Little Darlings is 100% nude, hence. no alcohol was served.  It's a little off the Vegas strip but not hard to find.  If you want an awesome VEGAS strip club experience, this is not the place.  It was dingy and cheap looking.  I felt kind of dirty stepping inside.  The girls were not in their perfect form.  Some of them were old and out of shape (to put it nicely).  If that's what I wanted to look at, I could have stayed home and looked in the mirror.  We were club hopping so this was just another place for us to check out.  We only stayed less than 1 hour and skipped to Cheetah's afterward.  I would say to skip it totally."
2,"I'm torn between the quality product and the poor service and WiFi.  \n\nThe coffee is exceptional but the entry fee (getting past the flaming hoops of attitude) to get your coffee is a little high.  Now I guess I'm one of the cool kids at times (working for the man - Buring Man), but unless that comes up in conversation, most often I'm not dressed the part in my business casual and just another target for the staff.\n\nBeyond the slow service and attitude, the WiFi is crap.  They are riding a signal from a neighbor companies (Wet Paint) router.  I wish they'd get their own router and Cox connection!  Hell I'd even set it up for them, and when I suggested putting a WiFi tip jar the customers at the bar were all for it!\n\nI like the location and the product but not the service and WiFi - both things that can be fixed."
2,I had heard from several people the food here was good.  As I travel to Italy often I'm fairly picky about Italian food but am willing to make allowances for Italian-American restaurants.\n\nI had the lobster bisque which wasn't terrible but not great either.  A little too peppery and some pieces of what seemed to be dried fish.  I had ordered what I thought was the crab/shrimp cake appetizer but was brought the meal.  Since I hadn't actually looked at that part of the menu I didn't realize it wasn't the appetizer until I got the bill.  The crab/shrimp cake was adequate but there was too much filler for my taste.  The grilled potatoes and vegetables that came with the crab/shrimp cake were not warm.  Completely over-priced.\n\nThe service was glacially slow.\n\nI will not return.
2,"I think this place can do for a cleaning, some say it adds to the appeal, but you can get the same \""vibe\"" without feeling like needing extra soap when leaving. Drinks are cheap and pretty strong for the price or at least what I expected. I went out on my own looking for chat with some new people to have drinks with and shoot the breeze but it seems like this place is full of groups of people not really into expanding outside of their clicks. Dive bar that will get a group of people drunk reasonably quickly. No music going on the night I went, so maybe I missed a lot of the appeal of it, I will re-visit and update if I feel it's needed."
2,"Not pleased. \n\nYes, they have good portions.  Yes, its cool they deliver and are open til 930 every night.  Yes, the receptionist can speak English, which is not a prejudice comment, just a general fact after calling literally 7 Chinese restaurants who could not understand a single word i was saying. \n\nBut the food that I received was sub-par.  It just didn't have any flavor!  The pot stickers were way overdone and oh too crunchy on the outside with very little filling on the inside.  The lo mien noodles were...awkward.  Half were bunched together , some were overcooked, some were undercooked; the veggies were waxxy and the beef in it was overcooked and under seasoned.  Seriously you messed up lo mien???  The generals chicken was just OK, not horrible but I've had better.  \n\nAll in all a poor experience, so bad I didn't even bother with the leftovers, which is usually my favorite part of a good Chinese meal!"
2,"Stopped by here for lunch and started off with the crab mozzarella appetizer and the mushroom morel soup.  The crab mozzarella was pretty good and the mushroom morel soup was also very good.  The soup reminded me of the Cheesecake Factory mushroom soup but I still prefer the one from the Cheesecake Factory.  No reviews on the beer for now but if I ever go back and I'm off the meds I'll be sure to give it a go.\n\nThe baked seafood combo consisted of a couple of clams, a mahimahi fillet, scallops and stuffed shrimp.  I was not excited about the gooey imitation crab stuffing on the shrimp and both the mahimahi fillet and the scallops lacked seasoning.  The clams were OK.\n\nFor dessert we had the nutter butter ice-cream cake which was good.  Nothing too exiting about the food here."
2,"Close to my house so I checked it out again. Maybe 3 ppl plus a very in attentive bar tender (dare I call him that). More interested in goofing on his iPad than trying to provide any kind of service. I quickly dropped $45, practically had to beg to get a beer. I'll pay for the beer, just actually pay attention.\n\nProlly try it in a few months but I doubt anything will change. Hasn't in over a year. No wonder it's empty at 1am"
2,The flavors and toppings were okay.\nI was a little disappointed how few non-fat options there were.\nThey have an okay selection but all were of similar tastes.
2,"Being from the Midwest, I'd never had Del Taco. Can't really say I've missed anything: the bag probably had more flavor than the cold, limp fries and unmelted cheese on the all-lettuce \""chicken\"" tacos."
2,"So I read the reviews and expected this place to be great. Needless to say did not reach my expectations at all. First off its a smoking environment and I went for dinner it just doesn't sit well with me. The service was slow and not too friendly. We ordered cheese sticks (cold, nothing special), beer battered pickles (way too greasy and pickles were to soggy) and the beer battered BBQ chicken sandwich (the beer batter was so over cooked it was almost black and I couldn't even eat it) we tried cutting up it and removing the batter but it was so much work for a sandwich we heard so many good things about. The garlic Parmesan fries was not in the slightest garlicy. All said and done my boyfriend didn't even touch his sandwich. It was a flop for us. The beer was good though."
2,"We went for sunday brunch , i like the fact they open at 7am, i figure everyone still sleeping nursing late night hangovers. I was right at 7 am only a handful of us old folks in line. . The buffet was very limited and not many items. For about 25 bucks a head you should get more. The hot foods were mostly breakfast items what happend to the lunch part of brunch. Very sad. Everthing was fresh as it should be since we were their early. Still can't believe a beautiful casino , ' upscale\"" would have a brunch that was so simple. Spend a few more bucks and go to wynn, or bellagio.  Service was fine."
2,"Another jewel in the Fox crown-read amazing look and feel but outrageous prices for food that's really nothing special.  A few of us went to lunch the other day and one of my buddies orders the prime rib french dip.  The server asks if they would like mushrooms, peppers or onions to which my friend replied yes, please.  They were kind enough to charge $2 EACH for said add-ons so $6 total additional charge.  I mean seriously, I can get ten pounds of onions for two dollars...\nI ended up splitting a chicken club and a ~1 oz. cheese 'plate' with a friend and we both got iced tea.  $24...to top it off the waiter was kind of a dick.\nI probably would never patronize a Fox restaurant again if I didn't get hooked up with gift cards on occasion."
2,"My husband and I were so excited to see a trendy and family friendly restaurant pop up near our neighborhood we couldn't wait to try! We gushed over the decor for the entire time it took to get our wine (15 mins) which was sub par and room temperature. The menu was good, but only if you were on a \""cheat day\"".  We ordered the only 3 healthy options on the menu and were VERY disappointed. The hummus app was the smallest portion of hummus we've ever encountered, but the stale pita chips were enough for a portion 10x the size.  My Caprese salad didn't feel fresh and his garden salad was blah.  Again we pondered, \""maybe we ordered wrong\"" but come on, you shouldn't have ANYTHING on your menu if you don\""t stand behind it.  It was so disappointing that WE WENT TO ANOTHER RESTAURANT  AFTER ON A WORK DAY THAT CRAZY!!!    This place makes me soooooo sad because its the first trendy thing within 7 miles of our house! PLEASE PLAESE FIX THIS WE WILL BE REGULARS!"
2,"Service was slow and the burger came out on a soggy bun.  Asked for a fresh bun but took forever so ended up just eating the meat.  Also, the place was super hot.  Everyone at our table was sweating.  Maybe they were just having a bad night but I wouldn't go back to this place after this experience."
2,"My husband and I came here right before seeing a movie. We chose it based on the fact it is right next to the movie theater. The staff was great, prompt with seating and taking our order. \nYummy watermelon margarita! The food...... Not so great. I got the chopped salad but couldn't eat more than two bites because the dressing was far too spicy. The waiter was nice enough to substitute my salad with a quesadilla, which was nothing great, but at least my mouth wasn't on fire. My husband got the rancho burrito which wasn't too bad. \nWhen we go back to the movies, we'll go somewhere else for dinner. I wouldn't suggest this place to anyone."
2,"It's 7:30 am. Time for breakfast. Let's see... Hmmm... no eggs of any kind. Do I want a plate of sausage gravy or some turkey sausage? Maybe a banana that was ripe about 2 weeks ago. Maybe I can have both the gravy AND the turkey sausage...\n\nAfter 10 minutes of this and watching Magdelina make sure that there were PLENTY of froot loops to go along with the over ripe bananas, the sausage gravy, and the turkey sausage,, I grabbed a cup of coffee and went on my way... Hungry.\n\nThere are literally HUNDREDS of hotels in Las Vegas. Stay elsewhere."
2,"Huge rooms. Soft towels. Comfortable bed with tons of pillows.  \nThree things that make me happy when I'm traveling.  \n\nWhat's wrong with this place, then? First of all, the location is central to nothing aside from the mall which houses several chain restaurants.  Second, the staff could not care less about pretty much anything. While the woman who checked us in was helpful and friendly, that was the end of that. Despite requesting my Hilton status \""amenities\"" (just a package of snacks and water...not much), I never received it.  I was also charged $30 for internet when I shouldn't have paid a thing (got the bill corrected at check out). And housekeeping didn't leave enough towels or replace the water.  \n\nConsidering we paid over $200 a night, the blase attitude of the staff is very disappointing."
2,"When you walk in and view the menu, you think you are in \""Chicken Heaven\"". There are a variety of flavors and various seasonings you can choose for your fries. However, I was not impressed. I ordered the chicken wing and chicken strip meal with a side of fries. The chicken was cooked to a golden crisp and served hot. I ordered the garlic Parmesan, and thought it was waay too salty. Also, a few of my pieces of chicken were undercooked. The restaurant is small, so I had to get my food to go. I have heard mixed reviews and though my experience was not the greatest, I am willing to give Chicken Shack a second chance."
2,"My friend and I used the recent $25 for $50 Groupon to check out Pewter Rose on a Saturday night. \n\nHonestly, I thought it was a little bit on the pricey side for what it was so I'm glad that we had the coupon. The atmosphere was pleasant but a little kitschy and I kind of felt that plastic tablecloths were inappropriate when you're charging $20+ a plate. \n\nThat said, it was absolutely packed in there. We had reservations for 8pm and arrived right on time and the hostess was able to find us a seat within about 5 minutes. However the first thing out waiter said was essentially \""We're really busy tonight so I hope you're prepared to wait a while for your food\"". We weren't in any rush and agreed that was fine. The service was good, our waiter was very attentive and kept our water glasses filled but even though we ordered as soon as we were able to, it was after 8:30 before we got our appetizer and 9:20, and honestly that was more waiting than I had expected to do. While the restaurant was full, it is not *that* large. \n\nI had the seafood risotto and it was pretty delicious and I would eat it again. My friend had the herb encrusted lamb and while it was good, we both found it to be overly salty. \n\nI might come back and try the brunch but I don't think I'd pay full price for the dinner."
2,"Not the first time and only because it's a party. Horrible service waiter picks up my salad plate take the knife off of it and places it on the table with a big wad of lettuce still on it. Appetizers where horrible I'm hoping I don't get sick from the mushroom caps, drinks where watered down. Main course wasn't so bad steak was ok but potatoes where cold and veggies had a horrible taste.  So many great places to eat in town and they pick this dump."
2,"It took me more than 20 minutes to get my single to-go order at this location. On a thursday night when there was hardly anyone there this was ridiculous. The food was OK, I've had better Hawaiian BBQ in the valley for less money. At almost ten dollars for the whole meal, it was not worth the money. Fortunately they do have a smaller, less expensive portion that would fill most people up for lunch."
2,"I like Durant's out of principle, but this is by no means a great restaurant by my estimation. The three separate times I've been were riddled with lackluster service, improperly prepared seafood, and meat with the wrong temperature (medium means medium, right? or has beef fallen into the \""rare is the new medium\"" fashion continuum?). \n\nI remain altogether unimpressed. I would, however, hide here if the law was looking for me. It's just that kind of place."
2,"While it wasn't 'bad', there are far better places to have an enjoyable meal in the area, even if you want to catch a game.  We went once.  We saw.  We haven't been back."
2,"My boss asked for a referral for an interior designer to decorate our new office building so I reached out to the Yelp community and got turned on to Neilsen. I sent all the contact info on to my boss and she was thrilled that I had a referral for her so quickly! Brownie points for me! \n\nNosomuch. While Nielsen might be extremely talented, his follow through and time management were less than adequate. He wouldn't return my boss' phone calls without her leaving him several messages, was 2 weeks late turning in his proposal, and would go out of town for weeks at a time without letting her know he was gone....I could go on and on, but really, I don't want to re-live the embarrassment again. \n\nI know there is the chance that perhaps there were some crossed circuits here, especially since there are so many positive reviews, but honestly, something was amiss with this experience and that's why the low marks (I don't give a lot of low marks normally and it pains me to do so).\n\nI'm not saying don't use this company, because they are probably extremely talented, but I would evaluate the situation you're in before you recommend them to someone so you don't end up in the same predicament I am in."
2,"I get really annoyed with these \""fancy\"" hotels who don't offer the refrigerator and microwave in their standard rooms, which I can get at a Holiday Inn Express or a Comfort Inn for probably half the price.  \n\nAlso, for the love of all things holy, don't charge people for WiFi in 2011 after they already paid you an arm and a leg for a room that isn't worth it.  That is RIDICULOUS.\n\nThere's at least a half-mile walk (without a sidewalk) to anything except a small convenience store.\n\nThe room was comfortable enough, but no greater than any 3-star hotel I've ever stayed in."
2,I just ate the saddest grill cheese I've ever come across. They put one slice of cheese on the bread and the cheese didn't go to the ends of the bread... Sorry to be harsh but I am disappointed. The last time I was here food was great but this time it seemed like they slapped it on there. The cooks need to put more passion into making their food. :/
2,"I'll be honest, I am hard on Tex Mex restaurants in the Burgh. I want so much to believe that I will find a place that does good tacos and I am disappointed over and over again. Here's the thing about tacos that no one in this city seems to understand: the tortillas are the part of the taco that touches the tongue first and will be the source of much of the mouthfeel that you experience while chewing.  (Yeah, I am a bit upset with myself for using the word \""mouthfeel\"" but I wanted to use something besides \""chewiness\"" and my thesaurus is out of reach).\n\nI lived in San Antonio for years before moving to Pittsburgh and in most of Mexico and Texas a \""taco\"" is expected to be a soft tortilla (can be flour or corn) that is freshly made in house. A fresh tortilla makes a world of difference to the enjoyment of the taco. Some of my favourite tacos in the world are just plain, $1.50 tacos that are with some plain 'toppings' a good verde salsa, in a warm, fresh tortilla. I say all this because I think that Verde puts too much emphasis on the ingredients (Which are still under-spiced and boring with some store bought hot sauces on the table giving all the flavor) and then put those toppings into a boring, store bought tasting tortilla. So there you are spending $5 for a taco that's substantially underwhelming."
2,"I liked the menu a lot and can tell that there is some serious potential here, but had a really bad experience. \n\nThey couldnt help the obnoxious, loud, drunk group that came in, so I will give them a pass on that. \n\nBut when my 1 pound burger came out, the fries were already cold. They seemed like they may have tasted pretty good if they had come out about 10 minutes earlier. \n\nUnfortunately they also forgot my biscuit until I mentioned it. They then brought it out and it was reallly dry. Again, seemed like it could have been better if it had been quicker. \n\nAgain, I reallly wanted to like this place and was hoping to try a breakfast here before I left, but I'm really not sure I should risk it now. Bummer."
2,"Alas, this place seems to be getting worse and worse over the years. I tried it again last week because it was Monday and Saigon Noodles was closed. I just wanted soup. I ordered the Tom Yum. \nIt comes with a little salad. It was fresh and good but the dressing was pure sugar. My daughter had the chicken satay. The peanut sauce barely resembled peanuts. It was also really, really sweet and had a few peanuts in it. My soup was sour-- not that nice sweet/sour mix that is typical with Tom Yum-- just sour. It was edible though so I ate it.\nTo get in and out for under $20 was nice and the service was pretty good.\nBottom line: if you are on the West Side of Madison on a Monday and want soup... lower your standards and eat here. Otherwise, go to Saigon Noodle or (if you really, really need Thai food) head to Ha Long Bay on Willie Street."
2,"Like many other reviewers said, this is basically an economy motel in the guise of a nice hotel.  The water came out so quickly in the shower that it couldn't drain fast enough and crawled up to ankle level. And there is no control to reduce the water pressure. Brilliant! Especially in these times of water shortages. I actually had them switch rooms because I thought my shower was busted, but the second room was no different and I see that other people here had the same issue.  No premium channels on TV. Like 15 bucks for internet service in the room and no wireless, just plug in with a tiny cord that can't even reach to the bed.  Their business center charged 8 bucks for 15 minutes of internet use!  And the customer service was beyond horrible. Everyone acted like they didn't want me to be there. You'd ask someone behind a desk a question and they'd just ignore you, as if pretending you weren't there.  Maybe an okay place to gamble at, but certainly not worth staying there. I've legitimately had better service at random cheap motels.  The only reason I'm not giving one star is because the room was clean."
2,"If I were in charge of an M&M store on the strip, I would have:\n\n- free samples!\n- life-size huggable M&Ms\n- a demonstration of M&Ms melting in your mouth, not your hand, even in the Vegas desert \n- hot chicks and dudes clad only in M&Ms\n- a glamourous bar/lounge featuring candy-colored cocktails and novelty beer with M&Ms floating in it\n- a Cirque du Soleil show where the acrobats only wear M&Ms\n- high stakes poker with the life-size huggable M&Ms as dealers\n- strippers\n\nBut someone else is in charge of the M&M store on the Strip, and so it doesn't have any of those things. Instead it has:\n\n- four floors of stuff that says M&Ms on it for sale\n- a cheesy 3-D movie\n- a (probably cheesy) tour I didn't go on\n- NO FREE SAMPLES\n\nI guess that's probably more in line with the M&M brand than strippers, booze, and gambling, but then I don't really understand what they're doing on the strip. Whatever."
2,Four (4!!!) overcooked shrimp on a whole shrimp po boy for 12 bucks?!? How can they serve this without being ashamed of themselves? Red beans n rice was average at best. Nothing close to authentic. Gumbo? Meh. Bland and boring.\n\nI will say though that the service was above average...though it didn't make up for NOLA's lazy take on Cajun cuisine. This restaurant wouldn't last a day in New Orleans.
2,"On the spectrum of burgers, these are definitely pretty good. It's way better than a McDonald's or Burger King. However, I Love Burgers wouldn't want you to compare their experience to fast food, so I won't, either.\n\nWhen comparing I Love Burgers to other gourmet burger joints, it falls short.\n\nLet's start with the service. There was a small wait to get a table, even though there were tons of open seats. Granted, it was busy, but since the wait time for the actual food was around 45 minutes, wouldn't it have made sense to let us sit? Furthermore, even though we ordered fries, the waiter didn't even think to bring those out first -- we had to ask him. A simple thing like this would've made the time go by a lot easier.\n\nOnto the food... like I said, the burgers are decent, but nothing special. I had the \""i love bacon burger,\"" which comes with a patty made up of sirloin and applewood-smoked bacon, toped with crispy bacon, bacon mayo, gouda, and onion strings. Given how ravished I was at this point, I was happy to eat it, but I don't think I'll ever need to try this place again."
2,"Been here 3 times. I must admit it is not so great and over priced. The service lacks but they are open late. On a sunday night when I rip off a nail before a big dinner meeting, they are open for a quick fix. I give them props for the crazy late hours but there would be no reason to visit them otherwise.  Last resorts and emergencies only."
2,"All of our food had a hint of Italian seasoning, which was strange and unappealing.  The veggie enchilada is chock full of zucchini (the menu just said veggie, and I had anticipated the usual peppers and onions...if you love zucchini, get the veggie enchilada and a side of Mexican veggies - also just zucchini - unfortunately I really don't like zucchini!).  All around the place is nice, service was friendly, but the food just wasn't good."
2,"This place is clearly very popular, it was filled the entire time we were there with many people who appeared to be regulars.  We went there for the veggie options.  The seitan appetizer was really good, and a huge portion, but the rest of the meal was not so great.\nThe service was kinda crazy.  Our waiter was nice, but pretty non-existent, and the rest of the staff seemed crazy and frazzled."
2,"My boyfriend and I decided to go out to a late dinner at Hash House, service was okay.  The hostess were friendly and welcoming, but leaning on the host stand a little to much.  We had to order off the late night menu, I got the grilled cheese sandwich, It was decent.  Way to much tomato and only one big chunk of avocado.  It was thrown together and sloppy, hard to eat.  Mike was our server and was good. Took him about 15 min to get my strawberry lemonade margarita, but was a very good drink for only $8.  All in all it was a decent dinner but hope for better service and food next time."
2,I remember coming to this location with my family every time we were in Vegas. I wanted something cheap and delicious. I found the latter! \n\nOrdered the: \n* 1/2 Roasted Duck - It was actually quite good here but my boyfriend commented on the small portions compared to Cali Sam Woos. \n* BBQ Pork & Chicken Rice - Ahh tasted just like home\n* Veggies (suggested seasonal veggies) - simply saut\u00e9ed with some garlic & salt. Srzly can't go wrong. \n\nIt was quite expensive here though - bill came out to be around $50 or so. I mean sure we ate for 3 MORE meals but....\nAND it's cash only. \n\nI think I'm going to try Capital Seafood upstairs next time.
2,"we went back out this weekend to get some more white balsamic vinager (it is realy good) and decided to have lunch this time.\n\nThe kids split a kids grilled cheese and liked it.\n\nMy wife had the antipasto.  she enjoyed it, but it was very small for $12 and had thress baguette sized slices of bread that were not toasted or warmed.\n\nI had the Abrequine - sold as a roast beef panini but this sandwich never saw a panini press.  It was small and really need some kind of spread to add some flavor to it.  \n\nthe potato(e) chips were crispy but oily.\n\nThe kids like the gelato and I liked what I tried.\n\nI picked up a bottle of the mexican lime olive oil, it is too fragrant and sweet.  The taste comes off as artificial/\n\n  My wife like the spicy green beans and hte feta stuffed olives are ok.  Nice family trip ever 6 months or so but not a place to make a regular stop."
2,"Because I stayed in Luxor, I ate here because of convenience.  I ate here 3 out of the 4 days.  For the most part, the sandwiches, soups, and salad was pretty good.  It's cafe food yanno?  However, the last day, the  drink server poured too much water in my teapot and when i barely moved it, it swished around and splashed on my leg!  It was so hot that i almost dropped the entire teapot of hot water on my leg but i managed to put it down.  \n\nI was hungover and tired and trying to eat something before I catch my flight out so I didn't complain, I just wanted an icebag so I don't blister.  Now here's the bad service part....i had to ask another waitress to find our waitress, our waitress had to call the manager, the manager had to call security.  When he finally came, i said i just needed a bag of ice.  I should've just took it up with the drink server, told her that she filled up the pot to the absolute brim, and had her get me a bag of ice from the kitchen.  oh well."
2,"I've been there three times now, the third just to try the taco to get something quick right near campus and to be able to properly review it (can't review a Mexican place without trying a taco or burrito).  The taco was small, no more than 3-4 inches in length, and I didn't see a crispy shell option.  The shredded beef although was excellent, but for $2, not all that worth it.  On another visit, I tried the fried fish, and I don't think I could have been more disappointed.  It was seriously a fish with only half the meat left on it (bizarre wedges were cut out of it, and filled with limes), stuck in a fryer, un-filleted (other than the wedges), and essentially undressed or prepared (other than the limes).  The decor is juvenile (one sign said sexual harassment will not be reported but graded), and unappealing to say the least.  Bad price, sub-par food, but ok service."
2,"Can't comment about too much yet , but one thing that bugs me is certain things at the school must be paid for online at the schools website, seems that they want the parents money so badly that all your information is there,all they need is your credit card number.They also charge a 90 cent fee to pay online,but you can only pay online,WTF?who gets this fee?if it's a convenience fee,I'd just send 15 bucks to the school,but you can only pay online so if the extort .90 per paying parent,sure it adds up."
2,"Visiting Phoenix and noted the rave reviews on this place, so decided to try this on our way back to our hotel. When we came at around 8:30 PM on Friday night, there was only one other couple in front of us so we were served pretty quickly\nService: Only 2 people working. We were greeted immediately when we walked in, but I got the feeling that I was supposed to have known what I wanted at that time.  The employee who helped us was not super friendly, but maybe it had been a long shift or...?\nIce cream:  My husband got the TC^2 and the salted caramel, and I got the almond buttercrunch and apple cinnamon. I also sampled the honey blue cheese and the sugar and spice.  I didn't get much of the almond flavor out of the almond buttercrunch, but the other flavors were alright. The texture was not great - kind of icy, not very creamy for all the hype around this place.\nPricing: Reasonable.\nIf one is in the area and wants ice cream with \""original\"" flavors for a decent price, might stop in. Otherwise, I would not recommend going out of one's way for the ice cream here. All-in-all my husband and I were non-plused (we're also spoiled by some really great ice cream in the SF bay area)."
2,"Nothing special, to be honest.  I am a huge supporter of small business owners. Sadly, Sonic has better tasting hotdogs and buns. Also his lemonade offered with special (says machine is broken, awaiting repair) is disgusting, watered down. Sadly, after all these years driving by... I know why I have not ever stopped in....and never will again.  :/"
2,"The food was great and the atmosphere was fun however I took one sip of my beer and noticed an irony taste in my mouth then noticed something crunchy in my teeth. The beer  had chipped shards of glass in it! When I brought it to the attention of the manager he basically called me a liar saying, \""That's so weird because the bottle doesn't look chipped to me.\"" I had the glass in my hand!He replaced the bottle but nothing else was done about my glass filled mouth."
2,"If not for the delicious turkey crepe and cookies I would have given this one star. The service was horrible, the decor obnoxious and the cupcake desserts were, I kid you not,  4/5th icing (seriously gross).  Our waitress was no newbie, but maybe she had too many tables, maybe she wasn't too bright or maybe she was just so slow that she couldn't recall the order by the time she got to the computer. She totally forgot our appetizer and I appreciate the fact that she owned up to it twenty minutes later.  By the time our food finally arrived, the pasta was cold, but we were so hungry we didn't send it back.  Stick to the carry out desserts."
2,"I hate the quality of tint used on my car. I had my previous car tinted years ago and it noticeably kept the heat out of my car to a more normal level.  I again chose a dark tint for my new car and everyday my car is EXTREMELY hot. It was not worth the hundreds of dollars since my car is still hot.  I'm not happy at all.!!!! It's as if I have no tint at all. If that's the case, what's the point??? I just wasted my money."
2,"The Flamingo is one of the few surviving hotels from the old Vegas days...and it shows. \n\nThere is nothing flashy about the Flamingo. Short of the presence of the casino, it doesn't even feel like Vegas. The Flamingo has become an institution unto itself, and short of getting a free room for my visit, I rarely ever even step foot inside the hotel.\n\nHowever, you cannot justify destroying one of the few remaining icons from old Vegas. Visit the Flamingo if you've never been to Vegas...heck, stay there even. The rooms are decent, but I had a problem with cell phone reception with a pool view room. \n\nNo great restaurants inside of the hotel, but it is close enough to every other hotel that it makes walking the Strip an easy task."
2,"Nothing about this hotel rises above mediocre. Rooms are aging fast and staff service is about what you'd expect  from a typical DMV. They may choose to do their job, but they definitely won't \""help\"" in any sense of the word.\n\nThe whole hotel is about a decade and a half past it's prime (if it ever had one). I only stayed here because it was the designated lodging for a conference at the hotel. Never again."
2,"This has been my all time favorite restaurant anywhere for years, since I lived here in very early 2000s, but this time it was a disappointment.\n\nThey didn't have the usual Cuban Bread on the menu but they said they could make it anyway... but it wasn't at all the same.  They used a different bread that was way too thick and not even toasted.\n\nI got the bacon and cheese burger but the burger wasn't very good, I didn't finish it.  The fries were just blah."
2,Smoothie King is like a broke Jamba Juice! When I came here it was packed with loads of people and the staff here are far from good customer service. The way it is set up makes no sense what so ever. When it was time to pay the guy ringing us up got our order wrong and wanted me to $18.00 for two smoothies..overall smoothies were good but don't think i would go back ever again.
2,"Came here for lunch. Masaman curry had tomatoes in it, so I ordered it without tomato (cause who has ever heard of masaman curry with tomato).\n\nOrder medium spice. It tasted bland. Dish had a lot of chicken, but barely any vegetables. I would have liked a better balance.\n\nSoup was okay, as was the spring roll that came with the lunch special.\n\nPeanuts in the masaman were raw. I had ordered extra peanuts, as I have had Masaman curry at a lot of places, and I love the cooked peanuts. The raw peanuts were a raw deal.\n\nIf you have time, head over a few miles to Chanpen Thai Cuisine. MUCH better quality food.\n\nIf you work nearby and need a quick bite to eat, the prices were reasonable and service was good. But there are better Thai places close by."
2,"Had a decent enough experience buying the car, but the service department was another story when I went to get my accessories installed.  They forgot to tighten a hose after a routine install, and my car died while merging onto the freeway immediately afterwards, putting me into a dangerous position.  I was not offered any kind of compensation for my time since I live an hour away and had to make a second trip, the inconvenience, or the danger they put me in due to their complete negligence.  Not even an apology.   This doesn't bode well for my trust in their mechanics."
2,"Quite expensive for such a small bowl of food that isn't all that great. I had the Dan Dan noodles ($12 + tax/tip). The spice from the sauce overpowered the shrimp and the noodles -- I could barely taste them! You can get better Asian food in the strip, but if you're stuck at the Venetian, this is your best bet for something quick."
2,"If I had to sum up my meal in two words: odd brunch. I started the meal with a kugel & strawberries based on another yelper's review - ate almost the whole thing! Would def order it again or serve it for guests at a brunch. Yum. The matzo soup tasted OK, felt like it was surrounded by canned chix noodle (ala Cambell's) though. Entre was holishkes (bland cabbage rolls with chunky marinara sauce), the sides seemed like random afterthoughts and portion size was enormous. My daughter ordered the kid's mac & cheese with a side of applesauce (which is always served in a ridiculously tiny cup). The wait staff were friendly and accommodating. It can be overwhelming and claustrophobic on a busy night but Sunday night was as chill as it gets. Next time I'm sticking with my fave dish there: open-faced tuna melt. Can't go wrong there.\n\nThe menus just kill me... I have learned over the years how to navigate them quickly but seriously Restaurant Impossible needs to come in and revamp here! A simplified menu featuring well made dishes to compliment some home made ice cream would have an immediate positive impact. That and some cleaned up, contemporary, functioning decor would really breathe some life into this place! We'll never stop coming here but will enjoy it MUCH more with some improvements. I'm rooting for ya Ella's!"
2,"I've been here twice and will probably not go back. The first time I just sat at the bar and had a couple beers and some nachos. The nachos were average. The bar tender was super friendly and the service was pretty good.\n\nThe second time the waitress was a total space cadet. We got there and she brought some water over after about 15 minutes and then came and checked on us once every half hour after that. We were there a good 30 minutes before they put on the game we had requested. When we ordered our beer, she had no idea what we were talking about. The food we got was cold by the time it got to us. Even if it was hot, it still would have been sub-par.\n\nThe same \""regulars\"" were in there both times I've been there. They're a little bit loud and both times were visibly inebriated.\n\nThere are enough other bars in the area. I would avoid this one."
2,"I am not a big fan of seafood so it takes a lot to win me over.\n\nI tried several of the dishes at Original Fish Market including the lobster bisque, the halibut, and the pork-chop with coleslaw.  The lobster bisque was bland and cold.  The halibut was decent.  The pork chop was so bitter and dry.\n\nThe whole atmosphere of the place seemed standoff-ish and was not friendly.  Furthermore, it took forever just to get our waitress's attention.  When we finally got her to look our way, she was short with us.  It was as if we bothered her.  I would rather go get sushi than spend more money here."
2,"We went wIth a Groupon for our anniversary 11/11. Wanted Texas but it was booked. Thought we would try this one since its close to home. Salad bar was sad. Very small and food looked like it was out of cans and had been sitting out for awhile. Nothing like Texas and Via. My husband prefers meat well done, they offered to cook a little more. Meat came back just as rare. We asked for a coke, they brought a can with a glass of ice. Meat selection was limited and was ok. Got the bill, couldn't believe Coke was $3!! Prices for meal are pretty much the same as other places. We will make the trek to Via or Texas."
2,"Food is good but service is awful!!! We went twice and each time it's the same thing, takes forever to get waited on, servers don't check back to see if you need anything and one time they took so long to wait on us that dim sum ended. Don't waste your time go to Changs on Decatur instead! I would not recommend unless you want subpar food at over the top prices."
2,So thank you groupon for saving me some money as this place is not worth the admission fee.  \n\nI grew up in Seattle so aquariums and sealife are something I really enjoy and usually when traveling I like to go to them to see different regions sea creatures.  \n\nWell that's the first problem Phoenix is a desert and I should know better than to go to an aquarium here but I was intrigued as it was new and I got a good deal on tix.  \n\nThe tanks were small and too many people in too much of a confined area for my liking.  I felt people were angry for you taking more than 30 seconds to look at something or take a picture.  \n\nThe talk times were a waste as they were all too crowded and you couldn't see anything.  There was one cool tank that had a second level to go above and look down on it which gave the best view in the place.  \n\nOverall I say drive to California go to a real coastal aquarium and save your money.  Heck even go buy a DVD or something.
2,"First of all, I REALLY want to like JJ's. They have a great concept, a cool and clever menu, and a good atmosphere. They seem to be really involved in the community and use and sell a lot of local products (Local Beer, King of Pops, etc.) \n\nWe have been 3 times now, and really just find it to be sub-par for our expectations. We have tried various dogs and sandwiches. Most recently, we both had the \""signature dog\"" with Chili, onions, beans, bacon, jalape\u00f1os and mustard. We found the Chili and beans to be lacking in any flavor whatsoever. The bun and hot dog were high quality, and the hot dog gave that nice \""snap\"" when you bit in. Despite all of those delicious sounding ingredients, we found it to be a bit pedestrian. \n\n\nWe also split a side of onion rings, which were greasy and flavorless. We each took a bite and decided to throw the rest away. \n\nOverall, just disappointed.  I hope in time, JJ's becomes the Charlotte institution that it could be."
2,"The Excalibur Rountable buffet reminded me of one of those horrible cafeteria type restaurants. My review is based on breakfast. Luckily we had a 2 for 1 coupon so it only cost my partner and I $9 each.\n\nI don't really know what to say here except they had all your standard breakfast fare but it was all dried out or soggy. It was not fresh at all. I ddin't even bother to go back and get more food. There was a dessert area that had pastries and donuts. Meh.\n\nThe highlight was the waiter who managed to make us laugh.\n\nin response to a comment I read down below, yes the food is mass produced but that doesn't mean it can't be great food. There are many other buffets that actually get it right. Try one of those and stay far away from this place."
2,Had an issue returning an item I got for Christmas. The same one was sitting on the shelf and they wouldnt give me in store credit because the tag was missing. Um....... it was a Christmas gift...... people tend to take the price tags off. \n\nThey're only getting two stars because VS Customer Service (called them) fixed my issue. Big applause for Corporate Customer Relations on the issue.
2,This was sad sad place. Even being the weekend the place didn't have many patrons. Maybe it was one of those off weekends but since were told that we are on the guest list and thus won't have to pay any cover so we said why not. Went in and saw some go go dancers but that just about it. We had a beer and after  that bolted out of there in less than 30 minutes.
2,"*bed bugs* Stayed here for a conference this week. The place is big and they seem to have nice pools and lounge areas, however, our room smelled bad... Like musty and also like smoke. I really was unhappy with the smell. My girlfriends and I stayed in two separate rooms. After the first night one of my gf's woke up with 6-7 bites and was left uncomfortable and itching the entire trip. The second night of our stay ( i was staying in a different room) I was also bit! I went to sleep fine and woke up with two bites on my ankles. Just a side note, we never had the doors open and we were in two separate rooms.  We both sleep with the blankets covering us as well so I have determined that this is most likely a bed bug issue. My last night I was bit again twice and now I'm home and happy to be here. I am frustrated though that I am itching like crazy, just felt dirty yuck! I gave two stars because the facility is nice, but I don't think getting bit is acceptable."
2,"First things first ... THIS IS NOT A REGULAR COSTCO! It's a \""business center.\"" \n\nI feel that this is very important to mention, because I was very disappointed when I came during my weekend stay in Vegas. My bf and I wanted to hit up Costco for a case of water for our room and to get alcohol for a friend's bday gift.\n\nNO ALCOHOL SOLD HERE. Although, they do sell tobacco if you're into that kind of thing. \n\nNO FOOD COURT. But, why would you want a food court when you can eat at all the delicious food places and buffets on the strip?! \n\nAs I mentioned, this is a business Costco so you'll definitely find lots of snacks and drinks for vending machines. They even sell vending machines here! I did enjoy the fact that they had a huge array of drinks (juices, sodas, sparkling water, cider, etc.) It was quite impressive. \n\nAll in all, this Costco was pretty depressing. Very few workers ... workers that don't really know their stuff. I asked the guy checking memberships at the front if they had any coupon books and he said the guest/member service would have some. Waited in line and it turns out ... THEY DON'T EVEN ACCEPT THE COUPONS HERE. \n\nI'll definitely be shopping at the Costco back in L.A. before heading out to Vegas next time.."
2,"How frustrating!\n\nBest part of today's lunch was service - Anthony, originally from Astoria Queens NYC, has been here for 8 months, sounded exactly like he should sound with the NY accent, serving in an Italian restaurant!  He was helpful, attentive, interactive and one of the best servers I've had in this city.  He also brought a sample of the soup of the day to the table for tasting prior to ordering.  Very attentive service - bravo, Anthony!\n\nFood?  Very mixed reviews.  The tilapia special was thoroughly enjoyed by both diners at our table who ordered it.  Note to kitchen - the portion sizes on the two plates was noticably different (although the smaller portion did happen to go to the lighter eater so it wasn't a problem).  If the same dish is going to two people at the same table, they plates should look alike!\n\nI started with the minestrone soup (a menu staple) and while the flavor was good, it was tepid when served.  Made me sad.  My meatball sandwich was also a bit lukewarm and heavy on the salt.  It just didn't taste as fresh as I wanted.\n\nThis lunch was a birthday celebration so the lemon cookies with two dramatic candles was a very nice end to the meal.  And the cookies were great - not too sweet, enough lemon flavor without being bitter and enough to share around the table.\n\nNote on the door says that as of Feb 1, this will be a smoke free establishment."
2,"--lost its traditional feel through the remodel. where has the personality gone?\n--bulky dark wooden chairs need cushions, the whole place needs more fabric. great potential with lots of light and high ceilings. More bright mexican ceramics please. stark wall of crosses and exposed wood and wrought iron takes me straight to Nathan Lane's Birdcage apartment. LOL.\n--remodel great for small (150ppl) wedding parties with dance floor in the center of the room.\n\n--rice dry and unflavorful, no savor. beans again with no flavor.\n--table salsa is canned tomato sauce with pepper seeds and BASIL and the touch of sugar you get from Ragu! It's salsa, not marinara, people!\n--guacamole has cottage cheese as a thickener! ew!\n--chili colorado is just thick, no flavor.\n--service is slow and unhelpful, but prices are high high.\n--$9 for the cheese crisp is worth it. great crispiness and good cheese blend."
2,"Staying at the Sunset Station, which by the way was much better than I had expected it to be.\n\nWell Gus had some folks to meet for dinner and I was on my own. Figuring I would get something and take up to the room I walked around a couple of times and decided on Fatburger.\n\nThe young lady was quite personable with each who approached. She took my order of a burger with whatever it is they put on them and since the sign said the onion rings were the best you know one always believes signs I too had an order with a shake. And I wonder why I am a fat old man. \n\nIt took very few minutes to get my order and off to the room I go. Well the burger was a mushy mess of no distinct tastes, I truly hated it and the onion rings were bland at best. The shake... ok.\n\nIt was mentioned that we should stop at a fatburger the other day and this memory popped up and I shuddered, never again..."
2,"Not what I expected.  Food was good, but nothing special.  Portions seemed small.  I really did not expect the stand in line to place your order, go find a seat and wait for someone to bring your food, and then you never get spoken to again. Reminds me of McDonalds.  We got Thai Dynamite, which sounds spicy, but was bland, and sesame chicken, which was so so.\nWhile we were there, we saw someone spill a large amount of salt or sugar on the floor right by a door.  Saw a server going out the door about fall, and then 4 employees walk by it before it got cleaned up around 5-10 minutes later.  Lawsuit waiting to happen.\nDon't think we'll go back :("
2,"I came to check this place out because it had four stars on yelp and my boyfriend and I were in the mood for Mexican food. I ordered the green chili plate and my boyfriend got the carne asada burrito and we shared the menudo. I was expecting the food taste more authentic but when we got our food, it was bland and not very tasteful. We felt like we could have just gone to Filerberto and got better food. The only thing good about this place was our food came out fast and the person who took our order was nice. Other then that, I will not be coming back to eat here. We left very unsatisfied!"
2,"\""Let me yelp this place really quick..\"" I said to my friend before we came in. What a mistake it was to give up that idea.\n\nAs you walk in, the place is clean and cosy. Service is fairly prompt, even though there was only one waiter working during lunch time.\n\nI had a fish burrito that arrived ~15 minutes after ordering. It consisted of undercooked rice, a pinch of vegetables, and fried breaded shoe sole for a fish. Honestly I once had a better fish burrito at Del-Taco across the street.\n\nMy friend had chicken sizzling fajita, which was rushed in sizzling and smelling pretty good. Unfortunately, it lacked flavor and had the same undercooked rice and 97 year-old salad for sides. The guac and sour cream were fresh, though.\n\nWorth noting is that the salsa was pretty good, full of flavor with just the right bite of hotness. So if you're looking for some chips/salsa and beer, go for it. Otherwise, don't do this to yourself."
2,"We had their special Tomahawk steak $98, Glazed Sea Bass $39, sides with asparagus $14, and hand cut fries $12. We don't eat our food bland, in fact slightly on the salty side, but all the food here was just a bit too salty. It will definitely spike your blood pressure. The best part of this experience was the ambiance. Definitely chic and their bathroom is really different."
2,"Love the clothes,hate the staff! I'm sorry but something goes wrong every single time I come here. Today, brought 5 items to the counter, came home with 4. And that was from the kiddy mgr who had to take over because the rest had never seen a check before. After his 10 minutes of flubbing and absolutely ignoring anything I asked him he finally rang it up. Grrrr I hate having to go back."
2,Prices are fair but 45 minutes to wash and vac my car? That's a little much. Undecided if I'll be a returning customer.
2,"Average food.  Great concept and enjoyed my first visit.  However, the only really good item is the Red Jade Chicken."
2,Very slow -- even without a lot of customers -- and very disorganized. You can't pay with the Starbucks app -- they have to take your phone and key in the number by hand!
2,"I came here with my parents before going to see Zumanity because it didn't have a wait time. I should have just waited the 30 minutes to be seated somewhere else.\n\nDRINKS:\nI ordered a glass of Sangiovese. I normally love Sangiovese, but I didn't even want to finish the glass.\nMy mom got a cocktail with limoncello, which wasn't too bad.\nOverall: B\n\nFOOD:\nI ordered soup and their salad special that day (cucumbers, \""fresh\"" tomatoes, onions, red vinaigrette, and feta). The salad was terrible. I thought it had marinated tomatoes at first, but then realized it had just been sitting pre-made in a fridge for awhile -- the tomatoes were that ice-cold. I ended up picking at it, but not eating it.\nMy mom got the rare veal ($30+), and she also ended up barely eating it because it was just way over-marinated. It still had a vinegary taste to it. I normally love all red meat, and even I didn't like it, so she wasn't just being picky.\nOverall: D\n\nSERVICE:\nOur server didn't come ask us how the meal was until we were pretty much done picking at it 30 minutes later. Admittedly, when she realized we didn't like the food, she did have one of her superiors come talk to us, who offered to get us something else. We didn't have time for something else, so they didn't charge us for the salad or the veal. \nOverall: C"
2,"Food was average, waitress was the worst.\n\nWe had 4 people in our party. 3 of us had failrly good meals my son however ordered the Philly ckeese steak which was a soggy mess. We thought about sending it back but the waitress never came back to ask how everthing came out. When the waitress did come back she just went through the motions of being a server she truly didnt care and should find a new line of work. My son ordered water, she forgot.. \n\nI will not be back on our next visit to Vegas..."
2,"Slow service and 15-20 for mediocre philly cheese steaks.  Sandwiches and fries do not have a lot of flavor.  Also the televisions are blaring loud, if you have sensitive hearing beware.  Seating is limited."
2,"Avenue Q was brilliant.  Keep in mind, however, that Avenue Q comes with a traveling cast.\n\nThe Gammage Auditorium itself?  Not impressed.\n\nFrom the outside, yes, it looks really cool. Some of the lights are out, but over all, it looks really cool from the outside.\n\nInside? It's a bit outdated. The bathrooms are gross, and half of the floors are completely handicap inaccessible. Of course, they don't tell you this when you get your tickets.  We showed up, and asked where the elevator was. Rudely, we were told there wasn't one, and if I had wanted accessible seats, I should have bought full priced orchestra ones.  I walk slowly and with a cane, and while I can handle a few stairs when I must, the 2.5 flights of stairs nearly killed me on the way up, and then I didn't go to the restrooms when I wanted too at intermission, because there was no way in hell I would have walked back up there.  I almost burst into tears as it was.\n\nI then had to rinse and repeat to get down at the end.  Again, multiple flights of stairs, people pushing me, and rude ushers chiding me for not buying outrageously priced orchestra tickets which were accessible.  Way to be classist AND ableist at the same time.\n\nFunny, isn't it, that such a tongue in cheek commentary on discrimination should be held at a place that both architecturally AND verbally discriminates?"
2,Waited an hour and was disappointed by the food.. I had banana pancakes and a breakfast skillet.  The pancakes were chewy.  The skillet had no flavor.
2,"Mid Town Pub has been a frequent haunt but am going to have to find a new spot. A few weeks ago I ordered  the chicken cordon bleu sandwich. I was served another menu item that was chicken served with mounds of jalape\u00f1os. When I pointed out the error, they quickly replaced it... With the same sandwich sans jalape\u00f1os and added ham. Chicken was still steeped in jalape\u00f1o flavor. I didn't eat it but was charged for it.\n\n Wanted to give the kitchen another chance on a recent visit and was served yet another in edible sandwich. It was so salty and pepper ladened that the first bite was my last.\n\nThis kitchen needs some guidance! Adios mtp!"
2,"My wife and I stayed here for a few days while in town on business.We had a suite overlooking the central courtyard at the back.Turns out that's where the delivery trucks do their deliveries and for 3 days in a row at some unGodly hour 2 tour buses were loading up Japanese tourists.My God what a racket !There is nothing in the suites as far as utensils....not a spoon,not even a bloody bottle opener.And then there was the clincher...must be why the place was pretty full.From 5.30pm to 7.30pm every day its happy hour in the large breakfast room with free cocktails and light beer.Every man and his dog was there...mostly quite elderly people getting medicated for the evening.It was pretty funny really.My wife and I were down there shooting some pool and the place was packed with oldies walking around with little plastic cups of cocktails or light beer.It's like a nursing home on steroids."
2,"I agree with another reviewer that it is a well intentioned concept.  Decor and atmosphere was, clean, comfortable and inviting.  Service wasn't great, but was OK.  If the food was better I would plan a return trip, but it was unfortunately not good.\n\nWe are gluten free family so we were excited to hear that they had many GF options for us.  Ordered the Vegetarian Antipasto, Flat bread Trio, Chicken Caesar Salad, and 2 pizzas.  All GF versions.  It was disappointing.  GF crust and flat bread was hard and tasteless.  My GF homemade pizza crust and packaged versions I get from Whole Foods were 100 times better.  Sauce on the pizza was too sweet.  The salad was drowning in dressing, Antipasto was also tasteless,  Flat bread was not good and the dips were mediocre.  \n\nSo bummed that it wasn't better.  Hoping to check back in on Yelp and see and improvement and maybe we'll give it another shot.  Would really like to see more \""healthy\"" and organic restaurants in Henderson."
2,i'm a vegetarian and was really looking forward to this highly recommended place. i'm immediately turned off that they serve actual real meat in a vegan restaurant. I will say that my unsweetened ice tea mixed with mango lemonade (mixed by myself) was delicious. the side salad with my pannini was excellent!!! pannini was DISGUSTING i could have made a to-furky pannini at home thank you. the highly recommended red velvet was very good for being 150 calories and 5 grams of fat. very disappointed :( service was SO SLOW and it was only us and two other tables....slow food +bad service = me no going again :( sadly! i was really excited
2,"The waitress we had here was horrible.  The bus boy gave us more attention than she did.  I say give him her job!  The food was OK nothing spectacular, a little over priced, but you are paying for the ambiance I guess."
2,"The food was perfect.\nThe ambiance was perfect.\nThe service was really REALLY bad.\n\nWe got to the restaurant, the hostess girl just seemed not to care. I think that's really the best way to put it, she just didn't care, like she's worked there for too long and she just doesn't care. When we got there she told us that the table was being setup, and the silverware must have been flown in from China while we waited, because we waited for 30min for that setup.\n\nOut server was even worse. After we got seated it took 20min for him to come by and give us the menus, then another 20min until he stopped by again to take out drink orders and we ordered food as well getting the sense of their pace. Then another 20min for HALF our party to get their drink orders.\n\nWe had to chase the waiter down for round x2 drinks that were promised and of course came only after another 20min of waiting.\n\nBeginning of the night the waiter told us that Vintner is Strip quality food off the Strip. Well on the Strip, Strip quality food also tends to come with Strip quality service.\n\nWhat a shame really. The food was good and the ambience was fantastic. But the wait stuff was so bad it's stupid.\n\nI would not recommend this restaurant."
2,"Meh.\nI had first heard about Buffalo Exchange when returning from Santa Barbara the week before and dissapointed I missed out.\nSeeing as their is one in Vegas, hopes back up for scoring designer goods on the cheap.\nWalking in, all hope demolished. \nThis is exactly the same thing as Plato's Closet which I detest.\nNothing but clothes that no one would want, service non caring. \nTons of people waiting to be told that either all their clothes are no good and they waited a few hours for nothing, or that they will offer you $3 for a cashmere sweater if you are lucky.\nI glanced around, saw nothing good whatsoever and know know not to bother coming to any of their locations."
2,"couple friends and i were walking down the strip and went by.  we mainly noticed it because the place is incredibly loud, and the music is pretty good.  we weren't going to stop, but a friend was buying some beers at their bar since the beers are usually 2 for the price of 1.  as we were waiting for him one of the guys outside was trying to get us to go in at $15 each, to which we said no thanks and started walking away as our friend was still getting his drinks.  we walked probably another 5 feet before he ran up to us and said he would do $10 each, to which we still told him no thanks and then we got our friend and went to left.  to which the guy came to us again and said $5 each to which we still just walked off.  so finally he let us in for free after about 3 minutes of trying to get us to pay.  we went in, probably stayed for 30 minutes, maybe and hour.  it was loud, music was good, drinks were decent priced, so i was semi content there, but the girls there were very meh, even with a buzz on, and a lot of the guys there seemed like frat guys who were too douchy and got kicked out of their frat.  so we left, i don't think i would go back at all"
2,3 measly chicken fingers on a pile of soggy fries. How do you mess up chicken fingers?! 9 bucks...no thank you.
2,I had an inspection and oil change. There was only one guy working alone and he communicated like a cave man. I will not be back.
2,There is absolutely no reason to dine here for Mexican food....it is non descript...no pride in preparation or presentation.  It is just bland food.  Service is very good but that does not make up for bad food....from the chips to the finale'....bad...and very noisy with screaming and misbehaving children.\n\nTry Lindo Michoac\u00e1n on Desert Inn...is was good but hope we can even find one that is better...it is an easy 3 star
2,"I waited for an awesome meal at a place I visited over a decade ago.  I remember the prime rib, crab and seafood from before but I was disappointed in the selection this time. It had more Chinese, Mexican and fruits than I remember.  I saw no real potatoe dishes other than mashed.  Sushi wasn't good.  However the prime rib as great, crab was abundant and calamari excellent.  Pre-made salads were not good.  My husband is a meat and potatoes and he barely found stuff to eat.  I would like to see a price that matches the lack of selection.  I would like to see more sushi that tastes good and more hot crab than cold crab."
2,"I loveddddd the old salty senorita they had great burritos, fundado cheese dip and steak salad and of course margarita and great happy hour. I never thou a new location will change this place . I order my appetizer and a margarita and they didn't have frozen machine yet OK I can understand its a new location... we placed our orders and I want it to try something different I order chicken burrito and a chicken fajita order. First we never got the appetizer and the main course was not good my rice was hard and looks and taste old, the beans were hard the chicken was ok . I ask for the hot sauces on the side and they put inside. At the end we order another round of drinks cause we need a drink after eating that and we never got our drinks. Service was OK I guess. All im saying I know they are new and all... But please bring my old salty senorita back !!!!! you guys can do it."
2,"Nice staff but not worth the money. Pastrami sandwich was a joke. As a whole , the restaurant has potential but I don't think I'll go back any time soon"
2,"Their chips and fries are good.  We could've had more to choose from if the menus were all in the same spot.  One is by the door, the other is behind the counter.  Where one would figure a menu should be.  It was our first time there so we ordered.  Then saw a hotdog,...asked the girl at the counter where it was on the menu, and she said it was behind us.  Hmmm... of course the menu would be behind us.\n\nAlso, when we were there, there was no ice.  I asked the girl if there it just needed to be refilled, but she said just to wait until it makes more ice.  What the heck???\n\nCashiers could be a little friendlier."
2,"Not for everyone. Although I think kids would have a decent time here, for 2 adults looking for something to do, Rawhide doesn't have much to offer. We paid $5 for parking and spent about 30 minutes walking through the \""town\"" and took a few pictures. But we really could have gone without. I wouldn't recommend putting this on your to do list for the area but if you're really into the western theme, I suppose you'll find town interesting."
2,"Great yogurt place and close by!!! Also .35 per ounce great price!!!\nBut we went there yesterday  7:25p, dark and closed!?! I called number on door and VM said open Sat til 9.....I left a msg: Where are y'all!?!?! Don't understand how a business thinks they can run with this kind of behavior!!"
2,Do not come here!!! We waited 45 mins to get a seat. No one is clearing tables. The food is marginal at bedt. I got a beef short rib. The meat is so tough and grisly that my knife cannot cut through. \nSTAY WAY FROM HERE.\n\nOk the buffet had some decent food. But the wait for a clean table made this a no return.
2,"Poor service by the wait staff is my biggest complaint. We were there at 5:00 (and it wasn't busy yet), and it took probably 15 minutes to place our order. \n\nFinally, $16.95 for a fish fry. Yowzers!"
2,"My wife and I visited this place to grab sandwiches. We were thinking of Quizno's, but saw this place and decided to give it a try.\n\nAfter I ordered my food; Chicken Gyro, Chicken Kabob and Baba Ghanouj to go, my mind drifted off to \""Kitchen Nightmares\"". I don't know why, but that's what I was thinking. Once our order was ready, we got it and drove home.\n\nThe Chicken Gyro had large slices of chicken not bad, but it should have been thinner. Since our \""to go\"" order was in pita bread, it was half soaked with the juices from the tomato and onions. My  kabob was a disappointment, it was also strips of thick dry chicken. I thought it was the GYRO and expected chunks of chicken. It was difficult to eat, so I ended up eating just the chicken.\n\nNow, the Baba Ghanouj was disgusting. The mixture was \""slop\"" immersed in olive oil. One bite was all  we could stand. The best I ever had was at \""Sabuddy\"" Israeli restaurant which closed because the owner returned to New York.\n\nAs for the sandwiches,  the pita bread was excellent and the next time I will have it there and NOT \""To Go\""."
2,"I went here due to the price and word of mouth. It is walk-in only, NO APPOINTMENTS! I had to wait 90 minutes. I was not offered a choice of male or female, good thing since I don't have a preference. I told him to focus on my neck, between shoulder blades, and mostly my sciatica. He asked me how long to work on each section, what a sciatica was, and what trigger points to work on for the sciatica. He didn't use time management skills, didn't know terminology or anatomy, and fussed with the sheets and draping a lot. It took 5 tries each time he moved the sheet to get it right. After he finished, he didn't get me any water or recommend anything like stretching or aromatherapy or epsom salt baths. I would go here with caution...."
2,"I was excited to try this place since I heard so much rave reviews during my visit in NY.  I was disappointed.....!!\n\nWe went on a Tuesday @ 1:00pm and we had a flight to catch at 3:30.  There was no line and the service was quick.  We ordered chicken wings, ABC burger, and strawberry sundae.  THe portions were huge, but everything tasted very mediocre... For the quality of the food, I think it is overpriced!\n\nI think out of everything... I only enjoyed the sweet potato fries.... :("
2,Bad experience with in room dining ~ \n\nHad called previously to ask for prices and how much we get if we ordered wings. In the beginning they said we get 6 wings/$16 during the day and 12/$16 after 10 pm. We has ordered around 11pm last night and when the food came we only got 6. I had called the room service again and she told me that we were suppose to get 12. Then she put me on hold to check what had happened. \n\nShe then goes to tell me oh we changed our menu sorry. She didnt even know the menu changed along with the other guy worker we had talked to before. I know you they are still in transition but it shouldn't be an excuse for indecent service.\n\nWe had bought 2 orders which was 12 wings for 41$ we would've never bought if the hotel didn't trick us. We would have  ordered something else. The order didn't even get us full one bit. \n\nWe order in room dining quite often so this was a very bad experience. \n\n\nOverall experience at the Delano is ok though. Less crowded which I like and the hotel is very nice. Next to the elevators they put up a new quote every day on a mirror which is my favorite part.
2,"This place is the perfect example of a tourist trap.  Nice location not far of the main drag of Old Scottsdale, beautiful building and layout.  The margaritas are good, but probably $2-$3 more expensive than they ought to be for every one of the many styles.  I thought paying $5 for chips and salsa was a rip-off, but then when the chips tasted stale, I was even less happy.  C'mon, if you have tortilla and factory in your name, you ought to have fresh chips.  I thought the tortillas themselves were okay, not great, but okay.  The carne fuego, or whatever I had the waitress recommended, was not good.  Small chunks of fire roasted steak completely ruined by a gloppy sweet/hot sauce. The veggies that went with it were just okay and the sweet potato-stuffed chile was weird.  It could've been great, but it was nowhere near good.  Unless your Aunt Hattie who has never had Mexican food is in town from Ohio, i'd skip this place altogether."
2,Apparently when you pay $185 to play the golf course it's too difficult to blow the grass clippings off the fairways. I don't mean to sound like an elitist prick I'm far from it. But when you've been living in Scottsdale for close to a decade and play a course the first time with that price tag on it you expect close to perfection. Greens were slow and course was overall in mediocre shape. I understand everyone is going thru or just ending their overseed process but to charge what they do in the condition it's in is a joke. For the price I would much rather play We-ko-pa or troon north if I'm spending the money.
2,"**Updated Review-\nBased on my last experience - the service here is so-so at best.  The \""kids\"" behind the counter are unattentive.  I had to literally shout to get them to notice that they had a guest in the lobby.  If it weren't for the fact that this location is at the bottom of the hill of Las Sendas - I probably would not return and instead opt for a different location.\n\nStore Manager/Owner - This is YOUR opportunity to make this right.  I am pretty generous/fair on my reviews and this location is by-far the weakest of all in the Mesa Valley.\n\n**********\n\nIt's Rosatis.  True nothing will ever taste as good as Pizza (incl. Rosatis) that you actually get IN Chicago because of the water quality west of the Mississippi is fair at best, this Rosatis does a really good job.\n\nThe kid that took our order was pretty cool-chill.  Brought it out to us in ~15 minutes - piping hot!  The sausage at Rosatis is awesome.\n\nWe visit this location every time we come to visit Dad/Mom since they live in the adjacent neighborhood.\n\nTip - order extra cheese - it is so worth it...the grease dripping all over - esp. from the pepperoni."
2,"THE GOOD: Ridiculously cheap rooms, speaking $35 a night. FAT TUESDAYS cheap giant everclear drinks....I may not remember much after that.  The beds were super comfy and it was clean.  Hairdresser Elvis.  \n\nTHE BAD: No one included the $5 a night \""resort\"" charge in the quoted price.  Only 2 staff members were polite to us.  One actually laughed at our friend over the phone, when she asked for more towels.  Far from the strip, but close to downtown Vegas, which we liked better. \n\nTHE HIDEOUSLY UGLY:  The topless pool at the top of the hotel.  No bar and it was full of what looked like midwestern pro-wrestler guys.  And large...LARGE women wearing no tops and thong bikinis.  I guess if you're comfortable with your body, go for it?\n\nNot bad, but I'd prefer to stay somewhere more expensive, get a nicer hotel/staff, and save $$ on the cab fare.\n\nP.S.  Why do people take their children to Vegas?????"
2,"I am really getting tired of restaurants that specialize in a specific region of the world, yet do such a poor job a reflecting the culinary offerings of that region.\n\nI must confess, I am not an expert on Greek cuisine, but I feel I have had better Greek than this. \n\nI can tell the difference between fresh ingredients and something that has sat in the walk-in cooler for a couple of weeks. \n\nThis is Las Vegas, a restaurant can not afford to get lazy about quality or it will end up being another victim of the recession."
2,"Ok this is the way to get to Vegas, and this is the tourist mecca.  It was glitzy years ago but is now a bit divey and not so easy to get around.  I am not sure how else you would get to Vegas unless you want to brave the drive but the airport will not be the highlight of your trip."
2,"Went in today to check out the home visit prices and see what all they had to offer. \n\nWalking into the place you got hit by a wall of odor.  I know having lots of dogs in a small space won't make any room smell like roses, however I would like to think that they clean the place every once in a while.\n\nI then asked about a service listed on the flyer and the website and was told that they don't do that.  Then why list it???  I also didn't like how from the front office you couldn't see into where they kept the dogs, though I could hear them all going crazy.\n\nOn my way out I realized that you could see in through the side from broken blinds.  There were a ton of dogs in a small space with no one in sight.  Also, side note from looking at the pictures on yelp...Yes, they have couches instead of cages but those couches look dangerous since they are so broken. I wouldn't wan my dog sitting on or running near that.\n\nSince I haven't actually used the service I won't give it only one star, but from what I've seen I will not be back or calling for home service thats for sure.  It would have been perfect too, since I live only a mile away."
2,"Well, this place is good.  The food is kind of that outdated tropical fare and lacks any sort of innovation.  The atmosphere has that TGI fridays chain feeling to it, but instead of shit on the walls its upscale tropical.\n\nI wouldnt really go back unless i was invited by someone else."
2,"Knocking you guys down a star. The place has become a rather hit & miss as of my latest visit. Broth used to be richer, portion more generous, service has gotten a bit more prompt not enough to warrant the 3star.\n\nTime for a new backup pho place?"
2,This has to be the worst cupcake I've ever tasted. I've had better cupcakes from the grocery store. every thing is over priced (even for Vegas). But I will say that the shakes are good.
2,"Finally got to Greenberg's for their Pastrami Sandwich.  As I watched the little lady do the slicing, I was thinking, man, she is piling it on. My mouth was watering with anticipation. When she placed it on the counter, that pastrami was bulging all outside that rye bread like a fat lady in tight spandex.  Man I was ready! Then I bit into it.  Where was that  Pastrami flavor? I salted. I mustard it up, to no avail. Where was that peppery taste?There was also a fatty taste that lingered all up in my mouth. I checked the meat and there was the normal amount of fat to it. I couldn't figured it out. What happened to all the hype about this deli? Maybe it was a just a funky slab that day. I will give it another try, because you can't beat that meat pile up  for Ten Bucks."
2,I found the food to be a little on the greasy side. For whatever reason the skin of my chicken was coming off and it just was odd. For the price you could do better. Actually I've been to plenty of cheaper place with much better AUTHENTIC prepared Asian-Fusion.
2,"Meh, I've experienced better, pretty much covers it.\n\nThe young man who brought water and tea didn't know what tea he was serving us. No straws were brought- big peeve of mine. I dislike drinking from cups at restaurants.\n\nThe egg rolls tasted of perfume. Chicken chow mien was ok, $5.95 for M-F lunch special. They never asked if we wanted desert."
2,"There were no fewer than 15 people working here the day that I went with very few people in all of Tivoli Village. I wasn't greeted by the two women who were enjoying their conversation upon my entrance, and then the same two women greeted the people behind me warmly. Then some other women who worked there were watching me like a hawk as if I had sticky fingers and was pilfering everything that I touched. So I was either totally invisible to the staff or I was a 14 year old with a couple of friends seeing how much I could throw in my bag and up my sleeves.\n\nBasically they sell H&M or Forever 21 accessories for higher prices. I'm not confident that paying more for their products would make my skin green less quickly. It's still a cheaply produced product. You could find some good stuff on clearance or as-is here, but I wouldn't ever buy anything full price here because it's definitely not quality goods."
2,"I wish I had read the Yelp reviews before booking. The bathroom is really small, which wouldn't be a problem if the door opened towards the outside... The power plugs were loose in the bathroom and non-existent throughout the rest of the room.\n\nWe were there for two nights, and was never serviced. We traveled with our two dogs so i made sure to call the front desk to let them know when we would be out with the dogs so they could come and clean the room... I did that twice the same day, and was clearly unsuccessful.\n\nI sent clothes to dry cleaning, and they were supposed to be ready by 9am the next morning... 11am nothing and we were already 2 hours behind schedule to hit the road. It took another 45 mins to get them and check-out. When I called to inquire about it, the lady at the front desk was as unpleasant as one can be. \n\nI won't go back to this hotel."
2,Get the chicken teriyaki bowl and skip everything else. I just got the tempura and teriyaki combo for lunch. The tempura was a carrot and a zucchini i think. Then some long thing with a shrimp tail but I don't think shrimp are pencil size. There was two CA rolls that were marginal but they do not give you ginger or wasabi. Wtf?\n$10.82 for lunch just not worth it. \nThey need more lunch specials.
2,"We had a family function here and I was sadly disappointed. I felt that the entrees were of average quality , but the service was terrible. We had made a reservation days in advance yet still the staff seemed unprepared for our service. We sat for ages until we finally had to ask for them to take our orders. I believe I asked for wine, then water 3 times as did other members of our party until my husband just started walking up to the bar and basically serving our party drinks."
2,"On the southwest corner of Sandy Porter and Tryon, you'll find this Food Lion in the strip mall. I've not shopped at many FL's, so I can't tell you if this is bigger or smaller than average. What I can tell you is that the prices here seem higher than Harris-Teeter, Bi-Lo, Wal-Mart and Super Target. While they have everything you need for a full grocery shop, including frozen, dairy, produce, beer, wine and meats, it's not going to be cheap.\n\nIf you do decide to shop with the Lion on a regular basis, pick up one of their MVP shopper loyalty cards - this will save you a good bit."
2,"The food tasted good, but everything else about dinner tonight was awful. \n\nThe waitress forgot some of our food and didn't bring my order to me the way I asked. After that, she brought us the check and refilled our drinks, but then we never saw her again. After a while I was thirsty enough that I literally got up, went behind the counter and refilled our drinks myself. No one noticed. After about an hour a new waitress came by and offered refills -- leaving our two empty dirty cups on the table but finally removing the dirty dishes. Over the course of more than two hours we were never asked if we wanted to order anything else. To top it off, two of the stalls in the women's restroom were completely out of toilet paper."
2,"I came here a couple of times while staying at the Tropicana this week. Overall, it's everything you would expect from an in-resort snack bar, but I still found it to be a bit overpriced. A couple of small scoops of gelato will run you $7, and the gelato is only okay. You can actually get more for less over at the Bellagio.\n\nThe self-serve frozen yogurt is a better deal, at $0.49 an ounce, and there are some interesting flavors to try (coconut to peanut butter to cake batter). I guess I never really understood the fro-yo craze. Everytime I eat  it, I just wish I was eating ice cream instead."
2,"I hate this airport.  I thought I loathed O'Hare.  I thought I truly hated the 'Nati (CVG) airport.  I REALLY thought I hated ATL's airport.  McCarran set a whole new low for me.  All of the queues you have to stand in are at least 150 people deep all the time, whether it's the security queue or the taxi one.  The TSA people here are so not the brightest stars in the sky.  And for Chrissake...all the slot machines.  Airports are already crazybusy and noisy as it is.  I don't need ringing slot machines to contribute to the migraine that is McCarran."
2,"So all this hype about Tao Beach... Got there, it was nothing like I imagined. It looked liked kiddie pools compared to the other places. \n\nIt was free cover for girls, and open bar (well drinks) until a certain time, so I can't complain. But for the guys that do have to pay cover, I think you would find it more worth it to pay cover to the other pools like Wet Republic and such.  Less cramped, and probably nicer pools too."
2,"Well, it's food!! That's about all I can say for The Smithfield Cafe.  \nI had the \""daily special\"" which is pretty much the universal way of condensing \""two eggs, bacon or sausage, and toast\"" into two words. Sausage was room temperature, eggs were decent, and the greasy home fries contained the flavor of the dozen meals that were cooked before mine this morning (not i'n a good way). Coffee was plentiful, but not flavorful. \nThe waitresses were grizzled and archetypal for their profession.  \nTo surmise; meh..."
2,"Here's the skinny:\n\nIt's pretty over priced for an Americanized Chinese place. Average dish was roughly $15-$20. \n\nThey have Vietnamese coffee w/boba, and it comes in a large = awesome, and SUPER strong too! They also have soy milk w/boba and fruit (watermelon, etc)..  prices are between $5-$7.\n\nTheir dishes come down to a few options:\n- beef\n- pork\n- soup\n- rice\n- noodles \n\n.. but I didn't come across any signature dishes you typically would at a true Chinese restaurant (ie. Pan fried noodles, combination plates like chow fun, etc).\n\nTheir white and orange hand blown glasses are really pretty, and the decor is cool too. Service was OK, and the food is cooked fresh. I could tell the noodles in our chow fun were hand made, I'd say those were my favorite of everything we had.  Oh!  the salt and pepper shrimp are yummy too!\n\nServings are 'A la carte (aka family style)' BUT the portions are smaller than a traditional Chinese place."
2,"I stopped coming here when I realized I could afford to pay more than $99/night for a room in Vegas.\n\nYou're stuck at the end of the Strip, the casino is meh, the rooms are straight out of 1997, and the whole place smells vaguely of that wet towel at the bottom of your hamper that you forgot about for two weeks.\n\n2 stars based on price and the fact that a girl once approached my group and tried to pick all of us up before stumbling away drunk....with a man's shoe print clearly visible on her left calf."
2,"Reading some of the other reviews, I feel like I must have eaten at a different restaurant. I order two spicy tuna rolls with brown rice. Both had zero flavor and could have been molded from Elmer's paste instead of fish. \n\nMaybe I ordered the wrong thing. Seems like a good concept."
2,"For the price, this is a great option. \n\nClean, comfortable, modern, awesome location and fantastic guest services. Free wifi, decent gym. \n\nI really love the outdoor fire pit & the menu at the restaurant has an outstanding selection. \n\n**Warning!! A huge disappointment!! While traveling for business, where my sleep is imperative, I was quickly disturbed with the obnoxious volume and thumps coming from the adjacent night clubs. This was on a was even on a Tuesday night!! I can only imagine a weekend noise level! So intrusive. So upsetting. Can't stay here again because of this ;("
2,"Okay, I'm from San Diego. I love everything Mexican and Fish Tacos are a must. Unfortunately, I've found this place to be more trendy than good. When I received my fish tacos they looked like what I expected except for one thing. If the fish was breaded at the restaurant then why bother breading fish pieces. The fish itself was fine but I received pieces. Typically, if you cut the fish correctly you won't have pieces. The batter was okay but I've fish sticks for Gorton's that were better. The batter had absolutely no flavor. It just seemed that someone took the time to decorate but I felt that I was served leftovers. I'm going to look somewhere else for fish tacos in the future.\n\nIf you ever in San Diego then try Rubio's, which is a fast food fish taco place and they seem to know what to serve the customer and what not to serve the customer. Cabo's didn't feel that way. At I could have received the same dinner for half the price but with a lot more flavor."
2,"The food is just fine; i had bibimbap. But the service is horrible! horrible! I was shock by how terrible their service was! and also they impose 18% of gratuity on the bill, which doesn't make sense at all. The environment just makes me not want to go again :("
2,I went on 28th of December 2014. Everything is Okay except the STEAK. It was not the good steak I expected. I love steak and been to many steakhouses but this place is clearly overpriced. I liked oysters though.
2,"Im rewriting my review on this place for 2 reasons. First, because the first time I came here was back in 2009. Second, when I came here the most recent time, it was not like my first. Im gonna make this short and simple for you non readers. The burger was tasteless. I understand the reason for the unlimited amount of toppings you can add to your burger. But even A-1 steaksauce, chipotle sauce and banana peppers cant hide the taste of dry ground beef. Come on Cheeburger, even Chili's has their own flavor!!! I was very disappointed when I came back here, but im over it now since I wont be back again."
2,"In the area this afternoon on biz.  Surprisingly, I've never been to this place.\n\nHit the buffet - with soda it cost $8.50 give or take a few dimes.\n\nIt reminded me a little bit like Shakey's bunch 'o lunch but not quite to their  \"" high\"" standards.  Also reminded me a little of the old chuck e cheese days with my daughter but this place is a cut above chucky's \n\nsalad bar - basic stuff - liked a few slices of peperoni on my salad !\n\npasta - spaghetti and elbow macaroni with two sauce options - can you say....ragu  ( actually a smidge better ) \n\nchicken and potato wedges - both coated the same ...hmmmm...tasted the same, too.\n\npizza - well....first round, THERE WAS NO PIZZA \n\n2nd round - pizza - had a slice of sausage and pepperoni - nothing special here - my guess is the pre-cooked, SYSCO sausage; the pepperoni had no flavor but alot of grease ! \n\nIf i had a few young kids, i can see coming back for post-sporting events, otherwise, sorry, no return planned."
2,"I just arrived in Madison and was pooped from a long day + travel. I was really hungry and excited for a low key, hot meal. I had a bunch of work to catch up on so searched for a vegetarian friendly place that would also deliver. I was excited to find veggie Nepalese food that was close to the hotel. Every dish, even things that seemed like sides seemed pretty expensive so I assumed the portions would be enormous. I don't want enormous portions but I also didn't want teeny portions with a high price tag. I ordered a soup and it was basically a cup of soup for over $10. I didn't order anything else sadly and am left feeling pretty hungry. Wahh. Haha. \n\nShould have read more of the reviews!!!"
2,"Updated: Echo Canyon renovation. Echo Canyon used to be my favorite trail but after this new renovation it sucks.\n\nParking is worse than before if that's even possible. I went on a typical Thursday afternoon and the park rangers still had to turn people away. \n\nAs soon as you turn into the lot there is a barricade with a park ranger letting people in one at a time as soon as there is a spot available. This would be a good idea but the barricade is so close to the road that only about 5 cars can wait for a spot and not be blocking the main road.  This is very poor planning in my opinion.\n\nAs for the trail itself: they took out the stairs in the beginning and made it very steep with compressed gravel. This is actually harder than the stairs and I could definitely see people slipping off more easily.\n\nI would not bring anyone that is out of shape to this trail. Also our furry friends are no longer welcome (no dogs allowed).\n\nOnce you get past the parking and the \""improvements\"" to the  beginning of the trail, it is the old Echo Canyon that we all used to know and love."
2,"Good chinese takeout here, seems to be hard to find.  This is the Hoho Cherry House.  The Hoho China Bistro is no more, but I heard it moved here.\n\nThe lunch specials are a good value, but the food here is right about average.  General Tso's is OK.  This is more along the lines of a Panda Express, but mom and pop owned.  For that, I expected more.  Nothing to rave about, but not terrible either."
2,"People don't often review chains unless they've had a particularly great or bad experience. I'm sorry to report that this is one of the bad ones. I was hoping to try the pumpkin spice latte today, but whatever I got did not have pumpkin flavor in it. My friend, who has tried that flavor, concurred after taking a sip. I didn't find much wrong with what I did get, but the glaring omission of pumpkin is a huge minus considering that it's a seasonal special. Sorry, guys."
2,"Terribly slow drive thru and they always make my drinks wrong! Great location and a few nice baristas, but they don't make up for a poorly made $5 latte. I'd rather go out of my way to Sbucks on Trop and Fort Apache."
2,"Food was excellent, it is summer and the bar had about 6 customers, 2 of them regulars and drunks. The lady talked at full volume to everyone in the building.\nI got the impression these people go there ever night and feel the world is better because of it. I for one will not be returning until the birds come back and there is enuf ambient noise to drown these people out. Not sure what V's should do differently other than stop serving drunks."
2,"I hate writing this update because I used to really love Apple Spice, but the last three times we have ordered lunch there have been multiple mistakes. For a place that does catering, getting 10 lunches right doesn't really seem like too much to ask.\n\nToday, two people ordered bread bowls. They received a very small container of soup with a slice of bread. That is not really a bread bowl.\n\nMe and one of my vegan co-workers ordered the southwestern salad, sans cheese. It came with chicken, and on the menu it states you have to pay an additional $1 for chicken, so it would definitely be something someone needed to ask for.\n\nOne of the lunches came as a sandwich instead of a wrap, and Heather W. was missing her cookie and her juice with her meal.\n\nApple Spice was nice enough to replace the mistaken items (brought corrected salads, brought the actual bread bowls - although, not with new soup, brought the wrap) and bring us an extra plate of cookies, but like I said, this is the third time this type of mistake has happened. \n\nIt's pretty expensive, the Southwestern is not even very good, and once the order comes back wrong it delays my eating for an hour + and it is just frustrating.\n\nI'm sorry Apple Spice... you guys are great but you need to get it together."
2,"I was so excited when I found out Yalla was opening near my house- we were in need of a good Med Cuisine place there, and also, it is owned by Khoury's- my FAVORITE place to eat.  \nWe ordered a few things, the roasted chicken sandwich, Fatoush salad with Chicken, and the beef kabobs. \nThe rice was out of this world! It has a little crispy thin noodles and a light oil.  The hummus was great and the Fatoush was so tasty.  My husband had no complaints about the sandwich..but we did have a couple downsides.  \nThe order was billed incorrectly.  And the cashier was very apologetic, but ended up billing me more, so that he didn't have to call his manager to fix it.  I felt that he should have just billed me the price he told me over the phone and comped his mistake.  Also, their Pita bread was not as good as i had hoped, tasted kind of old.  \nI'll be back though.\n\nUPDATE: \nI did come back, only to wait in line behind another customer for 10 minutes (at a counter btw) without so much as a \""hello\"", or \""sorry\"" from the cashier. The wait was so long becuase this woman could not get her order together and we were ignored so we just left. AWFUL SERVICE. Cashier should have acknowledged us, or offered to start our order while the customer ran out to her car, but no. Nothing. AWFUL! \nWe went to Osaka across the street."
2,"I went with a Chinese friend who ordered in Chinese.  When one of the dishes arrived and she didn't like the look of it she then shouted a lot at the waiter (in Chinese).  After that the food was exceptional.  Easily the best Chinese food I've had in Central Illinois.  (I admit, that's a low standard.)\n\nHowever, I've never been able to recreate this experience.  And how I've tried!  I ended up asking my Chinese friend to write me a note in Chinese ordering these same dishes from the Chinese menu.  I show the crumpled and worn note to the waiter when I go by myself.  But the food is never as good.  I expect it was the shouting.  Now that my friend has moved away, I expect it will never be that good again.\n\nWithout my friend to help us, this is a mediocre place."
2,Pros:\n* Friendly and fast delivery or requested items\n* Very comfy beds\n* Nice soaking tub( but can only fit one1) \n\nCons: \n*None of the staff at check in were smiling or looking remotely like they wanted to see you or even be working there.\n* No outlets by bed so had to get extension cords for my husbands CPAP\n*Told had freezer but they only had a fridge sucked for breastmilk saving (sorry if that grosses folks out)\n* No vending machines to buy a coke anywhere but their overpriced in room fridges\n* Overcomplicated room switches and lighting systems.\n* Bathroom sinks designed to get everything wet! \n\nThe rooms remind me of The Hotel but I prefer The Hotel to Aria
2,"I had been to one other Brazilian steakhouse a few years ago in Dallas and it was freakin amazing. However, Braza's wasn't great. It wasn't bad, but the food didn't seem freshly cooked; more like it had been under a warmer too long. Most of the meats were ok. The flank steak was great, chicken was good, sirloin was ok but sort of bland, the pork was good, lamb ok, alligator (yes, alligator) was not bad (my first time trying). \nThe atmosphere was the most disappointing element of the whole experience, as the picture on their website made it look like a 4 or 5 star fancy restaurant, with a nice picture of a glass of wine -- however when we arrived, it looked similar to the interior of a Golden Corral (not exaggerating) - definitely not a place that is likely to impress your wife/girlfriend. Also, be prepared, the restaurant is actually split in half: one side is Indian and the other is Braza's; so, it had the thick smell of an Indian restaurant in the air- which kind of worked against our Brazilian appetites. \nI have to say the service was pretty good. The wait-staff was friendly and seemed to want us to have a nice time.\nThe pricing was about $40-45 a person, which I thought was a bit high for this particular establishment-- and I walked away feeling like if I was going to spend that kind of money, I could've done better elsewhere."
2,"Staff manager isn't that friendly or helpful, and they never have what I want in stock. It is closer to my house than PetsMart, but after three unsuccessful trips I will just head to the competitor spot to get what I need."
2,"Well, I had great expectations for the food here after reading the great reviews. \nWe were seated very quickly, but our waiter from the start acted as though we were inconveniencing him. \nI ordered Scampi, it was slightly overcooked and the tails were burnt to black; the pasta and sauce were very good though; my friend ordered the cod, it was extremely overcooked and she asked for a new piece.\nTowards the end of our meal, we could hear him whining to his co-workers (this was a very loud conversation as the staff were behind the prep area going to the kitchen) that we were the ones who sent food back to the kitchen. \nI, and my friend, will not be going back, and we will make sure to discourage our friends from going. The food was mediocre and the service was unprofessional."
2,"I only went to this restaurant because island style was closed for remodeling. I have seen this place a couple of times and decided to give it a try. Im glad i did because now i know never to frequent this restaurant again. I don't care what this place looks like from the outside I'm strictly rating their food and service. First off my wife and i had to request the lunch menu, its not offered. The service was ok my problem was mainly with the food. Chinese food should be bold flavors with fresh vegetables and vibrant colors. This was none of the above. I had the pork and tofu hot pot. Again just plain and boring, plenty of pork and iceberg lettuce?!  Also ordered the shrimp pan fried noodles...very bland and just wasn't very good. Being a chef myself i can imagine that the chefs here just don't care anymore. All in all a very underwhelming experience, nothing special about the service, and absolutely nothing good about the food. I will probably never return"
2,"The food is good, but the times we've been here and had questions, the servers have never known how to explain items on the menu or even what's in it. When we ask, 'How would you explain Kenyan food?' Our waiter responded, 'Uhhh...it's similar to American food.' When we asked, 'What is Menudo,' he just froze up like a deer in headlights until one of us looked it up and said, 'I think that's stomach.'\n\nThe servers are nice and the atmosphere is quiet and intimate.  Unfortunately, they just don't train their staff well enought to know their product."
2,"What do you expect when you see a sign for All You Can Eat Sushi for $19.95?  Less and mediocre food right?  Well that's what I expected and that's what I got! The sushi was blah and there was waaaaay more rice in the sushi rolls than there was actually fish.    So, don't get the all you can eat sushi deal unless you don't care how it tastes.\n\nOn the other hand, my friend ordered miso soup for $4.50 and that sucker was HUGE....not the typical small miso soup bowls....so that was cool.  \n\nI skipped the sushi because I had an inkling it was going to be wack, so I ordered the Ah Sin Fried Rice (which was kinda wack too....not very flavorful at all).  I also ordered the Har Gow (shrimp dumplings) and it was surprisingly good....I've had better...but it was good.  \n\nOh and they charge you for hot tea ($8 for a pot that serves 5 people easily)."
2,"La Condesa, I give up on you. We try and try to excuse the terrible service, but no more. It's not worth it. It's too slow and inattentive and they just don't give a damn, so I'll take my $33 elsewhere.\n\nThis time we were disappointed by the food, too. We returned our horchata for being too thin and tasteless, and you brought us new ones after we finished eating. You drizzled a pretty crema all over the top of my torta (sorry, lonche). How do I pick it up and eat it? \n\nIn the past we forgave the dirty tables and loudness because your cochinita pibil was pure bliss. But not even that makes up for the service. :("
2,"It's a good thing they have super good sales on their meat and fish because otherwise I would never come here. \n\nTheir produce is only so so.  I buy milk a lot here because it seems to be on sale every week. And then the meat and fish - they normally have some sort of buy one, get one or buy one, get two deal on something. And you can't pass that up. \n\nThe service here completely sucks though. The cashiers and probably the least friendly people on the face of the earth. They don't even acknowledge you half the time. And they are all so ssslllooowww. It takes three times as long to check out at this store then any other store I go to. \n\nI will continue to look at their ads and come when they have good sales. But I'm so glad this doesn't have to be my only option for groceries!"
2,"Not my \""cup of tea\"" -- too Yuppie for me!  Atmosphere way too \""sanitized\"", and servers have little or no personality.  The food is fair but not worth the price IMHO!  What ever happened to pasta or pizza with RED sauce?  Seems they have every color and concoction known to man except red (well maybe one or two)- being of Italian descent I need red!!  I ordered from  the \""Small Bits Menu\"" because I wanted a light lunch - believe me - it definitely was \""Small Bits\"",  good thing they gave out bread because I needed a second helping of that just to let me know that I ate something!  My suggestion is to order from the dinner menu if you want a full meal - of course most folks are much more sophisticated than this old country boy and can figure out what most of the fancy California stuff is on the menu - sorry!"
2,"My breakfast and my boyfriends was very bland. We got the waffles and the blueberry lemon pancakes. The pancakes didn't even slightly taste like lemon and the waffles were mediocre. Although the presentation was nice, I won't be coming back."
2,"Asthma and respiratory sufferers avoid this place like the plague.  It stinks to high heaven of cheap teen cologne.  The merchandise is still over priced and staff is dumber than a box of rocks.  On the plus side, it's a great place for decent men's sweat pants.  Just make sure you don't pay full price.  Also wash the clothes when you get them home,  they will stink like their cologne."
2,Do you have any idea how frustrating it is to cut a $50 ribeye with a dull steak knife?  My only memory of this place is having to saw my steak.
2,I came for the signature tamales and left wishing I would have gone to el sombrero.  the food was shlockely prepared and lacked flavor.  it was also lukewarm.  service was equally thoughtless.
2,"Every time I play here something makes me angry. Today was slowness. Usually it's service and miserable people but today all staff I encountered were very nice. We played 13 holes in 3 hours and waited at least 5 minutes if not more per hole. Don't go here if you want to play a quick round and don't use the vending machine on the 4th hole. Wasted half my day waiting so we just left. I will say the greens were in excellent shape which is why I gave 2 stars not 1! I am a self proclaimed golf snob so I may be a little bit dramatic but when I pay $30 and barely get through half a round, this is what I have a problem with."
2,Good service...Not so much for the food...\n\nTwo steaks ordered Medium rare...One arrived med/med-well...The other was blue rare at best...Pretty much raw\n\nNoisy and busy but our server was great. I'm sure of we were not pressed for time she would have done the best to mack our food right too!
2,Why is it that no matter what time you come in it is always at least a 20 min wait? They need to hire more people.
2,"I couldn't agree more with some of the reviews I've seen on here. This is not the Wahoo's you grew up with in Cali. The fish is very dry and the green sauce stuff they serve is like some gross watery sour cream and herb combo. \n\nI've been here a few times for drinks and there is a particular bartender that's horrible. (Sorry, I don't remember her name!) When watching a fight in a mostly empty bar she came on shift and turned down the volume on the television and then changed the channel to some reality show. I asked for it back on and was ignored.  \n\nI've also been here on at least two other nights where her service was lacking because she was too busy chatting up a customer to serve us or even bring us the bill to get paid. I finally had to tell her we were walking out without paying to get her to do her job.\n\nAvoid this location unless you want a mediocre fish taco with crappy service."
2,"This supermarket, a Best of Las Vegas recipient since its opening, serves breakfast on the weekends so that was our destination on a recent morning. I found the market to be comparable to Whole Foods with more moderate pricing. We ordered at the counter and then retired to a table in the piano room where the food was delivered. Our easy over eggs came with bacon, wheat toast and home fries. The ingredients were good, but pricing was high and execution left much to be desired. The toast wasn't crispy, the bacon was limp, the potatoes tired and the egg whites watery."
2,"I walked into this place and had a sense of de javu.  It was a standard buffet with all the little stations with food from around the world.  There wasn't a long wait, which I took to be a good thing, but I should have seen it as a sign.\n\nThe buffet was over priced, the food was only okay, and the service was terrible.  Our waitress never checked on us again after she dumped our orange juices on the table.  \n\nI found out that my feeling of de javu was because I've actually been to this buffet before, but it was when it was at the Aladdin.  They simply transferred it to Planet Hollywood.  \n\nThere was a reason why there was no line for this buffet.  It sucked.  I can't believe I wasted by Sunday Brunch here."
2,"Well as usual the rolled tacos lacked the quality of my first visit.  They were mushy in the middle and some parts of the tacos appeared maybe to not even been dipped into the fryer. The guacamole quality also not impressive this time and the cheese on the rolled tacos was not melted at all. Very concerned about prices for this item too as in most places you can get 5 of these for under 5 bucks always,  but they are 6.50 here with tax. Not worth it based on quality and not even a healthy dose of alcohol helped either."
2,"Ah Aureole.  Lovely to look at, food divine.  Service?  Ridiculously bad.  Reservations at 930.  Get in, get seated.  Waiter disappears after leaving us with their malfunctioning tablet wine list.  Returns nearly twenty minutes later & is a bit annoyed that we haven't chosen our wine.   Because its clearly our fault the tablet isn't working.  Then he begins warning us (four times total) that \""we'll be closing soon.\""  \nAgain.  Food, magnificent.  So so so good.  But feeling directly pressured to hurry the heck up and get out after being abandoned by the waiter...um no.  We won't go back."
2,"This Terrible's is pretty close to my house. I stop there for beer on my way home.\n\nUsed the car wash one time, I felt I payed way too much, for a horrible car wash. \n\nNever pumped gas there, because it's higher in price than most gas stations in my area. \n\nThe convenience store has a good selection of products, at a decent price. \n\nThe beer cavern is great, because it's the coldest beer, in miles.\n\nIt's not the easiest parking lot to get in and out of. It's usually crowded, and parking spots are hard to find.\n\nThe employees are pretty much what you can expect from Minimum Wage Employees.\n\nI will still go there, as long as the price is right."
2,"Always have had good experience here but not tonight, dinner with group of friends had abysmal service. First waiter forgot our table and second waitress had a poor attitude when asked about very late food. Food was OK but definitely not as good as in the past."
2,"This place serves Werner Enterprises truck drivers. I know cause I'm one of them. It's just the basics for what we need. I've stayed in worse places. So if you like a 5 star hotel, go somewhere else. It's a 2 star maybe a soft 3 star hotel. But there are plenty of food places within walking distance."
2,Nothing special about this place. The food is ok and the service is slow. Not enough space between tables so its almost like your having dinner with the tables next to you.
2,"Food was ok but not the best.  I haven't gone there in almost a year and when I paid the bill I realized why I haven't. Almost $2.50 for a glass of OJ and they don't give free refills. Again, food was ok but there is definitely better."
2,"Was craving wings and decided to drive a bit to get them.\nThey are good, but I find the rubs a little too salty. \nHad the Louisiana and Parmesan Garlic.\nAte the Lousiana, not the Parmesan Garlic.\nThe parmesan cheese smelled like an spoiled dish rag. You all know that smell. \nStunk my vehicle up all the way home. \nTossed right in the trash. \nWill NOT be going back.\nDoes the staff not have any olfactory senses?"
2,"This was my first buffet I've been since being away from Vegas for years. And this wasn't my best decision. \n\nMy boys and I were wanted to grab a meal at a buffet before our night out in the city of sin.  Apparently, this was the closest one and had a short line. Once we got to cashier, I was in shock to hear how much an individual had to pay for buffet dinner. For the price for an individual had to pay, we could've got the 24 hour buffet pass. More buffets to visit at different hotels.\n\nOnce we paid, we waited a couple minutes for our table.  After our table was ready and then seated, our server took our drink orders. When everything was settled at the table, we were off to explore the buffet's offerings.\n\nThe selections were very limited since some stations were left unreplenished. With what was available, I had to make my $47 dinner worth it. I went for the grilled meats: kobe beef & prime rib, short rib tacos, assortments of sushi & sashimi, and beef Wellington. For dessert, I got mini churros and vending machine ice cream.\n\nThe pros:\n- Short rib tacos\n- Shasimi & sushi\n\nThe cons:\n- Grilled meats were very dry, also the beef Wellington\n- Mini churros were hard and stale\n- Ice cream from the vending machine taste like any other buffet place back home\n\nOur server was helpful but got all our drink orders wrong. I left full, dissaponinted, and unsatisfied."
2,"I was told to check out this buffet while in Vegas, and I kind of regret I did.  I think there are two types of people: those who like buffets and those who don't.  I'm of the latter sort, and buffets remind me of eating in college mess halls more than enjoying the food.  But still, we went here for a Saturday brunch.  \n\nThe variety seemed pretty good - asian, italian, seafood, pizza, breakfast, etc.  I had an omelet which was probably the highlight of the meal.  Everything else that I tried was fine, but I was definitely limited by not being able to have the meat here.  The desserts looked nice but I didn't really like any of the ones I tried.  My fiance was more experimental, but he thought that most of the food was kind of pedestrian or mediocre.  Ultimately, both of us would have preferred eating less at a better restaurant in Vegas, but then again, I guess we're not buffet people."
2,So I heard a lot if rave reviews and its always crowded so I said hey what the hell....yeah what the hell indeed.\nPros:\n-cheap \nCons:\nFood was subpar\nPork wasn't cooked all the way\nEnchiladas had fake cheese product\nMarshmallows tasted like they were circa 1987...bad year for marshmallows apparently\n\nDid I mention all the freakishly obese people...seriously woman that was your 5th cotton candy.
2,"In person, the staff can seem friendly or helpful. But over the phone, they don't even bother. They've called me to show up early only to switch doctors on me. The office isn't very clean. I had hoped to never go back, but they wouldn't respond to prescription refill requests and I had to go in person to fix the situation. First they told me I would need to come in and be seen every three months for my refills, but when I began to question this they folded and gave me my prescription. They seem like they want to force you to have as much done as possible to line their pockets with your insurance (hopefully) money. I'm back to hoping I never need to go back."
2,"I tried this takeaway for the first time last Monday. I had the Kung Po chicken, but won't be having it again. The chicken was breaded, and the sauce was sticky like a sweet and sour sauce, definitely not authentic Chinese that I was hoping for and it costs more than I expected.  :( Head to takeaway shops on Leith Walk instead."
2,"Pancho Villas has been around for a while, it seems to get enough business to stick around, but I am not entirely sure how... I have had better chili from several pubs and Illegal Jack's, cheaper too. Enchiladas and Fajitas were also uninspired and lacking a spice hit.\n\nA friend said they make a great margarita, however if I need to be inebriated to enjoy the food I don't see the point of paying a restaurant price.\n\nTo use the description so handily provided by yelp; meh, I've experienced better."
2,"The pizza wasn't horrible,  but the deal was awful.  The prices are extremely high at Dominos in general,  and their medium 2 topping is a rip off.  Low rating is for price vs.  Quality,  and value."
2,The facility is clean and architecturally beautiful.  \n\nBUT why would they concrete the decking of a pool in 100+ degree days in AZ?!?!?  It's slippery and hot on your feet.  Saw someone slip and hit their head - an ambulance was called to take her to the hospital for a concussion. \n\nThe ratio of pool guest to lifeguards seems to be 3:1.  \n\nEach time there is an injury instead of taking the person up to the first aid room all 50 guards blow their whistles and corral every single guest out of the pool and the entire pool area.  You are not allowed to find your children or grab your towels or even a water!  It's an absurd practice.  I will not return.  I agree that if the guards are dealing with an emergency people should get out of the pool but to corral everyone off the grounds is a bit much.
2,"I think this restaurant is way over rated for the money spent.\nOn the upside,the waiter was very polite and professional and overall the food was\ngood,not great but good. One the down side of things, when a meal costs over\na hundred dollars a meal and  the wines start at ninety dollars I expect exceptional\nfood and exceptional service for these prices.All of the foods were served barely warm or cold, servings were small. they have two unisex restrooms and after waiting in line,most people left the restaurant to wash and relieve themselves.\nThe only thing exceptional about this restaurant is the appearence  of the way the\nfood was prepared,other than that.this is only a average restaurant."
2,"Register service was not pleasant. I'm not sure if the girl who rang me up just didn't like me, but she was nice to everyone else until I got up to her."
2,"We ordered a side of Mac n cheese for an appetizer. We both ordered fish since it was Friday, with side salads. We also asked for a cup of the soup of the day- clam chowder. The salads came out first, then 2 minutes later the soup arrived. 1 minute later the Mac and cheese arrived. We joked that the word \""appetizer\"" seems to be beyond most servers. We had a few bites of our salad and our entrees arrived. Are you kidding me? We had so many plates on our table the waiter made a joke about it. I just looked at him like \""are you punking me\"". To top this off 3 different servers seemed to be our servers plus the food runners. We had to ask several for refills of water. We also had to grab someone for salt/pepper and to just get our bill. They were all super friendly but it's super clear there is no leadership or management guiding them. The deco is great, the food was all good. We will try one more time, I always give local places a second try. These service issues must be addressed. Any pos system should allow a server to time when food comes out. Clearly there is a miscommunication between the servers and cooks, this is a management issue."
2,"We used to really like this place as a good first stop in Vegas.  It has gone downhill - nearly all the way down hill.\n\nIt took 27 - yes, 27 - minutes for our waiter to come say hello and just take our drink order.  At that point, we ordered everything and asked for the check at the same time so we could make sure we didn't miss him again.\n\nThey've narrowed the menu and the choices aren't as varied, leaving off some things I used to like.\n\nI had the bbq chicken flatbread.  The chicken was not only all dark meat, but half of it was inedible because it was all fat and tendons.  I guess if you order a burger it might be ok, but they didn't do this one well.\n\nThis place has a management issue, which causes a staffing issue, which causes poor customer service and wait times.  We won't go back, but hopefully they fix it for future crowds.\n\nOne star for great beer selection, though!"
2,"I asked for delivery. Ok, they did it with no problems and quick enough (30-40 mins). \nI chose just rolls. \nThe salmon one was pretty flat, no taste. Californias were ok-ish.\n\nWhen I gave money to the woman who delivered she took them and left without saying a goodbye or thank you\n\nMeh"
2,"Doesn't even taste like pho, nor smell like it.\n\nI had asked for extra veggies in my vermicelli, and it looked like they put in less than most places normally would if i had not asked for extra. This plate was ok.\n\nMy seat had a bunch of rips in it, and when you sit on ripped leather it kinda hurts if you wear a dress/shorts."
2,"This is a standard looking hole-in-the-wall Mexican food restaurant just like a gazillion others in Phx.  Unfortunately this one is pretty lame.  \n\nI got two enchiladas, one chicken and one beef.  Neither meat is anything I'd recommend or buy again.    The dark brown sauce scared me and didn't taste much better than it looked.  Some sort of beef sauce I think.  It wasn't awful but it was nothing I want again. My copilot on this adventure said her chicken tacos were not so good either, and when we got back to the office she noted that we won't be trying that place again.\n\nThe place was super quiet for a Friday at 12:30pm. Punch machines were off, a 4yr old was scootering around behind the counter, and I think there were only two people working.  I wonder if they'll be in business next week."
2,"We've been here a couple of times and the poor service does not disappoint.  I'm not sure if they're understaffed or the staff has tables inside and out that causes them to be so slow but both times the service has been painful.  The food is average at best, bar food and not good enough for us to come back.\nThe bar itself seems like it could be great.  They need a lot of improvement to beat the competition that's right next door!"
2,"SINGING COOKS ALWAYS MEANS SAVOR! SERVICE STAFF TREATS YOU LIKE EXTENDED FAMILY JOINING FOR A GREAT FAMILY MEAL. DECOR A BIT DRAB, BUT THIS PLACE HAS POTENTIAL!!!\n\n--made-to-order Pico de Gallo is fresh and spicy, but too salty, especially if you eat with corn chips.\n--when you can hear cooks singing in the kitchen, you KNOW it's going to be good.\n--flour tortillas, though delivered, had only SIX ingredients.\n--guacamole should _never_ have a thickener like milk\n--rice too small, so it dried out fast, too bad.\n--cheese crisp not crispy, green chili strips were fresh!\n\nDECOR NEEDS A REDRESS\n--long strands of hanging beer flags don't make a place festive unless they're flapping in the wind at a Mexico beach bar\n--nor do mounted mariachi hats and diagonally-stapled multicolor throw rugs\n--caballeros and damas are great, but don't mount McDonald's-plain Men and Women signs underneath.\n--mirrored walls are '80s. EW.\n\nmust qualify my review by mentioning my corn allergy. means I can't eat much from this menu.\ngreat local feel here, needs a facelift."
2,"its just too pricey for a double shot of espresso.  really it is.\n\nI went to the handsome roasters cafe, had a double pulled by one of the OWNERS and it was still cheaper than at JPH. is it me or is that weird? LA is fucking expensive. \nI went to Barista in Portland Oregon, had a double pulled by AN AWARD WINNING BARISTA and it was still cheaper than at JPH. I can go on and I will...\nWent to Coava, Stumptown, The Refinery, all pretty pretentious places but still cheaper.\n\njust saying ,you guys are pretentious as F***\nbut i like to go every once in while when iI feel like blowing some coin.\n\nmaybe your rent is super crazy expensive or all these colleges kids are trust fund babies or taking at massive loans to feed there coffee habits.....\n\nlets be reasonable eh?\n\nPS but i love the fact you guys serve LADRO, haven't seen them in a long time. kinda cute."
2,"I think Phoenix reviewers inflate the ranking of restaurants here to make it seem like there are a lot more real good restaurants (and there are, but Blue Wasabi isn't one of them) or they are simply very generous, or they have no idea what good cuisine is, or they give an extra star for creativity by having \""blue\"" wasabi. I've learned to avoid listening to reviewers who give high ratings for average, at best, restaurants. \n\nWhat I like about Blue Wasabi - good service, decent drinks, different decor and look. \n\nWhat I don't like - For what you pay, this is average sushi. The sushi isn't cheap, so I had been expecting real fresh sushi. But, I was let down by the quality of the sushi and sashimi. The sashimi was actually better (but not saying much). But, the food here  was not as good as Sushi on Shea or Kyoto, both of which are considerably cheaper than Blue Wasabi. It's more of a scene place, somewhat trendy. But, I am not paying my money for the scene. I want good  food. And, frankly, Blue Wasabi falls short of that."
2,"I was there on Friday night about 9:00.  Not very many people and it seems that this place is short staffed.  No hostess, and only 2 servers for this large place.  My server was very good - he gets high marks!  The food was another story.\n\nI ordered the lemon sole, a side salad and that's all.  With tax and tip the meal came to $20.00.  The salad was nice and fresh and crisp.  The lemon caper sauce was tasty, the sole was not very good.  I did mention this to the server and he offered to replace it, but I didn't want to wait.  It was supposed to be \""saut\u00e9ed\"", the chef does not know how to cook fish!  It was fried and was crispy and tough.  Sole is a tender fish and doesn't need much cooking.  I was very disappointed in this dish and would not recommend it.  \n\nAs always, Mimi's does have good bread, but the rest of the food is not so hot.  This was what I thought a rather expensive meal (well not a lot, but more than $5 or 10!) and way not worth it.  Go elsewhere!"
2,I really don't know why this place gets so many good reviews. It is very dirty. Very old. It gets busy and the service is horribly slow. And honestly the food is just greasy and nasty.\n\nThe reviews say it's a great place for cheap good Mexican food. But it's not even cheap.\n\nThe salsa is not fresh. And the guacamole is pretty tasteless. When you order tortilla chips and salsa... They put package shredded cheese on and not melted.\n\nI had a taco salad and I couldn't even finish eating it. \n\nIf you like really quick and bad American Mexican food and then this is the place for you.
2,"When I heard my manager said he was going to \""treat himself\"" by going out to Blueberry Hill, I almost fell over in my chair. I mean, has he seen my other review of Blueberry Hill on Flamingo? Abhorrent! Wretched! This is a treat I would give to a used car salesman. Or Satan. Or someone else who's bad.\n\nNay nay, says he, you have to go to the one on Green Valley Parkway. It's 10,000 times better. I responded with a hearty \""meh\"" and went back to work.\n\nToday, however, I needed something to get the creative juices flowing, so I figured why not put Mr. Manager's words to the test. I got to the Blueberry Hill on Green Valley Parkway, and was promptly greeted and sat. In order to be most fair, I ordered exactly the same thing as I did at the last Blueberry Hill: Mexican-style chilaquiles and a Diet Pepsi. It was the same plate of mediocrity as the other one. I don't see how people rave about these places when I always seem to get plates full of mediocre.\n\nOn the upside, the service was a little faster. Not that much more friendly, but at least I wasn't waiting forever to get a refill on soda.\n\nI'm sorry, I'm still not sold on these places. If I need comfort food ASAP, I'm sticking with Denny's."
2,"Sauce variety is so so. Ribs are tiny, even for babybacks. Other meat accompaniments include brisket (too dry for me), pulled chicken, p[ulled pork, and smoked sausage. The waitress claimed they make the sausage on site but it tasted very generic, like it came out of a hillshire farms packet from costco. The steak fries were the only side I ate and they appeared to have some skin on them but still tasted so so. There is much better BBQ to be had in the NW Phoenix area."
2,"Located on Fremont Street, and not far from Golden Nugget. This place probably seen better days. \n\nThe only reason why I go here, is for the cheap Deep Fried Twinkies in Las Vegas. Can't beat the 99 cents deep fried Twinkies. Even though, I know its not really good for me, but got to love the deep fried Twinkies. But, they could probably clean up the deep fry station and better customer service. Really didn't need some one telling me \""Don't forget my tip.\"" With that remark, why would I tip you for being some what rude. But I guess 10% of a dollar, is probably all she'll get from me. \n\nBut the place itself, can probably look better, with out the slot machines that doesn't seem to work, time and time again. If the place was just a place to have a deep fried Twinkies and a slushy bar. Then it would be nice. But with the old school slot machines, and not so happy staff. I believe that this could of been a better place with a better review. \n\nIf you're into gambling or putting a quarter in a slot machine, this is not the place to do so, cause you'll probably not get any service or any help, probably in 30-60 minutes later. The slushy drinks and the deep fry station in the back, is probably a good place to get them."
2,"The coffee is made to standard but the partners aren't very attentive or friendly. I've gone here a ton over the the past two years, at several times of day. I've tried engaging the barista in conversation and they tend to give short answer and that's it. The coffee and food is exactly what you would expect from Starbucks, though."
2,"Just ate the seafood buffet tonight. It's not worth the price. The STEAMED crab legs were ok. The crab legs roasted in a sweet chile sauce was better. The cold crab legs near the cold seafood was a little salty. The lobster tails were small and slightly rubbery. But everything tastes better drowned in garlic butter.\n\nThe best part of this whole buffet was the desserts. The green tea cheesecake was nice and light. The creme brulee was just enough sweet and creamy to end a dinner. The bread pudding or whatever that was with the vanilla spice sauce was excellent.  The red velvet cupcakes were dry and tasted horrible.\n\nGo somewhere else for the buffet. This one is very over rated.\n\nFor those with kids, it's not a very kid friendly place. The seating is a little tight. So, if you have anything larger than an umbrella stroller, it can be a hassle.\n\nOne star for the amount of food and options. One more star for the excellent service we received. But the rest, did not stand up to the hype we got about this place."
2,"Not impressed. We went in around 4pm and there was only one table in there. Exterior was really original and set a good vibe, then we stepped inside and I felt like I was in a tattoo artists bedrooom. \n\nTook about 5-10 minutes for someone to come out of the kitchen to greet us and seat us which was not a good first impression. The salsa bar had good variety but was set up very poorly. The \""togo\"" salsa containers you use to grab you salsas were so small you couldnt even fit a tortilla chip into it, We had to get a plastic spoon to get our salsa onto our chip because there was no metal utensils on the table. They didnt provide us little plates either so our table was a mess before we even started ordering.\n\nAs our tacos hit the table the first thing we noticed where that both mine and my husbands plates had big cracks on them. Flea market much?I got the smoked marlin taco which had the texture of canned tuna fish with a minestrone like vegetable concoction on top and the shrimp tacos, pretty decent. The corn tortillas were pretty flimsy though and resembled the storebought el paso brand.\n\nService was not the best either, our questions about the tacos were answered with finger pointing at the menu and blank looks like...uhh you dunno what achiote rojo is? \n\nAll in all, the fact that we said we should have gone to chipotle instead says everything."
2,"When I first started frequenting this place's Sunday night happy hour, I loved it.  I would go with a group of friends, and it was always a great time.  Over the last few months, I have seen a decline in the quality of food, service, and an increase in prices.  Happy hour is still pretty decent prices, and the food hasn't been bad, it just isn't as good as it used to be, unfortunate really."
2,"Man, talk about an express rental of food, if you know what I mean.  I think this place is a little gimmicky and the food is just so so."
2,"Nothing terribly memorable about this place. I'll admit that I wasn't as hungry as I should have been, and was kinda sorta recovering from a blackout the night before...so take the rating with a grain of salt, I suppose ^_^.\n\nI got the breakfast buffet for about $15, which seems pretty standard for Vegas. Nothing really special about the buffet that I can remember, except that they had pizza, which made me really excited in the morning. Everything else was just your standard eggs, not-so-fresh bacon and sausage, hash browns, etc. I made it 3/4 through a plate before I grossed myself out, and I didn't get near my money's worth. \n\nBut the service was great! My waitress gave me two big glasses of OJ so I didn't have to ask for another later hehe...very considerate. \n\nSo yeah, if you're staying at the Planet Hollywood, it doesn't hurt to grab breakfast here. But I'd vie for breakfast over at Le Village Buffet in Paris instead *wink wink*"
2,"Cockroach crawled out of sprout plate... Killed it, hesitated to stay but did. They apologized, replaced food, charged me every cent for my food n to-go dinner. Used to come here every week, my fav pho diner, but I think I'll drive a little farther to Chinatown from now on..."
2,"Only because the male strippers were funny as hell just trying to be sexy but fuck... if we don't want a dance from you don't bother us... HIS NAME IS CHILI... ugly as hell guy who kept trying to give us deals so he can dance for us.. which none of us wanted... some of the guy dancers were really nice though.. I met a guy who was from San Jose, CA pretty funny.. but seriously main room girl dancers NO FUCKING SEATS.. WTF.. but we kept getting asked to join the guys who had bachelor parties but we didn't wanna sit with them.. and saw a guy getting a hand job by some ugly stripper... HAHHAHA."
2,"The most awesome part of Pasqual's is their salsa -- mild, medium, hot, love it all. I think at one point in history they even called themselves a \""salsaria.\"" The salsa makes me want to salsa dance even though I know I can't dance and I'm not even sure what salsa dancing is. That is how good it is, which is precisely why I'm so disappointed in Pasqual's today. With a large plate of nachos, they serve about a tablespoon of salsa in a tiny little cup. This happened last time, too, so we ordered extra salsa, but we got the same tiny little tablespoon cup. The chicken, the beef, the nachos, the tacos here are 3-star stuff, but I truly believe it's the salsa that makes it so. Gimme more!"
2,"Went this evening with a family member and ordered the $20 dinner for two.   Ordered the guacamole appetizer which was their tortilla chips (yum) and guacamole with corn, according to the waitress, no jalapeno's and not spicy.  First bite into the guac....whoa....5 alarm fire in my mouth.  It was full of jalapenos!!! and other spicy things. Then we got the 6 oz. sirloin, mine was well done as i requested but really burnt on one side.  It came with loaded mashed potatoes, which were great, and broccoli with god knows what they put on it, tasted very foul and rancid.  Service is always poor there and I don't know why I went back.  Today was my last visit there."
2,Horrible Service. Extremely slow to seat us... and feed us... and water us... and bill us... slooooow.\nWe won't be going back.
2,"Bad. With a capital \""B\""\n\nBased on the pizza we got, I have a hard time believing the person that cooked it ever set foot in a pizza place anywhere in the NY/NJ area, ever.\n\nWe ordered a half meatball, half pepperoni pizza. We expected for the pizza to look at least a little like the pizza on the menu.  What we got would barely pass for Dominos, but for twice the price. Thick, doughy crust, sauce that was more like tomato paste than anything resembling sauce, and way overcooked cheese.  And \""meatball\"" as a topping should be just that-sliced meatballs. Ground beef  spread over the cheese is not meatball.\n\nJust really bad. I was hoping for another of a handful of NY style pizza places here in town. This establishment just doesn't cut it. We'll stick to our regular places.\n\nFYI-we only had the pizza. For all we know the sandwiches or other dishes could be just fine. But for a place to call itself \""Streets of NY\"" would imply a good pizza pie.  Which this wasn't."
2,"Decided to run through the drive thru....first mistake.  The poor girl working the window was unfamiliar with the menu.  After she finally handed the menu to me, I was able to point to what I wanted.  Ordered.  Was asked to pull ahead.  After a wait...it finally came. \n\nDrove off....time to head home....with shear anticipation.  \n\nOn the drive home I could smell onion rings.  Unable to figure out what it was...until I got home.  It was my bag of ice cream.  The bag and all of the containers smelled of grease.  And...the flavor came through to the ice cream.  No bueno!\n\nWhat was salvageable of the ice cream was so icky sweet.  Had to stop, for fear of a diabetic coma.  And quickly down water.  \n\nMeh...never again."
2,"Food can be iffy some times. \nI usually order piccatta, and the one and only time I had their veal, it was very tough. \n\nFood is over priced, the atmosphere is the only thing going for this place.\n\nStaff needs to be upgraded and trained all around.\nIn personality, service, and knowledge. \n\nWent to the bar and asked for a mojito. Bartender said she \""couldn't\"" make it. When the manager (I believe his name is Mike or something... blonde.... light complexion.) came around and asked how we were doing, I had brought up the bartender not having the supplies to make drinks... Like a full bar should. He challenged me, by letting me know that they have fresh mint and it is capable.\n\nWell, I got my 'mojito'. \nMakes me wonder if the bartender was telling me she couldn't make it because of the mint.... or that she COULDN'T make it...... because...... gag.\n\nLast June, I set up a birthday of about 16 for my husband's birthday. I made a reservation at least a week in advance. Waiter / busser would throw the bag of bread on the table, and then hide. They could barely be found. Had to beg for refills.\n\n\nWe have had one great waiter in the 3 years we have been eating there, and that is only because I took my pregnant self and spoke to the manager and complained hardcore. He told me to make a reservation with him, he comp'd our meal, and I'm sure that is why we were treated so nice."
2,"Customer service : I was not greeted when I walked in and there were two people standing there. One made direct eye contact with me and said nothing. The other woman said hello after I stared at the menu for a bit and asked me what she could get for me. I said I was not sure so she just walked away. \n\nFood: I ordered the number two lunch special which is a slice of cheese pizza, a salad and a fountain drink for 6 dollars. The sauce on the pizza was too sweet for my liking and the dough was too soggy. The salad was good, it was just lettuce, cherry tomatoes and carrots with a balsamic vinaigrette."
2,"decent place. tvs, outside seating, and a roll of paper towels hanging on every table! i'm definitely a fan of pizza and beer, only you have to drink the beer there (draft- pretty good!), so take out doesn't afford that combination.  they have wine too.  their appetizers seem good, but i just had the pizza (with veggie toppings) which was just ok.  nothing too special here... maybe its location."
2,"I come from the San Gabriel Valley... so of course my standards for dim sum is a lot higher than the average Joe. With that said, this restaurant's food was terrible. I could tell that some of the food was the microwaveable kind and none of it tasted flavorful or fresh. The skin of the Har Gow and Shau Mai was practically melting and falling apart. The white rice cake dessert that I love love love, was also falling apart. It all tasted overly cooked/steamed and had no flavor. I guess if you are in Vegas and want dim sum, then this is a good option for you. As for me, I do not plan on coming back."
2,"Unfortunately my apartment complex caught fire, and I was forced to stay here temporarily.  My daughter, I and two cats came here. I asked for a \""handicap\"" room, as my knee had gone out. While the neighborhood isn't the greatest, the train noise can be bothersome.  However, I loved the safety bars installed throughout the bathroom as I had troubles walking. \n\nOverall if I had to do it again, I'd stay at the Scottsdale location."
2,"The place looks attractive from the outside and the inside. It was not full but a bit noisy on a Friday night, so we sat down on the (quieter) heated patio. The meal started well, with good bread and fresh salads. It went down from there. Overall, serving smaller portions of higher quality food would be the way to go.\nWe had spanakopita as a starter. Three pretty large pieces -- glad we ordered just one plate for two. It looked like a \""pocket pizza\"". Too much \""cream cheese\""; I don't think it was feta. I missed the light layers of phyllo crust we should have gotten. \nThen we had the regular (beef) gyro and the chicken gyro, served with potatoes and rice. Potatoes were more like fries. I did not feel like having something that fat, I ate just a few pieces and was disappointed. The rice was not impressive--and the chicken gyro was not either. My husband liked the meal better than I did--I think he had read reviews of the place beforehand and his expectations were not too high. The service was good, the pace of the meal was good too. But I don't think I'll go back."
2,"They are kind of hidden in Scottsdale Quarters upstairs next to Tanzy and iPic, so don't give up when looking for them!"
2,"I was disappointed with this place not because of the massage; which was good but this establishment has no staff. The masseuse is the receptionist, manager, and janitor. Every time a new customer comes in my masseuse leaves and arranges the massages for the customer. What was a hour massage took 90 min. We actually found this place after having AYCE Sushi at the end of the strip center, but I will not be back."
2,"Peanut butter jelly time?  I think not!  Not sure why the PB&J is only appart of the lunch menu, but if you want one for your child before 11 am, dont count on it.  The two employees were unwilling to relay anything to management (which we believe was skyping on the nearby couches) that it is easier to make a PB&J rather than a smoothie.  The employees only knew to say that it was against the policy to make a PB&J before 11 am.  \nAnyways, I ordered an egg sandwich with tomato and turkey and it was just an ordinary sandwich in that I could have made the same thing at home, but better because I would have had Tobasco.  I asked for Tobasco but  was offered their homemade \""chili\"" sauce, which tasted like pureed sundried tomatoes with chili powder.  It wasn't bad, but I enjoy the bite of Tobasco with my eggs.  \n\nAnywhoo, so if that was management relaxing on the couches, then shame on you for not standing up to defend your strict PB&J policy and invest in a lil Tobasco!"
2,"I really wanted to like this place, since it has such good reviews and nice happy hour prices...but I just didn't. \n\nThe decor is rather lacking and the booths were uncomfortable. The service was decent, not great. \n\nWe ordered Gyoza, which was ok. It's pan fried instead of deep fried, so it's not very crunchy. We also ordered a volcano roll and a rainbow roll, the rainbow roll wasn't that good, the shrimp on it was chewy and the avocado tasted a bit old. They brought us a thunder roll instead of a volcano roll. I'd been debating between the two so I thought I'd ordered the wrong thing and didn't make an issue of it, but when we got the receipt it said we had, in fact, ordered the volcano roll. The thunder roll was, again, just ok. The Tea and Miso soup were good. \n\nAll in all we just weren't impressed and we won't be going back."
2,"Only reason why this is even a 2 is because I have eaten here before and the food is great. \n\nI have never had service like this before here... \nStarted off normally. Greeted at the door, seated... The restaurant was a little busy at a little before 10. We got drinks within a couple minutes of being seated... French press was delicious... and then the waiting... 5 minutes... 10 minutes... 15... I'm about done watching others get seated and orders taken... I watch the waitress put in orders... talk to the other staff... not even a look over to out table... Got up and left... Not what I expect from Postinos... I won't be returning to the central location again..."
2,"I am a huge Cirque du Soleil fan. I have seen O twice, Ovo, Mystere, Quidam, Zarkana and Dralion. The concept of Zumanity intrigued me because going to Vegas for the first time since turning 21, the idea of \""the sensual side to Cirque\"" was one I thought would encompass the adult theme of Vegas. Don't get me wrong, it did, but with a sacrifice. I did not think the stunts were as difficult as many of the other Cirque shows. Moreover, the dancing and soundtrack did not stand out as well. However, with that being said, if you're there for a fun time, the \""clown\"" hosts of Zumanity will definitely make you laugh, especially with crowd interaction. The Zumanity experience is very different from that of other Cirque shows - it is a lot more intimate. For example, the theater was small and the performers of Cirque greet you when you head into the theater when doors open.\n\nFront row seats are going to get you a good amount of interaction so keep that in mind when booking Zumanity!"
2,"I liked the bar tops and the fact that it was nicely lit at this pub...that's about it.  Wait, the fries were pretty good...\n\nMy bf's brother got the fish sandwich with a side of wilted salad.  Yes, wilted because they had put the salad on the same plate as the fish sandwich, and the plate must have been placed under the heat lamp for quite some time prior to making it to our table.\n\nI had the fish and chips, and again, I must admit that the garlic fries were pretty good.  The fish however, was not as good as I had hoped it to be.  The batter did not hold to the fish.  It was not fluffy and airy with the crisp to it.   \n\nMy boyfriend had the Bangers, bean and mash.  All three of us came to the agreement that the bangers tasted like breakfast sausage.  Very underwhelmed.\n\nWill I be coming back to this Firkin place (which is a chained pub btw), highly doubted."
2,"The food was excellent but it was very expensive for the portion sizes. For three of us at lunch, the bill before tip was $105 & we didn't even have drinks. Service was good too but again I can't justify the price."
2,Read reviews and it was close...but no cigar ordered the New York steak and veal scaloppini and some cocktails....the steak at 30 a plate was full of fat and gristle and my veal was about the same and the sauce brown and gravy like heavy not what scaloppini is usually like\nMy martini was suggested And it was sweet but lacked flavor...service was good but don't think we'd return with so many choices out there.
2,"Sat at the bar for a quick glass of wine and to order some food to go. I ordered A glass of red wine. It was good, i don't know if it was worth 9$ a glass though. The bartender seemed a little mad I wanted half spinach, half romain on my Cesar salad. I'm picky, but I am nice about it. We ordered the spinach pear Gorgonzola pizza. It came out cold, and wasn't that amazing. Probably wouldn't come back."
2,"I was staying at the Hilton Grand Vacations across the street and down a way. I ended up gambling at the Riviera every day. Most bartenders at the poker bar are very nice and helpful. Many of the dealers are just nasty! James and Bruce are awesome. After losing hundreds to Tang, without even a smile, I wonder why anyone would keep going back to 3 card poker. If I was with the guys and not my family, I would never play here!"
2,"I can't believe I paid over $13 for two milkshakes. Why would I do that? It's not that they were bad milkshakes, they were fine, but no milkshake is that good. Not in Gilbert."
2,"I was here recently with 4 friends after an Overture show.  The food was quite good, at least what we ate of it.  On a few occasions the server cleared the plates when there was still food on them.  The worst part of our experience was out waiter.  One woman is 8 months pregnant and ordered an mojito without rum.  The waiter looked at her with the most confused look and said \""so, you want it with vodka then?\"".  She finally got it through to him that she wanted it without alcohol.  So then our bill came and we were charged $11 for this virgin mojito (the normal price with alcohol).  We asked him about this charge and he stated that there was no button for this drink without alcohol and the charge was for the mint and the labor.  We asked him to check with a manager, we waited 10 minutes and no manager came to our table.  So, we paid and left....angry."
2,"We parked here and validated the ticket ourselves at the machine by the cashiers. When we left, we were told that parking was $3 and the validation was only for 3 hours. What? Boo.\n\nI got propositioned by a weird tattoo shop owner outside the bathrooms. He had some silicon implants shaped like stars in his forehead. Weird.\n\nWe were gonna go to this \""College Night\"" at the Canyon Club since one of our friends didn't have an ID and it was 18+ but they were charging a $10 cover. What the HECK? For underage people? What a rip-off, man. We just left."
2,"Welcome to an excellent case study in why a nice property in a desirable, high-traffic location would be more than half empty during dinner.  Exhibit A: Three empty-headed hostesses so busy bantering wittily with themselves that it took them over two minutes to acknowledge my existence.  Exhibit B: I ordered a glass of Pinot and it tasted like it had been opened sometime during prior year.  I mentioned to bartender who said \""no, I just opened it\"" rather than offering a replacement.  And what a Happy Hour: $1 off -- can they spare it?  Dinner portions were excellent, but food was mediocre, other than the super croissants: warm and delicious, but nowhere near enough to make up for the rest of the experience.  With so many other superb options in Scottsdale, I can't see this place lasting another year.  Spend your hard-earned money elsewhere."
2,"This was my second go-round here at Tee Pee Mexican Food, and this time wasn't that much different. I realize that this is a historical venue and has been around for a very long time. Great. The wait at lunchtime on a weekend before Christmas was not too bad. Our wait staff was quick and friendly. The salsa was very flavorful, but the bowl of chips (while hot) were some of the smallest and most broken-up chips we have ever seen. My green corn tamale came cold. Yes, cold. And the rice and beans were average. Hubby's carne asada burrito was better than my tamale but it wouldn't take much to get there. If you're desperate, come for the salsa and margaritas or a cold beer. But, that's about it."
2,Don't go on a Thursday night! \n\nThey only open up the rooftop portion of the club and unless you are doing bottle service you'll be corralled into the center of the patio at least 15 ft away from the railing where all the good Vegas and people watching views are.  I was very disappointed with this club. I thought this was Vegas. Nightlife is suppose to be their thing. I've been to better clubs (even on a Thursday night) in Austin. The XS nightclub on a Friday night is ten times better. Don't even waste your time on Pure unless you can get in free on a Saturday night.
2,"Went to this place a couple years back with family during a trip to Vegas and loved it! Ordered all-you-can eat. My dad even got sick for over-eating! We couldn't wait to visit again this time.\n\nWe ordered alligator tail as appetizers this time and they were yummy. However, the all you can eat platters we normally order was good only towards the END. It seemed as if the oil used to fry our fish and shrimp initially was old...yuck! I don't even want to know how old. At the end of our meal (as they brought our new batches) it seemed to taste better. I like to enjoy my food in the beginning. I inquired with our waitress about the oil used and she confirmed that she did see one of the chefs change the oil to fresh oil at the end. Whack! The salad bar was pretty sad too and didn't look like anyone maintained cleanliness. Might be helpful to put the same items on both sides - makes it easy to maneuver and avoid spills. I did like how they kept plates chilled for it though. \n\nOur service was good and our waitress did her job. Sadly, we've lost our craving for this place. It just isn't the same.\n\nNote: Despite what time your stomach says let's eat, this place opens at 5 p.m. - we went at 3 with ready bellies the day before and had sour faces :("
2,"I only ate here since I was staying at the W. \n\nI will admit. hot waitresses. \nbut then again, u are in montreal. so nothing new there.\n\nwelp. thats all that this restaurant has going for it. They really try to go for fancy french-inspired dishes but they end up just trying too hard. The flavors don't reaaaally work. \n\ncan't really say much more.. \n\nbreakfast is okay though. pass!"
2,"When we arrived at McCarren and went to get the rental car, I initially thought \""hey, I made the right choice.  Look at these 5-6 people ahead of me in line while either one person or no one was at the other rental car sections all around\"".  Not the case.  Why?  Later in the weekend I needed a car again, and went with Budget that time.  Budget's price was just as good as Dollar's, and Budget had nicer cars available.  Meanwhile, in this first experience, Dollar only had two people behind the counter.  I don't think I've ever waited in a 5-6 person line for soooooooooooooooo long.  It became painfully frustrating to the point that I considered trying to cancel the reservation on my smartphone and schedule a whole new one at one of the other car rental agencies there.  Not cool Dollar!"
2,Atmosphere is great! Food is not. Had the pasta w meatballs which consisted of a bowl of gummy flavorless pasta w 2 small meatballs for $15.00. I left hungry and went home and ate a PB&J sandwich.
2,"Shopping in a mall has become a thing of the past for me, but I have a gift card that has been burning a hole in my pocket so we decided to do some good old-fashioned shopping in a department store. The store is pretty outdated and I was little disappointed by the lack of inventory to choose from. \n\nI was pretty sad by how little enjoyment I had in this shopping trip. It felt like more of a chore than anything."
2,"Like a lot of the other yelpers on here, I visited because I saw it on Man Vs Food. \nWe arrived about 11am, and although it didn't look busy we had to wait 10 minutes to be seated.\n\nI can't fault our server, she was attentive, knowledgeable, and very friendly. \nWe both ordered French Toast, and just had coffee to drink.\n\nYes the portions were huge, and they had loads of pecan nuts on top, but the toast itself wasn't anything amazing, and costs a lot more than Denny's!\n\nI wasn't that impressed - if I did go again I think I'd try one of the Hash dishes."
2,Slightly better than dominos/pizza hut/little Caesars but the price doesn't pay for quality and amount of pizza. Save your money instead for another pizza place. Seriously 20 bucks for a medium sized pizza?
2,"Don't go.\n\nThe lamest buffet I've ever participated in.\n\nIf you're staying at the Gold Coast, just walk accross the street to the Palms buffet.\n\nAt least the food didn't hurt me belly. For that, I give it two stars."
2,"It's a \""UPS\"" store.... you bring in a package... they take it... you wave goodbye to it... you leave.\n\nSometime after that a big Brown Truck arrives and wisks said package off to its destination. \n\nThis UPS Store was unremarkable... the guy behind the counter did his job... nothing more nothing less."
2,I went in one day for a Orange Julius and the machine was not working. A week later stopped in with some coworkers and chocolate cone wasnt available. A number of workers but awkward ordering and delivery system. I could not identify a supervisor/manager on duty during either visit.
2,"I love going out for breakfast, but there are a couple of reasons I won't go back here.  First of all, too expensive.  My girlfriend and I each had eggs benedict and coffees, and it was 40 bucks!  Second reason, the portions are huge.  I am always disappointed to see such huge portions coming out of a professional kitchen, because I realize how much food is headed toward the trash bin each day.  If you must serve such huge portions, please advise on the menu ahead of time.  \n\nThe most important reason I won't head back here...  unripened fruit as a garnish on my plate.  Just serve me what's in season please.  If it is in season, a tomato in summer for example, please make sure it's fresh, local, and ripe.  I was shocked when the waitress asked me if I wanted to add tomato to my dish and then she served me a hard, barely pink slice of tomato.  It's in season people!  Where did this tomato come from, South America?"
2,"I am a consummate Nordstrom's Rack shopper, whenever a new one opens within a 2 state area (California/Nevada) I try and make it out.  All of the best stuff seems to come when a new Rack opens.  I have been to upwards of 15 Nordstrom Racks and some are certainly better than other, however, none are worse than this one.  The Men's Department is laughably small and the selection is rubbish.  There was nothing at all that I could find to buy.  In fact I was so disheartened that I thought a little shopping might cheer me up and I went to the Rack in Henderson and purchased 2 sweaters.  I had high hopes for this new Rack but I doubt I will make the journey back out to Summerlin just for this store.  Very disappointed indeed."
2,"After a night out and skipping dinner, we were starved! We really wanted to try the Mexican restaurant in Aria but they were closing (boo!). After asking which restaurants are still opened we chose Lemongrass. \n\nThe decor is pretty and modern. The booths are hard to get into though! You cant just slide in. On the table they have a cup with wooden/bamboo chopsticks. I personally think if it was an upscale Asian restaurant they'd be pretty and reusable but that's my opinion. \n\nWe ordered Tom Kha Chicken to start which was awesome. They didn't spoon the soup into individual bowls which I thought was odd. I guess I'm just use to Asian restaurants doing that. For our main course we had black pepper prawns, sweet and sour chicken, some kind of curry, and I think Chow Fun. All tasted good but weren't outstanding. I guess I've had better Thai/ Chinese food with better service for cheaper back home. But then again I have to give them credit for being open so late. \n\nAfter adding some sodas, beers, and white rice the total was well over $100. Overall I doubt I will return even for late night grub."
2,"This place can make you a bit claustrophobic, especially if you've frequented the  LV North Premium Outlets. Here's how it sizes up:\n\n-Easier to park (but you might get stuck in some traffic due to lack of stop lights)\n-Indoors so you can find some sanctuary for those hot Vegas summers (but it feels kind of claustrophobic inside)\n-A lot of store selections (but I feel like the selection is much bigger at the North outlets)\n-More food options compared to North outlets, including surrounding food options\n-lacks that \""touristy\"" vibe, so less tourists looking lost or toting their luggage\n\nDespite the hassles of the North outlets, I still feel like I'd rather shop there. Although it was nice being indoors, it was easier to get to the main stores we wanted to go to by walking outside the building, but our trip was ultimately a bust."
2,"Overall a very blah place. The atmosphere is clean and positive, but the staff are not super friendly. The prices are competitive, but not the greatest. My manicure has a lot of air bubbles!! It does not look good. There is a very limited selection of colors as well. I am new in town and trying new places and I will not come here again."
2,"the promise of homemade turkey and roast beef drew me in, much to my dismay it's shredded. As Ramsey would say 'like a dog's dinner!'. I got the bobby with roast beef, so i could taste both. The bread was good, the stuffing was cold. The meat was chokingly dry. Dry dry. Sawdust tasting. I'm sure the other non shredded meats are great on that bread, this might as well had just been the stuffing and cranberries on the bread. Plus, the manager was bragging about how he just stands around and does nothing but micro manage. Donkeys! Lol. Make that guy clean the bathrooms!"
2,"I would of gave this buffet a 3 star than I thought to myself I really experienced better...also if i wanted to eat a buffet like this place, than I could of stayed in Cali and ate a buffet that would of been cheaper. \nThe whole appearance does look beautiful though."
2,"I went to The Keg last night for the first time, and I was a little disappointed.  I ordered the filet and lobster tail, and everything on my plate came out over-cooked.  I asked for the filet to be cooked medium rare, and it came out unevenly cooked -- half was well done and the other half was medium well.  The asparagus was so over-cooked that it resembled the pressure cooked stuff that comes out of a can.  I couldn't eat it.  The lobster was the best thing on the plate, but even it was a bit rubbery.  Even if they had cooked my food correctly, I'm not sure the experience would have been much better.  The food quality is only marginally better than Outback, but the price is much higher -- more like an upscale steakhouse. If you are looking for something that's a little better than Outback, then this might be the place for you.  However, since your already paying upscale prices, I would prefer to go to somewhere like Morton's, Ruth's Chris, The Palm, or Donovan's.  At places like these, you pay for quality and you actually get it.  I'm not sure I'll go back to The Keg."
2,"This place used to be great, but it's sad to see what it has turned into. One of their selling points was a variety of classes that were available from 5 am to 11 pm. Now they have very limited classes that are jammed packed with signs stating that's tips are mandatory. Very low class! They no longer offer shampoo or conditioner in the locker rooms and have no place to hang a towel while in the shower. The staff is very unorganized when it comes to class cards and often forget to pass them out. I recently renewed my membership after taking a few months off and needless to say....had I taken a few classes before renewing, I wouldn't have renewed. The only reason I keep coming back is because the instructors are awesome."
2,"So the last couple reviews I've done have been kind of negative. So, I've decided to keep this one positive.\n\nThey have a really nice patio! That is all."
2,"The last few times we visited, we left really disappointed. The potatoes are super dry (and reheated), eggs overdone and overall taste is lackluster. Their sriracha is four shades darker than it was meant to be. Old sauce... or has a fake been refilling those roosters? Scramble, we're breaking up. It's not me, it's you."
2,"On a scale of 1-10, I give it a 5.  The burger was tasteless, the bun ordinary. They mixed up our order -- I got fries instead of onion rings. They apologized and brought out onion rings a few minutes later which were fine, but not great. I nibbled some of the fries while waiting and they were average. I think $10 - $12 for a basic burger and fries (or onion rings at no extra charge) is out of line. The beer was good -- tasty and cold. Service was, again, average. The place was not crowded on a Friday night and I can see why. If you're looking for a good hamburger, keep looking. You can do better."
2,"The first time I came here was awesome.  The second time.. not so much.\n\nCan't remember the girl's name, but after 30 seconds of starting she stopped to use the phone.  Then, she stood in front of me (while I was leaned back in the chair) for a good 15 minutes just gabbing on the phone.  Three other workers were standing around me as well.. none of them had the decency to finish my brows.  Also, throughout her conversation, she kept holding her finger up and telling me to \""wait,\"" even though I wasn't saying anything.  \n\nWhen she finally got off the phone, she finished my brows.  At one point she yanked really hard and my eye watered.  She then called me a crybaby.  Thanks?\n\nWhen I went to the register to pay, she asked me how much I was leaving her for a tip.  Wow.\n\n2 stars because both times I've been here, my brows looked pretty good.  However there are a million other places I'll go to instead who can do just as good of a job without the rude service and horrible location."
2,I had a huge burger and it was ok. I would have liked a little less quantity and more quality. Not a place I would return to. I ate about 1/3 my meal and was disappointed. The tractor is cool.
2,"My first experience was so awesome I couldn't wait to come back.  I thought best service, wine , food and atmosphere.  This time a total 180. Note to our waiter\n\""listening skills\""  \nLast time we split every dish was separated and equally plated. This time he hacked into the steak at the table. Presentation ruined! Steak knifes came after the steak, when does that happen in a steak house? When he came to check on us, it wasn't until I had to reach out to the manager. By that time all our food was cold. When the waiter came to apologize, he said if the chef had to slice it in the kitchen, it would be an extra charge. I challenge him to find that button on the POS  system. If that was not bad enough, when the check came the waiter was swarming around my table like a shark on the hunt. Clearly this experience was not about our celebration, but our waiter."
2,"Not a fan.\n\nWent here upon my sister's recommendation but she also said she hadn't been there in about 10 years. So I chanced it because I live really close.\n\nWe sit down and the first question our server asks us rather abruptly is, do you have a Groupon? I was like, uh no. Is there a Groupon? So I look on my phone and sure enough there was so I bought one -$19 for $30.\n\nI was not impressed with the food at all. Every roll had cream cheese and krab mix in it or some variation of that. So not a great selection. Wasn't especially fresh and definitely flavorless. And the rice to fish ratio in the rolls was way off. They were like all rice no fish.\n\nOn top of that, our food took forever. Sigh.\n\nNot a great value. Without the groupon our bill would have been close to $60 for some mediocre sushi.\n\nSo I guess a lot of people come here for their $20 all you can eat special. We decided not to because of all the rules and conditions. No sharing. If you don't eat it all, you pay for what you don't eat...seriously?\n\nOne bright spot was the service was pretty good.\n\nOverall, won't be back :/"
2,"The store is amazing and the chocolate fountain is awesome. This review is for the customer service. \nI have never been here before and asked the cashier \""how sweet are your iced mochas?\"" The response \""well it's chocolate.\"" Great! I know that. Are we talking one pump? Two pumps? Am I going to walk away diabetic?! \n\nI know you are hating your life as every child in Vegas wants a gelato but for those of us who want coffee, AND don't want to drink a milkshake, put on a smile and pretend to give a sh*t about customer service. \n\nThanks!"
2,"If  you enjoy massive quantities of mediocre to substandard food with nonexistent service, you will like this place.  I am torn between one or two stars, but will give them two.  This place just opened and so is cleaner than Hometown Buffet.  \n\nI hated the fat dried out steak that required a wait in line, bad popcorn shrimp, and the tough fried fish.  The fried chicken, barbeque chicken, and rotisserie chicken were blah, but edible.  Some of the food is mislabeled.  \n\nDessert selection was poor with few choices for a buffet restaurant.\n\nStaff appeared somewhat disorganized.  We arrived early, but had to wait in a long line.  The waiter took forever to pick up the used plates.  I sometimes find it wise to bus my own plates.\n\nWe had to get our drinks before paying, which really slows the line down.  You pay an extra $1.99 for a drink or even more for a drink to go.  They charge $5 per pound if you chose take out.\n\nPretty amazing just to sit there and watch people stuff themselves, but will pass next time."
2,"They obviously have good intentions here but there is just too much to complain about. Firstly, the interior decor is extremely drab and depressing.  Yeah, that's just my opinion, but I can't be the only one. Also, on a 75 degree day in Vegas, the temperature inside was way too hot. Even my wife who is never warm noticed it. The tables are too small, and the couches are creepy looking. We ordered smoothies and I swear they must have grown the fruit trees from scratch in order to make them, they took FOREVER to come out. They were good, though. We ordered the \""hummus delight\"" appetizer and even though the hummus was good, there wasn't enough of it to adequately eat it with the sides. My wife ordered the Greek salad and there was no feta cheese. What?!?!  That was a first and it made the salad so-so at best. I got the spicy beef panini and it was really good, but it looked as though they had some trouble with the panini press because it was a bit burnt and had pieces of other sandwiches on the bread.  \n\nSo, overall, the food was good but it took so looooong to get it out that it really marred the experience. Add that to the depressing decor and the high prices and I won't be back."
2,This place is not very good.  I like their sesame chicken about 30% of the time - very inconsistent!  Everything else I've tried are ok or nasty..  My coworker found a bit of a bug in the plastic wrapping they used to wrap the container.  Would not eat there..
2,"Every good thing about our stay was immediately followed by a bad.... \nThe room was big.... And dirty.....\nThe bed was comfortable.....the pillows suck....\nThe room had some nice furnishings.... But was extremely dated.... Ours was a robo cop room....\nThere is wifi in the hotel.... You can only pair one device to it. Each additional device is $14 per device per day....that's ridiculous. \nPool area was large with gambling outside, kinda cool.... The pools themselves were small and u have to rent chairs.... No thanks.\nThe price for the room was fair.... Until you check out and they hammer u with resort fees and taxes..... \nService throughout the entire hotel was hit and miss...\nI would recommend spending a little more money and staying somewhere else"
2,"Eh! This place looks promising after looking at reviews and the menu, but don't be fooled it's not great!  \n\nWe started by ordering the fries sampler with zucchini, Mac n cheese and pepper jack shots (just fried cheese). This was delicious!' Then we ordered burgers and shakes and beer. The burgers didn't come out as ordered and at the end we were charged for everything we ordered that wasn't on the burger. The burgers took a while. The shake and beer we ordered with our appetizers didn't come out until halfway through the burgers! We also had to remind her twice about them!!  \n\nThe burgers weren't very good. The pepper bacon was sweet... Shouldn't be! The burger meat was mealy. I would only go back for the shake (Nutella with Godiva chocolate liqueur) and the pepper jack cheese shots. Don't go in with high expectations!"
2,"I made the mistake of having such high expectations of China Poblano because they were just completely crushed.  I had heard so much about  culinary genius, Jose Andres and that is the reason I even went into the restaurant after perusing the menu.  If it was not associated with Jose Andres, I would have immediately done a 180 after seeing the $11.00 price tag on a serving a dim sum.  \n\nJose Andres is known for his tapas servings and so our group ordered a number of tapas servings to share.  And they were just OK.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't mind blowing either.  If I am paying $8 for a mini mini pork sandwich- it BETTER blow my mind, and it did not.  My favorite dish was the eggplant dish, but it wasn't fabulous enough for me to return. I even tried eating the Chinese dish and Mexican dish, side by side to see if that would make a difference in the \""experience\"", but it didn't.  In fact, I still don't get it.  It was not a fusion restaurant, but rather two menus in one. \n\nThe ambience is cool and trendy, but next time I am considering Mexican or Chinese, I will definitely go elsewhere, where the flavor satisfaction matches the price.  I can get ambience elsewhere."
2,"Fairview Grill has changed its name to Lucky Louie's. So what? The service is still horrible. The food is mediocre at best and their beer list is short. I went there last night for dinner and drinks with a friend and walked out sick to my stomach from the food. Even had to pull out the Pepto-Bismol when I got home. \n\nThe Food...\n\nWings: If you get wings, stay away from the Jerk sauce, it sucks. The Barbalo sauce was decent.\n\nSides: I got the buffalo fries with a side of ranch for dipping and I must say they were tasty...very tasty!\n\nBurger: I got the Bacon Cheeseburger and ate about half of it. I prefer my burgers to be well-done and should have mentioned that so I guess that's my fault. However, the bacon was not crispy at all and they didn't even have A1 Sauce for me.\n\nLucky Louie's does have a couple of redeeming qualities though:\n\n1) Very Nice Golden Tee and Silver Strike Bowling Machine\n2) Pool Tables\n3) Projector Screen in front plus plenty more flat-screen TV's positioned correctly throughout the bar\n4) They carry the NFL Network\n\nWill I go back? Probably not unless forced to. Especially not for the food."
2,"I've been to Panchero's, and I probably won't go back.  If I ever find myself in that center again, I will be at either Jersey Mike's, Starbucks or Yogurtland!  The flavor of the food was decent.....but they were so stingy on everything that it pissed me off before I even got a chance to taste the food!\n\nGet this...they measure out the cheese in this little scoop....are you kidding me!?!?!  It was probably an ounce of cheese, which if you are like me, is not nearly enough cheese to go around.  Also, when I said that I didn't want the rice, just beans, I still got the same amount of beans that a person who ordered rice got....beans are like the cheapest food on the planet....don't be so stingy!  The carnitas was pretty tasty, but I just felt like I was being so jipped as far as the value and the portions went that in order for me to return...a mass destruction of all the Rubio's, Chipotle's and Baja Fresh's would have to occur...and even then...I would probably still pick taco bell....you just can't beat 89 cent bean burritos!"
2,"Just Okay.\n\nThe place itself is nice inside.  The staff were not all that interested in helping us.  The prices were in line with what we expected and the food was fine.\n\nWhat hurts Tusca is that other, better Tapas places are nearby.  Also the clientele at Tusca seemed to be mainly female late 30's to 40's who were there to hunt for younger upwardly mobile young men.  Maybe this was just the few times I was there."
2,"I had such high hopes based upon the recommendations but was sorely disappointed. The wait staff seemed distracted or else just not interested in our table. It took forever just to place our orders, which were not complicated: one crepe, one brownie, one petite pot. Unfortunately, we got two crepes and no brownie. Considering the brownie were for our small children, both of which had had it promised for good dinners,  just compounded the disappointment. We tried and tried to flag a wait person to correct the error to no avail. When we eventually did have someone respond, it was getting too late for us to wait any longer. We received an anemic apology at best. The food was delicious, and we do like supporting local businesses, but this location's service is in need of a reboot."
2,"What happened, Xinh Xinh?  We used to take out of town people here because we were so impressed with the place.\n\nLast time we got take-out.  Three banh mis and an order of wings.  Wings were pretty good and certainly well seasoned with fish sauce.  (If you are not used to the smell of fish sauce, this might not be too appealing.)  My wife's sister's banh mi seemed pretty good, but ours had very little meat on them.  They still had the jalapeno peppers and cilantro, but the mayonnaise seemed less, too.  I got the catfish banh mi and the fish was tiny - especially in comparison to previous trips.  \n\nWe'd noticed a decline in the quality of the bubble teas, too.  Originally they were really strong and offered flavors that Cafe Evo didn't.   But last time we got one (it was a while ago), it seemed like it was made with non-dairy creamer instead of milk.\n\nDisappointed.  Probably not going back - I guess I have an excuse to try making my own banh mi or pho instead.\n\nThe service was still good, but the food is simply not as good as it was when they opened."
2,"Remember the old Wendy's commercial with the old lady asking \""where's the beef?\""\nWell, ditto that...\nWe split the green chili beef chimi and although it tasted pretty good, there were literally three small pieces of beef with virtually no green chilis.\nAs Klohe Kardashian said at her sister's wedding, I give it six f'in months...unless they add some meat to those meals..."
2,"Serving portions are small, so you can somewhat say it's overpriced. They didn't have sisig when we went, and it was within the first two weeks of opening. Our food came in at different times which is unacceptable in my opinion. Our server was ok. Based on my observation, it doesn't look like they were trained. They are actually more concerned about cleaning up the tables rather than taking care of the actual customers. Overall, very displeased with the experience."
2,"Hardly utopian for this beer fan. Nice ambiance, on hip lower rue Crescent, and a nice mix in the crowd.\n\nOrdered the IPA on the recommendation of the very good bartender. What a disappointment -- virtually flavorless. Not what I'd expect of an IPA at all. Probably should have tried something else, but I just moved on.\n\nOh, and like other independent brewpubs in Montreal - cash only. Boo for the business traveler."
2,"Mediocre at best....\nStopped by on Saturday for a lunch. They had no grilled chicken available! I know... things happen but when place call itself Peru Chicken and has no chicken available it's like hot dog stand with no hot dogs.\n\nOrdered something called Tacu Tacu and plate of Antichuchos and potatoes with cheese sauce for app.\n\nTacu tacu consisted of huge pile of rice/beans mixture and small slab of grilled meat.  No veggies, no pickle... just that. Come on - work on presentation and quantities and you can probably charge $10 for that otherwise it's a fail.\n\nAntichuchos - slices of meat on a stick with bland side of corn and undercooked potatoes.  Meat was OK. Sides weren't. \n\nAppetizer (I think it was called pappas a la huancaina) - 3 sad pieces of cold boiled  potato served on a styrofoam plate covered with cheesy sauce (cold as well) - $5 is way too much for it."
2,"I thought I would really like this place, but I just don't find anything really special. \n\nThe burgers and fries are just so-so. Pretty pricey for a burger joint even for Vegas standards!\n\nGood that it's open 24 hours."
2,"Went on a Sunday morning about 10am. It was clearly busier than the staff and kitchen crew are able to handle. The place was packed but the tables were not full. It took a while to order and then the order was not correct when it came to the table. The appetizer cinnamon roll never came, my drink was not refilled and my pancake was burnt (black). The hash browns needed some love and my french toast seemed old. I hope they get their act together, it has the right ingredients to make it happen."
2,"Our foursome was looking forward to trying this place based on the reviews.  We came in at 4:00 looking for a late lunch early dinner and were disappointed to learn that they only serve \""brunch\"" on Saturdays and Sundays. Dinner doesn't start until 5:30.   Who wants pancakes at 4:00.  :(.   With our work schedules being m-f we will sadly never get to try them for lunch.  We will try again for dinner sometime."
2,"Omg!! Slowest service ever. When we walked in, there was no host. So, we went straight to the bar thinking we will get quick service....WRONG!! The place wasn't that busy. There were 2 couples at the bar along with another table that the bartender had. There was a long wait for a greet. She said she had to go find mint for my mojito.we finally got our drinks but was never offered menus. I had to go to the host stand to get my own menus. I ordered water before the meal and the bartender never brought it. I asked for water again by someone who dropped the food off. The food is ok....typical Applebee's food. We finished the appetizer, drinks, and entrees. Nothing was cleared off until she picked up our credit card for payment. What really pissed me off is that a 3-top walked in at the bar and the bartender knew them and she greeted them and got their drinks immediately...I will never go back even if the restaurant was conveniently located behind the hotel."
2,"Disappointed. Was recommended, was expecting so much. Was a bit dirty, waited ages to get served, so long we nearly walked out. Looked like loads of managers, no staff. Staff looked bored and poorly trained. What a let down."
2,"Philly cheesesteak not good. Cheap dried up luke warm meet. Not served as described on their menu. My husband got a turkey sandwich, which was ok but nothing to write home about. This place may be good if you're drunk and hungry at 2AM, but if you're just looking for a good quick bite for lunch SKIP THIS PLACE."
2,"I've tried a few of their veg curries, and they're pretty disappointing. They were all seriously lacking in taste and quality. Maybe their non-veg curries are better...\nI understand that since they're so close to campus, they can get away with lower quality food, but still. I wouldn't recommend anyone go there if they're looking for good Indian food."
2,"The service at this place has gone downhill! Ticket price for 2 people $120 plus Platinum flash pass an extra $140! Platinum Flash Pass \""supposably\"" reduces wait time in line. To be honest that's questionable! I feel that this pass is a scam.\nhttp://www.laronde.com/larondefr/flashpass.asp  (Misleading description)\n\nToday I shelled out a total of $400 to have a great time with my kid, yet the rules seemed to change at any given time in regards to the famous Platinum Flash Pass. This bothers me, since they misrepresented the wording defined on website. I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THESE PASSES WERE LIMITED! Why was I told that this was not a VIP pass and why did I have to wait in-line for certain rides? Why aren't all rides covered under the Platinum Flash Pass? \n\nI also ordered a beer, at $6.50 a beer I expect a proper pour not 3/4 foam 1/4 liquid. The drink in question was poured by a 16 year old! Being in the food industry and being familiar with the law I know that this is not legal. I plan on complaining to the http://www.racj.gouv.qc.ca. Teenagers should not be pouring alcool. Obviously Provincial RULES do not apply to Six Flags in Quebec."
2,"This show was overpriced, performance was mediocre, had very little real dancing and had a bit too much immature sexual insinuation (guys grabbing their crotch too often) and mime comedy. Throughout the whole show, we kept waiting for the real show and exciting performance to start.  It never did. There was one number like it.  Everything else did not have the caliber of their performance on ABDC. \n\nBut while walking out, someone exclaimed, \""it was sooooo good.\""  My husband and I wondered if we were in the same show.  Maybe it's more for the teenage crowd."
2,"I love Kirkland Signature frozen yogurt but this particular food court rips you off by leaving the middle hollowed out. It's like the employees are trained to serve the yogurt this way because it happens to me every time I order it here. Also, the pepperoni pizza is so greasy here that you'll need to grab a fist full of napkins to mop up the grease before eating. In fact, it's so greasy that it's on the bottom of the pizza and all over the plate."
2,"While in AZ I thought any Mexican restaurant would be good, I was wrong. My husband's uncle and wife raved about this place so we tagged along for dinner. This restaurant is located in a plaza. Upon entering the resturant You notice it is decorated really nice. I loved the Spanish decorating and the whole restaurant vibe. When we arrived we had to wait for them to fix a large table so we took the kids to the bathroom. The bathrooms were nicely done as well and very clean. After we finished in the restroom we were seated and our waitress came out. She was very nice and she took our drink orders & salsa orders. They have a couple of kinda of salsas. I was not impressed by their house salsa --and usually I'm down for salsa and chips but this salsa was a no go. The chips weren't even great. I ordered the cheese dip and this was actually pretty good. I ordered a chimichanga but it was not good at all and there was no cheese in it or on top of it and it did not taste good. I ended up sending it back and not ordering anything else. I tried my daughter's and husband's food and I wasn't impressed with that either. This place only gets a two due to the decorations and the good service. Food wise ---they did not represent Mexican food right."
2,Pizza tastes good. But delivery is horrible. Pick it up yourself unless you want to wait 1.5 hours to eat.
2,"I'm a frequent visitor to Kabuki, mostly for work lunches during the week.  Today (Saturday) I decided to treat my wife and kids to sushi!  I'm not sure if I'm tainted by the larger and quicker lunch staff, but service was absolutely atrocious.  Our server, Andy, was covering what appeared to be 4-5 tables.  His priorities, however, were more targeted towards complaining to fellow waiters about having to work on such a nice day and discussing weekend plans with the hostess.  To give you an idea on what I mean by \""bad service,\"" our appetizers and salad (that comes with the special) came after we were done with our sushi rolls, drinks were not filled, and it took him approx 20 min to pick up my card and check after dropping it off.  It's too bad they couldn't find anybody to work that wants to work!  Buyer beware, bad service, \""okay\"" food."
2,"Got to agree with the people weighing in on this Walmart with two stars. I have been going to it for about a year, but I'm changing my prescriptions over to another Walmart because I just can't take the trashiness anymore. \n\nI love Walmarts overall, but this one is the reason that I can't always recommend them to friends. (Had an Walmart-challenged friend come into town and use the restroom, and she heard someone puking in the stall next to her. So of course, she is NEVER going to go into a Walmart again, ever.)"
2,"Friday Happy hour menu:\nSteak and cheese - $ 6, decent\nNeopolitan milkshake - $4, decent\nGyro - $6, no more next time\nPanini - $6, okay\n\nService is slow, despite it being almost empty.\n\nOverall, it's okay if you are starving, hungover, drunk, or didn't think of other options."
2,"Here's why this place deserves a knock off of three stars: the blueberry scone was awful. Blatantly horrible; not sweet, almost savory like, which was odd. Had a weird granular texture as well. My espresso con panna was way more bitter than I expected, bitterer than starbucks'. These were the redeemers: the lemon olive oil cornmeal cake was absolutely excellent. The mocha was great too. The counter worker seemed very friendly and knowledgeable."
2,"Ehh. Nothing to write home about. Good service. Food just average. Unless you are a veggie loving hipster, this place is not worth the 2+ hr wait. Save yourself the trouble and disappointment and cross Butler St to Franktuary."
2,"I'll be honest... this place is not great.  I was killing a few hours before my red eye flight, and came here because I was craving some Mexican food.  I really should have gone elsewhere.\n\nPros - friendly service.\nThe guacamole was actually pretty good.\n\nCons -\nThe tortilla chips did not taste fresh and were not very good.\nThey didn't offer burritos.... what?  They only offer burritos M-Thurs (or something like that.)\nThe chicken quesadilla definitely tasted like something I could have made at home and was unimpressive.  Part of it was soggy (with what?  no idea), and there was dead space along the whole outside of the quesadilla that didn't have any fillings... so it was just bland tortillas.  Meh.\n\nYOLO, so you should probably go somewhere else."
2,"We have been to this location many times.  When you eat in the portions are fine but when you order out they cut the size of your order and still charge the same.  Last Friday we ate there, ordered the Mahi Mahi with vegetables and the fish portion was a decent size as was the vegetables.  On Sunday, 7-29, we ordered the same meal to go and when we got home the fish portion was half the size of the one when we ate in.  The amount of humus was also decreased.  \nThis is not the first time that has happened so if you are planning on getting and order to go make sure and look at the portions.  They seen to give less for the same price figuring that you wont see that till you get home."
2,"I love frozen yogurt. But my logic is that if you are getting FroYo, you are gonna want a more refreshing and fruity flavor. If not, you want Ice cream. Every time I have been in here they have had one fruit flavor and it was always something I am allergic to or dislike. They never even had original tart, which I thought all places had.\nThey do however have a pretty nice selection of toppings.\nThe place is pretty clean, the service is alright, and the price is the same as most frozen yogurt places per oz."
2,"This is my second visit and likely my last. I was so disappointed in the food quality and service. I treated a friend to the table d'hote and was horrified that she received a burnt  puck of beef after waiting an unreasonable amount of time. The fact the server did not even acknowledge the poor quality/presentation and never asked if we enjoyed the meal, reflects the nonchalance attitude of this place. I am a firm  believer that a sever is the representative of the food and the establishment. And when they don't take ownership of the experience, there's no reason to go back."
2,"This was such 50/50 place. Out of three different specialty pizzas we ordered, one was really good, one was okay and the other was really bad. Salad was good, but nothing special. Ranch dressing was really good, bleu cheese dressing was really bad. Chicken tenders were burnt, like to the point that when I opened the container, it smelled like a kitchen was on fire. They were so black, I could not believe that they actually delivered those to us. The buffalo sauce was good, but useless since our chicken was not eatible. The baked potato fries were a good concept and had a good flavor, but the fries were soggy, but maybe that was just because they were delivered. Okay, maybe it was less than a 50/50 ratio here, since we did spend over $100 for so much dissapointment."
2,"Didn't go in with high expectations as I wasn't impressed with Bottles & Burgers at Tivoli Village, but a friend wanted to try this place out. I am willing to give any place a try at least once, especially if they offer patio seating. The only bad part about their patio is it's located in between the two escalators that lead up to the second floor, so there was a lot of traffic, it was noisy and distracting. I didn't try the food, but I had their cucumber martini, wasn't bad but I've had better, and then the sangria, hands down the worst I've ever tasted. It came with a sugared rim which was strange, and it tasted like prune juice, I'm not joking. The only drink that was good was my honey jack on the rocks, can't mess that up. If you're looking for a nice outside patio, go to Brio, comfy chairs and fire pits, plenty of room and great people watching."
2,"\""Disappointed\"", \""underwhelming\"", \""overpriced\"" and \""over-sauced\"" are all adjectives that came to mind while eating at Imadake. From reading earlier reviews here, I think we ordered all the right items (octopus balls, okonomiyaki, that fried chicken with wasabi mayo dish, jellyfish salad, black cod), but none of them were that great. The cod was rubbery, unlike at other Japanese restaurants in Montreal (for example, Azuma on St-Laurent had a wonderful black cod). The octopus balls were gummy with un-cooked tempura batter in the center and slathered in salty sauce. The okonomiyaki was so completely covered in sauce, that this was the only thing we could taste. That, and a strange, almost cornmeal-y consistency unlike any other okonomiyakis I've experienced (granted I've only had it once before, in NYC, but it was a wonderful streetfood-style dish there; here, not anything I'd recommend, even if you got the sauce on the side--which I would recommend doing, if you choose to try this dish). We didn't order anything to drink, and to the best of my knowledge, only ordered the five small dishes listed above, plus one order of mochi, and it cost us $67 before tip. I certainly won't be returning. I think this place is more about the scene, as it's got a trendy vibe to it; it's a trendy-slathered-in-oyster-sauce kind of place."
2,"I wouldnt call this a premiere resort. The suite was small, and needed a major update to compete with other area resorts, ie. Tube television. The bathroom was very small and in one of our rooms was missing toilet paper and a working lock. The grounds looked like they needed a major paint job and some pruning of plants.  I had a lovely view of the highway, but luckily the noise was not a problem. On the upside, the kids enjoyed thw waterpark, but at times the lazy river and slides were closed. There was confusion over the opening times on Sat, which left our girls frustrated. If you are looking for a focus on kids waterpark, okay grounds and room, this will work for you.  If you are more interested in an overall resort experience, go to the Fairmont Princess."
2,"A topless diner near the Olympic Stadium. Decent diner food, lots of security lounging about, and what looked to be a few regulars hanging out. \n\nFYI - I was the only female patron!"
2,"The best thing to say is that the waitstaff is polite.  Mediocre food.  Overpriced for menu options.  If you have to eat here, buy a beer.  It will make the food better.  I ordered a quesadilla (steak) with a side of guacamole and a Coca Cola.  My soda was so anemic looking I thought it was weak tea.  I was never offered a refill.  The quesadilla looked great, despite the nearly two dollar guacamole only containing a tablespoon of guacamole.  The dried and shriveled green onion garnish was unneeded.  After attempting to eat the quesadilla, I discovered that despite the attractive appearance, the filling to cheese ratio was horrible and the entire thing fell apart and had to be eaten by fork.  The steak filling was overdone to the point of being inedible and the corn and black bean relish they put in it just made the small bit of cheese coagulate in a grainy mess.  Save yourself the money and just pick up food at Burger King."
2,"Decent for the money, but not spectacular. Wings were overcooked and dry. \n\nThe western bacon burger was decent. Bread was good."
2,"Expected to get  fed for $50-60 (fresh fish in Vegas) and left more money at the restaurant than at the craps table!\n\nFood was good, fresh, nicely prep'd. Portions were smaller than average. Price was over 2 times what I pay in down town DC which is pricy already. Oddly enough, drinks were reasonable. My manhattan martini was generious and $10. (same in DC).\n\nSitting at sushi bar was pleasant with an impressive huge animated  display behind the sushi chefs.  Service was good, friendly and prompt. Recommendations from the waiter were tasty.  \n\nWent to a different casino to recover the losses at the MGM ;-)"
2,"This was my 2nd time at a Twin Peaks. The 1st was in Austin, TX. This one had the most unfriendly waitresses. Barely saw ours, even when needing our check. The other waitresses were clustered in the back or someplace where they couldn't be seen.\n\nAs for the food. I enjoyed a burger with fries. It was prepared the way it was described on the menu. But there is no reason for me to return to this location in Scottsdale. I can get a better burger elsewhere (Whataburger). I was hoping to see the waitresses. Not at this location, though."
2,The food was just good. Nothing I would write home about. I found a few things that I thought was weird. The first thing is they charge for refills. Really what is the cost to do refills. Second thing as sitting there eating my food some more people came in and them like me was their first visit. They had 9 people in their party. The lady behind the counter said that they 15 percent gratuity. How do you charge this when you have to order at the counter and they don't have to bring you refills of food or drink. \nOn the positive side the people were friendly.
2,"Not much meat selection,  really slow,  even though,I wasn't crowded.  The meat was really some poor cuts. Ie sirloin.   The salad bar was boring. I have to say I came Here about a year ago and was really impressed."
2,"So I responded via email per request to the CSR rep below and she was concerned and courteous.  I emailed her maybe twice and another corporate rep also emailed with concern and humor.  I was then told that the local district manager would be contacting me within the week.  That was a few weeks ago.  I am really over a bad customer experience a month ago, but it is a shame the disconnect between local and corporate.  I need no further contact from dsw, but did feel the need to update the review."
2,"Location is clean, service is polite and prompt. I like how they use blue film covers over the fluorescent overhead lighting to keep it from being too harsh, gives the dining room almost a lounge atmosphere.\n\nBut the food.\nSalt and pepper calamari order was $7 for 14 grease-soaked pieces, without any salt or pepper. Very bland, only tasted like grease, served with cups of sweet and sour sauce? Best part was the random pieces of fried carrot used as garnish.\n\nThe \""special combination\"" bahn mi, with a smiley-face next to it on the menu, was a huge disappointment. Meat was all stacked on one end of the sandwich. I opened it up to distribute it evenly, only to find several blackened pieces of meat- the type of coloration that looks like food that has gone bad, not blackened from cooking. Picked out several pieces, then bit in, only to encounter some crazy spicy sauce or seasoning that was so strong it made my eyes water. All I could see were jalapenos (one piece on the entire sandwich?), and I don't mind those.\n\n This place may be right next to my gym, and the pho may be delicious, but I will not be coming back. If you can't reliably serve unspoiled cooked meat on your sandwiches, I am not going to trust the meat cooked in your soups."
2,"Took a business group to Harvest last night.  I realize their committment to locally sourced ingredients means a variable supply, but our experience was extreme.  They did not have one fish dish listed on their menue.  They had only two of their steak special, and so could not accomodate orders from our group.  They had only three of their dessert special, so similar issue.  They could not provide one request for a diet Coke.  They ran out of straws for one person's drink.  This was not a big group.  The place wasnt overly busy.  They were just apparently not prepared to be open last night.  Disappointing.  Will not take clients there again."
2,"Although we visited on a Saturday evening, we arrived around six, we were seated within 10 minutes because the restaurant was not very busy.  We were taken to a table which was not yet cleaned. After waiting a while for a waiter to take our drink order finally the manager took the order.  A nearby waiter recognized that we had been sitting for a long time without drinks or a waiter.  Because of him our waiter arrived a short time later and took our order.  We would have enjoyed our mozzarella garlic bread while we waited for our entrees, but it all arrived all together. The food, with the exception of the bread, was lukewarm at best.  While several tables around us cleared out, I never saw a busboy clear the tables.  We were disappointed by the discombobulated staff and disorganization in every step of our dining experience.  I honestly doubt I will returned this location."
2,"Like a glutton for punishment, I hit up Roland's again last night while in town for business. I tired Kaya, but the wait was 30 + minutes.\n\nHere's the big clue I keep ignoring....the restaurant is EMPTY when everywhere else is crowded. Another issue is there's poor A/C in the dining room, which kind of sucks when it's 85 degrees and humid outside. \n\nI had a grilled vegetable sandwich and clam chowder. Same as before, it was just OK.  Service was better this time though. \n\nAll in all, I preferred my to go taco salad from doba the night before to this meal. \n\nSave your money and try somewhere else. \n\nPS. Beer selection is impressive if you want to drink beers from all around the world."
2,"Edit 2/17/13 -- My boyfriend and I headed to Pin Kaow 3 for a local bite before heading downtown for the evening...what a mistake! The service was painfully slow and we waited for 20 minutes for our water. Our curry took another 20 minutes and our waitress never came back to check on us. Boo. \n\nPin Kaow is a stones throw away from my place so when I came down with the flu I called them up for my go to, feel better,  stand by of tom ka kai with side of sticky rice. Too bad the soup was a tiny little portion and it was so salty and thick  I ended up thinning it out with water. Definitely not the kind of hassle you want when you feel crumm-ola. I ended up paying $12 total for about one cup of soup and a small side of sticky rice. Bums. On the bright side, the sticky rice was warm and delish."
2,"Good hotel if you just want a place to stay when you are in Vegas. Its location on the end of the Strip is convenient if you are into walking a bit. If not - take a bus, it stops right in front of the hotel. \nYou can get cheap and ok drinks at the hotel bar & the room was clean!"
2,"good selction of beer, but the service was blah.  food was not great, but sort of expect if from a more bar setting.  someone put a lot of money into the place, but they should care a bit more about what they put out now..."
2,"This is like a more expensive, less tasty version of Macayos. \n\nI went here with a group of about nine people, and even though six of the nine people were present, they didn't seat us until everyone was present.  Hmm, ok.  This was on a quiet Monday evening.\n\nWe're seated and I will give credit to the server as she was very pleasant and attentive.  There was rarely a time a beverage glass was empty. \n\nThe food leaves a lot to be desired.  I had the carne asada taco plate with a side of guacamole.  It was as if nothing had any seasoning.  I understand Americanized Mexican food, I really do, and I did not go in here with the expectation of getting super-flavorful food, but I did expect some seasoning.  \n\nI definitely won't choose to come back here."
2,"Bonus points for the selection of coffee beans (Verve and Forty-Ninth Parallel) but minus points for the over-crowded atmosphere.  It's a bit of a pretentious \""scene\"".  Navigating from the drink counter to a table is tough, as is getting to the bathroom from a table. The chocolate chip cookie was greasy, but admittedly some folks prefer that.  \n\nNo complaints about the coffee drinks themselves.  If you just need a solid espresso drink to go and don't mind waiting in line, this place is fine."
2,"DONT BELIEVE THE HYPE\n\nOK so the reason I came here was because of all the reviews and honestly this place is not all that. First of all you have to wait for an 40 minutes or more to be seated and the service is very slow.\n\nOnly thing I liked about this place is the hurricane roll (The extra star is for this roll). The fresh was not as fresh as some reviewers said.\n\nOH and because we were sitting thing there and talking with friends with have not seen for awhile, mind you this is shortly after we paid the bill, they asked us if there was anything else we needed kinda their way of telling us to get the eff out because there were people waiting. I am sorry but if we were at any other place, they wouldnt make us feel that way. \n\nThey are never getting my business again. Get a bigger spot!"
2,"Came to Vegas for SHOT show and subsequently never left the Venetian.  Taqueria Canonita, you would  think being so close to the border and with so many people coming from LA to Vegas, they would have some great Mexican food.  I ordered the Santa Rosa Pork Barbacoa at the recommendation of the waiter.  As my stomach churned for that slow cooked, delicious pork, I was greeted with a fairly bland and very dry pork.  I would have been better off with Chipotle's barbacoa than what Canonita served up.  The empanadas that were ordered for the table were far from crispy and the guacamole that came with the tortilla chips were not fully mashed.  Far too many errors for a sit down restaurant to be any good.  On the plus side, the tequila helped me forget the awful food."
2,"An apt moniker for a once-enjoyable and frequented breakfast joint. Somewhere along the line, this place lost the plot. Needless to say, I will not be making any new memories here.\n\nRating Scale:\n1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  \n2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?\n3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.\n4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.\n5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."
2,"This gym is ok. I don't like that the cleaning people always seem to be in my way and yet nothing seems clean. The women's locker room is always disgusting. The gym itself seems to be a bit small and stuffy in my opinion. I wish it was a little wider and had more open space instead of all the cluttering of machines and equipment. The front desk girls seem to be clueless and are not the happiest girls. Except for like two of the girls, I think one of them is named Candice or Candy."
2,"This place gets 2 stars because of the amenities!!! The pool area was worth a lot more than our massages. We got a 50 minute couples massage which was $300, they automatically add your 20% tip in (which I don't agree with considering I am in a customer service based occupation) the spa is beautiful, but there was no area to see each other prior, men's and women's areas are separated, and it seemed very rushed. We both asked for deep tissue and got nothing of the sort. The massage was lackluster and frustrating. I have very bad knots in my shoulders and she never even rubbed my shoulders, so I walked away with so sense of relief?!?! I would not go back to this spa, even if we come back for future trips with the timeshare. I will likely find another spa in scottsdale off of the JW Marriott resort."
2,"Another annoying Scottsdale establishment. \n\nI gave it 2 stars because the food was tasty, not great--but good. \nThe service on the other hand was horrible at best. The restaurant was freezing!! We requested they shut the back door to prevent the draft of cold air pouring in and was ignored. It was lunch time on a Monday and we were only the 2nd table to be seated, I wasn't sure why our request went ignored. \n\nShortly after taking our drink order our server vanished for almost 15 minutes. After which did not bring any of us water. We then placed our 2nd, 3rd and 4th request for water and finally receiving it the same time as our entrees. Would you like extra salsa? Too bad, the waitress never was to be seen again till my friend got up and approached the bar to have her soda refilled. It took her this long to realized we were annoyed. The food could have been the most amazing thing ever, but due to the lack of service I will NEVER go back."
2,"You will find here:\n\n1) mediocre frostbitten sashimi\n\n2) scallops that will get you sick\n\n3) a den of witches. \n\nThe first two are self explanatory. The third will be explained in detail.\nThe food here is okay run-of-the-mill americanized sushi. Three star fare. The ambiance is good so that miiiight bump things up to a 3.5 star.\n\nHOWEVER the unique service forces me to ding my rating down to a two.\n\nThe waitresses here are chinese. I am chinese. I also understand chinese. So when the waitresses conspire to secretly sell my coworkers and i their crappier alcohol, i understand what is going on.\n\nCome on.....  \n\nHiro is where it's at."
2,"Love their coffee.\nThey need to add help in the morning.\nWith all the moms and high school kids ordering double latte whatever's there is a line to the door from 7:45 to 9:00.\nI'm not going to wait for ten minutes for a cup of plain coffee.\nUsually buy beans there and make at home. But now when I want to stop in to grab a cup to go, I go elsewherel\nThey should have someone who only takes straight coffe orders. They would get more business."
2,"I really wanted to like this place.  It is a fun looking place.  We were there when it was slow.  The downstairs bartender was friendly.  We went upstairs when our friends arrived.  The service was slow, food was boring.  We had a variety of dishes.  This place has potential but they need to bring up the food flavor and service."
2,"It's not a resort. It's an apartment complex that's been turned into a motel. Also, NO air conditioning during our stay. We were here in February so outside it was a nice cool 60 but inside the room it must have been a little over 80. I asked about air conditioning and was told that there was none and that only hot air came out if you tried turning it on. Unfortunately I found this out AFTER I tried turning the air on \""cool\"" as the thermostat said. Friendly staff but the warm room made it very uncomfortable."
2,"This airport is dirty, ridiculous, and not user friendly. What I mean by user friendly is... they need more outlets around the airport, so folks traveling for business can plug their lap tops and cell phones into for charging.  If you have a lay over here... good luck! I hope you're not late! You'll be walking a good mile before you reach your destination. As if traveling isn't already stressful. This airport adds to the stress... not to mention, you have slots machines every where- lose money quickly if you dare."
2,"It has been about 6 years since we dined at streets of New York. This time we ordered a thin and crispy pizza, a Caesar salad and bread knots. From my memory the pizza was better than I remember but not great.   However, the salad was not edible in fact we took it back.  The romain was brown and at least 4 or five days past it's prime.   They took it back without any Question and comped us a piece cheesecake in good faith.  Who ever prepared our meal should be totally embarrassed....        I don't think we will go back.."
2,slow to leave the airport. waited about 20-30 minutes for the shuttle to fill up before we left.\n\ncalling for a pick-up wasnt very helpful. they say the shuttle can arrive within a 15 minute window and then take up to an HOUR to get you to the airport. i sucked it up and just had a taxi take me. well worth it the money.\n\ndon't recommend this company unless they improve their efficiency.\n\nthey do get 2 starts because of their cheap rates. cant beat it if you don't mind waiting
2,"My wife, son and I have been going to Casey Jones now for quite some time, however this most recent time we went the quality of everything kinda seemed to jump off a steep cliff.   We went in with some friends the other night and ordered some of their newest burger the \""Juicy Lucy\"", after ordering them medium, we were rewarded with two burgers that not only seemed to be bleeding but the cheese the oozed out of them reminded me of a horror flick where the guy gets stabbed and his guts just pour out.   After taking the burgers back to the kitchen and being assured the would be taken care of, the burgers deffinately came back cooked... almost with a propane torch, talk about hockey pucks! and to top it off we didn't even get cheese in the new burgers making them not so.. Juicy ya know.   Where as before I would have preached this place to others, I can honestly say we won't be making a return trip until they get a better cook in the kitchen, didn't think it was possible to botch a burger, let alone four! this place has astounded me in the wrong direction =/"
2,"So, we received at $20 off coupon in the mail and decided to give it a try.  Let's just say...it's been some months since then and we haven't been back...the only time this place has popped up on my radar was when a co-worker was talking about their lackluster experience, too.\n\nThe service was fine.  It was the food that got me.  I ordered cheese enchilada's and my girlfriend ordered the chicken enchilada's.  Now, I expected cheese...but I didn't think I was going to have to go on a search mission to locate the tortillas. My girlfriend was equally displeased with her meal. The sangria I ordered was the only saving grace...not good enough to return, though..."
2,"Good food and decent service, but way too expensive for galbi and meat! They also have menus, new and old, that say certain dishes include dessert, but at the end when we asked for them they said that it wasn't being offered anymore. Um, okay, can you let us know before we order and/or update the menus please? I hate surprises like that when eating out when it's been spelled out. That alone knocks off a star or two. \n\nThis place would also be better to eat at alone or with two people for better value, because they give you the same amount of side dishes and seafood pancake no matter how many are at your table."
2,"Maybe I haven't been to Dos Gringos in a while, or maybe this location is just grosser than the Tempe location, but this place is dirty!  The bathroom has a bad smell coming from it and everything just seems kinda filthy.  I would never ever order food from here, if their bar area is this dirty I can only imagine how gross the kitchen is... I'm not really sure why people would hang out here when there are plenty of nicer and more fun spots in Scottsdale."
2,"I have been to this Jasons Deli several times, it has always been good.  We have ordered delivery from here several times, it has always been very delicious.  I ordered delivery from here today, and it was very forgetable.  The butter croissant that held my turkey sandwich together was really dried out, it was actually breaking as I ate it, it was that dry.  I have said before that they have the best brownies I have ever had....... Just not today. The brownies were overcooked,  one of them actually tasted burned.... they were very dry, not moist and fudgy the way they have been, when I have had them before.  Everything was disappointing about this meal...... it might be awhile before I order from here again."
2,"Outrageously priced. I get they have state of the art equipment but we couldn't afford to use any of it. While the staff is super friendly we did have one of the doctors say, after we couldn't pay to have anymore tests done, that it wouldn't be bad if we choose to put our dog down. I have no idea how a person can be so cold. Do no harm, right? Our dog only stayed 24 hours at the place and it ran us around $2000. We took our dog somewhere else that was much more affordable and they saved his life. He stayed at the other place for about a week. Same treatment and it cost us less than the one day at VCA."
2,"They have a variety of makeup lines but the selection of products was pretty scarce when I went in. The options they have for MAC, which was what I was shopping for, was really limited and most of what they did have was opened, broken, or looked really used. On top of that the customer service was terrible. The three employees working sat behind the register the entire time, no greeting or asking if I needed any help- which I did. Pretty disappointed. I'll be going to the indoor location next, hopefully there's a little more options."
2,"Decent food at an affordable price. We came to eat here around 1am on a Friday night when we first arrived in Vegas. It was pretty busy but we were seated right away. I shared the 7 oz. steak with hash browns, eggs, and toast with my boyfriend because I wasn't too hungry. The steak was OK at best - it was well done on one half and medium on the other, we asked for medium- but who's complaining for under $4? Hash browns weren't really crispy but the toast was good and the eggs were all right. Overall everything was lacking in salt; understandable given the older crowd. OK place if you're drunk or don't feel like going out to the strip but definitely not a destination eatery."
2,"Ate dinner there last week. While the food was OK, it is pretty expensive. Side dishes are an extra $11.00+. \n\nService, however, is another story. Our original servers numbered 3. The primary server was rude and arrogant, and smiling seemed beyond her capabilities. We could have tolerated this but when the busboy reached across my wife to take my plate, I was flabbergasted. I called him on it, telling him he should know better. Then the manager came by and we addressed the service issues with him. He was apologetic and changed our waitstaff so that our service was much better.\n\nMy issue... at a restaurant of this quality and price you should never have to complain to get good service. There are so many high quality restaurants available on the Las Vegas strip, why would you waste your time and money on a place that can't maintain high quality service throughout? My suggestion: find another place for dinner!!"
2,"I had dinner at Leroy Fox tonight.  This site used to house the old Hotel Charlotte.\n\nThe rennovation was very impressive.  The restaurant was very nice and it was good to see that they had incorporated parts of the old restaurant into the decor of the new restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant was packed solid.  The noise level was probably the most negative aspect of the experience.  In addition to the already deafening noise level, live music started up and it soon became impossible to hear the conversation at our table.\n\nI had the \""north\"" chicken which consisted of a breast and a wing.  It was fried and was quite good.  The chicken comes with a choice of a side item.\n\nThe menu looked quite good.  The service was also good, but I believe the kitchen got backed up with orders since the restaurant was full.\n\nI wouldn't recommend going to this restaurant, if you have hopes of having normal conversation with the people at your table."
2,"This was a very oridnary hotel, nothing especial. It did not match our expectation of a four star hotel in Vegas. We stayed there for one night, then for the same price we got another hotel that was much better."
2,"I'm giving BJ's 2 stars because the food is pretty darn good when they get the order right. I've been to this BJ's about 7 times and each time (except once) they have failed to give me what I ordered on the first try. I always come in with a group of people from work and we fax our order in before we get there. The kitchen has our order, in writing, right in front of them and still can't execute it properly. I know a veggie pizza with no cheese is a terribly complicated concept but come on! EVERY TIME! I've gotten it delivered with cheese and I've even gotten it delivered without the cheese but with sausage added! Sausage?!\n\nThe wait staff is always apologetic but the kitchen here seems to be inept."
2,"I wanted to love this restaurant and was very excited to try it. First off the place is small and they seem to have crammed as many tables in as humanly possible. While I get this from a business standpoint it is uncomfortable from a customers standpoint. My husband and I had lunch there on a monday and we could barely hear each other. We arrived early and I can only imagine how loud it gets during the noon hour. The menu was pretty limited. My husband ordered the turkey sandwich and I ordered the grilled cheese BLT. The bill for 2 sandwiches and one fountain drink was just shy of $20.00.  Service seemed a little slow, it was nearly 20 minutes from ordering to being served. When we did finally get our food it was just ok. The bacon on mine was hard and oily and had a quality as if it had been sitting out for awhile. My husband's sandwich was missing the vegetables and mustard that were indicated in the description but after waiting 20 minutes he wasn't going to send it back. Overall the place is loud and mediocre, not worthy of the price. My husband lamented that for the same price we could have gone to Capriottis and I had to agree with him."
2,All the used records here are basically beat up dollar bin records priced at $5 and up. Bad customer service too. Not coming back.
2,"As a San Francisco bay area resident, I thought it would be interesting to try Asian cuisine in Montreal's Chinatown District. Beijing came up as a highly YELP rated place. And, so we gave them a shot. \nTypical, super noisy, large open room, that has too many tables and chairs packed into it. We ordered the Chicken Soo Guy. The server described Soo Guy as a 'special Asian sauce\"" . . .UH, your typical sweet and sour sauce is not what I would call \""special\"". . . sorry, didn't like it one bit. The spicy beef had a bit of flavor, but that was only because we asked for it to come out \""SUPER\"" spicy. . . What's it like in the normal preparation?  All in all, I was not impressed with this place, and would not return."
2,"I have had OnTrac delivery many packages for me from Amazon Prime shipping. But a couple of times already they have delayed the package. The first time they were unable to delivery after I paid the extra 3.99 to have the package delivered the next day. the second time which happen today they're tracking information said \""out for delivery\"" and now it says \""UNDELIVERABLE - OTHER REASONS\"" followed by \""REDELIVER ON NEXT BUSINESS DAY\"". \n\nThe delivery man couldn't even put a legitament reason why my package could not be delivered. I am sure he felt he was running late and decided he would just take care of it the next day. Also the guy that first started to delivery packages to me would never smile even if I smiled at home and said thank you after receiving the package and he would not even say you are welcome. He would just hand me my package with a face as if he hates his job turn around and drive away. OnTrac needs to do a better job at training their delivery men on customer service skills. \n\nOverall they do a good job at delivering but I can't give them no more than two stars because compared to UPS or FedEx they just are not as good."
2,"When I went to the recently opened Panera on Friday evening, I knew we were in trouble when my young friend ordered the chicken noodle soup in a bread bowl. \""We're out of bread bowls,\"" snapped the staff member taking orders. My friend, who had been yearning for soup in a bread bowl ever since she heard about it, finally settled on a classic salad with chicken and I ordered a Thai chicken flat bread sandwich. We made our way down a narrow passage way into the table area. The decor is blah with bad lighting and none of the empty tables had been wiped off. While waiting for our food, I went to the restroom, which clearly had not been recently cleaned and a huge cylinder of toilet paper was set on top of the empty dispenser. Our food arrived and the person in charge of the kitchen must have been friends with the decorator -- blah. Granted the prices are cheaper than Paradise and the excellent Wildflower but for a lot less money we stopped at Frys on the way home and bought a La Brea Olive Oil and Rosemary round loaf and a can of Progresso chicken noodle soup. Now that was a tasty mean!"
2,"This is our go to place for great food,but not this past Thursday for Burger night.\nMy hamburger was made ahead of time,....results..dry ,cool ,tough.\nSame for the chicken ....super dry and tough...hard to swallow.\n\nIn the past hamburgers were fresh made,juicy ,served hot.Ditto per the chicken.\n\nWant to attract people to your burgers ,don't precook them the meat and let in sit in a pan.\n\nMcDonald's does that!!!\n\nTwo star for service."
2,It's really nothing special if you ask me. Unless you're a tourist who doesn't know much about the great local spots available it maybe satisfying. But asides from the decor I think the sweets are just too sweet to do anyone any good and especially not worth the price. It's just really hyped out I mean would you really buy a lollipop holder that Katy perry designed for $25? Seriously! Where do they come up with this stuff! 1 star for the fun decor and another for having a little cafe sitting eatery station.
2,"I was very disappointed with my first (and now probably only) experience at Hepatica. I came in to get half a dozen roses and it took almost half an hour, even though I was the only customer in the store. They also threw in greens with large, noticeable bug bites, without mentioning the added cost until they'd already charged me for the flowers. They even mentioned to charge my card twice, which was part of why it took so long."
2,"Last night was the second time I tried it, and still have the same problem. 1. Dough has an uncooked taste 2.they only have a red sauce for the pizza, and that just leads to much acid in my system. So I will stick to making my own our will stick to dominos who at least uses real Spinach not out of a can! So gross!"
2,"While it was nice to see vegan options, they were very limited and the assumption seemed to be that vegans really miss meat and dairy.  The food was good, but not great.  The drinks were average at best a drink will cost you more than the meal.  The staff was rushed and unpleasant; the host that was attempting to look like a secret service agent with his earplug and inappropriate suit was obnoxious and rude.  It wasn't worth the money and I probably wouldn't go back.  The noise and smoke from the casino will make any meal less enjoyable."
2,A few of us went here for lunch on a Friday and while the food was very good the service was very slow and inattentive.   \n\nI had the Blue Petit Mignon and the portion size was just right for lunch.
2,"The food is excellent, of that there is no doubt, but the service recently has completely gone down the drain.\n\nWhen we ordered from them we were told thirty minute delivery time - it took an hour. We ordered three gyros and more and only half the order was delivered. When we called to make this matter known we were met with a rude manager that could barely be bothered to fix the service issue. \n\nIt's been an hour and a half since the original order was placed and we are STILL waiting for our food. Food that was paid for in full.\n\nAbsolutely terrible customer service."
2,"I was dying for some drunken noodles, saw this place close and gave it a go.  They open at 11, I tried 1058, no one there realized how early and killed time at the dollar store, came back at 1114, still not open, started to leave and someone ran to the door to unlock it, still had her purse on so I know she just walked in the door.  I ordered takeout drunken noodles and asked how long it might be since I know they just walked in, 5 min.  I didn't know whether to be happy or scared.  How could that be ready in 5 min? It was obvious they took old stuff and just re fried it, pretty greasy and nothing tasted fresh.  I am not one to know authenticity, but I had some drunken noodles in San Diego that I am trying to find something similar here.  This is my 3rd round with the noodles and just a few other times eating Thai apart from that, but this was my worst for sure out of all of them.  I don't know Thai food real well, but I know fresh, and I didn't get anything fresh here.  Also, smelled like old lady moth balls"
2,HORRIBLE customer service. My sister and I went there after having no success at finding a brides maid dress from David's Bridal. No one greeted us. After browsing for 10 minutes I finally had to find someone to help us. I told her what we were looking for and she just brushed us off. It was a terrible experience. That alone caused them to lose our business. They get 2 stars because the dresses were beautiful and they had a decent amount of accessories to chose from. I would never suggest this place to anyone.
2,"It was okay. The server at the counter was more concerned with the call-in orders, which I guess is more common at this location due to the small amount of tables, but disappointing. It took me over 5 minutes to place my order. After being seated, with no one else there, I retrieved my order and was satisfied, but not impressed. The meal was very greasy & the rice and egg roll were so over-cooked. Won't bother again."
2,"Dropped $300 for my spouse and I to get in, it was entertaining but altogether not necessarily worth the price.  Then I discovered that we were among the handful of people who actually had to pay to get in, which was kind of a gut punch as cocktails are tremendously expensive.\n\nA very interesting stage show, some of the players interact with the audience, but the price point is very out of proportion to the actual performances.\n\nIf you're amongst the lucky majority that received a complimentary admission, go take a peek but I heavily suggest avoiding this place unless you smoke $90 cigars lit with $20 bills.\n\nThe performance art was entertaining and the interaction with the audience brought out a \""third dimension\"" to the show.  Think of well-dressed street performers, a little bit of \""Tap Dogs\"", a little \""Blue Man Group\""-ish.\n\nI don't want to say it's a rip, but it's certainly priced for the Romanovs and not exactly worth the tremendous entry fee, especially when most of the club seemed as if they were there on comps.\n\nFeeling a little jaded and, well, financially leeched.\n\nIt's a stage show and then a standard night club. If you morphed the marquee with a sprinkle of cabaret and a very light touch of Cirque du Soleil, drop $300 for a couple, there you have rose rabbit lie."
2,"I like the ambiance and feel of Grassroots - however, the cook has a bit of an attitude. \nWhen I explained this was the second time I had come in and they were out of what I  wanted to order he said because everything is fresh. Ok-I can appreciate and love that! However, I was asking for a baked potato. How can you be out of baked potatoes? That seems pretty standard. He then went on to say they are doing pretty well.....what?? How about just apologizing for not being able to accommodate your customer. Lose the attitude.  Food is par - I would recommend this place for drinks only."
2,"Stopped going to the Sunset road location in Las Vegas about a a year ago because food was not good anymore. When the new one opened up on Stephanie St In Henderson, we'd thought we'd give it one more shot. BIG MISTAKE! Steaks were not cooked as ordered, even when cooked a second time. Service wasn't the best either. Only thing good was the bread & salmon. Big disappointment Outback....."
2,"Really disappointing. Dropped by here on a Friday night with my wife hoping for a good dinner but all we got was marginally decent food that was very pricey.\n\nCocktails were 10 dollars each, not bad, but didn't really taste too good. nothing special.\n\nServers were unpolished. Felt like they were all newly hired.\n\nFood was not that good. New York Strip Steak was a small portion. Tasted all right, but not nearly enough for a young man. Asked for medium rare but got it medium. Wife ordered medium sandwich but got rare. Had to send it back (after waiting for 10 minutes). \n\nOverall, came out to 40 a pop, but was a lackluster meal."
2,"I went here once because one of the Pitt clubs was doing a fundraiser here, and I'm not sure if it was just this location, but I wasn't impressed. \n\nI got a pumpernickel bagel with plain cream cheese. The bagel was thin and pretty bland. There was barely any cream cheese on there, and what WAS there was poorly spread around. \n\nThe location is good and it's cheap, but you'd have better luck going to Einstein's bagels, or even getting a Panera bagel- instead."
2,"OK we all know about the merchandise. Looks expensive, is expensive and everyone likes it.... \nMy problem was with the customer service this time. I have to admit, I have gone to this shop before and it was just fine, but this one time, no. There was a sign at the door which said 40% off one men's item, not specification on anything else. (for father's day) So I went and picked up a shirt and proceeded to pay. I waited and then when it was my turn walked up. Then I was told that the item I picked is not included in the promo being it is new. I then said that I didn't want it. The cashier then said something, not sure if to the person next to her or to her headset, and then said they will honor it. During the whole transaction the person made no eye contact, when she talked I didn't know if it was to me or to the headset. No greeting, no thank you nothing. I was the one who said thank. It looked like they were doing ME a favor by selling me the shirt!!!\nTSA agents are more friendly and courteous."
2,"While there are, admittedly, fewer tourists down this end of the royal mile, its still clear that the World's End pub is a tourist orientated place looking to cash in on its varied and often grousome and scary past. \n\nBasically, this place is over priced and so geared to recieving people who are only visiting the city, it seems to forget about us locals. My friends and I were slightly put off by the fact the bar staff asked if we were tourists before moving to another group who were hwen we answered no. Kind of like we had said 'No, we arent tourists, but we are willing to wait until you have served the millions who are.' Not a good experience.\n\nHowever, once we had been served, we had a pleasent time - but I wont be back."
2,"I understand why people like this place.  Their portions are huge and the plate presentations are pretty cool. \n\nThey almost always have a long wait which takes away from the quality of service.  Plus, their food is greasy and not very fresh tasting.  They also don't have good healthy options on their menu.\n\nHowever, I'm sure most people who are going out to eat in Las Vegas aren't looking for healthy meals so I get why people flock to this spot."
2,"This is probably one place that is a hit or miss for me. Visiting from Chicago, I was excited to see how Asian fare would be in comparison. Satay has a clean and cozy ambiance to it when you walk in. I came with a big group and unfortunately that probably contributed to my overall experience here. We attempted to wait for  everyone's dishes to come out but that was a bad idea. All of our food got cold because it took a good 50 min for everyone's dishes to come out after the first person getting theirs. Eventually we stopped waiting but all those who waited already had cold dishes in front of them.\n\nAside from that, my food and the flavors itself was not really anything out of the ordinary. I ordered chicken pad thai, a pretty basic and popular dish that really cant go wrong. Mine came out pretty bland unfortunately. I don't really see myself coming back here on my next visit unless its for happy hour or something."
2,Ok. The two stars are because the floors had many sticky diseases on it. WTF? Don't they clean the floors? But the bartenders did make me forget about the nastiness with the strong and cheap drinks. That was the only reason it didn't get one star. I'd go back if I'm in Champaign again.
2,"Update - finally went to the new Lincoln Square Mall location. The decor is just awful, which is sad considering how nice the old place was. Cramped seating, depressing track lighting, drop ceilings, weird art right behind your seats so you keep bumping into it. They were out of the first two things I ordered (one was a special, so fine, but out of a basic bread-based app?)\n\nPasta took forever to come out, and my friend's was so cold that the cream sauce had congealed. Sigh."
2,"Made a reservation through open table for a party of 6 during Restaraunt week.  Between our party we had a combination of the appetizer sampler for 2 (fish tacos, bacon wrapped bacon & eggs, chicken pot pie nuggets) all were good, the chicken pot pie nuggets were lacking something in flavor , maybe salt? For entrees we had the crispy fried game hen and shrimp and grits while the other half of our party ordered the niman skirt steak, again all were ok, nothing memorable with the exception of the bacon wrapped bacon & egg appetizer.   About midway through our meal, we finally received our sides ( that we had to ask about) of zucchini and mac and cheese.  The dessert options included freshly baked cookies and milk or trio of sorbets.  The cookies were good, again nothing I couldn't have baked in my own oven at home.  When our check came we were surprised to see all the extra fees we were not aware of: restaurant week charity donation as well as the appetizer upcharge.  I've been doing research on the restaurant week menus and never noticed an upcharge fee on the online menu, the physical menu nor were we told at the time of order, they also changed the price from the website from $40 to $50.  Should've chose a different restaurant for RW or ordered a la carte from the menu.  Will probably not be returning or recommending. Jameson mule was pretty good though"
2,"We went to Rustic Cafe today for breakfast because we saw that it had a 4 star rating.  Normally, yelpers are right in their assessments of restaurants.  This, hoewever, was not the case.  My hubby and I both got omelettes.  They were both filled with stuff, but quite greasy.  The hasbrowns on my hubby's plate were cold.  We were both frankly quite underwhelmed by this place.  The price point was good.  I am a stickler for tasty OJ at a breakfast place, thus I am taking a star away for the sole reason that the OJ was obviously from concentrate.  I don't even drink OJ from concentrate at home.  Why would I pay $3 for it?"
2,"Underwhelming.\n\nThe M is a sleek place and everything is so beautifully done.  All of their eateries are so promising, but unfortunately always fail to deliver.  The layout and design of Terzetto is gorgeous and looks like something you'd find further North on the Strip.  Their menu is not uber creative, but it has the steakhouse staples.  \n\nI went with a party of seven and the service was fantastic.  Our server was timely, attentive and helpful (granted, the place wasn't exactly packed).  The service was the best part of the night.\n\nThe food, however, was merely underwhelming.  The steaks were cooked appropriately, but lacked any real beef flavor and the all-important char.  Sure, I'm not paying $50+ for a bone-in rib eye (like at Prime or Carnevino), but in order to compete in this economy and market, it should still taste as good.  The sides were good, but not very memorable.\n\nTerzetto is a value, in that prices are below what you'd find at the better steakhouses.  Unfortunately, you get what you pay for and this place is underwhelming."
2,"I want Tom's to be better... but it isn't.  The place has a cool \""Cheers\"" vibe, the service is excellent, but...\n\nI ordered a grilled cheese.  The simplest thing on the menu, right?  WRONG!  \n\nThose of you who are grilled cheese experts, like I am** will understand when I say: there was no butter on the bread and there was only one paltry slice of american cheese.  Seriously.  At least give me some cheese for my grilled cheese sandwich.  It's even in the title!\n\nI am sure that Tom's has more options for non-carnivores on their huge menu, but I was in a hurry and didn't have time to peruse the menu at length or concoct a special order.\n\nThe worst part?  My sub-par grilled cheese, fries, and iced tea came to $12!!!  Come on!  They put a piece of individually wrapped cheese between two dry pieces of toast!\n\nAt least the service was good.\n\n**side note: I really wish more restaurants would get on the options for vegetarians bandwagon.  No, I do not want iceberg lettuce on a plate with italian dressing, thank you."
2,"Wow did this place suck. I came here for lunch with a work collesfur. I am from out of town but this was the closest place and it did nothing for me. Dirty interior, poor service. I just got a chicken salad and it was not memorable."
2,"I've been here a few times because it's close to my job.  The lady that works in the front is really nice but the food is just alright.  I've never had a major complaint but today my food was not good.  I ordered shrimp fried rice for lunch and it's different, maybe a new cook or they change the oil.  It smells really good but has no taste whatsover.  Even after adding soy sauce and pepper it's unedible.  I'm so surprised because I love fried rice and who can mess that up.  Now I have to find something else to eat for lunch."
2,"Having been told just yesterday about Batch and the fact that they make different types of fougasse breads, I raced over today to try them out.  I am a sucker for great fougasse, and try them out whenever I see them at a bakery.  The trouble is, they are not always so good!  Alas, the Madison fougasse lived up to my fears. Having created something more like a pizza crust in the shape of a pretzel, the Batch Bakehouse would be better advised to stick with less ambitious treats, like the sinful \""Hello Dolly\"" 7-layer bar...  Though, of course, I DID manage to consume this  roasted garlic/sundried tomato/rosemary pretzel in disguise, it was heavy and way too chewy, not achieving the standard of firm exterior but soft interior."
2,"Fuel Pizza (uptown) Gets 1 star for being in uptown Charlotte' and another star for good customer service. Too bad the pizza is bland and flavorless, the side salad is colorful but lacks a good dressing to at least put it over the top. I thought the combos were too expensive for a pizza so flavorless and unexciting. \n\nYou can get a totally awesome tasting, HUGE, super slice of pizza for $6.50. Here you'll pay almost $8.00 for a drink, salad, and a decent size slice. I would say go to Sabarro's instead. You'll pay just a little more, but your meal will taste waaaay better. \n\nThe decor is interesting, but looks unfinished. The restrooms are clean, but they look nasty, with graffiti and poorly placed bathroom fixtures. I would think a \""theme restaurant\""  located in the heart of Uptown Charlotte would have a better looking design. Its a mess here. Glad I don't own this restaurant, I would be embarrassed to have it in my portfolio."
2,Room was ok...nothing special. Staff was nice. Parking garage was very spooky! Pools were not impressive to me. There is an adult store right across the street....weird & creepy. Very convenient location but I won't stay here again.
2,For starters the service was great but slow. Waitress was very friendly and the executive chef discounted our overall bill because we waited over 45 minutes for our lunch entr\u00e9es.  The pop and lemonade tasted dirty. I sent back a total of three drinks and stuck with water. The chips and salsa were decent. I ordered beef and chicken fajitas. Beef tasted like teriyaki and the chicken was dry. Didn't really enjoy the overall taste of the beef and chicken combo. Most likely won't be going back.
2,"This is not an experience for a tourist.  It's for people with a kitchen.  Walking around, I noticed very few stalls offering samples, and there was next to nothing in the way of ready-to-eat food like you see at many other markets.  Maybe I'm spoiled because Pike Place is my market.\n\nAlso, surprisingly small.  I figured this is the South, and the warmer climates produce a greater variety of food year-round.  It's held in a relatively small parking lot next to Old Town."
2,"After so much initial Yelp praise, I decided to drop into Nourish to give it a shot. I'm not a vegetarian or vegan or glucose or lactose free, but I am a pretty healthy eater and enjoy delicious food that also happens to be good for you. Nourish seemed like it fit a great need for its niche -- the only similar place I can think of is True Food -- but it fell flat. For starters, it's a good thing they have flavored waters, because their regular water tasted funky. Salads are very tasty but super small - appetizer portions at entree prices. Sandwiches are a much better value, but you can find better at many other places. The sweet potato fries aren't bad, for being \""air fried.\"" Without that caveat, head-to-head against real fries, not so much (and, come on, isn't ordering sweet potato fries over regular ones already being good enough?!). I will say that the dipping sauce that accompanies the fries is delicious! The setting is very casual and comfortable, and the service was great, but it's the food that brings someone back for a second time...and I can't say I plan on returning."
2,"My husband had the new 5-cheese Mac and Cheese with chicken. Looked pretty good and he said it was tasty.\n\nI however had the tried-and-true baby back ribs. Awful! Very dry to the point the meat was very cooked down and the ends were all but burned. They didn't even try to cover it up with globs of bbq sauce, which is a common stunt. Very BLEH... Won't ever get the ribs there again and highly dis-recommend them from others. Ew."
2,"I really wanted to like this place because I have a soft spot for diners and dives (not so much drive ins). And this place has the traditional diner set up on the inside located in an area of town (the Melrose) that I'm really rooting for to turn into something truly special (it's already pretty cool). But, I just didn't like the food. I ordered the breakfast sandwich which was eggs, sausage and cheese on a croissant. The croissant was ehhh ok. The eggs/sausage/cheese was greasy and not very flavorful. It came with a side of potatoes which were also pretty m'eh. I'll give this one another shot at some point."
2,Wait staff and service was good.  My steak was excellent (Tabasco peppered Kobe flank). My friends duck was mediocre and the fat was not rendered. We didn't have time to wait for a fix so she just ate it.  The sides with it were good. The worst part of the experience was the fact that they charged $5 for hot water. 35 for mediocre duck and 40 for a steak.  I find charging for hot water ridiculous.
2,This store is like a Mega store. Maybe they are a little bit over they head because sadly the meats are not the best. They have meat on sale for 3 and 4 bucks and its coloring is brown to black. Meat should be Red. I will shop here but I will stay away from the meat. If you can get pass that the store is really ok.
2,"Just had the worst experience ever at Picture People in Henderson Nevada. The white background of my photos show the scuff marks of the backdrop, they did a shoddy job of cropping, only allowed me a certain number of photos to go on my disk (nowhere in writing does it say I only get \""x\"" number of photos), refused to give me a price sheet because \""we just know the price of and tell customers the price\"", and above all refused to accept my coupon for $20 off a $100 purchase because they said it excluded the CD...umm... once again nowhere in writing does it say \""excludes the photo CD\""! The best part is the manager was the individual I was dealing with!! If it werent for the fact that my husband very nicely asked me to just woosah the situation I would have flipped out....Now I am just looking at the photos crying. I am definitely going to tell everyone I know not to waste their money.... 100% satisfaction guarantee my butt!   \n\nI gave them 2 stars because Portia was an amazing photographer and was very interactive and animated with my 3 month old to get her to smile"
2,"Once again the Mexican restaurant in Stations casinos has changed hands. No longer Guadalajara, but Cabo now.\n\nMy fiance and I decided to stop in here late on Friday night after I got off work. I really wanted a margarita to celebrate the completion of my training. \n\nWe waited... A lot. We waited for the hostess to show up. We waited for chips. We waited for drinks... Lots of waiting.... I waited for a water I ordered that never came. So I drank my fiance's. We were never asked if we wanted a refill of our chip basket.\n\nThe poor girl serving us seemed frazzled. The busboy was of very little help.\n\nThe food was mediocre. My margarita was the star of the night. It was very good and blended well. They did honor the check-in policy and we got sopapillas, which we took to go.\n\nI don't know why Stations Casinos keep changing their restaurants... But this change was not for the better. The only thing I'd come back for is another raspberry margarita."
2,"Service is great, drinks are good, food is only ok. Stuffed peppers and dates are the best thing there. However, the entire restaurant smells like an old dish rag. It makes me wonder how clean things are..."
2,"Beer is ok.\n\nFood...meh.\n\nAfter watching more restaurant rescue shows than are healthy I should have learned a long time ago that any place with a menu the size of a phone book does mediocre food at best.  BJs is no exception to this rule.\n\nThe menu appeared to be heavy on pizza like products so I figured going that direction was the best bet...so I ordered a flat bread.  It was supposed to have tomatoes, cheese and sausage.  Tomatoes, yes.  Cheese, yes.  Sausage...not so much.  There were a few (and I mean a few, sausage piece like substance on the flat bread, but I wouldn't say it was enough to qualify as saying the flat bread had sausage.\n\nAs for the bread part of the flat bread it was crispy in parts and soggy in parts.  Overall not a good effort.\n\nSo assuming you can't make the most prominent thing on your menu (pizza like products) well it is fair to assume that the products on the other 90 pages of the menu (yes an exaggeration...its probably only 12 pages long) are, in all likelihood, mediocre also."
2,"We dined the last night of restaurant week(which we didn't know until we arrived). The menu was very limited, the appetizer of pork bellies(my husband's) was so greasy he couldn't eat it, his entree was cod and very bland. My entree, sea bass was overcooked and tasted bland and not very fresh.  The only part of the meal that we liked was the dessert.\n\nThis was our first time here for my birthday and was very disappointed considering all the great reviews.  Was this any off night, maybe but will probably not go back. One positive was our waiter-very knowledgable and friendly."
2,"I spent a good three hours studying. Besides having a great facility for wifi, seating, and noise level, the service could use a lot of work. If you're in the service industry, people who apply for this jobs should be mindful that they will be working with people. In other words, they can be more friendly and cheerful no matter how difficult it may be. Other than that, I did enjoy my peach green tea lemonade."
2,"The food is good, but how hard it is to make good Italian food - after all, even the O Garden can get that right. But this place believes itself to be \""exceptional Italian food\"" (which is obvious from the exorbitant prices they charge) and it is not even close. No originality, just another offering of the same tired old foods that every other place is making. \n\nThis is a prime example of what has become a scourge in Vegas eateries of late - high cost, low atmosphere, mediocre cuisine offerings - where people with more money that taste go because they know nothing more about food except the belief that \""the more it costs, the better it must be\"".\n\nOh and then there was the WORST greeting any bartender could EVER utter:   \""I'll be with you in a minute!\""   Could I mean any less to them? If I wasn't meeting somebody, I would have walked out."
2,"Bad experience during my last visit. Found few strands of hair in chicken curry, posted picture. Naan bread was really flat and dry. Not much chicken in curry . Lot of variety and some other food was good. Expensive compared to other buffets. Not sure if I will come back"
2,"This place was a bit of a disappointment. Sure, it's a nice little restaurant in St. Mark's Square at the Venetian, the ambiance in nice, but the experience was not so good.\n\nService was slow and spotty. When we were seated, the waitress told us she was sending out water. Said water didn't arrive until we had received our meals and drinks, and only after we asked our waitress about it again. When we were offered parmesan on our food, the man who asked just walked away and vanished. We had to flag down or waitress to get it, who was noticeably absent throughout the evening. She then proceeded to absent-mindedly drop a huge chunk of cheese on the table, only to leave it there throughout the meal.\n\nFood was alright and came out very quickly, though it was almost too quickly, as if it had already been prepared before we ordered it. \n\nAfter the whole experience, I would probably not come back. There are many other restaurants nearby to choose from (it is Vegas, after all)."
2,Arrowheads Applebee's is much more enjoyable! Went to karaoke last night an it was so horrible. The dj and his crew sang most of the songs :/ there were some families after 11... I thought there had to be an age limit to be in the bar after 10? There were some annoying high school girls screaming spice girls... Help me!!!!
2,"This place does have great yogurt, especially The oatmeal cookie which is by far the best. Their service model though is extremely frustrating since they give out samples instead of having sample cups available. i waited for over 5 minutes to get one sample from the guy working who seemed less than interested in helping and barely said hi. No surprise when he rang me up and told me the price and that was it. A thank you or have a good day would have been way too much effort on his part.\n\nDefinitely wont go back to this location, very disappointed"
2,"I've been to this place several times and LOVED it!! BUT.. this time; not so much! The only person that speaks english was not there, so trying to communicate with anyone was a challenge. I have always asked for \""Andy\"" cause he does such a good job, but this time he was busy, so I got one of the ladies. The therapists were chatting with each other, and it was very distractive. The lady I had seemed very rushed and bothered. Not the best experience this time.. After my massage I walked back to the restroom and noticed a man being ushered in to a private room in the back with a door.. I thought this was weird and asked myself \""Why does he get a private room and my friend and I were out in the open and had to listen to all the distracting noises. I really hope nothing illegal is being done.. I don't condone this behavior and am not 100% decided if I will be returning."
2,"Not impressed. I was with a large group, so that might have been that. I was late and everyone else had already ordered. The server acknowledged me as the straggler or so I thought. I asked for a drink menu and a regular menu and he gave me the drink menu and he came back to the other end of the table a couple times leaving me still drink-less. After that he didn't ask about food and one of the guys in my party went up to him to tell him I was still looking to order. Everyone else received their food before I even ordered. I should have just given up right there, but I was starving. I ordered the apocalypse sow with salad. Not as good as I expected. I felt it was dry and lacking flavor. The aoli was just plopped in the middle. The meat was crumbling and I had to just eat it with a knife and fork. Should have just got the soup."
2,"2 stars for frozen hot chocolate... yummm\nWaiting time to be seated 30 mins\nWater to be delivered at your table 15 mins\nAnother 15 mins wait to take your orders\n41 minutes wait for the food :( \nFood was so-so, not bad, not that good either.\n\nI only want the frozen hot choco, so I'll just order at the window next time."
2,"I stayed at the Rio with a conference in July. It was dirty, musty, mildewed, the pool was closed a lot during normal hours of operation, the food was okay. The game floor was run-down, dirty, stinky (like someone crapped their pants-all the time). The elevators were often crowded and we had to wait in a mob to get on an elevator. There were always long lines at reception and concierge. We were there on weekdays. The shuttle services was poor - always waiting for the second or third shuttle to pick us up from the strip to come back. A cab would've been easier and worth the money. We had a great rate but it was similar to better kept hotels on the strip.  I would not ever stay there again with all of the other options in Vegas. I only stayed because of the conference or I would've changed hotels after the first night."
2,"Maybe because it's a new location they have not got the kinks worked out yet.  We sat in the bar area.  The server took almost 30 mins to come back to take our order after we told him we wanted to order food.  We shared the general Li's dish and asked them to split it.  They just brought  an extra plate.  That's okay, but actually placing the meal on two separate plates would have been a nice extra step and a lot less messy for us.  They were a little stingy with the rice, too.  Not really enough for the rest of the ingredients to balance out the soy sauce, so it turned out too salty.  Tip: ask for extra rice."
2,So so food. Had kung pao chicken and its just like every other strip mall Chinese joint around here. Lots of celery in the food. Wife had cashew chicken and it looked about the same. Actually if it wasn't for the nuts you couldn't tell them apart by looking at them.
2,"lame routines and mediocre dancing. I'm sure dancing topless was their aim to distract viewers from noticing the sub par dancing. Holly never speaks a word, and this black chick and white dude do all the singin and talking.  For 113 the view would be pretty good, but for 85 the view is hardly worth going for.  Still 113 for dancing tits is debatable. I couldn't  understand why everyone was so pumped to see this show, and even more so when holly showed her boobs, or someone did something sexy.  sorry fake boobs and small b cups just didn't impress me.  save your money go see La Reve at the wynn.. amazing just like the wynn ;)"
2,"I am a HUGE Pottery Barn fan. HUGE! Their furniture pieces are timeless and made to last. You won't find veneer wood here. Solid heavy pieces that are made to last. My tester; go up to any piece and start shaking it, if it moves so should you to the next item. I like my furniture sturdy, unbreakable. \n\nSo with that being said, why a 2 star here for this store in particular? The service! Actually the store manager truth be told. It's like the case of Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman. Yes I dress pretty \""comfortable\"" on weekends and I could be mistaken for a 15 year old without a job, but I am still a customer. A customer who just moved in a new house and needs to fill up his house slowly.  So when I frequently get snubbed for more affluent looking customers, I just  peruse the floor samples and get what I want at Pottery Barn Henderson or online. \n\nIn my profession, don't judge a book by it's cover. Treat everyone like family and they will treat you like family."
2,"Decided to give this place a try - there were only 2 other customers inside\nThe wait staff was very attentive and pleasant  - clean restaurant\nThe Clam Chowder was very good - I'll give them that....\nHowever, my Angel Hair pasta with Marinara sauce was too bland.\nAs I was trying to mix my pasta and sauce I noticed that there was way to much water in the bottom of my bowl. All the water should have been drained from the pot the pasta was boiling in because it just results in a bowl of watery yucky pasta!!!!!\nI was not pleased at all and returned my dish....\nMy kid's cheese pizza was OK but not outstanding.\nMy main concern is that the waiter made my situation known to the owner  (sure looked like the owner) and not once did he come up to me to  apologize or say anything. He had the opportunity as there were only 5 customers inside and that's including my daughter and I. \nThey did take the dish off my bill and the owner did say Bye as I was leaving but by him not personally addressing the issue at hand with me it just left me with a  \""I don't care to come back\"" feeling."
2,"Went to ditka's.... It was good. The food was wonderful.  Shrimp cocktail was perfect. Pork chop was wonderful. Burgers were great. Dessert tasty.  The chef is totally on the ball... \nUnfortunately our waiter was horrible. One of our party arrived first, waited 10 min before approached! Beverages took forever, a beer was ordered 10 min later it arrived. Had to ask for bread. Waited 10-15 min to give dinner order. Had to ask for beverage refills. Gave the order he wrote it down.... Then we added a salad, which he did not write down....you guessed it, salad never came. The good thing was we weren't charged for it. \nThank goodness the meal was comped.... I would have been totally pissed if I had to pay the $100.25 bill with the waiter we had. \nWhen your in an upscale restaurant you should NEVER have to ask for anything. (Period) no excuses.\nGood food, bad waiter. Would give 2.5 if possible for the food only.\nTake a chance... Eat in the bar area, dinner specials inn bar not available in dining room. My family usually eats in the bar and they say the waitstaff is great in the bar."
2,"It's bit overrated- definitely not the best show I've seen on the strip. So so jokes, stage and overall is too outdated, I was a bored out of my mind about half way into the show... if you are seeing only one show on your trip to sin city, think twice; but if you get comp for the ticket, go for some loud beat and play the giant beach balls at the end!"
2,"I've eaten at Hubbard Ave Diner many times.  Great pie, good service, average food, really inconsistent execution by the kitchen.  If they aren't busy, you've got a good chance to have your order arrive correct (as in get what you ordered as you ordered it) and hot.  If they are busy, forget it.  They really need to have an expediter in the kitchen."
2,"So, most of my reviews are going to be based on the quality and taste of the food.  I don't find that I experience really bad service or great service that often, most is satisfactory.  \nOn with the review.  The bread that they bring at the begining was pretty delicious, but sad when that was the best part of the meal.  Most of us had pasta, mine was extremely bland (I had the creamy garlic chicken)  I had to add a lot of salt and I never salt anything.  My fiance had the fresh tomato mozzarella pasta and it was terribly bland also, the tomatoes hardly even had taste.  The only thing in our group of six that seemed to be good was the chopped gorganzola salad. \nI would much rather support a local restaurant than a chain, but I would have to say that I would rather eat at Olive Garden than here."
2,"My first time there last weekend and let's just say it wasn't the best first experience.  I placed my order and it took quite awhile to get it.  Then we got our food and my order was completely wrong.  By the time they made another and brought it out everyone else was done with their food and I had to get mine to go.  The waitress took the check off the table, I was assuming they were going to give some sort of discount being as I had to take my breakfast to go now, but nope, she came back and there was no offer or mention of my inconvenience.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the food I did get to eat was good, but I won't be going back.  If a restaurant screws up and you miss enjoying your meal with your table, they needed to offer something for the inconvenience."
2,"I hate wet burritos. It totally defeats the point of a burrito. They insisted on running my unfinished burrito through an oven and then informed me they couldn't add anything else to it unless they put it on top. Forget that, I almost just walked away. I regretted not doing so once I found out my crappy chicken, rice and cheese only burrito was going to cost me $12."
2,"We went for breakfast here while on vacation, although I didn't pick the place, I had heard good things but found it to be ok (I prefer to visit non-chains). It reminds me of any other breakfast at any other diner that isn't really memorable or great. I had the eggs benedict but whatever they called the version with avocado. It was ok, a nice change from regular eggs benedict but not as good as the menu seemed to make it out to be. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their food just fine (they got salads or some skillet things). \n\nOverall the wait wasn't too bad, I didn't care for unattended children running around and the service could've been better (I waited forever before I got my coffee, and I'm not happy until I've had my coffee fix). I'd say its ok, but I don't plan on ever going back."
2,"I came with high expectations to this place of of a recommendation and was really not impressed. I came in after the dinner rush to place a take out order. The staff was pretty friendly but they didn't seem all that excited to be at their job. As for the location, there is both indoor and outdoor  seating which is nice. \n\nI got two veggie sandwiches to go for my vegan sister and I. As a vegan in-training, I made sure to ask for dressing on the side and no cheese and came home to find both on the side salads. I also found a hair in my salad which was a bit unappetizing. The sandwich itself was alright... a little soggy but pretty tasty. \n\nI think I will come back and give it another try if I am in the area."
2,"Be prepared to drop some serious cash here at the Shoppes. (I'm wondering myself why they added an 'e' in shoppes - maybe for that added flavor of pretention, haha). They definitely don't mess around here with high-end shops like Barney's New York, Coach, and Burberry just to name a few. Built just across the street from the Wynn Hotel and their own bougie shops, I'm sure they aim to cater to that same crowd. \n\nMy friends and I walked into Michael Kors and there was a purse that caught her eye. She picks it up and then asked an associate how much it was. He casually replies, \""That one is $1400.\"" Upon hearing this, she immediately returned the purse to the display, looks at us, says \""Okay,\"" and walks away from the bag. With our incomes, we can only dream about getting the stuff here. Unless you can afford all the things here and can actually purchase them - that seems like a lot more fun!\n\nNothing special about the decor of the Shoppes. But, there is one thing worthy of note, a waterfall that is two-stories high at the center of the mall. Be prepared to see lots of tourists taking pictures. And hey, why not take one yourself? \n\nFor the hard-working middle class schmo and \""normal\"" crowds, I recommend the Miracle Mile shops or Fashion Show Mall. I'm sure once the blazing summer heat kicks in, people will use this mall as an air-conditioned excuse to stay off the strip."
2,Went on a weekend morning more than a year ago. It says something that I still remember the details of my visit. They were just unorganized. Possibly overwhelmed. Lady who I think was the owner was just barking orders. Maybe we should have waited for a table outside for a more peaceful dining experience...
2,"This last time was my second time to eat at the Parlor, wanted my boyfriend and my brother to try it, I had gone there for lunch one other time and liked it, I think it was around opening week.  IDK what happened to but the service was BAD! the food was JUST OKAY, the people who worked there were \""really\"" cool. the attitude smelled so bad, wait maybe it was the food? i will never return to the parlor again it is over glamourized pizza served with a bad attitde! you can get better at NYPD or PIzzano's if you are looking for pizza in that area!"
2,"Guy who did my nails was rude and I got a gel manicure that went into my cuticles and onto the skin on several nails. Very messy. Maybe I had a bad manicurist, but I felt the staff was rude to most people who walked in the door. Won't be back."
2,"Well, if your address isn't correct and you don't pick up the phone to help with directions you can't expect a great customer response...  Was really looking forward to eating here, now not so sure."
2,"Definitely overly hyped!\n\nTheir bread is good, but their meat is poor, they barely put anything in between the slices of their bread! I felt like I just paid for their bread. I waited in line for 25minutes for the sandwiches with high expectations. Instead, I was still hungry after eating the sandwich and grumpty for having to wait that long for something not so amazing. What was I thinking?!\n\nI'm giving them two stars for their soft, delicious bread. However, if you don't like your bread being a little oily, you may not like it. You can definitely get better sandwiches at other local sandwich shops in Vegas. Definitely over hyped. You can definitely go if the line is short, but honestly don't wait in line. There are SOO many other places to eat in Vegas."
2,"I like to think of Petal has \""hit or miss.\""  Lately it has been a miss.  I feel like I can try on like 6-10 things and nothing will work- it won't fit right, too see through, etc.\n\nAlso, every time I am in there I feel rushed in the dressing room.  They are constantly trying to take things out (I assume for shoplifting reasons).  But I hate feeling so rushed."
2,"My mouth has a weird aftertaste. It could of been the cockroach that scurried across the floor and ended up in my burger. Free wings on Monday night football. That's cool. \nCheap beer. They raised over$1,000 for a nonprofit one night for local teens in need of help. That's cool. We are in Wickenburg"
2,"I'm not a big fan of this particular location.  Just as a background, I've been a Chase customer and have 2 active accounts with them.  I went in trying to cash a larger check and the new accounts specialist was just down my back trying to convince me to open another account.  I nearly felt forced to give my number, so I gave it to him quickly in hopes he wouldn't hear one of the numbers.  Apparently, it wasn't quick enough because he literally called me for 2 weeks straight and left me a voice mail to come back in and open that new account.  Also, while at the teller... I asked about a sign I saw on the window at the front.  It was some feature where you can scan your check and deposit it via phone.  I asked the teller if this was something that was available for the Blackberry.  Instead of knowing the answer, the teller had to search for the answer.  I guess that's good that she didn't just BS me with an answer, but at the same time; I feel as if that is something that she should have known.  My last complaint:  After the first set of doors is a room where there is 1 atm.  Under the atm... an overflowing plastic trash can that looks as if it has been neglected to days.  Not a good first impression, especially to those who are non Chase customers that are considering opening a new account."
2,"searched this place before we go.went to this place with a friend.the food was ok service was ok,the place is ekkkkkkkkk... I would not go back again !!!"
2,"Really don't like the concept of waiting in line to order. No greeter but the bartender tried to help. The cashier was too busy discussing how much money they made in tips to wait on us, but finally asked us what we wanted. Then I don't get a reciept and am told to go to table ??? Don't talk to me or I'll forget the number! The chairs are sooo tall I almost have to jump to get on it.... the burger was under cooked - but better than overcooked. And the whole concept is too expensive if I have to wait in a line to order. Just disapointed...."
2,Eh pizza is alright. Not a crazy fan of but it could also be because they took AN HOUR to deliver when we are 5 mins away.
2,"I have been frustrated more and more with Danny's Family over the years.  The constant up-selling is out of control.  I brought in a new car (2K) miles on it and they asked if I wanted a buff & wax.  I told them it was brand new and the sales guy still persisted.  Then of course the windshield chip guys.  I have a tiny, and I'm talking tiny, crack in the windshield and the rep basically said that if I didn't get that fixed today the entire windshield might completely shatter while I'm driving.  Serious?  The detail on the washing is good, but the up front selling is ridiculous!  I just wish there was a better alternative, but it seems like this is par for the course with car wash establishments.  Oh well...."
2,"Chips and salsa were good but that's where it ended. Dry meat on my tacos, my wife had a really bad salad. Chicken coated with sauce that was more like Italian sauce than anything Mexican."
2,"I have to say St Rose Pediactrics is wearing super thin on me. Appointment time was 11:00am. 45 minutes after we are put in a room. 25 minutes later a doctor still has not come in. It's about time to scale back the number of clients and/or appointments you take. Look, I've even had enough time to write this review AFTER reading all the others."
2,"Food was perfect. i got the galbi burger with house kim chi on the side. why the bad review? we came in with a group of 12+ we called in they accommodated us and had a warm welcome. So still why the terrible review...its courtesy especially when eating with people you havent seen in quite some time to wait for all the food to arrive at the table to begin chowing...2 of our parties food took 30 minutes later than everyone else's to come out. appetizers came in too fast which were fantastic (sweet potato fries) huge gap in between that and the entree. the waitress kept telling us the kitchen was behind and that the burger was being made. 10 minutes later she told us that they forgot the order. finally after 30 minutes the burger comes out. i dont care how many orders you have, the next burger should have been ours but no...we watched tables come in and sit down and get their food faster.\n\nwhen coming to visit vegas, my friend told me this place was great and he wanted to try it. sadly i was a little disappointed not by the food. but its not always bad food that ruins the experience."
2,"First off, I had a blast cause I was able to spend some quality time with my mom and son, which a rare lately  due to my crazy work schedule, with that said I was very very very disappointed in the customer service or just service in general.  The place is very cute and cool, tons of tv's with tons of sports to watch.  Nice and cool inside, and there wasn't many people when we went.  Our server was not good at all.  Kept forgetting about us.  Forgetting to bring us things, small or big, she couldn't get it together.  Now, just because I myself am a server and work in a restaurant doesn't mean I'm picking on her.  She herself said to me 'am I ignoring you guys alot tonight?' ummmmmmmmm yeah!!!!!!!!! \n\nThe little game area was ok, although the machines kept taking my money and I  had to keep getting someone to fix it.  Annoying!  \n\nFood was ok too.  Loved the house salad.  My pizza kinda sucked, was suppose to be thick crust and was thin.  We had to ask three times for more dressing.  My mom ordered a wheat beer and she was brought ??? well it wasnt  wheat beer, so she ordered something else.  Ten minutes later, still no beer.  I finally had to get up fine the server and ask her to get the beer........now!\n\nWe had fun just being together and watching the game and my son play.  But, I wont be going back anytime soon. :("
2,"It was just okay.  We've been to numerous Sushi restaurants in Charlotte, Davidson & Asheville, and this was probably our least favorite out of all of them.  It wasn't \""bad\""..just very boring.  We have another restaurant.com coupon from the Ayrsley restaurant so maybe that will be better."
2,So the waiter brought a me cheese enchilada and chicken taco even though I ordered a beef enchilada and chicken taco I informed him of this and he looked at me in the face and asked me if I wanted a side of beef.  I will not be back
2,"Chips & Salsa were the only things that were good. Margarita on the rocks was ok, spinach dip was ok. Chese enchilada & chile relleno was ok. Husband had a chicken chimi, he did not like it but like the beans and rice. My friend from Canada like the beef enchilada & hard shredded beef taco.  Flan was tough."
2,The food was awful. My mushroom ravioli was rubbery and so unappetizing looking they should have been ashamed to let it out of the kitchen. My daughters chicken was so overcooked she could not cut it. The waiter told us we should have sent it back but he did not come back to check on us. Will never go back to this location again. Stay away there are a lot of other restaurants nearby try one of those
2,"The only reason I give this a two star is purely because the customer service was fantastic. I will say this was a positive I experienced. I contacted Jay via email, and he got back to me very quickly, and his shop staff were very friendly. My cupcakes were not ready at the time I requested to pick them up, which wasn't too big of a deal, as everyone was very apologetic and sincere. Unfortunately the cupcakes themselves were awful. I can say that I have had better tasting cupcakes from Walmart. I ordered a dozen cupcakes, 6 with pink bows, and 6 with blue ties. The decoration did okay, but seemed liked something I could have done myself with some help, but the cupcakes were nearly frozen in the middle, stale, and the icing was hard. This could have been due to the fact that I was suppose to pick up my cupcakes on a Friday, but due to a car accident I was not able to get them until Monday. I did how ever send an email to Jay letting him know this Thursday evening. To me it tasted as if the cupcakes were made several days in advance and left in the walk in frig. Again, 3 of my cupcakes were practically frozen in the middle. I was pretty disappointed as I had heard great things about KAK, and was looking forward to using them in the future for other needs, but I will not be utilizing their services anymore."
2,"Getting tired of their unannounced internet service outages all times.  There have literally been three periods in the past week where I've been without service due to \""maintenance\"".  They said they were improving service, but I really didn't have a problem with it until they took it down completely. \n\nThey are pretty bad, almost Comcast bad.... and that says a lot."
2,"I so wanted to like this place, but I was not a FAN! I got the combo with BBQ pork and teriyaki chicken and chicken fried rice.  The BBQ pork was not GOOD at all, chewy and tough to eat.  The teryiyaki chicken was even worse, the sauce was a clump of jello like substance.  GROSS!  The fried rice was so soggy and the beans did not go with the rest of the food.  =(\n\nThey have a friendly staff and hurdle customers in like cattle."
2,"Came here for dinner, waiters took a while to get our order and there was not alot people. We ordered \""The Theresa\"" and the Corn on cob with chili, cheese and lime. The food tasted fine but i feel like it was overpriced, $6 for one corn on a cob with chili and cheese? come on now."
2,"Food was no better than adequate.  Service was worse.  Waiter did not speak English well, so our order was messed up.  One hour time limit.  Everything tasted of ginger, and more than just a hint of it. Atmosphere wasn't very good.  Poor lighting makes it difficult to read menu.  We will not be going back, even though it is very close to home."
2,"I have been to this restaurant dozens of times throughout the years. I find the steaks are always good, but the seafood is really hit or miss. Was there yesterday and my lobster was totally over cooked. It was like complete rubber. It was barely edible. I should have known better to order it there, but I love surf and turf so I gave it a shot. Very disappointing."
2,"Several people said I had to go here during my first-ever visit to Pittsburgh so I obliged. Whoa, I've never been this confused about why a place gets such high recommendations. \n\nUpon entry, expect a chaotic atmosphere. We were first told to find a seat ourselves, but then were told to be seated. Once seated, we waited for several minutes before anyone came by to ask us anything. However, after the first staff member showed up, another two came by within two minutes to ask us for our order as well. \n\nThe food was okay, nothing spectacular. The one interesting part was that the fries came stuffed in the sandwich. As for the taste, really nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nWhy this place is so popular will remain a mystery to me. Was it worth going just to say I had gone?  Not really."
2,"I have never had worse service in a hotel than this past weekend at Caesar's- we found the guest's before us underwear in our room, it took 6 hours for them to bring us an extra blanket and 24 for the extra pillows- our wake-up call never came- this is supposed to be a world class hotel- I don't think so- and when i told the staff about these instances- they just couldn't be bothered and the manager shrugged and said it's a holiday weekend- we don't have the staff- then hire more people- hello"
2,"Das Essen ist ganz ok, nicht berauschend. \""Typisch\"" Griechisch halt, zumindest das was man hier als \""Griechisch\"" bekommt, Gyros-Spie\u00dfe usw, meistens mit Saucen. Der Service ist leider weder freundlich noch aufmerksam, oft sitzt man 20-30 Minuten lang vor leeren Gl\u00e4sern. Preis-Leistungsverh\u00e4ltnis stimmt nicht so ganz, ist aber eine Alternative, falls man beim um die Ecke gelegenen Sokrates keinen Tisch bekommt und unbedingt Lust auf Griechisch hat."
2,"I came here with several of my co-workers hoping for fun lunch. While the decor was unique and interesting, I felt the black was a bit overdone. It also seems they designed their own chairs and they were really uncomfortable when you sit back. There is some kind of triangular design on the back and it kept digging into my lower back. It forced me to sit on the edge of my seat. Other than the interior decor, the service was prompt and friendly. But there wasn't anyone else in there at the time.\n\nEach of us got a different ramen noodle soup, an order of the waffle with korean beef, edamame, and the sliders.\n\nThe edamame was awesome. Super garlicky with some good dipping sauce. The ramen unfortunately didn't live to my expectations. I had the sesame tonkatsu and the broth felt way too thick and it wasn't hot at all. Maybe room temperature. the noodles were a bit warmer but not by much. I couldn't finish the ramen because it was too thick and it wasn't appetizing because it wasn't hot. My other co-workers agreed that their ramen wasn't hot either. The waffles were okay but not something I would order. I didn't get to try the sliders but they said they were just alright.\n\nI hope for the best for this establishment but it's not a place I would return to."
2,"This place used to be bomb. You can tell they are cutting corners now. They took off their best appetizer queso fundido, service was slow, no longer 24hours, and they barely comp drinks for players,got hasseled everytime I ordered a.drink and I was playing maMuch better options in town, no point of wasting time or money herex credits and fast. there are much better options in town, no point of wasting money or time here"
2,"Sadly, we had a really bad experience. Our guacamole had a really strange texture and unpleasant taste and the tacos were hardly even mediocre. The fish tacos had no cabbage, cilantro, or lime, they were pretty lacking in general and were served with wilted green leaf lettuce. The black beans and rice had no flavor. The party at the table next to us had to send their meal back for being uncooked. It was just not a meal I would ever come back for."
2,"My friend and I decided to try this place while the rest of our group stayed in the hotel room sleeping because of the night before. I was so hungry I just wanted to eat anything. \n\nFortunately the buffet had started here around 11am for 11.99 per person. (does not include drinks )\n\nIt was a Italian style buffet. Spaghetti , lasagna, meatballs , and Parmesan chicken. They also served a soup and salad.\n\nI hate to say it but the food quality was very poor. My clam chowder was disgusting and the only thing I enjoyed from my plate was the fettuccine . I kind of stuffed myself with bread because I was worried I was not going to get my money's worth. \n\nI was surprised how cold some of the food was judging that they just opened the buffet right as we got in. We were even the first ones!"
2,It was ok. It is like someone who is drunk and this is what the craved for munchies. They combined a Panda Express with a Taco Bell into one dish. Also the fried rice was terrible
2,The best word I can think of to describe this place is 'meh'. I went here for lunch and I was underwhelmed by the menu. I ended up getting chicken salad with fruit. It was a small scoop of mediocre chicken salad on top of a bed of undressed greens with some grapes and two strawberry slices sprinkled on. When I asked for some dressing they told me there was some on the table. They must have been talking about the oil covered squeeze bottle containing a tasteless vinegarette. Not impressed.
2,"I took my parents here mostly because of the view-but also for the food, which supposedly is good (really, 4 stars?). We ordered the peppercorn new york strip, one of the chewiest steaks I have ever tasted, the filet and salmon. The filet and the salmon were ok, but nothing special. The beet appetizer was acidic and did not taste good. \n\nSuch a shame-and very pricey. For 3 people without drinks it was close to 200$. Cannot recommend. Although the view is absolutely fabulous, that's why the 2 stars."
2,"I thought this place was pretty average. We did the all you can drink champagne brunch and that was pretty great. However, I thought the food was pretty bad. The salad was soggy, the eggs were flavorless, everything was sinking in grease, the breakfast burrito was NOT GOOD. Usually, when I'm vegas hungover, anything breakfast appeals to me, so you can imagine my surprise when I left this place hungry. For all of the amazing buffets in Vegas, skip this one."
2,"Samurai Sam's tries hard at creating some Asian inspired food\n\nThe three of us came here last week, each ordering something different. I had three chicken tacos which were good, but had virtually no meat. As you can see from the photos, it's hard to find any. Lots of veggies though.\n\nAs for my friends, they each ordered different types of teriyaki bowls. Both came with a lot of rice, but again not much else.\n\nSadly, you can get  nearly twice as much food at Panda Express.  It's hard to justify coming back, our bill came to $24.70, including two soft drinks and one water. So, Two Stars and yes, we have had better.\n\nSorry!"
2,"We ate at this place for Thanksgiving dinner, and it gave me an overwhelming feeling of OK-ness.  The selection of dishes is very limited and not too exciting.  The food is passable.  The service is actually pretty bad - they have food runners who never know which person or even which table the food goes to and waiters that are experts at zooming past you avoiding eye contact.  The decor is cheesy.  Skip."
2,"Ok... if you're hungry, hung over and needing something yummy to hit the spot. Don't go here.. ha! The decor and gimmicky stuff is pretty much the only thing that's great about this place. I love that you get a take home glass with your beer :) but the food is just yuck! Bar food that's gotten even blander than it already is! Our service was great, she was fast and friendly but it just didn't hit the spot. I don't even remember what anybody had - but seriously. Go here for the souvenirs, not the food!"
2,"I have been to Claim Jumper in CA.  They have been great!  The one in Avondale is just ok, I have been coming back a few times and it still has not changed my mind.  The service has been just so-so.  One time my chicken was served under cooked.  I do not know if I will return.  I still love in Claim Jumper in Deer Valley."
2,"Twice in the last 4 trips to JJs we got home and the sub didn't have the toppings we asked for. Second time it happened we called to complain and they insisted it was our fault. They told us we could drive it back and they would give us a new one. No thanks, won't ever be driving back there."
2,The overall experience was subpar. No greeting or direction on where to order when we entered. The burgers were cooked a little rarer than our tastes. The food in general was just average. Not much flavor. Smash Burger down the street is much better. And there's no need to make a comparison with 5 Guys. I don't see this place lasting long. The operation doesn't seem to be run smoothly either.
2,"Overrated. \n\nI think I ordered the wrong steak but at $60 a steak, I still expected a good steak. \n\nI read the reviews and I still ordered the bone in since bone in has such good flavor. Yes, I understand it wouldn't be the most tender cut of meat, but it was chewy. I have had much better steaks in texas (also corn fed like they highly describe on their menu and by the waiter) than at cut. \n\nThe rest - the sides were ok. i really enjoyed the mac and cheese that gets prepped (stirred) at the table as well as the spinach with egg. But the other sides were just ok. \n\nWine/drink: they had a drink menu on an ipad and yes that's impressive but when it's a group of seven (mostly guys - i was the lone girl) it might be smart to give us more than one unit. \n\nThe cheesy bread was amazing - that's the only reason this place got two stars. \n\nService was great - but expected at a place of this size. \n\nAll said and done, I paid two hundred dollars for my meal of a bad steak and ok mac and cheese. \n\nwill not come again."
2,"Cold Tuna, frozen vegetables, unremarkable service!\n\nI travel constantly, so I notice the small stuff as well as the big stuff.  In my second trip to this Phillips I was hoping for a better experience tan my first.  Next time, I think I will save the dough and just go to CPK ASAP in terminal B."
2,"Bus load, after bus load, after bus load of kids with few adults to manage them.  Holy cow, what a disaster.  Throwing balls, running kids, and no adults from the schools nor enough science museum staff to manage it all.  This was quite an annoying experience, and hard to enjoy the exhibits.  They really need to get this under control."
2,Food was OK (food temps could be hotter). Clean restaurant. Upholstery was outdated. Service was slowwwwww! There was very few people eating here and only one waitress and what could of been a 30 min experience turned into an hour because of her slow response time. I would come back only if the service was quicker (Which is customary for a Chinese restaurant) and my rice and music soup was hotter!
2,"Let me start off by saying, the cookies and bran muffin I sampled were absolutely delicious!! Also, the service was fine - patient and kind - even amidst some VERY rude women with kids who sent the children's food back because the toast wasn't crispy enough.. \nThat being said, I ordered the chopped salad with mixed greens and romaine I believe. The mixed greens were not just old, they were decomposing. Mushy and falling apart. Smelled terrible. This really irks me when you're paying $13 for a high-quality salad. I'm disappointed the chef didn't care enough to check what he puts on the plate. Otherwise, it would have been a great salad!\nI'm not that picky, but a lazy chef who doesn't care about food quality before the plate goes out is a bad sign."
2,"OK, drove all the way from Gilbert to Camelback because the Phoenix Magazine rated Delux as one of the best burgers in the Valley. Two burgers, one mixed fries, one lemonade, one Diet Coke and tip came to $39. Fries were very good but because of the poor service it's hard to say how good our cold burgers were. Susan had to ask one of the other servers where our order was because we didn't see our waiter... everyone around us was getting served and they ordered after us. Too bad, we probably won't go back because of the service. I'm sure if they could make all the pieces fit together the place would be great. Just don't want to pay almost $40 for a couple burgers and take that chance again. We'll go to Burger King or McDonald's where we know what to expect."
2,"Ate an early dinner here on Sunday, June 28. Chose this restuarant because we (me & wife) were visiting Las Vegas with our 8-year-old daughter, who is a picky eater.\n\nThe service was efficient, the ambiance is casino loud, and the food is pretty good. I ordered a basic hamburger with cheese and bacon and it was good, but definitely NOT worth the price I paid ($14). The fact that you have to pay extra for fries adds insult to injury.\n\nI cannot recommend this place because the value is horrible."
2,"I was a little disappointed in Pearl.  The sushi was outstanding but the presentation, service and environment left much to be desired.  First, the good.  They had a very large selection of sushi and all day happy hour.  Our food was excellent.  However, the resultant was so hot, we almost felt nauseous by the time we were finished eating.  The plates that our food arrived on were badly chipped.  The waiter kept touching us (patting on back/brushing against us) which was uncomfortable.   The last issue was that our soup was served after we received our entrees which was very odd.  Over all, I probably won't be back to Pearl."
2,"Just placed my order around 8:10 and 40 minutes later it has still not been placed with the restaurant. (they show status updates and it will say \""placed\"" when it has been done)  If ALL you do is delivery you better do it D@m*^ well!  I understand if there is a delay getting it cooked at the restaurant or traffic, but they should be placing the order with the restaurant immediately!!  Not cool foodie call, not cool. Not going to use them again unless I have to.  \n\nAlso there is not a great selection of restaurants to chose from.  Maybe Im spoiled, Im from Chicago and every kind of food imaginable is deliverable and super quick, that sure is not the case here in Charlotte!   When I called they just said they were very busy and thin on drivers.  Well hire some more then dude!"
2,"La bouffe est bonne, mais je n'y retournerai plus \u00e0 cause de la malpropret\u00e9. C'est un des pires d\u00e9liquants selon les inspecteurs du gouvernement."
2,Saturday night. Looking forward to this show and we got here before 8pm. Show started near 930. So freaking crowded you can't see the band.  Its so loud you cant hear the band.  Fire Marshall bill would close the place. So over capacity you can't move. Let alone get to the bathroom. All about greed. Need to stop ticket sales while there is still room to move.
2,"If I could give the food four stars and the service one star, I would. That being said, perhaps I went into this restaurant on a bad day. Initially, the service was great and our waiter, Rodrigo was certainly trying his best, but the dining experience fell short and the horrible service was a distraction from the great food. At one point, I had to wait fifteen minutes to have my glass of water refilled as I tried to catch the attention of a waiter and watched the table next to us have their glasses refilled twice. To say the least, the experience was odd. For such a nice (and moderately expensive restaurant) a couple of the servers had terrible adequate. Personally, I go out to eat for the entire experience. If I had wanted good food, I could've made it for myself at home...dining out should be about more than just an expensive meal and attractive decor. I don't think I would go back if given the choice. Ultimately, despite the good food, SOL Cocina left a bad taste in my mouth."
2,"Food was almost average couldve been better had hot  wings and fries blah!..Service incredibly slow on a friday afternoon,had to take my tab and go find the waittress to cash out.Guess cant wrong with the drinks and bottled beer here(only miller and coors on tap).Sports on tvs all over gives it 2 stars......."
2,"Great location, ok rooms, ok restaurants. Horrible staff. I felt like i was inconveniencing them by asking for simple directions. Incredibly rude and everyone looked like they were miserable. Probably the worst part of my experience was the Spa. Please avoid this hell hole even if they offer it to you for free! It is incredibly dirty and smells. I couldnt take more then 20 min and i left to take a long shower in my room. Try calling the front desk and youll wait anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes every time. There are SO many better hotels on the strip around the same price. I will not be staying here again!"
2,"I have been meaning to write this review for a long time. My husband and i got married at the Venetian resort, which is an amazing hotel, and we continue going there every year. The night before our wedding we and our four friends decided to go to this cozy looking Italian restaurant mainly the atmosphere seemed very nice and we love Italian food. \n\nHowever, I ordered a pasta dish not sure which one, with chicken and it came without, which I instantly noted to the waiter. Of course the waiter was apologetic, went to the kitchen to ask for the chicken, which I found very strange, perhaps even more strange when the chicken came out in a bowl, they had cooked the already frozen cooked chicken in cream in the microwave, so basically I was meant to add that to my pasta, It was hilariously disappointing, and our friends weren't very impressed about their pizzas either, and barely touched them."
2,This review is for the food court. It sucks. The price for what you get is ridiculous. Ive had better burgers at McD's and for a third of the price!
2,Space is off the lobby with views of the pool and the Strip - great atmosphere. Vibe was sports oriented with lots of flat screens broadcasting the Wisconsin v Arizona NCAA game. \n\nBurger was good but the service ( Erin  from South Dakota) was not. It took 40 minutes to get our burgers and the Rings arrived at table cold and in edible. They comp'd our coconut shrimp app and the rings - which was appreciated. But would have preferred to have gotten our food timely and hot. The establishment was not particularly busy - so it was hard to imagine what the problem was....judging from other yelp reviews this place has service issues.
2,"Maybe it was an off night?  This is the worst review I have given.  It is my Son's 26th birthday today so we met up with him at Brat Haus.  I had a really good feeling about this place due to it's current star rating on Yelp and the way it is designed.  It  has a really cool vibe.  The service and food were not acceptable.  The Scottsdale market demands good food and this place is not making the cut. My son ordered a Chorizo Dog and he sent it back (no flavor). My wife and I split a burger and they did not ask how I wanted it cooked. The burger arrived and it was well done and the only flavor I could taste in it was a strong taste of pepper?  It was horrible, I am sure they cook it to death because the quality of the beef won't allow them to cook it on the rare side.\n\nI did not drink but we had plenty of beer lovers at the table who were ready to have a beer or two but they had a hard time getting a server to stop by and take their order.  \n\nI tried some of the other's food and the only thing I found to be tasty was the pretzel fundido.  Not sure I will try Brat Haus again."
2,"I wouldn't call it great food. I had lunch here and the wonton soup was good. The Orange flavored chicken was average or even a little less than average. The fried rice that came with it was.....well....it tasted like white rice. Looked similar to fried but was pretty boring too. \nI would compare the quality to panda express. Not great, but an acceptable alternative to fast food. Only downside to that is that you have a waitress you have to tip here. \nThe dining area is odd, with boxes of supplies piled up on the right side of the entrance area. Makes it look cluttered and unfinished."
2,"OK sushi. Tried it several times. When I'm shopping at Home Depot, Target or Pet Smart. I get a thing for sushi and cold Japanese beer. Conveniently located in the same parking lot of Home Depot. Every time, disappointed."
2,"It was just ok, I got up sold for the hand wax and then tipped pretty well in advance to assure a good job, when It was ready the didn't really do a good job cleaning the inside, still had trash in the floor and door panels... Outside and tires wet pretty good though... I would say just use them for te cheap exterior wash next time"
2,"... this was the worst experience with a class/instructior I've had in my 10 plus years practicing yoga.\n\nI decided, on a recent trip to Phoenix, to drop in to a Candlelight Yoga class. Sounded really nice and relaxing. Not ... so ... much ....   I just don't understand why there has to be pop music blaring in the background THE WHOLE CLASS  ?? How about some softer music? Or silence. I found it both annyoing and super distracting.\n\nThe instructor was very uninvolved and seemed bored. She paced back and forth in front of the room at the beginning of class ... she did not at any point seem calm, centered or really connected to what was going on with her students. It was like she was distracted, or tired ... or BORED.\n\nWhat it was, and why I gave it two stars (and not one) was a good workout. Oh, and the studio is really nice ... urban, artsy, hipster style.\n\nI guess this is what they mean by competitive yoga. Everyone decked out in lulu, trying to outpose one another. Nothing wrong with that, but not my thing ... and I would advise anyone who's looking for more depth, presence and actual flow to try somewhere else."
2,"This was my second visit. I had a great experience my first time in- very personable waitress, great service overall and a really great sandwich. I ordered the cheese-stuffed tenderloin with their \""signature\"" white sauce. Disappointment. The sauce was yellow (the waitress said it was because of the addition of paprika) but honestly, it tasted like cheese wiz but on the watery side. It did not have a good flavor- very bland. The pork was pretty tough for being a tenderloin and I wished I had a serrated blade with which to saw through it. Not sure what happened today in the kitchen. In the future I will stick with sandwiches. They do that pretty well. And even though I left half of my meal on the plate there was no offer to discount my meal- even by 25%, which would have probably made me happy enough to have not even written this review. Restaurants are a tricky business. You have to be great in the kitchen -or hire someone who is - and have a great business sense- or hire someone who does."
2,"I stopped in here on my way to Cali hoping for something gluten free before my flight. It was pretty busy and only a couple overly stressed servers. It has a long bar, naturally as its Vegas, and then lots of little crammed in tables in booths with barely any room. \n\nMy server was nice enough to point out a few things she thought I could have. There wasn't a lot of confidence as to what was and wasn't gluten free. She asked the kitchen if I could have the nachos. They said yes but in retrospect I probably should have been more careful cause I could hear there was a pretty significant language barrier. \n\nSo I did go with the nachos which were pretty good. Chicken and a cilantro sauce along with the nacho cheese and jalape\u00f1os. There was a pretty good sized portion and I took some in a box with me for later. I never did end up feeling sick so I think the nachos are a safe bet here.\n\nOther notes, I did hear another customer complain of dirty silverware, mine was ok. Food came out in good time but not a lot of server attention in regards to filling water glasses or getting you anything else you might need. Price was pretty average for airport food. \n\nOverall, it's ok. I may try something different next time I'm in the airport."
2,"I bought two overpriced drinks -- a vodka soda and a vodka cranberry -- from a grouchy bartender who skipped over people who had been waiting for much longer in order to serve loud drunk girls.  Dude, all I wanted was to buy these drinks and go on my way.  There were, at most, 7 people at the bar.  Took 15 minutes to get a couple of weak drinks.  Should have saved my money."
2,Just sad how this franchise killed my opinion of this restaurant chain. Quality has gone down drastically since opening. A great burger does not give excuses for poor service and quality. This is my last experience here.... one of my 3 combos of half & half included 3 onion rings and 14 fries. My expectations as a customer that has had Fudd before... 5 to 7 onion rings 20 to 25 fries. No combo my family ate today met my expectations. Dirty tables. Dirty restroom. Dirty floors. Nickel & dime the customers.
2,"Terrible food and drinks. Cool restaurant layout. Service staff and managers were attentive. \n\nIt was packed for First Friday, which was opening night. Bad decision. The manager who stopped by admitted he had not yet tasted the food or drinks. One more indicator of why everything was so poorly executed.\n\nThe craft beer selection is unfamiliar but mediocre. The mixed drinks were all made in batches, according to staff, and tasted watered down. All were terrible.    \n                                                     \nThe appetizer menu has 3 chips & dip options including salsa, guacamole and queso. The chips were chewy, as if they were either not cooked enough or they were stale. The salsa, queso and guacamole were all lacking in flavor. The queso looked and tasted like potato soup.\n\nThey have 5 tacos on the menu. The carne asada and carnitas were very dry and flavorless. Temperature was between luke warm and cold. The cactus was unique, had a mild grilled flavor but was only so-so. The calamari tasted overly breaded and overly fried. The chicken was flavorless, as if frozen chicken had been reheated and some sauce had been thrown over it at the last minute.\n\nService staff and managers seemed to care, visited us on many occasions and ultimately comped our meal. They asked us to come back and we will. I will gladly update this review if food quality improves. I hope it does."
2,"Again, I'm not sure why Yelp encourages double pages for the location, the only difference being abbreviations within the street address.\n\nWhen the restaurant opened almost ten years ago, it was great! Management was friendly towards people of all ages, prices were cheap, and pizza and wings were excellent. I remember Amore working out a deal with my cousin's middle school for pizza Fridays, and all the kids appreciated it.\n\nI'm not sure when the change happened, within five years ago, or if there was another change after that. After the original owner changed hands for the restaurant, things took a turn for the worse. Employees eventually consisted of teenagers looking for extra cash instead of the workers who put their heart in soul in cooking, delivery, and service. The food quality also was much more sloppy, and prices steadily raised over the years.\n\nNow it's just another greedy restaurant. If Amore were in its original hands, it'd still be one of the best places for pizza in Scottsdale. Now it just blows."
2,"I avoid Panda Express. In the past, I've had vegetables that are mush and have felt sick to my stomach. However, with our kitchen being worked on, this was one of the few options for a healthier lunch. I had not eaten from the Buckeye location before.\n\nThe good: I had the vegetables instead of noodles/rice, and they were actually very fresh and crisp. I was pleased. Nor did I feel sick afterward.\n\nThe meh: I had chicken and mushrooms, and the Shanghai Angus steak. They were okay. The flavors are so strong they make the meat and vegetables all taste the same. It was all quite edible, but I can cook better at home and for a whole lot cheaper.\n\nAn acceptable place out of desperation, but hey, I've had worse."
2,"We came as a party of four without a reservation. We had about a twenty minute wait, no big deal so we sat at the bar. I Decided on a mojito that was great. Cheers to the bartender. \n\nWe were sat at our table in the outdoor dining area. There was live music playing below our seating area that was great. This was the end of our positive experiences here.\n\nThe service was lackluster, not terrible, just nothing special. Any drinks ordered seemed to take some time before coming to the table. Everyone ordered a different meal from the menu. \n\nThe food was nothing to write home about. Our appetizers came out timely, some melted cheese & chips. Then came entr\u00e9e. It was $30 for three small tacos that were not very impressive. Finally, the desert. A very bland banana cream pie. \n\nI'd give this place another shot. There were some other choices on the menu I'd like to try some time."
2,"I was thoroughly not impressed by this place.  Vacant tables were not cleaned and there was generally uninspired staff and service.  The cashier didn't take my order correctly; she asked me about what sauce I wanted with my fish (tartar) and didn't put it in my takeout order.  Another customer approached the counter to ask for bread after it was left out of his dinner.  I subsequently found that it was left out of my dinner order as well.\n\nThe chicken, although nice and crispy, was pretty bland.  I'll say the same for the catfish (Old Bay seasoning, anyone?)  The cole slaw was not very fresh.  The Chicago Harold's left me with a better impression even though it was a hole-in-the-wall storefront spot.  I would not recommend that you waste your time or money at this place."
2,"Panchero's Mexican Grill looked interesting to eat at, I love how they prepare their tortilla's in the big presser they have - but that's the only thing that impressed me; the tortilla's... Since they're freshly made, they're still yummy and \""gooey\"" - The staff was really nice when we entered, and was attentive to what we wanted for our orders :)\n\nI got a pretty basic burrito but was disappointed at the rice, the other two people in our party compared it to Uncle Ben's rice, the steak we got seemed \""boiled\"", the medium salsa wasn't as spicy as I thought it was (but they do have a counter filled with different hot sauces; of course I grabbed the Tapat\u00edo), although the salsa was flavorful. My friends had ordered a chicken quesadilla - they were good but not great. It seemed they only had Montery Jack as their cheese. The prices were pretty decent, I think next time I will try something else though!"
2,"I've been going to Rositas for probably 10-15 years and mainly at lunch during the work week. The tacos are great, the enchilads are chessy and taste good but also a gut bomb that makes you want to take a nap. Unfortunately this has always been one of my go to places and would normally give it 4 stars; however, I finally took the family this past Sunday and the food was OK not as good as usual and the service was awful. The waitress did not seem happy to be serving us, got one of the orders wrong (which we couldn't fix because we didn't see her for 20 more minutes), we got the tortillas for fajitas 20 minutes after the fajitas and the check took another 20 minutes to wait for. I would typically go here every month but hadn't been in a 3-4 months so I am hoping this was a one off and the next visit will be better and not that the place has gone down hill."
2,"Bakery square was previously the nabisco \nPlant.  Several years ago  you could have dropped bomb here; no one would have cared about the forgotten residents of this community...  Anyway Bakery Square is textbook example of urban renewal.\n  Google, urban actives fitness and a quaint \nLittle coffee shop (name escapes me)  are all located here. \nAdequate garage parking. \nStreet level parking is more readily available at off peak times.\n Weekends   you'll have to compete with the horn honking  mercedes, braking BMW's and the Voltswagen gti driving; skinny Jean wearing yupsters for street parking. Good luck!"
2,"Way overpriced for the 3 pieces of equipment that they offer. My 5 year old was extremely bored with it after only an hour and and my 20 month old did enjoy the \""Toddler Zone\"" for about 30 minutes. Don't forget your socks-they cost about 3 dollars a pair...\n\nThe only thing for small children (under 3) is the Toddler Zone which had maybe 6  padded shapes in it along with a little bounce house which mine really enjoyed, but that is it. The rest of the equipment is for ages 4 and up.\n\nFriendly Staff and the place was very clean for the most part- bathrooms could use some updating and deep scrub.\n\nNot worth the 22 dollars for 1.5 hours we spent there...would rather take them to Bounce Jungle or Bounce U for half that price."
2,"Second run to the Indian Land Red Bowl and left disappointed.  The service was just fine, but the food was blah. Won Ton soup was OK, good broth.  Beef a la Szechuan was pretty flavorless and the Sea of Love seafood combo was really blah.\n\nThere is a pervasive lack of spice and flavor in their dishes.  Too bad for a nice location and very nice d\u00e9cor.\n\nI doubt if we will return."
2,"I've had better Indian food, especially for the price.  But, they are in the old port of Montreal, someone has to pay for that rent!  I've also had better service, the waiter was a real jack ass.  The guy I went with did not leave a tip due to the poor service, and the waiter followed us into the street accosting him for a tip.\n\nI ordered saag paneer ($17), it tasted good but it arrived in small quantity, and the naan, while good is expensive at $4 per piece.   Note that they also close between lunch and dinner seating's. \n\nI do not plan on returning to this restaurant"
2,"I wanted to like this place.  They obviously spent a fortune on the remodel, but the food and the service don't match their architectural efforts.  I was going to sit at the bar and have a quick bite, and it was just sort of a mess.  Barstools were strewn all over, which I know shouldn't be a big deal, but it's one of those little details I'd never really paid attention to before.  It made  it look like they weren't ready for you.  The staff just seemed like a bunch of kids left to their own devices, dropping silverware and loudly yucking it up.  Pollo fundido was terrible.  Tasted very flour-y, sauce on top was like mushroom soup without the mushrooms.  Whole thing was more like a fried fajita wrap.   Just a disappointing experience.  And I really wanted it to be good.  I hope they straighten out some of their issues."
2,I thought if I go inside and order in person it would prevent mistakes. I was wrong they ordered 3 extra things that I never said I wanted that were expensive. I didn't think The total sounded right but wasn't sure until I got home. Unreal!
2,"Used to like coming here when Market Street had a line (as it so often does) but it's getting harder to find something to order.  The hamburger steak used to be reliably good but this time, it was ... off.  I suspect it is due to whatever was cooked on the grill before they cooked the hamburger patties.  The philly steak sandwich wasn't too good either.  Not enough cheese and the meat kind of tasteless - needed salt.  Was so disappointed we didn't go back for the friend wonton and teri beef, which are our usual standbys."
2,"I ordered her today for lunch at work, I ordered the general Tao chicken, and asked for it SPICY.  I guess that means they just add a packet of hot sauce to your order because the sauce was anything but spicy.  \n\nOn the plus side they use real chicken and nice big chunks.  Not like some places that that are a 1/4 chicken and 3/4 batter.  The thing that will prevent me from ordering there again is they don't do a General Tao sauce to my liking."
2,"Meh, nice patio but lackluster service if it's busy. I don't think we're cool enough to hang here, at least that's how they made us feel, and no one should feel that way as a paying customer. Not worth a return trip."
2,"Never ever going back. The place stinks like cigarettes and the service is terrible. The food is mediocre, ihop may be better. Definitely wouldn't suggest to a friend."
2,"Hired 2 cleaners for 2 hours to clean an empty condo.  When I arrived about 3 days after the cleaning, the place looked pretty much the same as before, minus the alcohol, spare light bulbs and cleaning supplies the previous tenants left behind.  I was told that it was usual to take everything out of the cabinets for the new tenants.  How about 'if it is not yours, don't take it' policy?  Obviously, it was not garbage.  \n\nI gave 2 stars because they did clean the oven and the fridge and a few drawers, but other then that, I am not sure what else they did for 2 hours.  After walking around the newly cleaned condo with bare feet for 30 minutes, my feet were black!  They did offer to come back and clean again, but after their first performance, I figured it wasn't worth my time.  Never again."
2,"Gross!!!!\n\nThere is not much variety at this buffet. If you want to pay $30 for pasta, pizza, and Panda Express Chinese food.. Not a wise move. Also, they advertise their \""seafood section\"" like it's some huge deal.. But it's just fried this and fried that. The shrimp wasn't even peeled. \n\nThe pulled pork and chicken were all soggy and drenched in BBQ sauce. The beans were canned. And I hate when salad bars don't let you make the salad, they make it for you. \n\nOverall, service was horrible too. I understand buffets get crazy, but we were pretty much neglected and had to call over the manager. \n\nI am only giving it the additional star because its simply edible, and the desserts are good! Mini donuts, ice cream, cookies... At least they didn't mess that part up!"
2,"I kept paying for monthly service and I don't know why.  The house was never really clean - just wiped down. \n\nThey rushed through the job wiping surfaces and pushing dirt around. \n\nI sent pictures of how dirty our tile floors were AFTER they cleaned and talked to them about the floors on several occasions. \n\nIt's too bad, but the attention to detail and a little TLC are completely lacking with this company."
2,"Disagree with previous post. Went to 1902 tavern for lunch a few weeks back. To start the waiter appeared to be either on crack or speed. Second I was with a party of 4 that all ordered salads. I decided to go with the steak. Awful call on my part. The salad took 45 minutes to arrive, along with the cracked out waiter (who we hadn't seen for at least 30 minutes) The steak was total bullshit. Overcooked and cold. The salad had way too much iceberg lettuce and tasted like crap. I won't be back until Pittsburgh decides to clean up Market square and all of the vargrants that inhabit the area. Where do these people come from? and is there nothing better to do except sit around market square, smoke cigarettes and throw your trash everywhere so city workers can clean up after your filthy asses? My advice to you son, is do the same as your father, and his father did...get a job!!!"
2,"If hometown buffet opened a casino, this is what it would be like. \n\nPaid $25.99 each.   For what you paid for, this place just sucks.  Dining area is like a high school cafeteria, noisy and drafty.  Lots of food varieties cooked to mediocrity. \n\nPro: they have beer (served in a solo cup like a carnival). \nCon: they only serve Miller light\n\nHere's a tip: don't drop your fork because you only get one."
2,Same as the first review.  It's close and near my place of employment but unfortunately every time I try it out the chicken tenders are always dry as hell. The corn and potatoes can be kept on a heat lamp for the most part but when it comes to the chicken it should be cooked to order. Skip Popeye's Louisiana and head to canes.
2,"I was craving dim sum late night, and this was the only place that was open. Since I've been craving dim sum for a few months now, this place got lucky that I devoured everything in front of me. The bad news, I got food poisoning. I knew there was something wrong with the pork shumai when it reeked of bad pork and the cavier on top was still gooey on top, but I was beyond hungry and going through one of my cravings so I forged ahead. There is a limited dim sum menu for night time. Here is the breakdown: Edible and decent: sweet custard buns and shrimp balls. Reminiscent of dim sum: banana leaf sticky rice, shrimp potstickers and pork buns. Either bland or bad: pork shumai and shark fin potstickers. I heard there are much better places to go for dim sum in Vegas...so don't go here for it, unless it's really late and you are beyond crave monster status. FYI - I saw a family order 7 orders of fried rice...maybe that is what I should have ordered...."
2,"I called at 6PM to inquire if they had a \""kids section\"" here because my youngest is 2. The guy that answered said yes we do, I said great we are on our way.  We got there at 630 and when we paid he tells us just so you know the kids area closes at 7PM.  WTH. Someone should let them know when people call at 6PM thats some important info to tell them.  Now why they close off their kids section is a WHOLE other problem... I have a 9 yr old and a 2 year old, so after 7PM my 9 yr old could go jump with the other scraggly teenaged boys and hoodlums that were showing up (urrgh) while my 2 year old does nothing. I did ask for a refund and then left and went to Jumpstreet which I recommend because they DONT close their kids section at odd times, its open during their business hours and is a lot cleaner."
2,"gotta say that this place failed on the majority. service was slow and rude. the hummus was almost all tahini, no lemon juice, and no seasoning. lentil soup was like chef boyardie chili gone bad.\n\ni dont recommend this place at all. lots of choices in the area."
2,This place always runs out of items on the menu. I've ordered the chicken fried steak twice and it never comes with the fresh bread they advertise. In this visit alone I've heard the waitress tell two tables they didn't have baked potatoe or a breakfast item. Our waitress appeared lithargic and took a long cigarette break while all her tables waited on her and the cook. It was bad enough she didn't check up on her guest often enough. The team leader is no better. She's helped us twice before. Never smiles. its enough to make someone depressed. Luckly the food they have is great on an empty stomach. Love the unlimited hot coco. Avoid the water. Tastes like algee.
2,"Over priced for portion size. Good luck actually tasting the guacamole in their food.  Also look out for cold food, half way through my carne asada burro was cold. I will say that they did replace it.  Otherwise the taste of the food is great."
2,"This place was nothing fantastic. We started with spring rolls and they were average. Then I had the Pacific Cove salad, which was a little too fishy and I am not sure I liked how each item was segregated on the plate. The crab and shrimp seemed like they were just pulled from the freezer. Everything was just okay. For the money it wasn't worth it. \n\nThe atmosphere was nothing special either... just another regular chain-like setting."
2,"Loved this place for a while. I don't mind that it's closed on Sundays as I work on the weekends. The problem I find is that checkout usually takes about 20 minutes, sometimes longer. Tons of checkout stations with very little staff. 6 stations, 2 open with 30 people in line at one in the afternoon. Usually you hear the manager get on the speaker \""cashiers to the front\"". Not here. Just wait in line, wasting away the day. It wouldn't bother me as much if I didn't see 20 or more employees walking around all over the store. \n\nEven with the long lines, this was the only store that sold Dill buttons. If you aren't someone that uses buttons that often, this means nothing. Dill makes high quality buttons for blazers and suits. Metal and plastic. The Hobby Lobby brand and most other brands are plastic crap. Recently HL has stopped selling Dill and only offers the store brand so they can do 2 for 1 specials. \n\nAt least I don't have to bother with the lines anymore. Now I order online."
2,"Ok, the selection is amazing.  But, after the nightmare of shopping on Black Friday last year (I had a certificate that I could only use that weekend, so had no choice), this time I planned.  This was last weekend.  I stared shopping at 10:40 in the morning.  Hardly anyone was there.  Merchandise was organized.  Not a single shopping bag to be found!  I found everything I needed.  Somehow, 4 items!! FOUR OF THEM!  \n\nSince I was using a gift certificate, I couldn't return or exchange items, so I didn't keep the receipt (that I know of).  One of these items was a gift:-(  \n\nSomehow, this didn't happen during the Black Friday from hell with tons of people.  Also, they let people bring their alcohol in there.  Bad idea.  Saw a girl go up the escalator the wrong way...\n\nWTF??!!  It was not a stressful morning.\n\nThis was at the Forum Shops.\n\nForever 21 would NEVER let this happen!"
2,"We arrived late and they sold our room, requiring us to move to another hotel, and then move back the next night. NOT COOL! \n\nWe did however get comped breakfast for two nights, and the \""continental\"" breakfast on the executive level was much better than I expected. \n\nExecutive level aside, the gym has very limited hours and costs extra to use, and so does the internet. To me, that's a bit disappointing."
2,"There are plenty of restaurants with great food or even better food for a fraction of the price. It's just ok... My shrimp on my salad were so overly salted that they cut my tongue. Scallops were great, steak good too... Just not worth the absurd prices."
2,"I have been here about 3 times, twice  for the weekend breakfast buffet and once for lunch. The food is similar to Denny's, so nothing special here. Everything here feels dingy and dirty, there was hair in one of the dishes in the buffet. Service is average, but employees are just as dirty looking as the restaurant..will not be coming here anymore."
2,"I am perplexed by all the 5 star reviews.  As out of towners we just wanted somewhere nearby our work place.   The place was packed and so we had a 30 min wait, no problem, but humorless greeter was downright misog, no smiles all night.  Bad start.  Tofu appetiser with ikkura and condiments was delicious, great tofu.  Hand Scallop Soy roll was badly made, small and not spicy like I asked for.  Edamame overcooked, various rolls including the monster were lack lustre and ingredients just not fresh.  Tuna sashimi was sent back twice.  \nNo alteration to bill was made.  green tea creme bruless, tasty but teeny weeny portion.  Sake was great but for $12 a bottle it should be OK."
2,"PBelow average service.  Had a pedi and while the polish looks good, the rest was sad.  The young man who did it literally attacked me with cuticle nippers and nearly pecked me to bloody shreds.  4 hours later and I'm still stinging.  Not much of a massage either.  Then, for Mani,, they left both me and my friend sitting in the pedi chair and proceeded to pull our arms out of our sockets.  Won't be back..."
2,"The ambiance is deliciously dark and a throwback to the grand old days of quality tablecloths and real silverware.\nThe service here was very sub-par.  Perhaps that was because I was dressed like an ignorant tourist that just wanted to be comfortable checking out the city---FYI--tourists have money to spend, too...\nI hate the fact that most upscale steak restaurants ignores the needs of patrons who want to watch their waistline.\nMy husband likes steak, BUT--- I want to eat healthy.  So, how about some healthy options, Capital?  \nI had to special order my salad and take off a bunch of junk. There entree-sized salad was fit for a mouse that had already eaten...I  left hungry! Ugh.\nPlus---my special order came out wrong and I had to (once again) watch my husband eat while I fantasized about how many carbs were in the napkin...\nOh, I won't be coming back.  There are too many other great places to spend my well-earned money on."
2,"For the good: beer is cold, great TV's and the food is not bad BUT for the service OMG every single time it gets worse and worse. It is TERRIBLE and every time we go there are new servers. I have been told many times the turnover of employees is because the management is awful and they treat their employees BAD!!!!!  Time to STOP supporting This place especially because there are SO many great sports bars with great staff!!!!!"
2,"This place is just too hyped up.  I ordered a burger medium well and it was oozing red on the inside.  i could barely fit my mouth around it.  I'm sorry but burgers are 100% about perfect proportioning of quality ingredients.  If you want to make a bigger bugger, make it bigger in a direction that makes sense.  Burgers are my favorite food, but I was not thrilled by this place.  Stack'd in shadyside is better for 1/4 the price.  Also the restaurant was freezing cold!  I was sat at a teeny high table where our plates could barely fit even though the restaurant was mostly empty.  I didn't like the way the burgers were served also, they were crammed in a tiny basket that made it hard to eat.  Don't get me wrong this place isn't bad, but there are so many other places nearby that will give you better food/atmosphere for a fraction of brgr price."
2,L'hamburger steak est ok  mais trop ch\u00e8re. Il commence \u00e0 4.50$ mais peut monter facilement \u00e0 une dizaine de dollars avec les extras. Le take out peut prendre facilement une quinzaine de minutes (pour un hamburger). Trop de boucane \u00e0 l int\u00e9rieur aussi lorsque il est en pleine production.
2,"Ok, so I've never had pho before this, so I don't have a benchmark. What I do know was the pho was really bland, so the second time I tried the Asian Invasion cheesesteak... $9 for a sandwich with nothing else, made on a cheap store-bought roll that tasted nothing like french bread. \n\nWhen my sister saw I wasn't all that enthusiastic about my sandwich, she offered to let me try her banh mi. It was super salty and on the same roll, with veggies that I thought were supposed to be pickled but lacked any bite.\n\nPut enough sriracha on anything and it's edible, but for these prices, I want better."
2,Went for Sunday brunch. Edible items include bacon and funnel cake strips. Everything else appeared to have been purchased frozen from Sam's club.
2,"I've been to this establishment twice.  The first time we did not have a reservation.  We bellied up to the bar and waited, and waited and waited...eventually a table opened.  I had no complaints that night.  The food was lovely as was the atmosphere.\n\nFast forward to tonight.  We had a 5:30 reservation for a birthday celebration.  At 7:09 we were told that we needed to leave as the table was spoken for.  Now granted we were winding down anyways, but A) this was a terrible business practice and B) yes the table was spoken for, BY US.  They knew we were celebrating a birthday and did bring out a very lovely birthday surprise for the birthday girl.  But for 60 bucks a plate I do not expect to be rushed out the door.\n\nSo now that we've gotten the service outta the way - onto the food, this is a restaurant after all.  Well, my meal of tenderloin tips was super salty but still pleasant.  The dessert (key lime pie) was really good.  My dining companions had the special - a prime rib/ shrimp combo.  They said the shrimp scampi was really good, but they've had better prime rib.\n\nI'm just flummoxed, why would Beef and Bottle risk alienating customers?  I sure as heck won't be back.  Oh and I got sick from my meal - not sure if it was me or them, but after being rushed out the door I'm gonna say it was them!  I will not be back."
2,"Chez ma grosse truie cherie was not really on my list of must try Montreal's restaurants. I ended up here because with a group on 5, it was not easy to get a reservation on a busy Saturday night. This restaurant seems to catered to large groups with communal tables and family style menu, which seems to be well suited our party of five.\n\nService was attentive and excellent. I wish the food can match the service. \n\nWe shared: \n\nOysters ($15) - Apple ice cider vinegar from Vergers de la Colline\n- Not bad, I had better oysters..\n\nChef Choice Seared Foie Gras ($23)\n- The best part of the meal... I would just come back to have that\n- Love how the sourness of the fresh grapes compliment the fattiness of the foie gras\n- No sharing! All mine!\n\nThe Whole Hog ($32/pp) - Baby back ribs, smoked grilled pork chop, braised shanks, braising juices and parmesan cheese French fries \n- The platter looked amazing for photos but most of the meat tasted bland and dry\n- The only thing I enjoyed was the shank which was tender and moist\n- I did enjoy the roasted vegetables... \n\nThe only saving grace might be some local beers in bottles... Dieu du Ciel did make the dining experience a little more enjoyable.\n\nSadly I doubt I will be coming back again really soon...... unless I can have that foie gras all for myself!"
2,"Food was good. Waitress \""Maggie\"" has no common sense. Spoke with owner and got things cleared up. Still won't go back again."
2,"Why do people eat here?  It was packed on a Thursday night.  We had to eat in the bar to avoid a 20 minute wait to be seated.  Everything on the menu is SOOO Expensive.  The only reason we stayed and ate is we had a $50 gift card.\n\nWanted to order something eat that we could share while having our cocktails.  The waitress could not recommend or guarantee anything that was gluten free.  So I just ate all the free bread and butter they brought and then we ordered dessert.  He got the ice cream sundae and I had a lemoncello raspberry cheesecake or something like that.  The waitress recommended it.  It wasn't very good at all.  I only ate a few bites because I didn't want to waste eating that many calories on something not so tasty.\n\nWith three cocktails (A mojito for me and 2 gin and tonics for him), the sundae and slice of cheesecake, with tip was $45).  I think that is quite a bit.\n\nThe best part was the free bread, no joke.  Service was pretty horrid as well."
2,"First, this place reeks of being a national-chain-franchise-type restaurant.  The staff is trying to be enthusiastic like they have been instructed, but it feels very fake.  \n\nOtherwise, the burgers are good.  As you have heard, the standard burger contains two patties, the smaller version has one.  The fresh-cut fries were excellent, maybe the best in Tempe.\n\nWe may go back, but probably won't go out of our way."
2,"The rooms are very nice, clean and comfortable. \n\nFamily above us was very loud, early in the morning I could hear them eating stomping on the floor.arguing...chairs sliding etc.. really took away from the experience.,\n\nWe were in the Lily building right behind the office. The parking was horrible, there were never any spots near the building open. Had to dump the in-laws on the curb since they are not able to walk so much. Then Id drive around praying for someone to leave. the casino next door was closer than the parking garage to our building.\n\nWiFi is an issue too.. 40 bucks for the week on 1 device.. gosh every hotel we were at on our trip had free WIFI but not the most expensive.. .. I only pay 19.99 a month at home.\n\nOne of my guests was approached at check in to do the time share presentation. The lady started filling out a form for him for the next morning and he said he may not be able to go but would try, she rudely asked him if he was going or not? He told her he didnt know, she tore up the slip and said never mind have a nice day.. REALLY??? Welcome to Vegas!"
2,"My wife goes here ever chance she get, but I refuse to go with her. Coffee deserves 5 stars but the chick behind the counter is so rude. I refuse to spend money at a place that lets it indie hipster staff treat regular Joe's like my self rudely."
2,"We have been here 3 times, and the service has been bad every time. The view is AMAZING, but because of the poor service we will not return."
2,"Had dinner there last week ...... went there with great anticipation because of its legendary status in New York ....... mildly disappointing but easily correctable .... the place itself is fun ... its old-timey Italian restaurant decor with all the celeb photos hung on wall ... very professional and most attentive service...... good food but not great ...... seems like the kitchen is trying to '' play it safe'' and the result is a very ample portion of just slightly above average entrees ...... my veal dish was good but not as good as I had hoped based on the Rao's reputation ( hype ? ) .... so they have a nice,fun setting,great servers and decent offerings but if they really got into that kitchen and tweaked their prep a bit ...... they'd improve on a product that is just a tad on the bland side. I hope they address this as it is a fun restaurant with good personnel ."
2,"Meh. Sure, the hot dogs are good, and you can get it piled with toppings. But it's quite expensive for what you get!\n\nAnd I was really excited to see they had Poutine on the menu, as my Canadian brethren had told me legends about the stuff. But I came away a little disappointed. Guess I'll have to wait until I end up in Quebec to try it again!"
2,"My #1 pet peeve with this airport is that you must board a tram everytime.  Why?  SFO is bigger yet there's no tram.  \n\nWhile waiting to fly home, the jacked up PA system near gate D1 was ear-piercingly loud and distorted.  Are they oblivious to this?  They even have to add the 3 loud ass toots after their deafening message just for added pleasure. Everyone was covering their ears from the shreiking.  Are they that busy with checking to see if people are sneaking water bottles onboard that they don't know this?\n\nAlso, why is it that a taxi ride to the hotel is $25 and only $15 to the airport?  Isn't it essentially the same distance?"
2,"Came here yesterday and didn't have a great experience like I've had at many other Yard House Restaurants before.  We were able to be seated right away +1 star.  \n \nOur waiter came over and we placed our order. Lunch special with pizza and tomato basil soup, kids meal with pizza and veggies and ahi appetizer which  was being eaten for lunch and not appetizer.  My cousin also ordered a beer, which took forever to come out.  The waiter finally came over after about 10 minutes and said they had to replace the keg.  \n\nBeer finally came, next we waited for our food... And waited, and waited and waited!  Thank goodness I had snacks in my bag for my 3 year old to settle him while we waited.  When the food did arrive, the cheese on the pizza looked old and dry, as if it had been sitting under the heat lamp for quite awhile.  We only had a few bites and moved on to the soup, which my 3 year old and I basically split because it was delicious +1 star!\n\nThrew the leftover pizza away since it was gross."
2,"Wait wait wait... this place is still open? No, seriously? Um. I'm confused. No, I mean like, in business? Operating? A manager? Employees? Hours of operation? Transact monies? Uhhhhh. You sure? Because when you define \""Air\"" as a smoker's patio and \""Earth\"" as weird alien shit on the walls and \""Fire\"" as the burning of your ear drums and \""Water\"" as a place to buy really expensive drinks that dehydrate you, I just can't really comprehend how our $30k millionaire ballers can afford to keep this place going, even in an economic environment that protects only their class. But that's why I'm a $20k impoverished sycophantic parasite on our society. No business sense. \n\nTwo stars for the money they put into this place in the first place. And the elevator to the private VIP bullshit area. Classy. Retarded classiness."
2,"45 minutes d attente, au lieu des 20 annoncees, pour \u00eatre en terrasse, la salle \u00e9tant vraiment trop bruyante, \u00e7a.commencait mal... \""Les meilleures pizzas de Montr\u00e9al\"", bon, ca valait surement le coup d attendre. Et bien non... La pizza du chef n'avait aucun interet tout comme les pates d un de mes amis, noy\u00e9s dans une sauce grasse insipide... une addition elevee m'a convaincu de me mettre que deux \u00e9toiles, le seul int\u00e9r\u00eat \u00e9tant la terrasse, agr\u00e9able. Bref, une adresse \u00e0 \u00e9viter, pour qui aime un tant soit peu la cuisine italienne!"
2,"The exact definition of two stars: MEH. I'VE EXPERIENCED BETTER.\n\nAs for someone who LOVES Korean BBQ and always eats it every other week, I do not recommend this place for KBBQ. I've been to many KBBQ places, but I have never seen KBBQ to be $30+. It's not very surprising that this place would be $$$, I mean almost everything on the Strip is PRICEY. Since $30 for a very small portion of kogi was definitely out of the question, I decided to order dolsot bimbimbap instead. This dolsot bimbimbap was the most expensive I have ever paid for. There's nothing special about this place. I'm giving it two stars because the food was descent and the waitress was nice enough to be honest about size portion of the KBBQ meat.\nNever again."
2,"There are two types of people who are patrons of this establishment: the elderly and people with free passes.  We had free passes.\n\nMy fiance's work gave him two sets of Regal movie tickets.  That would be great back in Seattle where the company is because Regal's are all over.  Here, however, there are only two theaters in the Regal family and this is one of them.  The other is on Northsight somewhere.\n\nWe saw a 645 movie and it was all old folks.  Even with them, the place was deserted!  There is one guy working concessions (with his first AND last name on his name tag - I thought that was a little weird...), one chick in the ticket booth, and that's about it.\n\nThe actual theater was even worse.  The screen wasn't all that large, the sound was awful, and it was an \""old school\"" theater.  I consider a \""new school\"" theater to be one with stadium seating.  This theater you actually walked uphill when walking towards the screen.  Sounds backwards to me!  It actually might have been worse than a regular \""old school\"" theater.  If we hadn't had free passes, we would have left.  Instead, we stayed and toughed it out.  \n\nI guess we'll venture to the Northsight location for the other two tickets.  I thought most of Scottsdale was upscale with a lot of folks around, not scarce and geriatric like Sun City.  I am no longer wondering why no one has reviewed this place - it needs to be put out to pasture!"
2,"This is NOT a 3 star hotel/resort. It is a 2 at best. The rooms smell musty, the interior and linens are not clean, and the entire place just looks worn out. Maybe back in the day it was something more but not now. The beds were lumpy and the linens were of questionable cleanliness which made me look for bed bugs - which there were none although there some type of small critter in the tub. On the plus side, the Speakman shower heads are great as was the water pressure and hot water.  Still, not a place to which I will return."
2,"So we were back on this side if town and excited to have an excuse to return. Hate to say it but we were disappointed. Zucchini fingers were not crisp. They actually bent in half when you picked them up. Also, they no longer serve them with tatziki (sp?) sauce but will charge you $1 extra for a really small container. Um, isn't that like going to an American diner and being charged extra for ketchup?  Also, the zucchini desperately needed salt. \n\nMy beef and lamb gyro was ok. A little dry. Hubby had their famous Oscar burger that comes with pastrami on it, which was dry. \n\nThe little salad that came with the meal seemed to have a cup of dressing on it. Yikes!\n\nSorry to say but won't be stopping by again. Better Greek food at Stephanos which is closer to us anyway."
2,"Speak up if you want a drink before you've dropped $300 in the machines. It's pretty hard to get served. -especially after 10pm, even if its not busy. When you do get your drink, you may want to order a double b/c it's gonna be a short jigger of whatever you ask for. \nThe only reason I give this the 2 stars is because they have a really great \""Rooster\"" salad.\nUnfortunately most of the regulars don't seem like the kind of people that eat much. They seem more like the kind of people that took a break from feverishly cleaning their grout & thought they would take their teeth grinding out in public... Very intense. Lol"
2,They should put the flies on the menu! We went for lunch and were bothered by so many flies that it ruined the meal. Just be prepared!
2,"I was sadly disappointed, after reading all the excellent I thought it was shoe in. not so much. Long wait for food then it was just ok. Id rather pay more for food that tastes amazing and doesn't take forever to get."
2,"I was a skeptic of this chemist of brew.\n\nNeedless to say, I wasn't too far off.  This is great for a night out with the boys to watch the game.  That's all I can say since I wouldn't recommend coming here to chat.  \n\nI ordered me a beer and some fried fish and chips.  I don't like soggy food, but I guess that's how it comes here.  The fried fish was laid on top of my garlic fries, which were way greasy.  As the fish and fries came together it was a hot soggy mess.  I might want to add tasteless too.\n\nThe place definitely has a pub look and feel.  Live music when I came that night, but the football game was going on too.  Rowdy fans and loud music doesn't go well, but I guess it wouldn't matter after a few drinks.  Our service was good, but splitting checks again can be a challenge. - Enjoy!"
2,I went for their lunch buffet and was expecting a buffet. It was a few dishes and the honey chicken turned my mouth into a glue trap. Haven't been back since.
2,"After all the reviews, decided why not give it a try?  WOW, packed on a sunday nite with a 20 minute wait.  Know all about eating the spicy mudbugs after living in houston 7 yrs.  The crawfish were really good, not soggy and mildly spiced for my tastes choosing the hot n juicy spice.  They were out of stone & blue crab, leaving only king legs and snow crab to choose from.  I got the tiny sized snow crabs, my friend got the shrimp platter.  both were mostly fries.  this place would die a quick death in south texas or the bayou country.\n\npros: food came out really fast, miller lite by the bottle served really cold.\ncons: limited items available that night, say they serve beer & wine but wine was only sold by the bottle last night.  atmosphere gets a zero, we were packed in like sardines, forgive the pun. waitress seemed frazzled, maybe it was her first night.  had to ask for lemons, WTF?"
2,"Disgusting food, disgusting desserts. \n\nIt's all superficial here - everything looks good until you take a bite out of it. The pastas and noodles were overcooked and oversauced, the fried foods (you usually can't go wrong with those) were good until I bit into one that was all breading and oil, and the mac n' cheese didn't fail to disappoint.\n\nThe desserts were bitter or plain disgusting and the soft serve ice cream was icy and cheap tasting. The cookies, which looked really good - did not live up to their looks.\n\nI do give Hometown Buffet two stars however, for their dinner rolls and mushrooms. THOSE, well... Those were pretty awesome."
2,"I booked TWO rooms for my and my friends to have a good time in Las Vegas! We love Vegas but will definitely stay at  a different hotel at our next visit.\n\nFirst, we checked into our first room at 1:30! Yay, one room was ready! and our 2nd room was suppose to be the connecting room next door, but.. that didn't end up happening. :( our 2nd room was not ready until 6:15pm and wasn't even the connecting room! \n\nAnd in our 2nd room we didn't have shampoo or conditioner!! So I had to call for them to bring it up but it took them 1 hour to do so because the runner was all backed up! Aye mi. That was just the beginning... Then we called to go to Marque and the concierge put us down, but later we found out from a promoter the club wasn't even open that night! (Thursday on 4th of July!) only one of the rooms (Boombox, which isn't the main one) was open! The concierge failed to tell us that! \n\nAnyways, I don't want to keep complaining BUT I will say for a luxury hotel, their staff from the receptionist desk to the concierge, to the security that didn't know where things was or how much the buffet cost all need some training. On the job training is NOT enough! I think for this price, the room and staff definitely could have been better. I would stay at an older but more experienced hotel.\n\nHope this helps!"
2,This is an alright place if you haven't experienced some of the much better places in Arizona.  I think it is somewhat overpriced compared to similar restaurants and the food isn't anything to rave about.
2,"This gym offers a great selection of classes; however, there are more negatives than positives with this gym. Parking is difficult to come by, and you have to pay. The staff is not so friendly, it's expensive for the quality of equipment, and I wish someone was sitting at the desk downstairs instead of upstairs. \n\nI can't wait for my contract to end; I regret signing one now. There has to be better gyms in the area."
2,"Popped in for a take out order on a very busy Sunday afternoon. I don't know why the OG gets so busy on family holidays like Mother's Day, but on this one it was packed solid with people waiting outside, inside and in the bar area.\n\nWe were able to place our to go order with the very busy takeout manager. That guy should get five stars. But the rest of the place, not so much. We sat at the bar for 30 minutes waiting to place the order and then waiting for it. Could someone have asked us if we wanted a drink? Maybe offered a glass of water? Nope.\n\nThe food was OG standard but again it was packed perfectly with the salad in an interesting container that kept the lettuce and such fresh with the dressing and croutons separate. They also put a separator to keep the cold stuff from affecting the hot stuff.\n\nTwo stars because the place was less than tidy and the bar staff didn't seem interested in customers. Otherwise, it would have been pretty good."
2,"If you are going to serve New Mexican food, then serve it, don't water it down and serve things up like they do in the real state. I spent a month there and nobody in hell would use a whole Green chile in making the Chile Relleno. You use either a Poblano or an Aneheim and then cover it in your green chile sauce. The guy next to us eating his meal was complaining alot about how the sauce wasn't hot at all. \n    Chips and salsa were free at the bar - they were decent with two salsa's. Also noticed like another Yelper did that the food comes out like 2 minutes after ordering. This can only mean one thing, nothing is made to order and that means you can do alot better than the food here. The fake Chile Relleno was enough to send my running."
2,"We have ordered pizza from here 3 times now (I see your 3 strikes and you're out comment Jen H - funny!) and each time it has gotten WORSE!\nThe last pie (Hawiian) was just last week and it arrived SOGGY all over the bottom! Could not eat it without first trying to crisp it up in oven (failed to work).\n\nI called and the owner answered. FIRST he told me the Hawiian Pizza is ALWAYS like that! OKAAAYYY....  I disputed that and he then said all the ingredients were fresh - I should hope so! THEN he said \""what do you want, a credit? Next time you call,  remind me\"". \n\nI was not feeling well that night or I would have likely fought harder on this issue, possibly even had the driver return, take back the soggy pie and give me my money back! \n\nAVOID this place! Lousy pie, lousier customer service!"
2,Beer and apps were okay but if you are looking for any sort of craft brewing atmosphere this is not it. Service was below average yet the place was slow. I like Sleepy Dog in Tempe but will never return to this location. Maybe it's an attempt to appeal to everyone but it just doesn't work here.
2,"I was excited to dine here... Until I dined. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the food--simply mediocre and along the same line of Chinese food I could get for $40 rather than $240. The dim sum was decent but the snapper was dry and the prawns and curry just didn't work for me. The nightclub, to add, felt like a cave and my party and I left shortly after being escorted in. I will say, however, service at the restaurant was excellent."
2,Expensive for what it is. Burger (6oz) fries and soda over 10 bucks. The fries were 2.40... And not for a five guys portion either! \n. Service was slow too... And the place was not packed out. I predict they will not last long.... Like johnnie brusco's.
2,"Ewwwww\n\n\nAre people just giving this place good reviews bc they want to pretend like they're super cool and are totally down with hole in the wall places in the hood?? \n\nBc this was seriously nast. We ordered the queso w chorizo and that was bomb, I'll give them that.\n\nOur food came out, I had one bite of my chilaquiles and was like ready to spit it out. The green sauce was creepy and the steak was very off in flavor and not seasoned at all. I asked for a to go box and boxed up the steak to feed my dogs. \n\nMy friend ordered their torta. She was like 'I can't tell if I don't like this bc it's gross or bc I'm full' I tasted it and was like 'bc it's gross.' she called me today to tell me she tried eating it for breakfast but threw it out bc it was nasty. \n\nWe'll be sticking to the torta from Gallo Blanco, bc even though their service sucks, at least their torta is amazeballs. \n\nSeriously some of the grossest food I've tasted. The staff was friendly and the place was clean and packed. I just personally find the food super nasty."
2,"I became a patient of Dr. Barrettoko after my favorite doctor at Nevada Family Care moved on.  What a disappointment that was. I would have followed her, but her new facility did not accept my insurance.  \n\nDr. Barrettoko is not of the same caliber as the previous doctor. The final straw was during my last appointment. As I was telling Dr. Barrettoko what I was feeling, what symptoms I was experiencing and I caught her texting on her cell phone.  She works with an iPad-like device that has the patient's medical records on it.  She was trying to hide her cell phone behind the tablet as she was texting away. Unbelievable!  If want a doc's I undivided attention do not visit Dr. Barrettoko.\n\nThe rest of the staff is nice enough. I do not have experience with any of the doctors at Nevada Family Care."
2,"The happy hour prices make it affordable but the food quality still doesn't match the price.  I've had a fresher tasting roll at AJ's grocery store.  My colleagues and I went here for an early dinner (they eat here a lot) and even they said it was not as good as before.  The tuna for the hot & spicy tuna roll and the \""lollipop\"" was so over diced that it was actually mushy.  When we brought this to the attention of our server he just made a scowl said sorry and took the still full of food plate.  No discount, no formal manager apology, nothing but the bill dropped off as he dashed on by."
2,"There's free parking in the back which is a plus & with your receipt, you get 10% off any souvenirs in the upstairs gift store.  The food's ok but one of our group of 5 substituted the touted mac n cheese instead of fries but when his plate came, no mac n cheese.  The waitress dumbfoundedly stated what? no fries either? when it was brought to her attention!!"
2,Cool ambience. Drinks were good. Service was SO awful. Very unorganized and hectic. It took over an hour for our food to come out and it was cold. Super loud which is fine for a club/bar but don't expect to be able to sit and have a convo while you eat. If you have a group that needs separate checks...good luck. I've worked in a restaurant for over 10 years and I'm patient when we go out on a busy Saturday or Friday night but they need to get it together or it will be another failed bar in the south side. Totally a waste of a Saturday night.
2,"The most inexpensive place to eat at the Wynn. \n\nAccording to Mr. Wynn the Pizza Place gives NY style pizza a run for its money. I beg to differ. \n\nI was really expecting the pizza to be excellent. It was only okay. You can order a pie or by the slice, start with a simple cheese pizza and add on ingredients and price. \n\nI had a \""cheese\"" pizza with pepperoni, onions, and peppers. First of all I expected the peppers to be green but they were red. I also expected the ingredients finely chopped, they weren't.\n\nThe pizza itself was good but a little too greasy for me. With nothing but a fancy napkin to blot it with, I just didn't blot. The slices are big so that's a plus.\n\nAlso tried their basic vinaigrette salad which was okay, again not the best and the dressing wasn't mixed that well against the greens (come on people).\n\nMy favorite thing here was their iced tea that had a hint of passion tea but wasn't sweet. \n\nDue to the wind outside we were forced to sit inside and were not able to enjoy the sounds of the waterfalls outside."
2,"If they could only figure out how to take phone orders without putting people on hold for 6, 7, or 8 minutes or more, they'd be doing well. This Domino's is very close to my house and when I get a craving for their new, rather yummy, thin crust pizza, it's just easier for me to drive up there and order.  But then I'm relegated to sitting in the very drab waiting room.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily recommend this location too much after sunset. They've had some issues in the parking lot (shootings and the like)."
2,"The decor is the best aspect.\n\nTERRIBLE service. The waiter could not show us on the wine list where anything was.  He did the fly by \""is everything ok\"" without stopping. One glass of wine i ordered was corked--but nothing from the waiter.\n\nWe ordered first soup, then appetizer, then our meal.\n\nThey rushed out the soup and appetizer together (this on a not busy night). We asked them to slow it down but apparently they don't know how. it felt like Applebees' services with higher priced food.\n\n\nThe food is not tapas--there is a very small appetizer menu. Of that the octopus was delicious, as was the onion soup.  the entrees were not at all memorable. We did not bother with dessert.\n\nEven had we decent service we felt like this is a restaurant trading on the chef's name with no hint of the august heritage. a misuse of a brand name chef--or an over extension of a name with one restaurant that does not meet the standards. This restaurant could not survive without the Hubert Keller name."
2,"This was an up and down experience. The service was definitely lacking: upon arrival- the absence of a bellhop to help with bags, the hair in the shower of our room, the stain on the sofa of our room (beyond disgusting). However I love that the rooms have balconies and some great views. The casino is nice and the location is great since it is pretty much smack in the middle of the strip. However, for the cost there are definitely better options."
2,"It's too bad with so few good Mexican restaurants, what passes for good now is just very ordinary. The food at Lindo is plentiful on the plate and not outrageously priced... it's just that it does not make you say, I must return here. \nFor folks in Henderson, it's a long trip up to the World Market Center, but that's where you'll find interesting and very creative Mexican fare... at  Mundo Restaurant. ..(moving from their previous location over on Ft Apache, wish they decided to come to Henderson instead).\nhttp://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2010/apr/14/viva-el-mundo/"
2,"My first experience here wasn't the best at all. My manicurist (a guy) must have lacked technique or something. I honestly think my nails looked better going in than they did coming out. Not to mention, my skin was cut from the cuticle nipper, and I got a nasty scrape on my skin from the nail buffer as well which had to be treated once I got home. To add, the pedicure was done in cold water. \n\nIt just stinks to have experienced more pain than anything. As far as the final result of my pedicure, it just looked sloppy and dull. I'm used to a smooth glossy finish on my nails and I ended up with air bubbles and over-applied polish. Perhaps this was my bad for not going to my regular shop, but I just wanted to give one of the newer places in town a shot. The final verdict: 4ur Nails is just not for me."
2,"Want to spend $$$$ on 'diner' food? Then stop in at BLT Burger. Just glancing at the menu one might think that the prices are somewhat reasonable, but beware. Fries are NOT included. Yep. That's extra. I had a Tex Mex burger which was decent but I've had better, and bigger elsewhere. The bun was soggy and it fell apart after the first bite. The spiked milkshakes on the other hand are awesome. Grandma's Treat is a wonderful concoction of Makers, vanilla, caramel, and nuts. All in all I would go back to BLT but only for the $11 (gulp) milkshakes."
2,"You get what you pay for. \n\nThe good things about this place is that its close to the middle of the strip with access to the city center, crystal shops, Aria, and Belligio through the tram. The hotel was cheap and the lobby is nice. \n\nNow the bad things: \n\n- The walls are extremely thin so you could hear every conversation, every toilet flush, every shower, and every door being opened and closed. They were so thin that you could hear your neighbor having SEX! Very disturbing!!\n- Housekeeping is horrible: we had five pillow and all but one had a stain. Even the comforter had a stain. \n-The bathroom, most of the furniture, bed, and television were outdated or old and need replacing.\n- There was no coffee maker. Why provide free coffee when you can charge $3.75 for a Starbucks coffee downstairs. \n- No mini bar\n-The smell of so called rose petals smells good at first, but soon gets overwhelming and give you a headache. \n\nIf you are looking for cheap stay in Las Vegas then this is your place. If you are looking for more comfort then I recommend somewhere else."
2,"I've come in here during my previous business trips and gotten great food. \nI have specific food allergies which they were able to previously accommodate, however not this time.\nI called in my order as usual, but they told me they changed their menu and what I wanted was a lunch menu item. The menu online hadn't been updated yet they still told me they wouldn't give me the food I was trying to order. \nThis to me is false advertising, and poor customer service. \nDont get me wrong, the food I had was good, but now I wont be going back because of this."
2,"We went to Tryst on a Sunday during lunch for a family member's bday. The menu seemed promising. I decided on the seared ahi tuna salad for myself and spring rolls to share. I didn't think to ask if anything I ordered was going to be hot. I assumed the spring rolls would be hot because I've never experienced raw spring rolls before and any time I've ever ordered a salad with some fish in it- the fish has always come out hot. This was not the case. Which is not a big deal but cold seared ahi tuna is not good. The seared part of the title is misleading. When something has the word seared, I expect it to be HOT... but that's just me. The spring rolls were tasty -I just did not expect them to be cold/raw. Nothing to write home about but it wasn't terrible. \nAnd my fianc\u00e9 found a hair in his salad and I lost my appetite."
2,"I just have to say its sad that I've not experienced some of the great wings I've heard so much about! I ordered chicken Parmesan and was so excited to dive into my half off happy hour wings! You get 10 whole wings for five bucks... That's gotta excite you! \n\nSad thing was, they were tasteless and greasy.  I kept biting into them thinking it would get better. I assure you, it did not. I ate three and had to stop.  It was like eating grease flavored chicken.  \n\nThe only redeeming thing about the meal was the tomato salad with huge pieces of mozzarella cheese. I really want to like this place... And I'll probably be back at some point. Heck, they still server beer.  That's good enough for me!\n\nHoping and wishing it will turn around though!"
2,"Let me start with a positive: the Cupcakery's red velvet cupcakes are phenomenal--moist and flavorful, and the frosting makes a perfect complement. A friend gave me one and I was excited to share this place with my boyfriend. Unfortunately, their other cupcakes were kind of a disappointment, especially for the price. For $3.75, I expect something pretty good, and a lot of it. Unfortunately, the cupcakes we bought were about the size and quality of the kind of cupcake you'd get at a grocery store--very dry, not much flavor, and the cream cheese frosting? Not as good on a coconut cupcake as the red velvet. The shop looked nice enough, and they were decorated fine, but not spectacularly--I think I could have done better, even with my meager decorating skills. If you happen to be passing by and really need a sugar fix, I say go for it, but otherwise not worth it."
2,"The ice cream is delicious but the place is filthy. Sinks, counters disgusting. Dust on the inside of the glass where ice cream is held. Only ordered because ice cream was covered. The door to the back room was open and that room was equally dirty. No health rating sign up, which is not good. Too bad because the ice cream was delicious. Clean this place up!"
2,"It's been 3 years since the last time I attended a game at Sam Boyd Stadium.  Not much has changed.  The Rebels are still terrible and the stadium is subpar when compared to other college stadiums.  They did win against Western Illinois the night I went, so that was a plus.\n\nThe stadium is outdated and the concessions offered here are terrible.  All of the points I made in my original review still apply....someday UNLV will build a new stadium and that will change, I hope....\n\nReturn Factor - 50%"
2,"I guess that I sport a very simple haircut and like to keep it that way. Unfortunately, the person who cut my hair here must have slipped with the razor just behind my ear and tried to make it look normal by cleaning it up and making the other side look the same. Since I don't typically look at myself for extended periods of time, I actually didn't notice until last night when I was washing my hands in a resteraunt bathroom.  I will be speaking with manager come Monday. \n\nI had no wait and the lady who can't cut my simple hair do was very nice, until she didn't say oops I sort of f*'d your hair up. It isn't really bad and I'm not horribly upset but it IS noticeable! It would have been nice if she said something to me about it. I think this warrants a refund of my money. I will let you all know if I got my money back."
2,"This place was alright, just not what I was hoping for. The curry was a little too soupy for my liking. The customer service was great, we had a really nice waitress but unfortunately I don't think that would be enough for me to want to go back."
2,"I'm afraid I'm going to have to downgrade my prior review as I've been disappointed the past couple times I've purchased from the Meat Shop.  The staff is still great, very helpful, but the product has let me down. \n First it was pork belly, the quality was not good-much fattier than my normal Asian market source but I figured homemade bacon's kind of a tough standard to judge quality as it's smoked and cured.  I then did a head-to-head with spare ribs and the ones from the Meat Shop were thin and tough while the ones I got at Smart & Final were meaty and juicy.\nI suppose if I better express what I'm looking for I might get better results but just because I don't that shouldn't mean I get crap, especially for triple/quadruple the price of the regular grocery store."
2,"the salsa bar is good, free chips and salsa.\nthe  people working on the counter are rude.\nhad the california tacos so plaine has no flavor\nwont be back"
2,I had the house special chow mein to-go for 8.10.\n\n- a bit better than panda express. pretty bland. \n- small portion for the price. few meat for their combo\n- 8.10 for chow mein and their AYCE dinner is10.50? bad pricing. \n- i have to come back to try AYCE. eating individual platters aren't worth it.
2,"I just noticed this was so highly rated and wanted to send a little more reality the way of the burrito drive. The only thing it has going for it is the fact it delivers, and would pass for a business meeting or simple catered event. If you are looking to go out to enjoy some Mexican food-you can look pretty much anywhere else and be happier.  \n\nI've tried this place a couple times over a year ago now, but doubt anything has changed. I disagree with the implication that chipotle or qdoba is inferior to this place. They are comparable, but I would rank chipotle significantly higher. So long as you don't think of this place as a mexican restaurant or receive the food for free, you might not be disappointed.\n\nCome here to remind yourself just how good places like El Pastor and Taqueria Guadalajara are."
2,"My friend and I swung by Phillip's for a quick bite while our plane made a stop in Charlotte (our gate was right next to the restaurant). It's pretty simple - sit down, place your order when a waiter comes around, and get your food pretty quickly. The only real complaint is that the food's a bit expensive (as all airport food is) and that they didn't have BBQ sauce when I requested it for the chicken tenders. Aside from that, the food was pretty much what'd you expect overall from this kind of joint. The tenders were pretty standard, served with honey mustard sauce. The seafood platter comes with fried shrimp, crab cakes, and some spring rolls. I felt better for not getting the bigger crab cakes when I had theirs - the crab meat was extremely nondescript, coated in fried breadcrumbs but with an indistinguishable taste aside from that. The spring rolls were okay, if unspectacular, and the fried shrimp was decent.\n\nYou're not going to get much service here - our waiter had to be flagged to give us our check - but it's an airport spot, so you can't really set expectations too high. I'd probably stop by if I wanted something other than standard fast food in the airport, but there's not much any other reason to come by here."
2,"The food was pretty good and the guacamole was awesome, but my boyfriend and I were not treated very well. I guess it's just Scottsdale, but the waitress asked us incredulously if we wanted a table, seated us, and then didn't speak to us for a good ten minutes. She was nice to everyone else, but she acted like our presence was bothering her. I'm sick of going to restaurants in Scottsdale and being treated like I'm not welcome."
2,"We have gone here a few times. \n\nMy gf being a vegetarian really loves the fresh salads and vegetables they have, It is a good selection and it is always fresh, but dang, its expensive for salads. \n\nService is always prompt. They also walk around with cookies and offer them to the tables, my kids love it of course, who doesn't like a nice warm cookie???\n\nAnd something else I hate is getting banged for drinks. I think they were 2.50 or 3 bucks. For soda fountain drinks???? \n\nIn the back section of the restaurant it always smells like feet too.. Just an observation.. :)                    \n\nThe pastas are just OK. Sometimes the soups are good. A friend of mine told me there is no way you can eat as much food as you paid for. I kind of believe that every time I go there.. \n\nThe funny thing is, with all this mediocrity, the place is always packed! \nI guess people love a so so place.\n\nI dunno, Sunset Station is just down the road, its cheaper and better and drinks are included!!!! \n\nI'm just sayin,,,,"
2,"If you want to be squished by hundreds of sweaty strangers with out even room to dance then come here. The restaurant is nice and I like the atmosphere the club has but Tao needs to seriously crowd control they let too many people in too fast, I was over it after 30 min. Not to mention the quality of people we ran into, maybe it was just random but this fat drunk Mexican literally feel on top of my girlfriend. My GF playfully smacked her ass when she got up. Apparently she didn't like that and started charging at my GF then tried to swing at her. Held back by all of her friends she finally stoped acting dumb and went away. I latter saw the same girl trying to dance on the stage where the bouncer kicked her off for being to raunchy. Thursday night might be better but I won't be going back. I've heard marquee and XS are much better clubs."
2,"I hate that feeling when you tell your server that you have a travel zoo, and wait to see whether they are cool, or treat you like a leper, guess where we fell? The couple behind my husband got the most amazing service because they got a prix fix meal with the wine pairing ( good for them!) the cocktails we ordered ( not included in the TZ) were short, and the drinks that came with the voucher tasted like sea water. Our bar bill itself was $100 so we always pay way over our coupon voucher. My husband ordered the seafood pot and salmon,which he found to his liking. I ordered the beef carpaccio and chicken with the sauce on the side. My chicken and the little side thing ( veggies?) it came with were dry. They also gave us a palate cleanser of squash soup ( was it supposed to be cold?) and some fishy paste, blah! I don't know, I was expecting the same service that I got from their sister restaurant, Andres but there was no comparison. The views are pretty. The only great thing was the crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e, that was good stuff. Not enough for us to be back though. Thank god we didn't tell the host we had the TZ like that other unlucky poster! I would've really had been pissed if we were sat facing a wall. if you don't like people with coupon vouchers stop listing them, it's as easy as that."
2,"I went here several times. It's usually good. The service is usually good.\n\nBUT the reason I put 2 stars is because they need to learn how to train their workers better. I usually get workers that work well. However, today I ordered gauc and chips, barbacoa bowl, and a carnitas quesadilla... and the only items I received were the quac with NO chips and a barbacoa bowl. I think the workers were either new, untrained, or deaf. And the line also literally didn't move for about 10 minutes... two girls were working at the time.. I don't know there names, but they don't do there jobs well and need to find another one."
2,"I shop at this location often because its so close to my home.\n\nThe majority of the time they have the products that I use in stock.\n\nThe downfall to this particular store is the lack of customer service. I don't typically need assistance on the sales floor since I know what I need. However if I did need help there would not be a soul around to assist me. I don't ever see any staff around except at checkout. When I get to the checkout counter the staff is not personable at all. I don't need a full blown conversation to occur but I would think a \""How are you?\"", would suffice.  Instead of talking to a coworker or the typical \""Do you have an Ulta card?\"", etc. You know the questions they are trained to ask . I would appreciate a thank you after my purchase.\n\nAgain I will continue to use this Ulta but only because it so close to home. If the customer service does not improve I will have a chat with a manager."
2,"$3 for a bowl of rice!!! Yikes! Late night dining options at the Wynn were limited and led us to this place. We ordered bbq pork, bbq duck and two bowls of rice $45. OMG! Sam Woo bbq we could of eaten the same thing for like $15 and it would of tasted better. I don't mind paying for a good meal, but being over charged for mediocre food just makes me pout. The server was an automaton, no smile, no energy, no emotion. Sad, Wynn, Sad! I just wanted a tasty late night dinner but no go at Red 8."
2,"Lost baggage and poor child wrangling. It's all about employee empowerment.\n\nI have the patience of the Madonna - all right maybe more like the Material Girl - but I am pretty laid back. After my humbling experience in the wine industry, I've been much more appreciative of service industry related jobs. But when employees are not empowered to answer the most simple of questions, and we're checking in on machines with nobody around to handle luggage, well...it's a disaster waiting to happen. It's an unfortunate thing that is supposed to help in keeping costs down and help with efficiency - but there's been consistent problems with all of my US AIRWAYS flights.\n\nLet's throw JFK airport into the mix to help maximize the disaster...we ended up in Orlando. Waiting for our luggage. Luckily our toddler was entertained with the luggage roundabout...because we waited through two flight arrivals to retrieve one bag. \n\nFamily that met up with us for the 4th assured us US AIRWAYS used a really efficient delivery service...Apparently the lost luggage situation is pretty common.\n\nGood thing the baby bug is a trooper when it comes to traveling - because Orlando trips tend to be family-heavy and the on-board US AIRWAYS staff consistently doesn't seem too thrilled to be dealing with even the well-behaved ones."
2,"Maybe we just picked an off night, but I was very unimpressed. We walked in at 6:45 on a Saturday night, expecting to have to wait for a table. Instead, we had to wait for the hostess, who was nowhere in sight. With all of the NCAAF on tv, I was surprised how many seats were empty. Once we were finally seated, our waiter appeared promptly to take our order. We started with bruschetta, which was good, but not good enough to bring home what we didn't finish. And at nearly $10, seemed very pricey for some bread with tomatoes and dressing. \n\nWe had heard that the mac & cheese was award winning, so my daughter ordered it from the kids menu. When it arrived, it wasn't the \""real\"" mac & cheese, it was the open a bag and microwave kind. She was hungry, so we let it be. My Wife ordered the lasagna, which she liked, but again at $12, was too pricey for what she got. I ordered the Tuscan Panini, which was very tasty. \n\nI don't think we'll be back, and if the number of empty seats on a Saturday night is any sign of what is in their future, they might want to think about changing things up."
2,"We tried this carwash for the second time yesterday hoping for a little better results.  Once we saw our car come through the carwash, it was evident that there were too many cars and not enough employees to handle them all.  We ordered \""The Works\"" which includes vacuuming and wiping the interior.  The exterior looked great, but as we drove away, we realized that the entire dashboard area hadn't been touched.  The guy was obviously too rushed to realize he completely missed that part.  Third time won't be a charm because we probably won't be back."
2,"Meh. Lot of hype around this place, but I was underwhelmed with the food. \n\nThe decor is really nice, and a great location but overall I wouldn't come back except for their extensive beer on tap.\n\nI ordered:\n\nSquid Salad - not bad, not great.\nSake Nigiri - salmon was not fresh too much rice\nSpicy Tuna Roll - tuna mix wasn't fresh and zero flavor\n\nTo top it all I asked for Nigori Sake. The server didn't know what it was since apparently they only have WARM sake. Not much of a Japanese restaurant."
2,"Well we got free passes since we stayed at the Treasure Island...and when we got there it was still super empty....and they were playing trance music that kinda just made me take a good nap....\n\nthey had free drinks that night \""Lemon Drops\"" more like lemonade and water!!.... it was hard to tell if this club was going to get any better, and we didnt want to risk it so we left and were planning to come back latr since they had \""in and outs\""...but we never made it back..... HmMmM wonder if it got better....\n\nthe patio did have a beautiful view of the strip and the little \""lake\"" very nice club."
2,"I went here after a late flight from Denver, as it was the only restaurant at our hotel that was really open, and we did not want snacky food. Let's just say the food was definitely lacking. I ordered a burger and it pretty much tasted like a hockey puck it was so burnt. Maybe try it Medium instead of Medium well next time? Scratch that I probably wont be going back next time I am in Phoenix, The service was OK but I have experienced better. I would not recommend this place, but if it is the absolute only place and someone else was paying I would not pass it up."
2,"Meh... That's about how I felt leaving SMG the other night. They were offering a Groupon for a $5 movie ($3 surcharge for 3D glasses). That was enough to get us in the doors. There aren't that many showtimes offered. \n\nThe screen was really small and the lighting from the stairs really threw off the movie viewing experience. I appreciate that they do the reserved seating thing but it was difficult to get four seats together without splitting rows. We ended up in the back row. \n\nThe service was noticeably slow. The waitress had a habit of just standing in the rows blocking the screen. That got really annoying... \n\nA few notes: The ticket counter is on the 2nd floor. Stop there first before heading up to the theaters. Don't forget your parking ticket, they validate. SMG is definitely not my first choice but I would return in a pinch."
2,"The cheesecake is good and the waitstaff tend to be friendly, but the food definitely leaves a lot to be desired. I've had several entr\u00e9es and appetizers here and not been impressed by any of them. I'd especially recommend avoiding the nachos!\n\nThat said, it's a decent place to go late night for dessert."
2,This place isn't all that. Maybe its cause I went in there to early in the day.  Didn't really look like a great place to party or waste a lot of time in. Although it did have a nice Irish look. But I still won't go back.
2,"A very large restaurant in the New York New York Casino. They offer \""outdoor\"" seating - meaning on the fake city streets within the casino. We chose the outdoor seating so we could people watch while we ate.\n\nThe Margarita was too sweet and a little watered down. They served it in a plastic cup rather than glass. That was a bit of a disappointment. They are generous with their chips and salsa. They also made us table side guacamole which was very good.\n\nFor dinner, I had a beef burrito. I've had better."
2,"Prob the most screwed up restaurant in Scottsdale. If you like to dine in dirty, outdated dive bar style restaurants so small you literally eat as one big family with strangers, who by the way consisted of drunk kids from the skatepark next door and large individuals who pretty sure spent most their time in jail. Your in heaven. They even have this bartender who you can read about in other comments who I'm certain is on Breaking Bad's blue meth. Nobody can talk as loud and as much as this guy. It's really quite the show. The little server girls who probably get lashed by bamboo canes from this guy are nice, the food was hot with good portions are the only thing they have going on here. Be prepared if you accept this challenge."
2,Service was exceptionally poor. \n\nWent here for a late lunch and we were the only couple in the restaurant. The waitstaff neglected us for 20minutes. \n\nThe food came out 30 minutes after we ordered and was awful! The pasta I ordered had dried out from sitting for so long.\n\nAvoid this restaurant on your next visit to lake Las Vegas.
2,"It's Chili's which means it tips out at three stars, but in this ones case it is small with slow service. Better to wait in line at Burgatory..."
2,"Not so much for me . Last years participants was not impressive. I would rather spend more money and go to one of the bigger events like devoured , feast on the streets , or taste of biltmore. My friends that go like it because its family friendly so i can see that point of view , it is family friendly and a nice way to kick off the summer."
2,"Hmm... I read so many positive reviews on this place that I was really excited to try it. I got the pat's pounder platter with pulled pork, beef brisket, added on ribs for 3.99 and collord greens and hush puppies for around $23.00, kinda pricy, but I was hopeful on the quality.  Here is what I thought:\nPulled pork - really dry, and almost crunchy at times... definitely pass on this if I had to do it again\nBrisket  - pretty good actually, salty but good and flavorful \nRIBS - Never again! They were pretty much all bone, and so dry that I nearly broke a tooth! Given that this was a $4 add on to the plate I feel somewhat angry about it\nHush puppies - ok, nothing earth shattering \nGreens - really bland, although it didn't taste salty, kind of a shame, because a pound of salt may have actually improved the taste."
2,We went with a group of 10 including 2 small kids for an early dinner at 530 on a Thursday. It was already packed. The service was very friendly but we waited over 25 minutes for our first round of AYCE. The food quality was ok but nothing to get too excited about. Prices were average. My biggest gripes were the layout- crowded floor and you have to walk through a wait station in front of the kitchen and not run into any servers to get to the restrooms...and the music. It was nightclub music- ok whatever- but it was as loud as a nightclub. The group consensus is that we probably won't go back. It wasn't a comfortable atmosphere and not worth that for the sushi.
2,"I recommend spending the extra money at the Bacchanal buffet in Caesars Palace! The first time I went to this buffet 12 years ago I loved it, but we recently were staying at the Mandalay Bay for a night and wanted to just dine in the area. It costed a little over $30/adult and $20 for my 5 year old. The food selection was not as much as what I remember it to be and it just seemed over priced. The quality was good, just disappointed on the lack of selections and having to wait for certain food items. I would not go back just because there are so many other places to choose from in Vegas. I would also rather pay $50/person at the bigger resort/casinos for a better selection of food/seafood."
2,"I had originally posted a 5-star review, but have now retracted it. While at The Brake Shop to have my brakes inspected, I also asked for an oil change and tire rotation. After they drained the oil, they realized they didnt have the proper oil filter, and could not locate one. They added some oil back in my 2012 Audi, and replaced the oil filter.\n\nWhen I went to Jiffy Lube the next day, the service guy there wouldn't touch it - there was oil all over the engine. I had to immediately go to the nearest Audi dealership, where they stated that either the oil filter was replaced improperly, or an incorrect oil filter was used. Had I driven any longer, this could have cause severe damage to my 1 yr old Audi.\n\n2 Stars because the store manager was very friendly, and didn't try to upsell me anything. Negative 3 stars for the poor garage staff."
2,Went here once for your curiosity and once because I was dragged here. Fat burger is mediocre at best. Its overpriced and takes wayyyy too long to get your food. In N out kills this place and is almost have the price. I would rather go to burger king or carls jr and those places are shit.
2,"Loved the ambiance, loved the music it wasn't too loud we could still carry a conversation. \nWe came 5 girls for their monday night comped dinner + 1 drink, you just pay a tip of $15-20 each which of course is great. However most of the food were half cooked sliders w/ground beef and the salmon. It seems like everything was cooked in a rush. Not sure if it was because the dinner was comped but I wouldn't come back here again to pay full price for a meal."
2,"The food was alright and I thought that the portions were a good size. But i think that the service was absolutely terrible. My friend and I walked in and two women at the counter ignored us for a couple minutes, said they would be with us in a second, continued to ignore us until we finally asked if we could just seat ourselves and they just said yes. We then sat ourselves - and waited for about 15 minutes before someone came up and asked if we were going to be eating there. From then on out - the service still was not very good and everything took a long time. The waitress wouldn't even look at us when we were ordering - as if she just did not care. The food definitely does not make up for the terrible service. I will not eat there again."
2,"My wife and I have been here two days, with two more to go. Room is tiny, shower is tiny, bed is tiny. Shower head is broken, ice machine doesn't work, breakfast is terrible, wi-fi is poor (weak signal everywhere in the building). But it's a good location, and the staff has been friendly, so I give it two stars."
2,what a messy place! If you want to look a good bargain you have to look carefully because everything is chaos! Even Big Lots has more order. Not worth my time.
2,"Love Costco, have been a member for 15+ years now.  A word of caution, you may want to count your pills before leaving the pharmacy.  Since May 2014, now Sept 2014 I have had three prescriptions shorted by several pills.  Picked up my latest prescription less than an hour ago, came home, and this one was short.  Dang, going back right now to have them get the quantity right."
2,"I attended a birthday dinner here for a friend on a Thursday evening. I had high expectations, as I'm a huge Asian food lover and have heard great things about Pittsburgh's recent restaurant openings (as I've just returned to the city). However, I was disappointed with the food and service. The dishes we ordered really lacked a meaningful Asian influence (although no one ordered the noodle dishes) and flavor. Skate cheeks, placed on top of small pieces of white toast, were pretty bland. The fried Brussels Sprouts were the highlight (obviously, but don't beat Meat & Potatoes). We should have skipped the desserts - both options were vanilla custard-based, one topped with Fruity Pebbles (somewhat cute, but very poorly executed).\n\nIn addition, our server seemed to lack experience and confidence - we had to ask to place our order AND had to ask for recommendations, as our server never introduced herself nor asked us if we'd ever dined there (no one had). \n\nHopefully the next season's menu will feature more \""grit\""...authentic Chinese and/or Southeast Asian flavors (ala Red Farm in NYC), b/c right now it seems they are trying too hard and missing."
2,"I'm going to give the Luxor 2 stars because I have alot of good memories of my stays there over the years. The Pyramid Cafe is a nice place to stop and have a bowl of soup and rest your weary dogs after walking to the Luxor from Bellagio.\n\nThe powers that be who \""upgraded\"" Luxor ruined it, plain and simple. It's a Pyramid, why in God's name would they get rid of the Eyptian motiff? It's beyond me. The new look is awful, really really bad. Knowing what they've done to Luxor and knowing how far down the strip it is from everything else that we go to Vegas for, I don't think I'll be spending any more of my time - or money - in the Luxor while in Vegas."
2,"Note: I judge Vietnamese places on four things: pho, spring rolls, peanut dipping sauce and avocado shakes. \n\nVietnam Grille just didn't impress me on any level. For such a highly regarded Vietnamese joint, I expected a lot more. The spring rolls were on the the smaller side. While the fillings were fresh, they were missing something. The peanut sauce was overly sweet and not that peanuty. The pho was severely over spiced and much too fragrant. The star anise was an overpowering flavor in the broth. The pieces of flank steak weren't the beautifully, paper thin slices that I've had at every other Vietnamese place. The tendon was undercooked and too chewy... Definitely not my fave. The avocado smoothie was no where to be found on the menu... One of the things I love about Vietnamese food is how much food you get for the price. I thought that Vietnam Grille's prices were on the higher end of what I'm accustomed to seeing. \n\nThe positives... The service was fine and the parking was plentiful. \n\nNeedless to say, I'll be continuing my search for my go-to Vietnamese joint in Charlotte."
2,"It Seems that Eliseevsky is under new management, While the experience was not bad it does not come anywhere near the previous reviews. First off gone are the Horseradish  / cranberry flavored vodka shots. When I went Eliseevsky no longer had a license to server alcohol. \n\nSecondly the menu has been reduced by a fair amount. The menu on the website (which has not as of this posting been updated) speaks of caviar, veal, beef in sweet & sour sauce, Shashlik\"" (kebab) and many more all of which no longer exists. \n I had the chicken Kiev  (butter filled); also sampled the borscht and my friend said the pork soup was good. The food was still good but none of it knocked me off my feet. \n\nThe atmosphere seems to have remained largely unchanged. Still looks like a log cabin, modern Russian music plays in the background. Our server also performed a selection of Russian titles (not sure if he was lip syncing or not).  The service was a bit slow even with the restaurant being mostly empty. But I attribute that to a loss of the art of dining on my part.  I will probably go back and try another dish or two but buyer beware the price remains at about 12 -16 a dish. I believe this to be a bit steep for what you are getting."
2,"Punked!\nIn a sentence, horrendous value for money.\nWe chose this place expecting a fine dining experience complete with great food and service. Unfortunately both failed and especially the service.\nWe had specified to our waiter immediately that we had an hour and a half before we had to leave to attend a show and he assured us we'd have plenty of time to enjoy our meal at a quiet and relaxed pace.\nOne hour and 10 minutes later our steaks arrive even though the 2 parties next  to us arrived later and had already been served all 3 courses of their meals. What's going on?\nCall it favouritism, poor planning or whatever, we had to engulf our meals in 10 minutes before rushing off to our show only to be late. Not only that, the waiter forgot to include the mushrooms I ordered, had them made quickly and then added them to our bill...so considerate of him. Where's the common sense in customer service? At least give me the mushrooms for free!\nI wish I could say the food was superb but it was average at best;  I've had better steaks  at 1/10 the cost, no joke.\nBottom line: if you're looking for a premium dining experience, think twice before choosing Delmonico."
2,"Very nice place to live in a very good area; however very pricey and the manager Nancy is horrible!!!!! She despises children by enforcing ridiculous rules for kids in summer by not allowing them\noutside without an adult at all times. Sh sent a memo stating absolutely no bicycles allowed in the courtyards( which was one reason that lured me to the place . I liked the fact that it was quaint and had a courtyard for kids to ride bikes) On top of it all Nancy also is such a control freak who despises children she took the liberty to call me to \""warn\"" me that kids aren't allowed to take out trash and what kind of mother allows their 10 year old to do this, This is not acceptable for residents living at Altessa. There's more, Nancy is so asphyxiated on emphasizing her power she even took liberty with putting a chain lock around the pool during summer nights after 9pm. How's that for controlling! Last I checked Altessa was kid friendly and not a senior 55+ community. Nancy seems to think otherwise!\n\nIf it weren't for the Hitler style management who tries to make the community a senior citizen one, and the rent being so high I would still be there, as to me it's best choice if you are limited to apartment living."
2,"I have been on the search for a good nail salon for some time now and this is NOT the place.  I get gel manicures every two weeks like clock work and every two weeks I am going somewhere new. I don't like when they use Acetone to soak off the old gel polish, it it extremely bad for your nails, and I'm not even sure what the half cut lime rubbed on my nails was for.  Also I asked her to just cut them a tiny bit and she cut them almost all the way down.  Not going back and the search continues..........\n(4)"
2,"Had lunch here before attending the Dec. Yelp Hours at Cartel down the street.  $6.95 Green curry w/ chicken called my name.  It's a good thing the server took my order before I had a chance to wait much longer- the noise level was driving me up the walls!  Sure, it was during lunch, but I've been here during dinner, too, and even though there were only four or five tables going at that time, the noise level was high.\n\nVeggie soup with tofu came in a small bowl.  Lightly-salted, fresh-tasting, perfect to get the juices flowing.  Soon after, a plate with jasmine rice, an oval bowl of green curry, and a small eggroll arrived.  Took a bite of eggroll and was disappointed to see * in the mix.  This is the first time I've seen * in eggrolls served in a Thai restaurant... Thai coworkers tell me that's not the norm.  (Another inauthentic dish served here is their pad woon sen- silver-bean noodles with veggies, tofu/chicken, and egg.  TB serves it dripping with sauce when it should be on the dry side.)\n\nCurry sauce was good, but looked too watery and not silky enough.  Medium-spiced, perfectly light.  However, the noise level, soggy pad woon sen, and eggrolls with * will keep me away."
2,"I had the Firehouse Hero, hot roast beef, turkey and ham. It really lacked in flavor, just tasted like warm mystery meat. This is my first time eating at Firehouse and I wasn't impressed. The meat was piled up in the middle so I opened it up to spread it around and with 3 meats it barely covered the bread. Expensive for a toasted sub. Also they made my sandwich on wheat but I asked for white, not a big deal, but when I asked to have it remade they didn't even apologize. And I had to wait until they finished making the other guests sandwiches. I won't be coming back, customer service isn't there, no flavor and overpriced."
2,"It's ok, good for a quick bite. I don't understand the almost cult like following.\nMade a mistake and had the shake instead of pop and was sick for hours.\nStaff was very friendly, but they needed someone dedicated to keeping the place clean."
2,"Is my bartender supposed to be drunker than I am?  I thought there were some rules about that.  This is the old Nick's Fat City building reskinned to look like a swanky deal.  It's really not a bad place for a show unless it is incredibly crowded.  If it is, you'll quickly learn what human sweat tastes like, and you'll forget what it was like to drink beer because you will never get back to the bar.  The last time we were there, I made it to the upstairs which was great, but since the bartender up there was seriously hammered, he didn't seem super interested in giving actual service.  The sound is good, the space isn't bad, and lord knows it's good to have concert venues in the area, but the bartenders kind of blow, and security was having trouble keeping up with the crowd."
2,"-Cozy atmosphere in a nice building with great outdoor seating \n-Server (heavyset black woman) was bad and behaved inappropriately\n-Food is slightly pricey for some dishes. Flank steak was amazing. Pizza was okay. Nachos were standard fare. Nothing special here.\n-Girlfriend saw server (slender black lady) use restroom, pick her teeth, and leave restroom without washing hands! This was before we left. Awful!"
2,"I didn't know that a return policy was so difficult. I went to return $28 worth of facewash and toner that broke my face out and the sales girl was making such a big deal that I had used half of the product. Almost anyone will tell you to keep with a facial routine for a week or two to see if it works. I bought the product two weeks ago. I didn't notice anywhere on the receipt that said \"" only use a few times, if you don't like it, bring it back\""...."
2,"The only reason I came here was because the TI provided us with a 2 for 1 coupon. The food was over cooked and greasy, and some just tasted funny. The desserts were the only things that we ok, not horrible but not great either. Very disappointing!"
2,"I haven't been back to a Chili's in a long time and when we were given a gift card after moving to Pittsburgh we decided to use it. Their service was really nice, but their food was lacking. My husband and I shared their fajitas for 2 and were given the wrong kind of protein, we asked for pork, chicken, and beef. We were given shrimp instead of chicken so they replaced it with the chicken. The waitress let us have the shrimp, but decided to not eat them since they seemed a little under cooked. Also when our sides to the fajitas were served we noted that the beans were cold, and had to flag down the waitress to heat them up. \n\nI will say that their pork was really good as well as their beef, their guacamole was tasty but could use more lime. \n\nThe ambiance was nice and the place was clean. But overall despite the friendly service, we were not very impressed with their food."
2,Wow this place has crazy prices for a sandwich come on get real I don't understand what justifies paying so much for a soup or a sandwich and the portions are extremely small do yourself a favor and pass unless you have money to blow
2,"I haven't had dim sum in a while so my husband and I came here to satisfy my long-awaited dim sum craving. We went on a Sunday before noon. No wait. First impression - I like that the restaurant feels inviting. One spacious, modern, open room, not a hole in the wall.\n\nTo my dismay, my feelings changed as soon as I tried some of the dishes. The food was disappointing. I regretted my craving choice. Most of the things we ordered were cold or just awful. The worst one was the beef spare ribs. So greasy, fatty, gummy, and boney. My shrimp wontons were cold. Chow fun were short pieces and dry, just the opposite of how I like them. Those ribs left a horrible taste in my mouth the whole day. The only thing that were decent were the shu mai and the shrimp flat rice noodle.\n\nOther saving graces were the decor, no wait, and the excellent service even though I'm not Chinese. The dim sum ladies were nice, explained what some of the items are, the server checked up on us, etc. \n\nOur bill was $38 for two before tip."
2,"We went on a Friday night as packed as it looked we actually went right in and got a table. The waitress was good and always on point with service. \n\nAs for the food I ordered the Jack Daniels ribs and shrimp. The shrimp were really good. As for the ribs they showed you shouldn't order ribs unless its a BBQ place. They were suppose to be baby backs but they were dry. Some parts of it were pretty good but a majority of it left your mouth dry wanting water. My wife ordered the steak, sadly a majority of that 10oz consisted of nothing but fat. \n\nTo top it off there was a huge party they sat next to us that ended up getting drunk off their ass. They were so damn loud and obnoxious you couldn't hear your own self think. I don't mind people being loud but c'mon you don't go to a restaurant and get blitzed. But from the way it seemed the manager and servers acted like its an everyday thing so what do I know I was just eating there. \n\nEating there made me realize why I never actually go eat there. Nor do I really plan on going anytime soon"
2,"Not my first time here but for sure it's going to be my last. So much for the \""best\"" package because it was the worse. Nothing was wiped down. Dust was still sitting on my dash board. Windows were horrible. Back seats and truck wasn't even touched. The side of my doors were all foot prints. I had to ask them to wipe this wipe that and I still brought it home and re did it myself. Probably the only okay thing they did was my tires. A so called \""shine\"". Won't be back and won't recommend it to anyone"
2,"With so many rave reviews, you would think this place would be great outside of the 11pm-4am hammered crowd timeframe, but not so much.\n\nAlthough getting a seat is much easier, this place is not really recommended for just a regular dinner.  Maybe it's because I'm not the biggest \""squeaky curds\"" fan, but no one at the table seemed to be blown away by the various assemblies of fries, gravy and cheese.\n\nI have had other poutines that would knock your socks off drunk, sober, or anytime of the day, but this would not be worth it unless you're drunk enough to wait forever in a line to inhale something that will make your hangover a little less painful."
2,"My nephew who lives in Madison LOVES this place so we keep going but I have to say that other than sitting outside, I don't get the appeal. The flavor options are incredibly boring- every time we go there it's just chocolate and vanilla and then a \""guest\"" flavor (on Monday it was Espresso). The people who work there are not very friendly or welcoming and generally don't have a grasp of the English language. On top of it, I'm not at all clear what kind of ingredients are being used. If my raspberry shake was in any way natural, I'd be surprised. There were no seeds at all (usually a good sign of authenticity) and it tasted a bit chemical. Is the milk hormone-free? I don't know. That said, it's a cute little place that attracts people of all ages and on this most recent visit, we learned about K-9 Custard, which our dog absolutely devoured (it's $2.75, so make sure yours is hungry!). Anyway, I wish I could give more stars but I have to be truthful- I have had much tastier and interesting ice cream/gelato experiences than this custard stand offers."
2,"Perhaps I expect too much out of a diner. \n\nThey put us in a room that was about 90 degrees. The waitress seemed more fit to be a bartender at the Rouge West than a waitress at a Diner. \n\nThe food was ok, kind of bland and tasteless. I much prefer My Mothers Restaurant for this type of food. \n\nOn the plus side a dude in a bear suit scared the living hell out of a small child, so the trip wasn't a total loss."
2,"We just moved to MTL and he had never had a smoked meat! We were a bit lost and hungry and stumbled upon this Dunns location. The roomies had just has a great Dunns experience back home. So I decided this would be a great place to intro TJ to the smoked meat sandwich. I was wrong. We split the traditional medium smoked meat platter (sandwich, fries, coleslaw, and a pickle). Positives - enough food for two, the fries were good and plentiful, pickle was tasty. Negatives - a bit on the pricey side (~$15 for what is supposed to feed one person),  smoked meat was meh (dry, salty, overly processed). Overall it was ok but I'll have a hard time convince him to try smoked meat again."
2,"Enjoyed the beautiful weather sitting on the terrace at the Wynn but our service was horrendous.  \""I'll be right back\"" translated into \""I'll be back in 15 minutes\"".  Same as \""your order will be right out\"" meaning \""I have not even put your order into the kitchen yet.\""  It took 35 minutes to get our food after we ordered it and the food was not that impressive.  My omelette was subpar, the hashbrowns were inedible and the french toast tasted almost burnt.  However, the black angus burger was delicious and after tasting my husband's burger I knew I made a mistake in ordering.  Don't go here if you are in a hurry and sit outside if the weather is nice so that at least the atmosphere will make up for the crappy service and mediocre food."
2,"Wynn, you have to be eff'in kidding me. I know you feed your employees better than this in the cafeteria.  Most of the food was per bunk.  You didn't even have lox with the bagels but you have no problem charging 40 bucks for breakfast.  Shame on me, you lost me for life. \n\nThe food: The only good thing about the food was the desserts.  The sushi was similar to  gas station sushi.  It was not fit for human consumption.  \nMake sure you confirm they are not serving breakfast.  I made the mistake and it was super expensive for pancakes and bacon. They had no quality breakfast food at all. Shoney's quality at best. \n\nThe line: 1 hour and 30 mins for sub par food. I should have went to McDonald's. NEVER AGAIN!"
2,"Maybe we missed something but the much hyped and beloved Honey Salt was just not good for us. We sat with the accomodating bartender for lunch. Started with extremely rubbery, greasy and borderline inedible calamari, it was a loser. We shared the famous Biloxi chicken sandwich which we found dry and kinda bland along with the My Wife's Favorite Salad(duck confit). The Caesar salad is also a misfire and has kale in it, yuck. The salad was devoid of flavor other than the miniscule fibers of super salty confit. What made the salad so awful was the cold, previously prepped and also rubbery overcooked fried egg on top of this sad salad. Luckily the bartender noticed the unappetizing egg and got me a fresh, correct and over easy egg. No real reason to go back unless you want to see Carrot Top at the bar."
2,"I went in on my lunch break one day to try out their bento boxes.  I ordered brown rice, garlic noodles, diced salmon, and diced filet mignon.  As you can tell with the pictures posted on here, Volcano Grille tries to bring a menu filled with healthful options (salad, choice of carbs, and protein). While this may be the case, flavor should not be compromised. I was actually a bit disappointed because their food was not packed with flavor.  I understand that they have a bunch of different sauces to pick from and take to go, but at least make the flavors of the actual food stand for themselves.  And no, the seasoning of the garlic on the noodles, and the rub on the fish did not really help.  \n\nBesides their food being a level or two above the borderline of bland, staff was really helpful.  The noise level is a bit average here, not loud at all.  The dining area was very clean, so I appreciate that.  \n\nI would say that if you do not really want to be impressed and are looking for just \""ok\"" food that you can just smother a bunch of sauces and sriracha on, consider going here."
2,"My girlfriend dragged me here because she wanted to have some all-you-can-eat crab legs.\nAt 7pm the place was packed but we were seated quickly. You do not pay 1st here. Drinks are extra.\nWell the buffet is really small and all bad asian food. lots of shrimp and fish and some crab legs, a few plates of sushi on plates covered in saran wrap.\nThe dessert bar was a joke-generic cookies and stale bad cake. Fruit and pudding with soft serve ice cream.\nWe were there for an hour-I made 5 trips & not once did they change out any food. The spare ribs looked terrible and everyone noticed because it was busy & nobody ate any. The crab was the winner.Everyone was loading up plates of crab. Myself I'm not into seafood.\n\nI see others have given this a positive review because its cheap but thats they only positive thing here. The food is not real impressive but there is all you can eat ice cream\n\ncheck here for pics @ http://www.usmenuguide.com/krazybuffetmenupics.html"
2,They move you from chair to chair as you have services done.  They did not have enough staff and Lannie was working on two customers at the same time.\n\nWhen I went to wash my hands the sinks were dirty especially around the faucets.\n\nNot impressed.
2,"The good: the cupcakes! We got a four-pack of, I believe, red velvet, pink champagne, smores, and the peanut butter chocolate one. They were all good, though I'm not sure what the pink champagne was supposed to taste like - it was a little odd, but you know, it's a cupcake. So I ate it. They're moist, the frosting is good, and that's what matters. \n\nThe not-so good: when we went in there were a few people there, not sure if they were the owners or their employees (they looked to be in their mid twenties or so) and they were all kinda.. rude. They just gave us this dead stare and seemed really impatient with us, even though we came in at a dead as hell time (monday afternoon, pre-lunch, since we were out). It just seemed like they wanted us to get OUT asap. After trying a few more flavors, the orange creamsicle and strawberry cupcakes taste really artificial and have a heavy chemical smell - ick.\n\nOn the chalkboard it said, \""Can't say anything about customer service, but the cupcakes are good!\"" and I feel as though that sums this place up perfectly."
2,"First: The food tastes all right, albeit very salty. However, after eating here for some time I had to stop. Unsure if it's the salt content or the amount of processed ingredients, but I feel terrible after eating here. \nWhich is sad, because I have a soft spot for the po'boy.\n\nSum up: if you don't mind indulging in junk food that's still vegan, this is a good place. It's convenient, it's fast, and it's pretty relaxed. \nBut if you're looking for something nutritious and clean, there are other places."
2,"I was craving some BBQ and took my mom here.  The menu looked like it had great potential and our mouths watered from the variety of offerings.\n\nThe biscuits were a bit heavy, but were tasty.  We split a two-meat combo. It was massive!!  We ordered the beef and the St. Louis ribs.  Both were on the tough side.  I had to ask the server if it was St. Louis or baby back ribs on the plate - because there was hardly any meat on it!  I was told St. Louis, but I swear they tasted like baby backs!\n\nWe also didn't care for the mashed sweet potatoes - it tasted like baby food.  We did order the apple pie and it was generous and tasted good.  Overall, it looks like it's great for gorups, has big food and drink servings, but fell short in taste and authenticity.  If I were to choose to go to a BBQ  restaurant chain, I would go to a Tony Roma's."
2,"Went on a Saturday and was excited to see what it offered as I just moved back to Pittsburgh from New York, which had great juice bars. The juice selection was very small, I hope it will be inspired by http://liquiteria.com/cold-pressed-juices.php and http://www.juicegeneration.com/menu/smoothies to offer a wider variety. Also I hope they will blend juices and or smoothies on-site. If they stick to their 5-6 flavors during the summer months, I doubt we'll return...that said, best of luck!"
2,"I'm a native San Franciscan, so of  course I've been to Crustacean and Thanh Long in San Francisco. Both restaurants are to die for, but this location's food is nothing like either one. I went to Vegas about 3 years ago for a friend's birthday, so of course we had to check out the place. We ordered the garlic crab and the garlic noodles. The waiter brought out to us a crab shell stuffed with crab meat and it tasted nothing like either of their places back in the City. I was floored! There's nothing like craking your own crab. Plus it was a tad bit more expensive. The location was nice, though. We decided to order a bottle of wine and just made the best out of the evening."
2,"Very disappointed in the overall quality and flavor of the food.  A la carte entree items, such as the curries and samosas, seemed like they might be leftovers from that day's buffet or even the day before.  The naan bread was overly plain and half-burnt without the texture and flavor I get at other Indian food places.  The food looked \""ok\"" (sauces were oddly neon in color), but lacked character and the taste of each item was very one-dimensional.  We ordered all food \""mild\"" on heat (although we can handle spicy food just fine), but most members of my party still got an upset stomach later that night.  Wish I could recommend this authentic looking joint to friends and family, but I can't."
2,Just had Father's Day lunch here. Enjoyed the food but not great service. Our server rarely came over. I was thirsty for more water 90% of the meal. Needed more salsa and had to ask someone else because our server was nowhere to be found. I get it when things are busy you cannot be everywhere but she didn't even acknowledge that we were clearly being neglected. That was my first time so could have been random bad experience.
2,I had ordered a pizza for the NFC championship game. I understand you could be busy but my order was cold and the cheese had dried out. Unacceptable.
2,"I'm giving it 2 stars for the service and quickness. Now for the food, we ordered the pad Thai and the pad se ew. The pad thai was a big clump of sticky gummy ramen like noodles you could barely chew let alone swallow, but the flavor was good they need a flatter noodle and the chicken was over cooked. The pad se ew had good flavor but the noodles were not wide the pork was tough.\n\nI prefer the food at the corner Thai kitchen around the corner on trop.  Give it a try and please let me know what you think.  I jugde a Thai place on the pad Thai if they can make that well, you can bet the rest will be good too."
2,"This place is way overrated. They hook you with their one signature item (a glorified Mocha Ice Blended from Coffee Bean) and get you for their overpriced basic menu items. The service is sooooooooo slow, especially for a place that really isn't that big. Good place to hang out if you're in the right mood and the right people though I suppose."
2,"The food is very good and I liked the atmosphere.  If you go for happy hour be very careful where you sit and then still ask the server.  We had a group of people on Wednesday and sat at a patio table only to find our table did not get happy hour prices.  Had we sat to the right of us at the bar or to the left of us at a different table, we would have saved about 50% on our bill.  Even the manager would not override it.  They said that we sat at a private table, this table was sandwiched between the front entrance gate and the front door of the restaurant, nothing private about it.  The waitress never mentioned it or suggested that we sit at the other table."
2,"Waited a really long time to be seated for a mediocre birthday dinner. I ordered some sort of shrimp pasta plate.  Our meal was a long time coming after being seated. My shrimp had gone bad...really bad, so I ordered something meatless. The replacement dish took so long to arrive that I ended up eating part of my wife's  I only had a limited amount of time before an event I had to be at and couldn't wait any longer for my meal. My daughter didn't finish her plate & my wife was underwhelmed by hers (same thing I had).  It just tasted bland to me.\n\nThere are too many alternatives in this town to wait 40 minutes on \""meh\"" entrees that are not inexpensive! That's what makes the world go round though. Some people swear by this chain. Just not my thing."
2,"I ordered decorated jumbo cupcakes for a small birthday dinner party.  One of the four cupcakes was to have Happy Birthday Grandma written on it.  The cupcake had a plain white plastic circle with the happy birthday grandma written in black marker.  Wow, I'm beyond disappointed.  Tacky, sigh... too late to get something else personalized.\n\nafter dinner party .....\nthe white circle was fondant not plastic...still did not like how it looked\nThe cupcakes were delicious though."
2,"I have NO idea why people are raving about this. I was a fan of them on the ABDC, but as a Vegas show they completely FAIL. The only good thing about the show was the music and when they did the first few moves from \""Single Ladies\"" - that cracked me up. \n\nOtherwise...  the attempted \""plot\"" was lame and made no sense (what's with the dead janitor please?) The dancers were out of sync. The costumes were boring. And the masks completely detracted from any personal connection to any dancer. \n\nSo my rec is: if you score free tickets, watch it, but don't pay for it!"
2,"Dear Beat, \nYou may be trendy, and you may be in the vicinity of an awesome center for creative space (Emergency Arts), but the hipster staff who take my order are ALWAYS snobby. Please smile and be helpful.\nExcept for  Heather (she's great) and the cute foreign guy; I like watching him slice my tomato.\n\nYour food menu IS great, and though I think your coffee and espresso are not the finest, the ambiance and weekly events DO make up for that a little. I wish I could love you, but I just don't think the connection is there yet."
2,"Well... I would maybe have been inclined to give Chez Claudette a higher rating if it hadn't been for the following....\n\nordered a poutine classique to go, and then because it was pouring rain decided to eat it inside by the front door.  Even though the place wasn't busy, our french quebec waitress told us that \""next time we order it to go, we have to eat it outside\"".\n\nthe sauce also kind of tasted like thick canned poutine sauce.  \n\nit was still a delicious poutine and we ate the whole thing.\n\nOur small poutine was around $7.  the same price as any other poutine spot."
2,"Man, the quality of Outback has really gone down since the last time I came here. I hope it was just an off night, but everything seemed to go wrong.  The menu was wrong on several occasions. My husband ordered the Sam Adams on draft. Says it should be a Boston Lager, but the Summer Ale came out. Apparently they were out of Boston Lager on tap but the server didn't tell us and didn't offer anything else. The chicken artichoke flatbread was delicious, but the menu says a \""sprinkling of parmesan cheese\"". The thing was heavily covered in it. I would have asked for light cheese if I'd known it was more like a cheese crisp. I ordered the steak salad medium, it came out medium rare. Also, it didn't say that gorgonzola cheese crumbles came on it, otherwise I would have asked for those to be left off. So unfortunately I had to send it back. The manager was very polite and took the flatbread off our bill, but when he tried to explain that they were out of the Boston Lager beer and that's why we got the Summer Ale, I was a little annoyed. Okay that's fine, it would have just been nice to know that in the beginning. Don't give me excuses. All in all it was a very mediocre service and just not as good as I remember."
2,"We had a nice dinner,, but my wife got food posioning..  She woke up 4am and was ill and continued to be ill that day..  Could keep nothing down and very dehiderated.   The management while polite seemed to think I was shaking them down when I asked for a partial discount off our $300 bill..   Rather hard to accept such an event when dining at such a place..  Better luck.."
2,"Ok, so going to Vegas, you have to do at least one buffet. However this place should not be on your bucket list.\n\nCrab legs...yes, prime rib yes....but both were of low quality and the prime rib was super dry. And yah, it's supposed to be a French buffet so they did have some of my macarons, but they were gross and unappealing. They didn't care about the presentation at all with respect to the macarons.\n\nThe food handles were sticky and gross. There's no wet naps or purell nearby. It's like someone purposefully lathered the the food handles with syrup and pretty much played a prank on everyone. Gross, and unattended, and lack of ownership amongst the cleaners and food servers.\n\nThe waitress knows who you are too, ethnicity, etc...so when she saw a bunch of filipinos, she got into Filipino mode. I guess she really wants to provide that awesome customer service, that or she wants a fat tip at the end. Either way, she was pretty attentive. \n\nIt was a Sunday, so champagne was included. They went all out with the Wycliff Jean champagne....whewwww. Mix with the oj and you get the mimosa. Not bad, they even allowed us to keep the bottle to walk aimlessly throughout the casino and along the vegas strip.\n\nFor $30, I would probably invest a little more somewhere else next time. This was more of a cafeteria leftovers like food with mediocre quality instead of the higher more quality food that can be found elsewhere."
2,"Normally, I wouldn't review a chain restaurant but the service warranted me to write a review.  This review is more for the service rather than their food.  OK, first thing first, when we got sat down, our server took our drink order. She got our drink and brought our complimentary bread and we placed our order.  It took 15 minutes to get our Blossomin' Onion.  As if that wasn't enough, it took another 20 for our main dishes to get to the table.  I guess the server saw us getting annoyed and gave us a weird excuse that their computer went down.  That is such a bunch of bull because the people that got seated AFTER us got their orders no problem.  I would rather her to have told the truth rather than making a BS excuse that didn't make any lick of sense.  So we got our food after over 30 minutes has passed and I do have to say, their food is prepared well and tasted good.  We ate our dishes with gusto.  When we finally got our check,after waiting for what seemed like forever after we finished our food (10 mins of waiting) and another 5 mins to get the change.  We spent more time waiting than eating.  Now I usually give at least 20% for gratuity, but for this instance, we gave about 12% so she would know the service was blah.  At that point, I was over the service."
2,"I am not one to write reviews but I had to on this place.  I was super excited to try this place.  It looks cool and seems to have a cool vibe.  I've been waiting for this place to work out some quirks since I have heard bad things and they have bad reviews on yelp.  I thought they are new and are just trying to find the groove.\n\nMy boyfriend and I went last night for date night. We saw all the bad reviews, then a couple good reviews showed up and we thought let's give this place a shot, maybe the other reviewers are just not used to this style of Mexican food.  The price is what I would expect at a this kind of place but the food was not.  The chips and salsa were great but the two entrees we got were sooooo bland.  Where is the flavor, it seems to be non-existent.\n\nOur server was great, she even offered to take one of the entrees off the bill.  Which I think is super cool because I assumed we would just pay for them and be unhappy.\n\nBottom line, I will not come back for food!\n\nI did see they have happy hour and I have heard the margaritas are good, so I will come back and try the discounted margaritas some time. Maybe if we drink a couple margaritas we won't care that the food is bland."
2,"A very ordinary sports bar.  Positives:  clean, attractive (if somewhat sterile) atmosphere; friendly, attentive, gorgeous staff; big-screen TVs and enormous projection TVs visible from any table make it a good place to watch a game.  Negatives:  need more craft beers on tap; menu somewhat boring and food needs seasoning (SW Turkey sandwich bland, side cole slaw lifeless); took 10 minutes to get my first beer even on a slow Sunday night.  Would give an extra star for fixing any one of those issues, two if all were fixed."
2,"Yet another Asian-inspired food chain! Oh c'mon do we need this in Champaign? We have so many Chinese/Korean restaurants in campustown and honestly, they are way better than Flat Top. \n\nSo, the whole stir-fry concept that they have is actually Mongolian BBQ. The difference is that they have tonnes of raw vegetables and ingredients to choose from. Oh, not to mention, weird sauces and food combinations. My combo was okay (it was brown rice, clams, beef, vege, salmon and roti prata) but if you don't have a sense of what goes with what, then your dinner is going to be a disaster. \n\nIt's clever of them to have this pick-your-own-ingredients kinda concept because if the food was bad and you complained, they can point their fingers back at you and say that you chose the ingredients. Then again, you are not the only culprit. The grill sensei is responsible as well. If he over-grilled your food, it will taste just as bad no matter how wonderful your selections are. My friend's moo shu was not wrapped very well and some of the rolls fell apart. Well, there goes your dinner. \n\nI think it is good to try it once but more that once? You decide. Still, the combo of rice, salmon and roti prata bothers me. Maybe I am just a stuck-up purist who thinks that chickpea dhal is the only way to go. Could this be a one-hit wonder like Bar Louie? We'll have to see."
2,"Scale of 1-10 (single visit):\n5 Food\n6 Service\n7 Atmosphere\n8 Value\n\nBy no means the best sushi.  Though weird as this sounds, grab some creme puffs!  Those are great!  But probably just from Costco.\n\nThey were also unable to figure out when we were done eating (lots of stacked empty plates with no one left eating?), so the payout was slow.  And during lunch table turns should be fast b/c people have to get back to work.\n\nHere's the cool part:  You don't (but you can) order off a menu.  You grab covered food off a conveyor belt that rides around the restaurant.  Apparently this is common in Japan.  I'd never experienced this before.  And the items are cheap ($1-$2), so you kind of just grab what tickles your fancy."
2,"I utilized him, Paul, about 3 years ago for a termite problem.  I picked him based on Yelp reviews.  He did the treatment and then had to come back to retreat about 4 months after the original application.  I called him on the phone and he said he would come back but he was not going to make anything since it was under warranty.  When he came to the house again he made it very clear that this was costing him money because it was all under warranty.  I have never experienced having a business owner try to make me feel bad for asking them to honor their warranty, a warranty that I paid extra for.  I will never utilize his services again."
2,"Shucks..a bit disappointed, last night I took family for the first time hoping to have the same experience as we did for about 10 times. The Clam Bake was the reason we always go on a Sat to have the $5 off, found that it wasn't anymore...crabs was an added option and you had to pay extra for it. It was still tasty but we should have gone to a buffet for the price we paid...It was still tasty though...Sadly..Shucks is now not on the top of my list..for value as the prices went up immensely..."
2,"The pizza is pretty good. Especially at 2am. But when it takes over an hour for delivery, no thank you. I shouldn't have to call 3 times to find out where my pizza is. Then when he finally showed up he asked for a tip. That's the best way to not get a tip."
2,"I Went here with my girlfriend last week for dinner, and I wasn't to impressed. The waitress was nice and accommodating but the food took forever to come out and there was only a couple other parties in the restaurant. When we finally got our food my girlfriends chicken was still raw. The waitress took it off of our bill and she sent it back to finish cooking. A little while longer it came back fully cooked. It did not have a lot of flavor but at that point we were just happy the food was there and it was safe to eat. I wouldn't recommend eating dinner here, but it is a good place for desserts."
2,I find it strange that people like this place. The food is not good at all. I adore anything chilli cheese..and all of their chilli cheese stuff is pretty gross. I can make better hot dogs at home. I only keep coming back for their ice cream and lemonade float. Yum. But I really dislike the food. I've tried everything on the menu and have to keep coming back here..my favorite food is the jalapeno poppers which are delicious. I just buy a bunch of those.
2,"This is from a visit about a month ago.   I had a burger and a couple beers and my wife had a chicken flat-bread and a couple cocktails.  My fries were limp and overdone and the burger was lukewarm when served.  My wife's food quality OK.  The one thing that stood out was the lack of any urgency whatever to service.  I didn't time the wait staff or anything like that, but there were delays being seated, getting a menu, getting drink reorders, getting food orders from the kitchen, and finally, getting a check.  It was very obvious to me that the slot players and a couple \""regulars\"" got a ton of attention and prompt service from the staff---everyone else, not so much.  Docked Mr. John a star for crappy service.  Even though I live close, there are so many consistently better neighborhood joints and I won't choose to return."
2,"this food is cheap for a reason.  The egg rolls are floury, the fried rice was cold and tasteless and although the veggies in the vegetable lo mein were crisp and fresh, it was so full of garlic you couldn't even taste them.  The location is on a grimy street although the restaurant is clean and fairly quiet.  There are so many chinese restaurants in Madison, I don't know why anyone would go to this one."
2,"It's not enough to inspire me to change the star rating on my review, but it is worth noting that David, the General Manager of Rice and Company, contacted me to express his concern and regret about the lack of service I received on my visit. That's the kind of attention to customers I would have liked while I was at the restaurant. Maybe there will be some kind of trickle down effect, or whatever the economic term might be, but doubtful I'll volunteer to test that firsthand the next time I'm in town."
2,"Obviously great selection of Rebel merchandise but outrageous prices. Seriously, the prices are almost twice what they should be. Why does the same hat cost $30 here, $20 at the ballgame, and $16 online from the manufacturer? But... If you want nice Rebelbilia, they've got stuff here that no one else carries. Bring a few quarters for parking."
2,"First, their clothing is arranged by color, not by size. While thrift stores may think this looks great, it's not great for people shopping for one size.\n\nAlso, their prices were outrageous. Many of the items I liked I could have bought new for a little bit more. The upscale prices did not match the dingy and dirty store. We won't be back to this one."
2,"If we could get my g-parents network switched over, I'd NEVER have them return to this St Lukes.  Quality of care seriously depends on who's on shift and what floor you're on.  Cath-Lab and ICU staff has always been fantastic, but staff on the 7th floor is a hit or a miss.  Likewise with staff in the ER. \n\nSeriously makes me wonder WHY some people get into the medical field, when they clearly are not cut out for working in that type of environment."
2,"It started out really well. Was seated in less than 10 minutes and our server started out great, but it went downhill from there. \nThe food was great but they forgot our appetizer. Trying to find our server was impossible. Had to keep asking for refills n they forgot to bring out the dessert for my friends bday. When it came to paying the check....once again had to find the server. Keep in mind it wasn't that busy.  Got the busboy to finally take our check. Maybe ill just try another location."
2,"Pizza was ok.. I ordered Vinnies, which is your choice of 5 toppings.  Italian sausage, black olives, onions, garlic and basil.  It wasn't bad - but it wasn't great either.  \n\nThe server was exceptionally friendly and helpful - but the service was the high point of the experience."
2,"The food is good, but it is very annoying that they will deliver to my house some days and not other days..... Your delivery range is 3 miles and grub hub says I live 2.8 miles away, mapquest says 3.3.  Either way I think its close enough.  Don't be jerks and deliver me some damn Asian food when I want it, not just on days when you have nothing better to do."
2,"My car became disabled in my garage.  Called this towing company on the recommendation from my car dealer.  1st call placed at 10:30am and was told it would be about 90 min.  12:30pm, still no tow.  I called back at this point and was told it would be 30 min and....she took my information again...what did she do lose it or maybe she forgot to order in the first place.  Ugh.  1:30pm (3 hrs. now)  I contemplated calling another company and then I though what if they both came together or the 1st one came for nothing.   So, I still waited (it's not like I'm going anywhere, right?) Finally 2:30pm they arrived.    4hrs people!!!   and not even a call from the office to say oh they're busy or running behind, nothing.  The guy was nice enough, but had a lot of difficulty jumping it to get it out of garage.  I stood and watch as he hooked up the chains and started to pull it onto truck, I'm thinking there must be something I have to sign, so I stepped in the driveway and away he pulls. No goodbye, no thank you, no I'm sorry it took so long.  \nI will never use them again.\nDoesn't anybody give good customer service anymore???????"
2,"Went here for lunch today. Ordered two burgers and a large cajun fry to share. We waited for about 15mins for our food. Normally we would not have minded but we were the ONLY people in the place. When we got our food our fries were not cajun so we brought them back to the counter. The gentleman at the counter, larger guy with glasses, asked us if we want them remade, we said yes. Then he said, \""Actually, here is some seasoning\"" He gave us one container of cajun seasoning. We said we would prefer them remade, it tastes great fresh and with the seasoning. At that point, he was ignoring us so we just went back to our table and began eating. \n\nI'm not impressed with their lack of customer service. We ordered something, we should get it. I've had much better service at the location on Val Vista and Baseline at Dana Park. I would drive the extra miles to get great service and quality food."
2,"Found the place to be average at best. Pancakes were not very good. They tasted like they were made from a mix, mushy in the middle, and they came with powdered sugar which I don't like (wish the server told me beforehand). Average wait time to be seated and for food to arrive. OJ was pretty bad as well- like the cheap stuff you get from the grocery store. I like the fact the place is not a chain, and I'd be up for trying other food there, but from my experience the pancakes do not live up to the hype."
2,"I would give STK in Vegas 5 stars but they have the worst customer service so 2stars for them. Blonde chick that checked our RSVP was a snob... Really bitch get a real job. Make sure to have the entire party present otherwise the last person to arrive won't be able to order her food and will just have to share with the others. The waiter rushed us and asked \""are you done now?\"" Didn't ask if we wanted to take any food to go and just grabbed our plates while one of my friend was still eating. So we took our time to order and eat desserts and left 10% tip instead of 20% on 400$ tab. No need to be rude when you're making minimum wage, idc if you're busy, they shouldn't have booked 100 ppl in a 50ppl max capacity room. \n\nOther than the horrible customer service, food here is delicious!"
2,"Pathetic. $10 just to view Ferraris that are roped off?  They could have done this in a more friendly way, perhaps at least allowing some reasonable viewing from the outside and through the glass.  The Ferrari dealer here in AZ has about the same selection and you can get as close to you want and browse on Sundays when the salesmen are not there.  What a disappointment!"
2,"Turns out eating here, appropriately, is a crap game. Food always OK To good. Service, you need to bring your luck."
2,"Second time here, ordered a Greek Salad with Chicken Kabob.. the plate was so small i couldn't cut my chicken or even fork out the cheap iceberg lettuce without some falling on the table, chicken was way too saucy as well. Stick to a gyro, had that last time and it was golden. Seems like good people, they are nice."
2,"We tried this place on a whim today and our experience was mixed. The tofu summer rolls were good but not great, the lemongrass soup was stellar, and my pad se ew was good but a bit too sweet. My husband's experience was bad enough that we probably won't go back, unfortunately. My husband hates coconut and ordered the Penang curry on the understanding that it was not prepared with coconut milk. Unfortunately, our very nice server was wrong (the dish was tasty but for the coconut). My husband exchanged his dish for the pad Thai but that dish was very sweet with a hot pepper kick. Overall, Curry on Murray gets a thumbs up for decor and service but the food is merely OK."
2,People were telling us they were laughing so hard that they cried.  We didn't experience much laughter or tears.  Not sure if it was because we could not relate to it.  This show is for 45+.
2,"We decided to check this place out after reading some of the reviews.  I guess I am disappointed because I had such high expectations.  This is just a regular coffee shop.  I was there with my husband and one of my twins.  I was going to order the breakfast burrito, but I wanted it with turkey sausage.  The girl at the counter told me they couldn't do it.  Ok, so I chose the Turkey sausage, egg and cheese on an English muffin.  I requested a scrambled egg for my little girl, again the girl at the counter told me they couldn't do that.  The eggs come pre-made in the shape of a patty, that sounded as appetizing as my sneakers after a 3 mile run.  I decided to cancel the food and pay for the coffee and bottled OJ I got for my baby.  Too bad, I am always looking for breakfast places."
2,"Trying too hard to be upscale, with none of the effort you would expect to accompany such high prices and professional demeanor. I don't mind paying more for quality, but the only thing that was 5 star was the view and the price."
2,"Seriously!!!  I would never ever pay $50.00 for a pedicure EVER.. Well again and I wouldn't have paid it this time NEITHER.  We asked for pricing, I stated what I wanted  and the only change i made from time of check in to done was that I now wanted french tips.  Had I wanted to spend this kind of money, i would have gone to TheBathHouse.\n\nthe other thing that puzzled me was \""why, were they mopping the floor at 9 am in the morning, when the salon JUST opened\""  Who really wants to be at a Salon when they are cleaning up yesterday mess."
2,"Uhh... came here on a Thursday night and what an awkward Thursday night it was.\n\nAt least our group of about 9 guys all got in free, somehow? Promoter probably put us on guestlist but I don't really remember.\n\nLet me say, this was my first night in Vegas EVER and first club in Vegas EVER, and it was a sad experience.\n\nThe club itself was just full of a \""dead vibe\"" where you feel like nobody was excited to be out. The only area of the club that was open was the outdoor patio upstairs. So you would have to try and venture through the crowd of older people, composing of cougars and manthers to find some socialization. Only one bar open which was extremely overwhelmed as you can figure.... really disappointed and haven't returned since!"
2,"Service was good, but that is all I can probably say about this place, because the food wasn't.\n\nI ordered the Tuscana Sausage Soup, the potatoes in it weren't cooked/boiled all the way, it was sort of too salty, but the sausage in there was pretty good.\n\nBuild your own Pasta seemed like a good choice besides Pizza, but I was wrong. I chose spaghetti, bologonese sauce (meat sauce), meatballs and mushrooms for my pasta. It came out to around $22 - 24 for the pasta and those two added ingredients. While the spaghetti and sauce tasted fine, it wasn't hot, it was semi warm, and everything else that came with it. The meat balls tasted like frozen meat balls from the market, it was also warm like the pasta.\n\nAll in all, I didn't like the pasta, maybe I will opt for a slice of pizza instead."
2,"I did not like this place.  I was into the retro look and 'dive' appeal but it basically a dive without anything GOOD about it.  It isn't the cheapest place and the burgers were not that good at all.  Setup is awkward, hard to get inside for soda refills.  I think this place only survives due to tourists.  They don't know any better.  I would not go back."
2,What to say. Our waitress was so incredibly rude.  If my food wasn't good then I would give have given it one star. This was my first and last time going there. There is another bar/grill a few doors down that is so much better and less expensive. The only good thing about this place is that there are vegetarian items on the menu.
2,"I wish that I could have got ahold of Sherry's Pampered Pets so that I could have made the reservation that I needed. But after 2 attempts at contacting them by phone and leaving them a voicemail that never got returned, I never even got as far as making the reservation. I waited 3-4 days for a return phone call, and then made reservations elsewhere. If I can't even get ahold of anyone or get a return phone call after leaving a voicemail, I am sure not leaving my dog with you."
2,"Was in one night for a show next door, but decided to go cheap.  Cheep it was!  All show and no go.  It's a beautiful hotel from the outside, but I think It is just old now, and service didn't help.   We were getting a \""non smoking\"" room, but we got to the room and it was really stinky and smokey.  I called and they said just come down to the \""manager's desk\"" and they will get us a new room, so we hiked down and not one person was willing to help us.  When we finally got to someone, she rudely said go to the desk at the very end.  We did, and no one was there.  Waited 10 minuted before going to here again, and she was just annoyed at this point with me.  She told me to wait there and someone would help me.  So I did, and about  10 minutes later, someone stumbled down to us and told us to go the the OTHER SIDE!  If you have been here, it is a long desk!  Especially when you have 2 full bottles in your bag, ha ha.  \nOverall, just a bad customer service experience, maybe if we were there 1 hour prior, it would've just been an old hotel and not so horrible.  Would I stay again?  Only if I HAD to save money and the show was next door.  Other than that, yeah no."
2,"There is a limited selection of decent Chinese food in my area so I decided to go a little farther away to try Chopstix based on the reviews.  Unfortunately the card reader wasn't working so the man behind the counter asked if I could go get cash.  The nearest ATM is in the Smiths across the way.  I went and got cash (paying an extra $3 since it wasn't my bank) and went back.  There was no one else in the place at the time and the same man behind the counter saw me come in.  I had my cash out and my food was bagged and sitting on the counter but instead of helping me he decided to take a personal phone call on his cell while I stood there and stared at him.  I continued to wait for several minutes and another man was at the counter doing something and also ignoring me.  Finally he looked up and asked if he could help me.  I said I'd like to pay for my food.  At which time the other man finally got off his phone and took my money.  No apology, no offer to give me a discount for my inconvenience, or even just throw in extra fortune cookies or something. \nThe food was decent (wor wonton soup, house fried rice, and orange chicken) but it is definitely not worth going all the way over there for terrible service.  Will not be returning."
2,"No. With all of your other options in Vegas for buffets (Wicked Spoon, Bacchanal), this just doesn't cut it. Food was dry, sitting out too long, and the cheaper price attracts a ...cheaper crowd...if you know what I mean. You're in Vegas, spring for the good buffet!"
2,"The service was adequate, and menu choices were a little more than a little overpriced. I ordered the street style pork sandwich, the pork was pretty much the equivalent of a blue rare. The sandwich was the size of a small biscuit, and depressingly unfilling. Before this, i had ordered a pork taco with green salsa (forgot name, sorry, this review is written in retrospect), and the pork was well cooked, except that the taco was soggy as a result of the pork grease. My friend had dim sum, so size wasn't much of a problem for her, she did say though, the dim sum had an off-putting oder, but tasted fine. Overall, the place was sub-par and I wouldn't go here again. Another note: The drinks offered there are served in bottles, which means no free refills. Just know that these bottles are the size of a soda can, and depending on what you order, you may or may not be getting less than your money's worth(or even less still), as some of the bottles are smaller than others. Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, overpriced and the food is repulsive."
2,Our first visit here. The service was great. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. The location is priceless. Westgate  is a super fun place to hang out. Too bad the pizza wasn't so great. It tasted like a frozen pizza I could have cooked at home! Bland. Sauce was gross. Crust was thin and too soft. Its too bad. Given the location and competition... the pizza shod be much better! Too many other choices!
2,"The staff was really unimpressive.  The food, okay.  Overpriced for what you get.  They are really trying to run an upscale restaurant but they have a  long way to go to achieve this.  Wine list is very limited, the food portions are tiny and the staff is a tad bit stuffy.  You can find far better in Charlotte than what they offer here."
2,"I've been wanting to try this place for a while. Now that have, I'm good. \n\nIt's the kind of place you go to after a night of partying when your standards aren't so high. It wasn't all THAT bad, but not great  either.  \n\nI judge Latin-style restaurants on their chips and salsa. If it's not good, I know what to expect from their kitchen. With that said..\nthe chips were greasy and salsa tasted like Pace picante. \n\nI had the two taco plate of grilled chicken and steak tacos with re-fried beans and rice. The grilled steak taco had good flavor, but the chicken was VERY dry. I added lime and salsa to try and moisten it up. All and all...it was decent, but not any better quality than a late night taco place. \n\nService was ok."
2,"We stayed here last year during a family road trip, and we enjoyed the stay.  The room and bathroom were clean.  It was right near Interstate 77, very convenient.  Very close to a great mall as well.\n\nThis time around and only a year later, our room was not all together clean.  The bathroom had hair on the floor, the AC was very loud which kept us up.  \n\nThe staff in both cases were friendly.  But we may go elsewhere in the future."
2,Cool restaurant great neighborhood concept but the food is so bland. Store bought chips for the dips. Kids Mac and cheese is gritty and flavorless. Chicken in salad is over cooked and not seasoned. Heaping pile of raw arugula on my pizza. Salt is great resource. Thanks but no thanks not again
2,"The food is still great and terrific value for $4, but unfortunately the `douche factor` has gone up to 11! I should have known better when I heard some fat suit walk out with three others and say `4 people for under $30, what a deal!` I was like, oh no, they`ve invaded it. I got there at around 1:20pm after the Friday lunch rush and usually it`s some students or a couple having a late lunch, now it`s full of soccer moms and cheap douchebag suits who found out about it on FB or Yelp, please stop these greedy people from making long line ups impossible to eat good food!!!"
2,No Reservations available after 5 o'clock which totally sucks. They have no phone charger station which sucks. The waitress was phenomenal and extraordinary. But had to deal with a new bartender tonight who took forever to make dreams because he was new. Outside of the waitress I will not be back here again after 5 p.m.
2,For a pizza spot with a vegan menu....this place had no vegan options after 1030p? Of course every other pizza option was offered but no vegan style pizza. As a past customer I feel so let down. They should at least offer some type of vegan pizza late at night same as the rest of the pizza styles. And no offer to have a pizza made either. I think that's whack costumer service. Again....feeling let down. :(
2,"The only reason I will go back is if a band comes to town that I cannot miss.\n\nI'll start with the good.  Security is so friendly.  My friend proposed to his girlfriend and they were so helpful into making it happen.  If they kick you out, you deserve it!!\n\nParking sucks.  It costs money to park and they don't have many spaces.  You have to get early to park and it's really the only good parking around the venue.\n\nSound is meh.  I've heard better, not often do I hear worse.\n\nDRINKS ARE A RIP OFF!!!!  Either don't drink, come there drunk or sneak booze in (I don't support sneaking it in.  They do pat you down as you enter)\n\nSo what we have here is a rip off establishment that is one of the only places in town to see national touring acts.  Fuck it."
2,"Love the concept of savory, clean eating.  4 visits layer and I'm finally convinced they are not able to provide a good consistent dining experience.  The first time the food was good service terrible.  2nd visit (early on a Friday night) out of flat bread... What restaurant runs out of one of their signature items before the biggest dinning out night of the week?  We got bbq beef sandwiches which were awesome... but they brought out sweet potato fries that were burnt black.  One thing to burn them another to serve them.  You can see our dilemma... They showed promise but never delivered.  3rd visit more of the same.  4th visit I thought I'd try for breakfast.  An hour past opening time, the door was open, no sign off a breakfast menu, nobody at the counter, not another person dining, staff see me but ignore me for 4 minutes.  As I leave someone finally says \""good morning. we are open\"".  Too late!"
2,"I have been to this location many times, and let me say that Einstein's is vastly superior as far as bagels are concerned. That stated, Bruegger's does serve good softwiches...however, I could get better bread and bagels elsewhere."
2,"There ought to be a law prohibiting Greek restaurants from going corporate.  I expect my Greek restaurants to be family owned and run by ugly, hairy, overweight Greeks (this includes the men and the women).  In fact, the uglier the better, as I suspect there is an inverse relationship between the quality of Greek food and \""looks\"" of the restauranteur.  Wasn't there a movie about fat Greeks who owned a diner.... wait... I need to grab some Windex I'm getting a pimple.\n\nAnyway, Daphne's proves my point.  I was in the mood for meat, bread and french fries and Daphne's was nearby.  I would call my gyro a \""styro-gyro\"".  The meat was cold and tasteless and had been carved hours earlier.  The pita bread reminded me of an old sun rotted Frisbee that sat on the side of the house all summer.  It crumbled into pieces.  The french fries were hot, but I could taste the frozen bag they came in.  The only high point is that they offer this really tasty diet Soba grapefruit flavored drink at their soda fountain.  That was one tasty diet drink.  Oopah!"
2,"Oh dear. Drinks decent but service awful.\n\nTried to book a table 5 days in advance. Tried 3 times and no one would pick up the phone and gave up as the Germany vs Brazil Blitzkreig was starting.\n\nCalled back two days later - after an extended discussion about seating arrangements (size of group & suitable tables) then high table by window was confirmed.\n\nArrived at designated time, table given to someone else and they didn't know about the booking. Just as well a couple of the gang didn't make it as they'd given away our big table which was made such a big deal of when I tried to book. Saw 4 walk-in's arrive after us and get served before us. No acknowledgement when I arrived. Took 40 mins to get the drinks - cocktails (nearly 25 mins after arriving before the order taken and got some water as knew cocktails might be a bit slow). Then 10 mins after that to get snacks that we had to ask again for. \n\nThe guy that ended up serving us was really nice but he only arrived 25mins in as he was a bit more aware than the girl serving when we arrived.\n\nSo Juniper, nah. Had I not been using a voucher, I'd have walked. And the voucher was a 2nd chance after friend's horror stories of bad service..."
2,"The place is hit or miss depending on which bartender you get.  They have some really good ones, but they also have at least 1 really bad one.  I won't name names but I wouldn't recommend the place on certain nights of the week."
2,"2/5 for great people working there, and the friendly vibe you get just walking in the door. BAM, smells like a pickling factory but do not fear, the bar area looks fun. Our experience was bad however-- the noodles in our ramen were cooked Al Dente, and you know what that means once an amalgam of them begins to expand in your stomach. They definitely weren't cooked all the way, so thus, I felt like I was going to LITERALLY lose my food after I finished a relatively small bowl. Yeah, I'm a small person, but you know, I can still eat! I just felt so sick afterwards.\n\nThe spinach- strange & refreshing.\nThe carrots- lovely.\nThe pork- cold, but good.\nThe nori- you know, your standard nori.\nThe broth- yeah, a little salty, but good. We tried the Pai Ton, the tonkotsu broth without the Pork ordeal.\n\n\nBut the noodles! They made me so sick, and I really want to love this place because their ramen is so diverse. After the meal, one of the friendly staff members made us some little non-alcoholic shots, so like I said-- SUPER NICE people! I just can't handle their style of food, it doesn't agree with me at all. If you're sensitive like me, try Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe-- they'll be a more classic and authentic option for you. \nCheers!"
2,"Initial impression when arriving set my standards high as well as the hype over this place. I love the decor and feel of the place itself, but the pizza was over-priced for thin and hard to eat cause the toppings just slid off. Also ordered the cheesy bread which i'd honestly prefer Little Caesar's over here. \nThe waitress was nice but disappeared for loooong periods of time. \nI'd be willing to try again but try something other than Piza cause the Calzone looked good."
2,"-4 stars for the food that my date and I had, +1 star for the wait-staff service, and being seated quickly during an extremely busy Thursday night.\n\nMy date got the chili - only ate half of it. There was so much cheese in it, and she said it tasted like spicy marinara with beans.\n\nI had the beef stroganoff. It was so oily, that there was an oil slick underneath. It also caused me to have gastronomical issues for the remainder of the evening.\n\nI might go back to try a burger..."
2,After a friend raving about this place for 6 months I had to go.  I'd say my turkey sanwich was pretty average.\nI'd never go again simply for the fact they don't have Sweetener for their unsweetened iced tea.  Boo.
2,"I use to enjoy this place. But, I just had a bad experience for lunch. I even heard my server talking to his colleagues about how bad the tip was from the previous table. Also, they were out of the first two beverages that I asked for.  Will not be going back anytime soon."
2,"Went for my Bday and the service was excellent but the food is another story. The food is not worth what u pay. Bill came out to $250 for two. Had a ribeye, pork, bone marrow, and two glasses of wine. Save your money. Go to Bobby Flays for a better steak and price."
2,"Clean airport full of debauchery: drinking, gambling, and I'm sure strippers are next. There's a lot of food choices, it's always tidy and getting around is easy. So, all in all I'd give 5 stars ---- if it weren't for the mile-long taxi line. I find this unacceptable and I'm surprised the casinos haven't found a way to speed this up to get people losing money in their houses more quickly. The cab line needs to improve!!"
2,"Two stars is about dead on. We were first at a motel 6 and this was definitely an upgrade, but only by one star. The bathroom was the worst part. If Windemere would only do a deep cleaning of their bathrooms once in a while, I could see a full additional star. Other than that, the rooms were pretty big, it was nice to have a balcony, and the pool and hot tub was nice, but would have been a lot better if someone grabbed a net and scooped out the branches and leaves now and then.  \n\nThe service people were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was fine. Just clean this place a little Windemere and you're almost there."
2,"We eat at this deli many years ago inside the Mirage Hotel and remember it was really good. With our recent visit I was so disappointed. The server lady had no idea what the soup of the day was. She was kind of nutty in her response and made us feel like she was in a hurry. Much to my disappointment the food was horrible- we sent it back because it was cold. I also found the prices to be out of line with the lack of quality. With so many options in Las Vegas, I would not plan on returning to this place. They nickle and dime you."
2,They have great food if you can get service.   Last time I went wewaited 30 min and didn't have any service at all so we left and done 20 min to another restaurant. We just phone order wings and pick them up now
2,"Maybe because I'm use to NY Steakhouses but I was disappointed. \nI was with a party of 10 for lunch. Lunch menu was great however my steak was over cooked. \n\nWhere's the porterhouse steaks???\n\nWine was good but little expensive, even for Vegas."
2,"Ew. Ew ew ew. My palette is not THAT discerning, by any means. But. Flavorless canned mushrooms and frozen spinach in my omelet. No seasoning, and just sort of a big sloppy mess dropped onto a plate. Took forever to take our order, much less get it to us. Only reason it's getting 2 stars is that the hash browns were okay. Not really sure why it gets such high reviews."
2,"All it takes is bad attitude and the unwillingness to be flexible for your customers to turn a good experience into a bad one very, very quickly.  Unfortunately, this happened at 360 Physical Therapy, who I was ready to write a pretty stellar review for, based on PT service alone.  I liked my therapist on the whole, and I've felt like I was taken decent care of. \n\nHowever, the practice has a rather draconian appointment-cancellation fee. It doesn't seem to matter that I have paid them countless $35.00 co-pays (ludicrous and laughable, I know... but that's between me and my wicked insurance provider) and that I call them if I I'm so much as stuck at a traffic light and will be five minutes late... we are battling to the death over an alleged no-show appointment that I swear upwards and down I rescheduled prior to not attending.  The billing manager will not let it go, and insists that I must pay this fee, no matter how many conversations we have about it.\n\nThe point here is, folks: isn't it worth it to keep your customers happy? I know I didn't miss this appointment... but even if I did, I had countless sessions at this facility. I was always on time, and I always paid at the time of service. I was a \""Good Customer.\"" And I would be going back, and recommending my friends, if it wasn't for the fact that they are unwilling to let something so small go.  Unfortunate, I think."
2,"The entire property is run down, kinda creepy and pretty yucky.  I had rented some inline skates thad had moldy inserts.  I think they may be the only roller rink in Madison so you don't have too  many options.\n\nObviously this place is popular with kids and they don't seem to notice all the blight so we would just grin and bear it."
2,"Recently visited Frank and Lupes. Food was very good but service was slow. In fact, we had to go to the bar to order drinks because our waiter wasn't coming over to our table.  At the end of dinner, my dinner partner left the table to use the restroom, and our waiter came over and asked me if I was waiting to be seated......this after he had been already waiting on me for an hour and a half."
2,"En pensant \u00e0 ce que je voulais dire \u00e0 propos du March\u00e9 Bonsecours, je me disais un peu la m\u00eame chose que Virginie. C'est un tr\u00e8s bel \u00e9difice et de l'ext\u00e9rieur, il est assez impressionnant. Par contre, pour moi c'est l\u00e0 que \u00e7a s'arr\u00eate. \u00c0 chaque fois que j'y rentre, je trouve que \u00e7a deviens un centre d'achat trop chi-chi qui est fait pour les touristes riches seulement. On dit y exposer des oeuvres d'artistes qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois et montr\u00e9alais, mais on dirait que toutes les choses se ressemblent et sont beaucoup plus dispendieuses qu'ailleurs. Allez-y si vous \u00eates en visite juste pour le voir, mais ne vous attendez pas \u00e0 \u00eatre impressionn\u00e9 \u00e0 part pour l'architecture du b\u00e2timent."
2,"I have been here twice and had 2 different experiences. The first time we liked what the menu looked like so we had lunch here.  Food was good, standard bar food so nothing overly special but good. Service was decent, it was not busy so we were checked on regularly.  We found out they have the UFC fights so we wanted to go here to watch them. Fight night; we show up and it is $10 per person! What!?! Every other place in EV only charges $5/pp. We were already there and they were just about to start so we stayed. Next our waitress informs us that she needs a credit card or id as a security for the table. What?!? We are a 40 something couple, you think we are going to dine-and-dash...really. After a bit of discussion, I reluctantly give up my card. Then the fights start but because it is March Madness, not all the TV's are turned to the fight as they said they would be. So I have to crank my neck in order to watch them, even after the game ended they still did not turn the tv's. \nThe food again was ok and service was good so we will go back for food but not to watch a fight, I will stick with Old Chicago or Tilted Kilt for my UFC viewing."
2,The burritos are good enough when you're craving breakfast and can't get away from work. I use them about once every couple of weeks. The service our horrible. Almost every time I call I get put on hold only to never get answered. I call back and finally get my order in. If there was another place that delivered I would go there.
2,This is a pretty crappy and old hotel. The room was dusty and had several missing items such as cups and laundry bags.  The bed sheet was dirty and had a huge bloodstain right in the middle of the bed. I had to ask housekeeping to come and replace the bed sheets.
2,"Limited beer actually available on tap. Hell, I could slap a sticker on a tap and call it whatever I wanted to, doesn't make it true. Even if they did have all of the beer they claimed, it's still not enough to call it a \""world\"" of beer. Seriously limited in supply and variety. Our group headed up the street to another establishment after only one round and found better selections."
2,Super slow service compared to other EBs. IlI go to the one on Sahara even though its 10 minutes out of the way next time.
2,"Lunch special only  till 4 pm . $7.99. Okay food nothing special that would make me want to come back. Service was just OK. Overall, I have had way better thai food else where ."
2,"Went there for lunch today. This is my second time visiting and the second time my order was messed up. I had ordered a chicken ceaser salad burrito. It was my mistake I guess, from what I remember a ceaser salad doesn't have tomatoes in it. Well it does here. I don't like tomatoes. Love ketchup but not regular tomatoes soggin up my meal. I had them make another burrito. The menu clearly states what's in a ceaser salad, and tomato is not one of the ingredients. The replacement burrito tastes slightly better than the first but not by much. Maybe they had a surplus of tomatoes and were trying to get rid of em I don't know. Should've went to Costa Vida but as we all know they are almost always crowded. Ugh F me and my burrito cravings."
2,"I will start by saying that my daughter and I made a special trip to get these bagels fresh in the morning, and I was so disappointed!\n\nFirst of all, weighing in on the bagel debate, I do prefer NY bagels (for which I have also been known to make special pilgrimages).  Montreal's are thinner and somewhat sweet, which is less enjoyable to me.\n\nThat said, some of the dozen bagels sold to me were actually stale and had to be day old.  The best and freshest was probably the sesame.  However, we decided after trying both St. Viateur and Fairmount, that Montreal bagels are not for us.  I think many Americans who have experienced high-quality bagels in NYC might agree.  Frankly, I can even do better at several places in Boston.\n\nMontreal has amazing French food; I guess I don't need it to compete with NY for the Jewish angle.  (I also think Schwartz's is way overrated.)"
2,"I have never been a fan of Olive Garden, but a brand new and shiny one opened up on the west side by home. My husband and I thought OK, we will try it again after years. DUH, dumb decision!! Was a total disappointment. Why do we do that to ourselves? You do not like somethings for some reasons! Sticking with gut feel next time. \n\nGot the fried mussel de napoli, that was ok. The usual mussel cooked and bathe in garlic butter sauce. I ordered the chicken alfredo pizza. OMG, it was so salty! I could barely eat it. Dipping it into the chicken & gnocchi soup to wash off the salt. I should have returned the food, but I have worked in the restaurant business through high school and college, I know what happens to returns! No thanks... My husband's spaghetti with meat sauce was kind of bland. We did not taste the herbs and spices in the sauce. \n\nActually, the food only deserves a 1 star but the service was outstanding from a young lady, so I am forced to gave 2 stars."
2,"Great food, great atmosphere, but POOR customer service.  No smiles on the cashiers at all.  They just never seem happy to be there."
2,"The Stone Crab and Joe's is fantastic if you catch it on the right day.  Sunday afternoon I sat at the bar and enjoyed great service and a terrific meal.  That 1st visit was a recon mission for a future date with the wife.  My honey & I went on a Thursday night.  The crab was horribly spoiled, the texture was odd and it tasted like ammonia.  The waiter was a clod hopping oaf.  I should have flipped my plate on the floor, spit in the face of the idiot and walked out without paying!  Caesars can be like this, hit-or-miss... Caveat emptor!"
2,"I got myt first pair of orthotics with this place back in 2001. Back then, I felt like a valued client, and they almost had me believe that they were foot specialists or podiatrists. I paid a little over $100 for two pairs.\nHowever, I visited the same location yesterday and explained that I could not find my inserts so I bought the shoes instead paying $600 for what I had purchased once a long time ago. Yet the shoes were still $130.00. I specifically asked for slip-resistant shoes and felt like being at a roller rink passing through the kitchen. \nI returned this morning, and the male attendant with a feux hawk decided to quote manufacturer's words to me when I tried to return the shoes, or exchange them within 2 sentences of our conversation.\nSo if it wasn't for their overpriced and prescribed inserts not from someone who has a degree in sports medicine, it would be for the careless treatment I received that I am submitting a low but generous score to the only surviving location in Clark County.\nI should add that female that I initially bought products from yesterday, was polite but said that their products would last 5 to 8 months at best, which is piss poor for $130.00."
2,"This Starbucks is owned by Treasure Island and not corporate-owned, so they do not have perks like receiving stars or free modifiers using the Starbucks card. They can take your card number off the mobile phone app though. I only went here every morning because of its convenience. It was real Starbucks (not just proudly brewing).\n\nI found the employees here friendly enough, but nothing more than absolutely necessary. There are no tables and chairs, so don't plan on sticking around. Get your coffee and move on. It's now the only Starbucks ON the street in this area of the strip. Just don't think you're going to have a religious experience with your morning cuppa joe."
2,We were absolutely starving so we decided to check out this place...wish we hadn't. The food was lackluster - not all that cheap and NO RITAS! I suppose I needed to look for the apostrophe but I was kind of hoping they would have a variety of margaritas...but alas Rita is just the name.  With my hopes dashed I was left to the food which wasn't anything I'd give a second thought to. The day we went there was no live music and no real ambiance to speak of.
2,"How do you get iced coffee wrong? I asked to have to coffee sweetened , and now I taste rock sugar that's not melted in my coffee! :( what a disappointment ."
2,"Kind of a cool atmosphere, good for drinking. Mediocre and slightly overpriced meals for what you get. Irish Pasty was mainly potatoes, some cabbage, little bit of cheese and small amount of corned beef (Cornish Pasty at Guad/Dobson is much better). Every other item was traditional, strip mall bar food. \nI could have been in any other bar and gotten the same experience. \nBasically good for booze, but not much else."
2,"The room seemed pretty impressive thanks to subdued lighting.  We started with a basket of warm bread that included an Asiago roll, walnut & cranberry bread and a French roll. We each ordered broiled walleyed pike which turned out to be slightly dry and shared a baked potato (overdone) and creamed corn.  We concluded the meal by sharing a cr\u00e8me brulee.  The creamed corn, served in a large casserole dish that was finished under a broiler, was by far the standout of this meal. On the downside, the cr\u00e8me brulee was one of the worst we have had the misfortune to eat.  \n\n04/08 20 years have passed since we last had the courage to dine at the former Roberta's, but like fine wine this restaurant has improved with age.  What it lacks in ambiance is made up by a friendly staff and moderate pricing.  Ms. Westie's 8 ounce filet, served medium rare as requested, was very good though decidedly short of prime.  My Chilean sea bass was perfectly cooked - crusty on the outside and moist inside, and accompanied by garlic mashed potatoes, a small fennel salad and saut\u00e9ed spinach."
2,"I really wanted to give them a better rating because they have great toppings. Service was great, cute little restaurant, beer flights and wine flights, but the pizza dough was just ok.  Wasn't expecting the dough to be so \""doughy\"". I was looking for that crisp dough you get at a wood fire oven place.  \nI've been searching long and hard for that pizza place with an egg pizza to remind me of the pizza's I had in Italy.  \nJust have to say great toppings, but work on the dough."
2,Had a private function here - beautiful space and the staff was attentive and friendly.  Not much here for vegan's and the kitchen didn't try to accommodate very well even though they had all the ingredients to make a great salad!
2,"We were tired from doing tourist crap all day and came back to our cheapie hotel, the LVH, to cool the heels. By dinner time we were too tired to go anywhere else so gave this place a shot. Unlike others, we were actually greeted immediately and seated. From there on, please trust the other reviews and go elsewhere. At 6 on a Sunday nite the place was a ghost town with only 2 other tables seated and Motley Crue music videos blaring. I get the Vince Neil connection but this was over-the-top annoying. Our server was good, very attentive, which frankly we expected with the lack of other customers. Food was very blah. As others noted, chips and salsa were right out of the grocery store, fish tacos were fried/microwaved, and beef \""machaca\"" tacos were just cold mushed meat. Ugh. We were tired, it was food and no one got sick so I guess it ended OK. Overall, stay away from this restaurant and more to the point, the LVH in general. New ownership is destroying the place, literally and figuratively."
2,I've ate at honey bears a couple times because I really like BBQ but this place just doesn't do it for me. The sauce is very different because its more like a broth than a sauce. The sauce or broth doesn't have too much flavor.\n\nEach time I've enjoyed the flavor of the meat (Pork and Chicken) but the sauce and the sides just kill it for me. The Potato salad is very bland without much flavor.\n\nOverall the meat is very good and would be the only thing that I would order. There are many other great BBQ restaurants in Phoenix that top Honey Bears.
2,Scottsdale standards?  Stay somewhere else and gamble here if you want. The pool is mediocre. The restaurant choices are not spectacular except Orange Sky- i really felt like i was on a carnival cruise with all the alcohol fueled tattooed gents and stiletto heeled teeny boppers here. Save your money and gamble and stay somewhere else.
2,"I was very excited when I saw the 'Coming Soon' sign prior to their opening and was looking forward to dining here. I have been there twice now, and do not intend on going back. The food is not bad, but overall, my experience was unsatisfactory.\n\nNot only are they overpriced, but they are stingy. I absolutely hate restaurants who charge a fortune, but have little to offer. Both times I came, I ordered the 1/2 'Pollo a la Brasa'; the second time, they did not give me fries. I was told that they no longer offer fries with the meal. Not only is this false advertising on the menu, but this just shows how cheap they are. How expensive are potatoes??\n\nPlease don't order the Yuca fries. The $6 order comes with 5 fries, literally. If you are willing to pay over a dollar for a 2-inch fried potato, then by all means go for it.\n\nThe waitress I had was impatient and gave me all sorts of strange looks each time I tried to get her attention. When I asked for sauce for the chicken (which should have come with it), she looked at me as If I was absolutely insane. If it were not for my co-worker treating, I would have made sure the server received minimal tip.\n\nI do not intend on going back to support a business like this one."
2,"This is the first place that I have been to during a happy hour that had no beer specials.\n\nI've been to about 5 different Maggianos and it seems to be slowly going down, in terms of food quality. I just really love Italian food, so I keep giving it another chance. I'm very close to the point where I would enjoy making my own fresh pasta, getting a good bottle of wine and some ciabatta bread and making dinner at home."
2,"Went to this place, my first time on sunday, aug. 17, around 3 p.m. for a to go order. Gal told me salad was huge and I asked what mixed greens were. Salad was not huge and the order did not contain mixed greens at stated in the menu. Better to buy a salad bar to go salad, less money and larger. When I asked if there was dressing with the salad, the reply was you didn't specify what dressing you wanted. Well, I was never asked what dressing choice I wanted. Was not offered free ice cream while I waited for the to go order, yet another patron was. I asked if crackers came with this order, no, well I grabbed some on the salad bar I should of ordered on my way out the door. Salad was good, but not what menu specified."
2,"We dropped our vehicle off Saturday to have them check why it sputters upon acceleration. They never called us back (after 3 calls to them) to let us know it was ready.  Monday afternoon they called and said  they \""jiggled some wires\"" test drove it and they claimed it was fine, but if the check engine light comes on, bring it back. Not even 24 hours later it came on, we dropped it off Monday night and now it's Tuesday afternoon and not a single call from them.  Their communication clearly needs work, and after 2 whole days of having our car and not being able to find out what's wrong with it is unacceptable.  Even if they find out what's wrong with it before they close today, they will have to keep it another day or so to potentially fix what's wrong with it.  This would not have been such a rotten experience had they just kept us informed once, or even twice, even if to just say \""hey, we are still working on it and will call you\"".  At this point, we are getting the vehicle and taking it elsewhere.  If you decide to go with Fletcher's, be prepared to have little to no communication about what's going on with your vehicle."
2,"I've been going to Lee Lee's for a number of years, but it seems to be in a decline over the last year. While the selection and stock of some ethnic sections are still maintained, the Japanese foods aisle is not being stocked regularly. Lee Lee's has never had an outstanding Japanese food section, but it had most of the essentials. Being of Japanese descent, this section was a lifesaver for me-but no more. Instead of the familiar brands and selection of Japanese goods a ten-foot section of shelves was being fronted with CostCo (Kirkland) roasted seaweed. While I do buy seaweed from CostCo occasionally, when I'm having some good rice I look for the slightly thicker and more flavorful Japanese brands. Even their rice section was decimated and lacked stock. I guess I'll look for a new market."
2,The food here is great - my problem with the place is around two things:  ok although a minor problem it still is a consistent problem...every time I go I get a milkshake and every time it is not mixed well enough.  This results in huge chunks of ice cream you have to mash or wait for it to melt.  I dont like that.  The second problem I have with this place is the service.  I have gone four times at varying times of the day and always the service is subpar.  I end of flagging down the waiter for refills and begging for the check again and again.  But the food is good so if you are only interested in the food and the cute atmosphere then this is your place...not for me though.
2,Good food\nFriendly service (only if they are not busy)\nI mainly go here for the appetizers and beer during happy hour
2,"I went here on Thursday May 1st, 2014. The two girls that were working on this day were sitting at a table with their friends when my sister and I walked in. One of them reluctantly stood up to help us while the other stayed seated. The employee acted like it was such a chore to help us. Instead of letting us browse she followed us every step of the way in an attempt to make us hurry up and order. In summary, the customer service was bad, the ice cream was great."
2,I was pretty disappointed to find out that they do not carry any type of yard art or Talavera pottery... \nI'm always looking to add a little something.
2,"I've been here once before and had no complaints. Food was good, patio was beautiful, service was to expectations. However, I went back just recently and was not pleased. My two friends and I were not greeted by anyone at what looked like a host stand and stood there for a good five minutes, while servers just stood at the door to the building not looking our way. So we took it upon ourselves to find a table. Almost all had reserved signs which is fine, but with that situation I expect someone to seat us. Once we sat, a server came up and asked if we had just \""walked in\"" and if we needed menus. We said yes, of course, but then she proceeded to tell us that the table was reserved and that any other table would be fine and she would be right with us. We found the only other empty table, and shortly after we sat a man that was with the large party reserving all the tables informed us that that table was reserved as well. I do understand that it is fair for a large party to be dining at the restaurant but I felt as if staff was not paying attention to anything other than that. Frustrated and impatient, my friends and I left.\n\nI am hoping this is a once time instance because I know The Vig can do better than that and I don't want to miss out on their awesome food."
2,"This place would be a lot more vibrant and useful if parking were free or somehow comped.  During its beginning a lot of the new store front attracted outsiders as we as local SS residents to walk the area, shop at the stores, and eat at the restaurants.\n\nNow ... it just doesn't seem to get over a rather nasty case of attrition.  There's chains, chains, and more chains.  I do highly recommend hitting places for happy hour specials, that's is something they do get right in the SSW."
2,"This theatre is pretty good. The seating is comfortable, the stage is kind of small, but the drinks are SLIGHTLY better priced than what you'll find elsewhere (and also really delicious!)\nI would love to give them a solid 4 stars, but the fact that I went here for a night of improv and heard nothing but the banging of the bass from Tabu next door is inexcusable. Are you freaking kidding me with that poor planning?!? My show (that I spent a good amount of money on) was at 11:30pm. The noise was constant and quickly gave me a headache. You could feel the vibrations and my husband's seat shook. \nIt really was a huge distraction from a show that was pretty fantastic and otherwise, would have been worth every penny. I plan to formally complain. I don't know how you can sell expensive tickets with clear conscience and expect your guests to deal with that for the entirety of the event."
2,"Dim Sum is not good at all.  This restaurant is better than Dim Sum on Central.  That is not really saying much.  The dishes seem frozen and not fresh.  The dim sum was bland and not much variety.  I do not expect Charlotte to have the quality dim sum of large cities.  However, I do expect the staple dim sums such as chicken feet, shrimp rice noodles and other to be at least good.  However, they are not.  Recommendations for dim sum is to drive to Atlanta."
2,"if you order a combo here, one out of the two items they bring out will have something odd about it.  the buffalo chicken salad that i ordered came topped with this frighteningly chewy, wiry fried chicken that I did not want to put in my mouth.  My friend's apple gorgonzola salad was unappetizing with a plethora of iceberg lettuce.  \n\nwhat does redeem za's is their selection of cheesecake factory goodies. good to keep in mind when you've had a bad day and you need something sinful to wash away the pain."
2,"if you want a cheap hotel, go to excalibur, tropicana is declining big time, I stayed here a couple of years ago and it was adequate, I went last week and now it's supergross.com."
2,"Their burgers are tasty. Not the best I've had, but good for the price. Our server was friendly and dropped by to make sure we were happy on a regular basis. I wasn't a huge fan of the atmosphere, too much country music for my tastes. They have lots of pool tables and a few bigger games like free throws and boxing games, and plenty of TVs showing whatever games are on.\n\nThe one real gripe I have with the place is that nobody seems to clean the tables, there were crumbs and old drips of ice cream that I had to clean myself."
2,"I was not dazzled by the food.  The place is quaint for an uptown spot.  The food is definitely overpriced. I will not return on my dime, it would have to be someone else's."
2,"This mini version of Sephora is located inside JCPENNEYs lower level floor near mall entrance.  That's a good thing, that way you don't have to waste time wading thru the store to get to it.\n\nNot so good is the inventory.  Its a small space so they only carry the more popular items and just the basics in some of their product lines. Still I think it's great they have Sephora here. \n\nF grade as far as customer service goes.  I counted 5 sales reps at the cash wrap.  2 were busy at the registers. The other 3 were just standing there talking. Personal business.  \n\nI must've had my invisible coat on since I had to squeeze my way thru between the ladies to check out the fragrances they were standing in front of. Still not one of them acknowledged my existence. I didn't see the fragrance I wanted but I know they carry Tocca at Sephora in Town Square.  I was looking for it s good 3 minutes. That was a potential $100 sale lost. Not sure if their employees are affiliated with JCP, but if they are, all management has to do is check out the tapes from LP..you'll see how \""helpful\"" your employees are."
2,"We decided to go with a mobile groomer for our 8 year old Bolognese dog. She has a lot of medical issues including being blind. It got stressful taking her to a groomer with barking dogs, blow dryers etc. Not to mention our Groomer of 6 years flaked out on us. I called Green Dog Mobile Grooming yesterday for the first time and had to leave a message. I chose this Co because of their reviews. I left a detailed message with my phone # and wanted to know how soon they can come out. That was over 24 hours ago and no call back. I called again and got voice mail again. I hung up. I understand people are busy but 24 hours is a little too long to not return a call for a potential new customer. I guess I will keep looking. I was really looking forward to having them out especially because of all of their good reviews. Oh well, I guess they don't need our business!"
2,"Had a sub par experience for a simple birthday dinner for my mom. Not sure why we had a so so time because we were the only people in the restaurant at 430pm. Started with the calamari which had too much breading so I could barely taste the good quality squid. For main course it was risotto Milanese which was amazing. So this is when the service got weird, I told them ahead of time is was a bday dinner so I was expecting a simple ice cream or whatever but instead we got tiramisu-but I had ordered that for myself not for my mom. So remember to order ALL your desserts not what you think your going to get just because it's someone's bday. And to top it off I didn't get my doggie bag of my unfinished risotto, I think they tossed it even though the waiter specifically said he was having it bagged up. I guess he was more interested in checking us out rather than making sure we were being taken care of. So I doubt I will come back here ever again.  Two stars because of the service, would have been four because the food was decent but these days service is 50% of the experience."
2,"The food is so-so and is severely overpriced for the caliber of the food they serve.  Their runners don't time the food right and even the waiter/waitress that waits on you doesn't even remember who ordered what. They call this place an American brasserie but this is fake French at best, and even that is a bit of an insult if you'd ask a French chef to taste their food. Don't get me wrong.  The food here is good, but thats the problem - It's not 'excellent' , 'mouthwatering' or 'to die for'. It's just ok good.  It's not worth what they charge, and if you're looking for good French, this place definitely isn't it.  With that being said, the ambiance and decor are superb. The mixed drinks are tasty and they don't jip you on the alcohol.  I suppose I expected a lot more out of a restaurant in the upscale Renaissance Hotel near the theatres, where a lot of out-of-towers may frequent. Surely, you wouldn't want this place to showcase Pittsburgh."
2,"If you have a choice, go to the one downtown. I always get the buffalo shrimp, but at this Majerle's the coating was too thick. Not to mention, our ice tea tasted like dirt and service was horrible."
2,"Beers are good as were the wings, but the burgers were a BIG disappointment. Flavorless and uninteresting.  Portions were way too big--bordering on ridiculous.  Service was good.  Would go back for a beer and appetizer but that is it"
2,"Mehhh. They don't deliver so I had to go pick it up. Chicken satays were dry and overcooked but tasty. Basil fried rice was mushy and over sauced. Scant (3 small) shrimp and 6-7 pieces of chicken. All the right favors but heavy handed execution. Chicken and vegetable stir fry with black bean and ginger was the best of them all. I have to say that after reading all of the great reviews on Yelp we were very disappointed. To top it off, one app and two entree came to $30. Not bad if it was a quality meal but this owing one of those."
2,"Our group decided to do the all day buffet because it was cheap and easy. Maybe we should have saved the stomach aches and long hours on the potty and just spent money on decent food. Well see the foods not that bad.. its just i can't eat three meals of stale food. Breakfast was whateves. Standard stuff but they had fried rice and array of wtf \""breakfast\"" foods out.. Lunch rolled around and low and behold the same exact shit we had for breakfast! They added some fried chicken but that was basically it. Dinner was better but i really can't eat stale food all day. Boo"
2,"We are staying at the Mirage and happened to walk by this restaurant which looks amazing from the outside. My wife and I are avid sushi fans and thought this would be a fun place to try out. The waitress was very friendly and the Kirin Ichiban beer was great. The sushi, was not worth the high price tag. We ordered the calamari which is thick strips (it's good but also pricey). We ordered 3 sushi rolls and were very disappointed with the lack of creativity for such an expensive roll. We decided to close out our bill even though we were still hungry because we were not satisfied. \n\nThe regular sushi rolls are extremely tiny and are just the item around rice and seaweed.  If you are deciding on this restaurant for sushi alone, don't bother. If you like your sushi to have a variety of the sea's flavors, then don't go here. Maybe we are spoiled because we are from San Diego but I will not be coming to this restaurant again. We are used to much tastier, creative sushi for about half the price of Japonais."
2,"Food was pretty good. Nothing too unique or memorable besides the decor, and the 60s music absolutely killed the mood. They need to keep with the theme and have instrumental chill music. Ciabatta chicken sandwich was ok. Bread lacked the traditional ciabatta flavor. Sweet potato fries were a bit soggy. Hummus was pretty good, though the pita tasted a bit raw?"
2,"This place is big. There's bowling, pool, a restaurant with okay food, and games, most of which are played for tickets. There are three major knocks on this place in my opinion. First, it's really not that kid friendly, as it's open on two ends and there's nothin preventing someone from walking out with a kid. I always stress safety when we go but parents really need to stay in top of their kids, which can be difficult if you have more than one child. \n\nSecondly, it lacks a food selection of traditional arcade games. Most games are extremely violent or involve tickets, neither of which are appropriate for kids of some ages. \n\nOn another note, the games that are played for tickets are really an introduction to gambling, i.e. pay money to play a game of chance in hopes of winning tickets or a prize. I always steer the young ones away from playing games solely in the hope of winning tickets. I stress hat they should play a game that will be fun regardless of whether it involves tickets.\n\nIn summation, true kids love the place but I'm not a big fan."
2,McDonald's will be McDonald's so I've based my review on service alone. cashier had no personality. He didn't smile or even was interested on working. He looked and sounded miserable taking my order. The manager on the other hand gave me my food with a smile and even cracked a joke. it was a morning shift so that employee needs to cheer up and smile more and spread positive vibes especially when people are just starting their day.
2,"carolinas, your enchiladas ruined it for me.\n\ni can't imagine eating another one of your soggy tortillas swamped in a pool of the most horrifying enchilada sauce my taste buds have ever met. mole overload and non-existent chile. lacking any real taste to it whatsoever.\n\ndisappointed."
2,"Sorry, little grey heads, Mia Bella Cafe is just Meh for me and not the 5-star experience that everyone else seemed to enjoy (did you?). Came in around 11:15am and the spot was empty. Like, 0 people in there. 0. I was aiming for a light meal, but there were signs for shawarma outside and I'm weak for the stuff, so I went for a shawarma wrap with a side of potato salad and then grabbed a turkey panini to eat later in the day. \n\nI'll make this quick bc it's Friday and I know you gots some partying to do... the wrap wasn't cut, so I had a shawarma burrito that was eh. I was confused the entire time on whether it was OK or not. The potato salad consisted of diced potatoes, but no mayo to tie 'em together. So, yea, just a bunch of dry potatoes. The panini was OK. Turkey, cheese, let, tom on some nice bread.... but they put it in a box with an Israeli salad which leaked all over it, making the bread soggy as hell and an open-faced panini for moi. Overall, meh. I wouldn't return."
2,"My wife and I went there for a Valentine's day dinner....so my experience may not be typical of an average day. Anyways, here's my bit...\n\nWe had a reservation for 7.30. We were not seated until 9pm....by which time, I had lost my temper, appetite, and the mood for some over-priced, sub-par rack of lamb! The food was barely ok....the tables were too close to each other and we were seated pretty close to the kitchen with a darn pillar blocking most of my view. Guess the window tables might be fun...but I don't think I'll ever go back to find out."
2,"2.5 but I rounded down.\nThis is not a place you go to eat out but it's rather a emergency stop when you have no other place to go perhaps 4 in the morning. Cash only. Doesn't separate the check so if you are eathing with somebody else figure it out among yaselves.\nI'm not a big fan of diner's and haven't been to one so I don't have anything to compare to but like I said, if you have nowhere else to go you might try this one.\nFood is ok. It's like the food that a mom who doesn't care for cooking cooked. I don't want to be too mean. Waitresses are friendly. They are dressed up in scrubs like nurses."
2,"Came in for dinner on a Saturday night at about 9 PM.  A little busy, but the service was fairly quick.  Large selection - mostly bar food.\n\nGirlfriend had a taco salad which had a very greasy shell. I had a club sandwich with fries and a cup of chili.  Fries were made there, crispy and great. Club was not toasted and had no spread. Chili was tasty.\n\nPrices were a bit higher than a Phoenix bar & grill, but I guess it is Cave Creek."
2,"It's a chain, so I know the food is decent. I'm mostly turned off by the fact that I couldn't come here to watch a baseball game. No sports package at a popular burger place? I'll be going elsewhere for dinner."
2,"I wanted to enjoy pure but it was disappointing from the beginning. We waited for over an hour to get in even though my group had 6 females and 3 guys. They complained of the ratio EVEN though they kept marching in hordes of guys. Inside the club I would see at least 5 guys for every girl that walked by. The floor was sticky and the bartenders and staff were slow and unfriendly. The only good things about Pure was the roof lounge and the fact I made $50 in cash from some \""high roller\"" in the VIP making it \""rain\"" dollar bills throughout the night. I would never pay to get into this club but at least I made $50."
2,"VERY VERY FRIENDLY WAITRESSES AND WAITERS. I never got a \""bitchy\"" staff member serve me and we always end up laughing together and having a great time (yes, with the staff). I was told it's because most clients are rather cold to them and I'm one of the friendly ones but that's to be expected in a bigger franchise of bars.\n\nFree Popcorn and 4$ infinite refill iceteas are amazing. Decently priced food, not spectacular but nothing big.\nThe TV set ups don't cover all the seats in the bar and that's honestly quite frustrating. My friend practically got a neck cramp trying to watch UFC 168.\n\nI was sadly told from a VERY RELIABLE source on staff that they recycle cole slaw... Now THAT is fucking disgusting. I do not know nor will I ever reveal if the staff member is still working there or not. I do not know how they recycle the cole slaw but I'm never touching that part of my meal ever again."
2,"I was in town on the night the Lakers were also in town. BF and I and a friend decided to try to get tix from a scalper. Not knowing the venue, well it figures we got jipped. We got tickets to something they call the verve lounge. Its like a club in between the lower and upper levels. OK thats fine except there is nowhere to sit and the view is lame.\nNOT worth it, I would rather sit in the nosebleeds, then again I'd rather be at Staples Center."
2,"Firefly is a cool place, but much more for the trendy crowd than for the foodies, like me. It was really loud and crowded. The menu did not have anything very adventurous, in fact quite the opposite. The \""french fries\"" tapas were ok. So was the manchego mac and cheese. The grouper was very dry and plain. The salad was acceptable, but the empanadas seemed small for tapas. The albondigas were boring meatballs with no real flavor. The best thing was the paella, and I've had much better.\n\nIf you are looking for great tapas, this just isn't the place."
2,"Had the Maine Lobster Pot Pie and the Shrimp and Scallops for entrees. Crab cakes for appetizer. We do not get it. The Pot Pie was a neat and cool presentation but that was it. All tastes were just weird and sometimes unpleasant, the food overall was a disappointment with a capital D. The service was struggling to not be fake and the night was just not one of our better dinners in Vegas. We have been to a few Michael Mina restaurants and it seems to be the same at all of them. Not up to standards of other Vegas celebrity chef, high end restaurants. Really disappointed. Cost was only 30.00 dollars less then Gordon Ramsay's and no where near the experience."
2,"The shopping/selling environment would be much more enjoyable if the associates were not rude, unfriendly and incompetent. I am currently sitting in the store waiting for them to go through my clothing that I'm selling, wait time is estimated at 45min, which I don't get as there are 5 associates in here and 3 customers (me included). When entering, not one associate said hello or even offered a smile. I stood waiting at counter for 5 minutes until an associate finally approached me, rudely. I don't get it, don't they want business?! \n\nThey have a great selection of clothing here, but the negative energy in the store definitely makes the shopping experience a downfall. A sign reads \""like us on Facebook,\"" apparently they don't want to be liked.\n\nAs an avid shopper and seller, Platos closet will no longer get my business after today, I think Ill stick with the more professional and friendly Buffalo Exchange. My social network will be notified of this negative experience that I normally receive when coming in here."
2,"Went in for a meal on Sunday night.  Not a great move.  The food was really not great even for a chain italian place.  Service was good, we sat at the bar to watch the Sunday night game.  \n\nI'm still not sure if the issue was the poor food, the poor menu, or something I can't nail down."
2,I love korean BBQ and I love Sura's style concept.  The restaurant is buffet style. You pick the meats and dishes that you wish to have and bring it back to your table to grill. A server will bring you drinks and clean your grill ever so often. \n\nThe food isn't bad but it isn't great. You might find some pieces of meet that are still frozen if you pick from the middle of the tray. \n\nI went to the restroom while eating here and witnessed an employee leaving the stalls without washing their hands only to later see her behind the buffet line serving meat.  True story. \n\nI was so disgusted I wanted to return back to the stall and puke. \n\nSince Sura's AYCE menu is around the same price of the others in town...I'd go elsewhere especially after using their restrooms.
2,"The Fringe, the International Festival, and the Film Festival, I can all understand.\n\nThe Book Festival, that's pushing it a bit.\n\nThe Politics Festival, that really is just taking the piss.\n\nIt's not that politics is particularly boring or unimportant, it can be quite fascinating and is integral to almost any major event in history, but it's just not the kind of thing that requires a festival. Try as I might, I can't see a crowd of stinking hippies sitting round in a circle, sniffing glue and discussing the merits of the capital gains tax.\n\nNext up, the Festival of Accountancy."
2,"If this place thinks it's a spa, they are wrong. I waited 20 minutes to be asked to sit at a table, then asked to move. My nail tech said all of two words to me while talking to everyone else in a foreign language. There's a sign above the nail polish stating if you break one of their ancient bottles, you'll be paying for it. There's some decrepit lotions in a corner cabinet and a spray tan booth for sale. Yet, they were busy. My nails turned out fine ($15 for a fill) but I won't be back."
2,"I went in today to have a look at their selection, i walked in and no one was there. I heard someone snoring in the back so i figured i would take a peek. As i thought, someone was laying on the couch sleeping! ahah. I hate waking people up so I took a few business cards, took note of their products, and went on my way.\n\nProducts were some of what i am looking for, drip tips, and batteries, and also looking for new brands of liquid i haven't tried out. I'll be back in a few days maybe, and hopefully someone will be awake to answer a few of my questions.\n\nIt's a small store from what i saw, i didn't see any testers i could help myself to, i did see a showcase full of flavors which was nice. I did find a couple that caught my eye as i was reading them. Other than that, it was a shame i walked in at a bad time.\n\nfor now 2/5 stars i can't leave this mistake unsaid."
2,"A lot of these reviews talk about how friendly the staff is, but when I went yesterday (6pm on 2/26), I did not experience that at all. We weren't ever greeted or said goodbye to.  The first thing the cashier said to me when I went up to order was just \""hold on.\"" Then she took my order (medium tea), then told me to hold on again, so she could finish doing two other orders, one of which was a smoothie. I literally just ordered tea and their tea comes in tea bags. She just left my cup with a tea bag in it on the counter while she went to make the coffee and the smoothie. Maybe it's just me, but I don't see why she couldn't just put the hot water in my cup.\n\nI do understand that it must've been hard since she was the only one working up front, but c'mon, you gotta learn how to multitask and do it with a smile on your face. If she at least greeted us or said something other than \""hold on\"" and \""here you go\"" to me, then I might've given this place 3 stars, maybe even 4. Customer service can really do a lot for a place and I just didn't experience anything good here. I will, however, be back in the future since this is one of the only coffee shops by my house and I'm always on the prowl for some study spots."
2,"I had appt with Doctor Meghan How ever she din't  show up as she was Sick I get it everyone gets Sick However that is not the Point..Front Desk Judy she just had a straight additude she was definitely not happy to be there Overall she is Unprofessional, i even over heard her go to the techs and told them how stupid I was and how I gave her additude and other Nonsense  **OVERALL** patients should NOT get Treated like this. I was mistreated I got to my appt in time I waited one Hour to get treated How ever the service that I received from the asst and Doctor Michaels was Excellent. Judy needs some training on how to treat the patients with respect and By being more proffesional the other girls there as well very Unprofessional they need to stop talking about patients as we can all hear what they say.."
2,"Went for Sunday brunch. Ordered a Western Omelet - it was ok. Others at my table got the all-you-can-eat buffet, and seemed to enjoy it - I think this is a quantity over quality kind of place.\nOne highlight was the hashbrown casserole - very tasty!"
2,"I have been here three times now. For some reason a lot of my coworkers really like it. It's a popular lunch-time destination. \n\nThey are known for their southern, Louisiana style dishes. I would say it's just pretty typical, heaving-tasting foods. Their gyros are not bad actually, but the creole with shrimp and blacken fish I had as a lunch special were just too salty and heavy for me. I'm sure some who love their soul food would appreciate it, but it wasn't for me. \n\nIt gets pretty crowded during lunch hours, and the spaces are quite tight."
2,I ordered the spicy shrimp whichis noted as very spicy.  It was so NOT spicy and NOT flavorful.  However I had a nice time inspite of the food.....
2,decent at best.  if you know real cajun this place won't impress you but for the lack of any other option it's passable.  the Rat Toes appetizer is pretty good.
2,"I have loved this Fry's since it reopened last year.  I spend a lot of money here.  My last shopping experience was disappointing and frustrating.  I got home missing several items.  This is the 3rd time this has happened to me at this store.  When I talk to anyone in the store (most recently an asst. manager) about this there are no apologies.  All 3 times were like this.  \nA while ago, I purchased shrimp at Safeway and got it home to find it was spoiled, I returned to the store and the manager replaced double the shrimp and refunded my money.  Now, that's customer service.\nFry's may offer good prices but you can't put a price tag on good customer service."
2,I'm not sure when this started but tonight I noticed a sign that states from 9pm to 5am there is a 25 cent surcharge on every item sold. The establishment is open 24 hours. It's ridiculous that they would operate in this manner.  Are they paying their employees more in the evening? Highly doubtful. \n\nBread was delicious as usual. Hot and fresh.
2,"Food was awesome but service was terrible.Went on NYE and waited 20 plus minutes for drinks which kinda set the tone for the dinner.Server was OK but the time from which we ordered to when we received our food was much to long.When I questioned the waiter I was told\"" Its not my fault they are way behind in the kitchen\"" .This is not the response I expect from a place like this.We may go back but why when there are so many other good steakhouses in Vegas."
2,"Agave-how I wish it weren't so:\n1. Terrible service- no hostess when we arrived. No utensils when we received our food. No server to take our payment. Everything was just slow. I'm wasn't in a hurry, but having to wait for everything makes any average person a little anxious.\n2. Food- Crispy quesadillas - chicken and corn versions: nice corn masa shell but bland fillings. Then we had the fresh fish tacos. They were soggy and a mess. The fish had an old fishy flavor and I couldn't get past it. If I'm able to eat fish sauce like it's ketchup, I think I have a pretty good tolerance of seafood/ocean taste.\n3. Ambience- surprisingly nice. From the exterior, I wouldn't never have thought it was that well put-together in the interior. It was a great blend of the colors, the lighting and a Large center bar. But I'm here for food first and thought did not impress."
2,"Worst bar tenders in Charlotte. Inefficient, rude, and mess up a simple orders. I ordered 3 beers and ended up with 3 shots of Fireball. I told her I ordered 3 Two Hearted Ales, she left and I never got my beers even after a bar back told her I was still waiting for my order."
2,I don't think I saw an employee for the first 10 minutes I was in there. Once I basically ran into one he was helpful.
3,"For Scotland's busiest, most important and the capital's train station it sure was pure chaos.  I took a taxi here to go down to London and the moment I went underground I was amazed at how unorganized this place seems.  Maybe me or maybe it was the construction that was going on.\n\nAll the usual amenities you would expect from a modern train station, you have a pub nearby, the snack shop and all of the other usual suspects are here.  The open roof feeling of being underneath main roads doesn't sit well with me, because it rains here and it is cold here more than it is warm so why an open roof. And being from California being underneath big things that can collapse just rubs me the wrong way, almost as much as finding out that the trains to London are on a track all by itself not with the others. They realize that people drink or wake up way too early to get on trips right?"
3,"4 stars for the young bear stuffer guy rockin the converse shoes, he tried his best to keep my birthday girl's attention. She just turned 2 (if you read my reviews she is the one that might be autistic or has adhd and is wild nutz) and she was just all over the place.\n\nNow, this is where I have to take off a star... at the check out... my daughter had a build a bear purse that she stuffed with hearts (both the purse and hearts were BAB, I was not buying them). I quickly snatched it without her looking and put it behind my me and on top of a shelf.... obviously so my daughter would not see it and scream. Well Mr. Lazy from behind the counter (not my cashier) starts yelling MAAAAM give it to me and I will put it away...  HERE GIVE THAT TO ME AND I WILL PUT IT BAAAAAACK. My daughter started wondering what he was yelling about and she was looking around. \nThe guy was ridiculous, my husband was paying and he even turned around to see what the guy was yelling at.\n2x I replied to him that I didn't want her to see it and then I just walked away.\n\nThat jackass should know if a mother tries to hide something away from a child that he should not create a scene. All he had to do was put it back after we left."
3,I like the back area of the bar outside. The music is pretty good. Didn't get to stay there long. I'll have to try it again some time.
3,"I grew up in Las Vegas so I've been here a zillion times. The security lines can be long during peak travel times (Fri and Sun afternoons), there's a nice variety of food chains and random and expensive stores. I always pray I get to fly out of the A and B gates since it is waaaay less crowded and there's never a line for security. Since it's a big airport, it can take a long time to get from your car to checking in your luggage to your gate, so allow for some extra hiking time. \nOf course there's cheesy Las Vegas crap all over the place and slot machines, but that's what makes this place so... Vegas. The TSA clowns are usually pretty easy-going and apparently the taxi lines are realllly long. So save time ad hire a limo. It probably costs about the same. Also, free Wi-Fi!!"
3,"I've been here for brunch before and it was amazing! However, I was disappointed by a recent trip for a friend's bday. \n\nWe had a big group and hung out in the bar area, standing/mingling, and occupied the three tall, center tables. It was a Monday night and the service was EXTREMELY slow. It looked like the server, in addition to the bar area, was also responsible for some tables in the dining room.\n\nI ordered a drink and it arrived about 20 minutes later. A friend ordered food at the same time and his food arrived about 10 minutes before my drink. And we were sitting right next to the bar! The drink did not fit the description on the menu (it sounded like a martini, based on the description, but ended up being some sweet concoction served in a wine glass) and I sent it back (something I very rarely do). I asked for a different drink and it arrived, another 15 minutes later.\n\nThe dinner small plate and entree options leave much to be desired. With a large group, we wanted to order a few shareable plates, but all the small plates on the menu did not seem very sharing-friendly. Also, why does EVERYTHING have bacon?? The entrees seemed very over priced (tilapia for $22, are you kidding me?). \n\nI would definitely return for brunch, but never for dinner or drinks."
3,"Ah. This place kills me......for two reasons. Firstly, it USED to be amazing...Then all of a sudden, the quality of the food and service kind of crashed. And secondly, what kind of restaurant DOESN'T ALLOW YOU TO TAKE YOUR FOOD TO GO?!??! This is the reason I won't be back. I had gone there with a friend, and we ordered and appetizer to share and then a main dish each. I had the veal with mushroom sauce which in the past was pretty amazing. However, halfway through that dish, I got full (shocking, I know). At the end of our meal, both of us asked for the rest of our dishes to be packed to go and we were told by a very unhappy woman that this would not be possible. Either eat it all here, or too bad. It was SHOCKING. So.....although the food is ok, I won't be returning here. I don't like feeling ripped off, and the fact that they won't give you the rest of your paid-for food, makes me feel totally ripped off.  :|"
3,"I must have driven past Franks A Lot one hundred times before I ever thought to give it a chance.  Franks is on the east side of the road that becomes, airlane, right behind the airport.  As I take airlane to work every morning to avoid a few lights, I kept seeing Franks and finally decided to try it for lunch.  \n\nWhat can I say? A solid hot dog, great price point and an EXTREMELY friendly staff. I haven't pegged if its a family running it from front to back, but I think it is and let me say, they do it well.  There is a drive through as well as basic patio seating.  Make note, they only take cash, but don't worry your lunch wont be more than six or seven dollars anyways.  \n\nTheir specialty is the Chicago dog, which is covered in onion, celery salt, sports peppers, and tomatoes.  Grab a side of their freshly made french fries and you are out the door, loving life.  Their menu extends to service polish sausage, cheese fries and even a philly cheese steak, but I have remained loyal to my Chicago dog....for now.  \n\nIf you happen to find yourself in the area, I say check it out."
3,"If grandma's creative brain exploded on a Sunday afternoon, this is what it would look like.  They have paints, glues for any surface or material, brushes, picture frames all shapes and sizes, seasonal arts and crafts, beads and bedazzlers, candles galore, styrofoam in weird shapes and blocks, construction paper, wood shelving that you can stain or color any way you like, fake flowers, glass containers, etc.  Also, if you're into scrap-booking Michael's is probably a dream come true."
3,Bartender was a heinous miserable female but the drinks were bomb!  I would go back just for the gnarly drinks but the service was totally Yucca yucca!
3,"Brass turns into \""The Beat\"" on First Fridays. I'll be back! First Friday is now cool to go to again.\n\nLOCATION: Fremont of course. But instead of being down on Fremont its up on Fremont! (huh?) :) Its actually situated above Hennesy's Tavern. Head upstairs because that's where the party's at. There's a balcony so all you smokers can have a smoke break and watch the crazies walk Fremont. If you want to leave, no problem, Beauty Bar, Vanguard, Insert Coins is just right across Las Vegas Blvd so you can bar hop and mob the rest of downtown. \n\nMUSIC: I think KidFunk was on decks. And he did not disappoint. It was a constant stream of good tracks. Lots of house & tech house, dropped some electro and dubstep. It was a good night! There's a decent size dance floor for the size of the place. I only went into the main room but on the other side there's an even larger room with a different DJ, possibly different music too? If they keep it up I'll make this a regular stop on First Friday.\n\nBATHROOMS: Were filthy and disgusting. Drinks and other unmentionables all over the floor. Be sure to check if there's toilet paper before you pop-a-squat. The dispensers were always empty so grab a handful of paper towels before you go in.\n\nGOGO: The gogo(s) were 100% disappointing, sorry. Both in looks and in dancing.\n\nGUYS: No dress code, no cover when I went.\n\nDon't forget to RATE & FOLLOW! ;)"
3,"I decided to try this place out despite the reviews, and everyone is 100% spot on. The decor is cool looking. The bathroom was odd. The hand dryer is located on the one faucet. So if there are multiple people, they have to wait to wash their hands while you fight with the awkward dryer. For the ladies...they actually don't have sanitary depositories in the stalls. You have to walk out of the stall to the main trash to throw things away (unless I missed it somewhere). \n\nI had the veggie burger. It was tasty, but is definitely on the small side. I would agree that it is more like a slider. The fries are good as well. I'd say they are pretty much a normal portion size, but if I'm paying extra, it would be nice to have a larger portion.  The water cups are tiny. You have to sip it like a fine wine. I was not stuffed after the meal. I was able to go to the movies after and down a medium size popcorn without any issues. \n\nI hate to say, but I don't think this place is going to make it. I think for the cost, it's not worth it. They need to make things cheaper or provide larger portions. I don't think there was an option to double up the veggie patty?"
3,"For those stuck in the convention center area, this is a ok place for a beer and pub food.\n\nAs a graduate student in the area only to attend a conference, I have been to this bar twice.\n\nThe jalapeno poppers and onion rings are a favorite. The buffalo wings are ok...nothing special.\n\nGets very crowded during games, but makes the place fun.\n\nSo, if you are trapped around the area with no car and crave a beer and munchies, this place is A-Ok."
3,"I was a loyal Sakana fan for years up until the birth of my sone.  Going out for sushi is not so convenient with a lil one. So after a 3 year hiatus, my husband and I opted for Sakana on date night.  Would it be all that we remembered? Disappointed to say that it wasn't. We sat at the sushi bar and the chefs were not as personable as they were in the past - very little banter or recommendations. The saving grace was the scallop dynamite - the best I have had in the Valley and the oranges for dessert. Gosh how I missed those.  \nI accept that maybe a 3 year break might have built up my expectations."
3,"I like to go here to grab some subs on the way to the river, since it's between our house and the 17. Just because I don't want to go to Subway or Blimpie's.\n\nMostly, it's a rather expansive Italian market. Need olive oil? They have 20+ different kinds. Pasta? There's a whole aisle. How about one of those wooden thingies for making gnocchi. Got that too.\n\nIn the back, a counter runs along the whole length of the back wall. That's where you'll find all sorts of cheeses, cold cuts, and sausauge, plus a few sweets. \n\nIt's also where you order sandwiches. And you'd better know exactly what your want, and fast. The man behind the counter is perpetually surly and curt. It gets worse if you stand there and try to make heads or tails of all the hand-written sandwich combinations taped to the wall. Luckily, the woman who runs the cash register is always very sweet. So that kind of makes up for it.\n\nI want to love their sandwiches. I just don't. They're OK. The meat is always really good, there just isn't enough of it. Maybe I'm just not ordering the right things. \n\nUntil then, I'll continue to support Romanelli's, but they'll only get a so-so rating for the deli. The product selection, however, is top notch."
3,"This place is just ok for me. The restaurant has a nice setting, good service, and nice entertainment. The food is good but not great for the price. The steaks were slightly over aged for my taste, au gratin potatoes were very tasty though. They have a nice wine list with many options for all budgets. Its worth a try if you are at gvr and looking for a nice meal but I prefer most of the steak houses on the strip over this place."
3,"$4 OPI!  Read Carina's review, b/c I didn't want to pay $8.50 at Ulta... geez, so cheap... alot of the OPI colors already have separated (heat?  age?) so make your choice for price over quality... I'm so cool for $4 though.\n\nOn the same end where China Magic Noodle is, same plaza as Lee Lee's."
3,"Went in for an early dinner and ordered the Pot Roast Sandwich. The vegetables came and were not cooked. They were raw, I ate the meat which was great. I told the waitress and she commented that that is pretty normal actually and offered to give me another side vegetable. I am glad that she did that but at the same time was a bit subdued by the fact that this was a regular thing for them. My husband enjoyed his chili burger loads. The drinks we ordered were very strong as well. This place is always busy but perhaps we ordered the wrong food for this place!"
3,"Had a carne assada torta.  It was actually not bad.  For the price it was real good.\n\nA few comments/observations...\n\n- Comically unorganized. There is no process for how this place works.  I got my food but if they actually had something that resembled organization I would have got it a lot sooner.\n\n- The grill was a bit on the dirty side.\n\n- The meat while ok was a bit on the fatty/chewy side.  Chopping it into smaller pieces would have been helpful\n\n- Not the cleanest dining area.\n\nNot really a 3, but not a 2 either.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt."
3,"Sat at the bar, no music or sound on the TVs, after I asked for the second time some music was turned on, some sort of low sounding reggae I think, could barely hear it. No food on the happy hour menu, $3 Cuba Libra's, I enjoyed those. Didn't sample the food. Might come back not sure yet."
3,"Because we are so far removed from the French Quarter my stomach rarely directs me to Cajun. Let's be honest there are few options in this town.  So this becomes the default spot to scratch the gumbo itch.  \nAbove average food, better service, higher than expected prices."
3,"Went to this buffet (gorgeous d\u00e9cor by the way) two weeks ago and although it was great, it's not the best buffet I've eaten at.  I do have to agree with the other reviewers that the options were poor.  The quality was good and the portion control in individual containers helped but other than that, I'd say this was more like a three star place.  Luckily I didn't do the weekend $40-/+ buffet that most mentioned.  We went on a Monday during brunch time and it was about $22 I think.  Not bad for an all you can eat place in Vegas as it kept me full all day, but I felt the lack of options bored me and was done within 45 minutes.  I expected a little more from a place that looks so posh!"
3,"Dude, totally didn't realize how many lesboz are in Vegas. But they're like the totally stereotypical mullet-wearing, jean vest with ripped sleeves wearing, big arms type of galz. You know, have you seen that movie Monster with Christina Ricci and Charlize Theron? Well, that type.\n\nAm I seriously the only hot one? Hehe jk.\n\nSushi's alright. But who pays $15-17 for a roll of fish?\nFor that money, you can go to Oakland and get yourself some\nV\nV\nV\nV\nV"
3,"The pictures of the burgers looked super crazy and deadly but the portions are actually very feasible. Our group of 5 shared: sashimi \""won-tacos,\"" triple T fries, the original ringer burger, and the bacon mac-n-cheese burger. We probably could have stuffed ourselves with another item. My favorites were the fries and the original burger. The fries were super crisp and full of truffle flavor, especially the aioi. The original burger had the flavors I like most, although I think the bacon mac-n-cheese is more unique and a good combination to try.\n\nTo me, the burgers are a little better than your average burger but not a favorite I would want again and again (I still prefer Bachi burger or even Holsteins). The tacos were definitely a let down- super small portion of tuna and not very interesting. Overall, I would only come back for a beer and some of those fries."
3,"While the desserts are tasty and well made. The prices and service is not. \n\nYou could tell everyone working their just WISHED they were somewhere else at the moment. They could care less about actually serving you unless you asked for help. \n\nWe ordered the sweet trio and my friend told the worker if we could get the second one as the first one was damaged. For some reason she told another worker to do it instead and did not relay the message at all. It was only after we paid and were seated that we noticed that the dessert was damaged and had to bring it back for them to give us another. \n\nThough not very difficult, we shouldn't have had to deal with that to begin with."
3,"Okay, so I had to do an update.\n\nI was actually at the BuyBack$ location in Henderson near Galleria Mall when we couldn't find what we were looking for.\n\nSo we called the location on Decatur to see if they had the movie we were searching for on blu ray.\n\nOh yes they did!!! Of course they did. They have everything.\n\nSo we asked if they would hold the item for us and that we would be there to pick it up shortly, we were across town but were on our way.\n\nSo we drive all the way across town and guess what.\n\nThese people had the gumption to tell us Sorry, it was actually being held for someone else. They claimed prior to us calling that it was already on hold but in the end that it was up to management's discretion to decide who would get it.\n\nWell, we told you were coming from across town, you told you would hold it for us. So I didn't get it.\n\nWhat I did get, is that they would get a review update and lose a star.\n\nI am not saying I wouldn't go back but I will NOT go out of my way to return to this location again. \n\nThey lost a very faithful devoted customer."
3,"I've been here several times, and well, it's a chain. I don't usually eat here but my husband wanted to go here. Funny enough, he actually wanted to go to BJ's and was confused. He was disappointed because they only have lager here.\n\nLast night we actually had a 5 star experience. Our server Paul was really phenomenal. Got my kids extra fruit, really knowledgeable about beer (my husband loved chatting with him about beer and brewing) and helped me figure out the rewards program. Great service! Food was pretty good too. Hubby got the fish and chips. Fish was breaded with panko and was nice and crispy. Pretty bland though. The garlic fries were really good. I got the cheeseburger with blue cheese. Nothing phenomenal but good.\n\nUnfortunately, I've had a lot of 1 star experiences here and I think that they are a little too expensive for the quality you get,  that I'm giving GB a 3 star overall. Hopefully last night's experience indicates improvement, but it's really a hit or miss."
3,"Came here on a sunny, warm, Saturday night.  I looked enviously on the people enjoying the backyard patio with its hanging white lights while sitting inside the dark interior.  Regrets regarding seating choices aside, I had a pear and arugula salad which was good, but still left me hungry $8 later.  Many others in my party ordered drinks which may be a better way to go."
3,"A-OK from me.  In case you can't tell from my other reviews, I'm a happy hour type of guy.  This spot has a good one.  Several appetizers and rolls half off along with good drink specials.  Want a quick roll and Kirin and are on the west side?  Come on in.  \n\nI must say that I prefer Sakana to this if you are going for dinner with someone special, but looking for some rolls and laughs with a few friends, this is a good place to do it."
3,"This store has good prices on many things, some much cheaper than Safeway and others equal to Fry's. It all depends on what you're shopping for. I prefer Fry's in my area of town though because the Albertson's by me ALWAYS smells like rotten fish and enough to make me hurl. \n\nThis location just happens to be by my friend's apartment so whenever we need something we just run in here and get the items. Very easy to get in and out of and very good customer service."
3,"This was the only buffet we tried (first time visitors) so we don't have anything to compare it to in town. It was nice and at $40/pp reasonably priced. The variety is small but great tasting, and I could have eaten the Na'an all night. The husband enjoyed the brisket. Everything was clean and bright but a bit too cafeteria style for my taste. Overall I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here but if it's convenient it's a good option."
3,"We had Lunch there on a Sunday ,pretty busy .\nI say the food is ok not a wow but ok.\nThe service was good and the place looked pretty clean .\nThey got lots to pick from. \nWe did wait a long time for are food.\nThe prices are not to bad either .\nI will give them another try maybe for dinner."
3,The only downfall is the wait during lunch through the drive thru.  I have always had a long wait but today was horrible.  Only 2 cars in front of me and my wait was over 15 minutes after ordering.  This was for a simple sandwich and smoothie nothing crazy or extreme.  The service is getting slower and slower every time I go.  It's really making me consider avoiding it in the future and it used to be one of my favorite places.
3,"I was suprised how much I liked Kahunaville. Sandwiches are all very reasonably priced- around 11 bucks- and very large. The drinks are spendy like most of Vegas but be nice and they pour stiff. I highly recommend a Bombay and tonic yard. \n\nOur server was very friendly and professional, She did a great job especially since one of my group pulled a rude dipshit maneuver with an empty ketchup bottle."
3,"Typical Panda Express, but add a drive thru. Service is not exceptionally friendly, but lets face it, who cares. You have to deal with the employees for a whole minute and a half. Food is always good, portions are generally good, and close to shopping."
3,"My date and I decided to try something new and stopped at The Lodge for Happy Hour.  We were really pleased with the prices, and all the bartenders/servers seemed really friendly.  And the deep fried cheese curds were to die for!  (I am from Wisconsin, after all.)  However, the bar stools are INCREDIBLY UNCOMFORTABLE.  We didn't stay long, but thought we liked it enough to try it again...at a table next time.\n\nP.S.  We couldn't decide whether to Yelp about the so-scantily-clad-it-was-almost-inappropriate server.  I mean, I know it's a bar and she's working for tips but...geezuz....it made us look around the bar for her pole."
3,"This West End restaurant holds the honour of being Edinburgh's oldest chinese restaurant! (Or so it claims). It's over 50 years old, and it's become such a local favourite they're some people who've been visiting for quite a few decades. The name is a little bit dodgy, but the food definitely isn't!\n\nThe restaurant specialises in Cantonese and Peking cuisine, and there's sooooo much choice on the menu it's difficult to decide what to have. Like many chinese restaurants, the desserts menu isn't elaborate and there is something with banana's in it; this seems to be a constant in just about any chinese restaurant I've been to! \n\nOne great sign in this restaurant is that there are actual Chinese people frequently eating there, as we all know its most difficult to please the home crowd."
3,"Didn't stay at the hotel but the Craps game is the best even though it only pays double on 12, it offers 100X odds!!! Well worth it for cheap gaming on the Strip. The place is a little old but not run down, with low ceilings and the air smelling like smoke. The locals are friendly and the drinks are okay."
3,"C'est avec une certaine impatience que je fantasmais sur ce restaurant... un peu trop peut-\u00eatre.\nNous avons partag\u00e9 des \""croquettes\"" au foie gras : vraiment rien d'extraordinaire.\nEnsuite, je me suis laiss\u00e9e tent\u00e9e par la cote de cochon heureux: viande tendre et bien cuite, mais la sauce n'\u00e9tait pas assez tasty \u00e0 mon gout. Mon ami a pris le magret de canard, pour le coup clairement d\u00e9cevant.\nTarte aux pacanes excellente, mais vient-on ici pour \u00e7a?\n\nVraiment contente d'y \u00eatre all\u00e9e, mais plusieurs restaurants dans la meme gamme de prix me rendent bien plus heureuse."
3,"This place and other local spots like the Teepee remind us of a far gone time when our Mexican food was predictable and when our standards were low.  But sometimes that hits the spot.  This place definitely has some history, just ask Marty Robbins."
3,"You get what you pay for, yet I wish you could get the basic needs. This place doesn't provide a mini fridge, tea kettle, coffee maker even less a microwave, so you are forced to spend all you pennies buying street food. Also the carpets are pretty old and stinky. Our faucet didn't work, we complained and the next day it was fixed.\nThe plusses were: silent after midnight, so you can sleep pretty well :) and pretty close to everything as well. \nWouldn't mind going back but would check other options first."
3,This sushi spot is average at best. The rolls have too much rice and hardly any fish. I would rather pay extra and get more substance than just eat a bunch of rice. I wish they had some sort of seating. I go here when I need to grab a quick work day lunch. It's on par with grocery store grade pre made sushi
3,"This place was aight,\n\n$4 Beer specials were a pretty good deal but the sole reason I'm not rating this place any higher is because of the food. (Better options at 4Peaks and Santan)\n\nIt was Underwhelming and Overpriced~ The ambiance of this place was nice though\n\nHad the Oyster Po Boy and well.... if you want seafood I guess one should move a bit closer to the W-Coast."
3,"I came here after getting absolutely no help at Fry's. It was nice to see that all of their mini computers,ereaders and the Kindle I wanted were at the very front of the store! I'm glad I didn't have to walk all the way to the back. I was wearing heels for the first time in a long time so my feet were aching. I just wanted to get the Kindle and go. I couldn't leave without a cute case for it though. They don't have a  huge selection so I settled for a bright blue case. My ideal case would have been pink or had Hello Kitty on it.\nThe employees were so much more willing to help here. It wasn't like Frys where it was like pulling teeth to get answers. When we were about to pay the cashier asked if we had their rewards card. We had one but I didn't want to use it because of what happened before. We made some big ticket purchases a couple of years back and the gift rewards were going to some random address in Illinois.  We tried to get it corrected through their call center and even talked to the manager. When we told them that the address on file was not ours and we could prove it they still would not change the address. This is why I will go no higher then a three star rating. I can never fully trust this company."
3,"Club was fairly standard, but the view of the city was amazing on the 53rd floor, although the one drawback of this is the fact that once you look outside, you realize how far you really are from The Strip.  That and the fact that we had very favorable weather conditions, otherwise, going outside would have been an absolute nightmare.\n\nOther than the location of the club, everything about this club screams \""decent, but unspectacular\"" which, incidentally, is a very significant accomplishment for the Palms."
3,We ate here a week or so ago and I have to say it was okay. It's nothing either one of us was blown away by but the food was good. We ordered the gnocchi with marinara and the ravioli al formmagio.  Both were good but the stand out was the marinara sauce. I'm rather picky about it and it's probably some of the best I've had in awhile. We also ordered the caprese as an appetizer and again it was good but nothing wonderful. Service was very good as well. For a restaurant in a strip mall setting it was good however the prices are really high considering.
3,"I'm a Gordon Ramsay fan, love all his shows and his passion for excellence.  He reminds me a bit of myself in my college years striving for perfection over the cast iron grill at Buffalo Wild Wings.\n\nBeing a fan I was excited to try this place.  What to order?  this was the hardest question to answer since the ACT.  I wanted a burger but thought I should get out of my comfort zone and try something a bit more British, so I went with the pie sampler.  I thought this was a great idea so I could sample all the taste Gordon has to offer but it backfired a bit because it really is just an appetizer, so I was still a bit hungry afterwards.  Each meat pie was about as good as a meat pie can get, but that's not saying much.  Looking back I should have ordered either a whole pie or the burger, or maybe the sampler and a burger.  My friend had a burger and it looked amazing, I stole some fries when he wasn't looking, very good.  I will be back to try the burger."
3,"Not the best computer science program.  However, it is a pretty big school.  It has that Arizona feel to it.  The heat can be unbearable at times, and I live in Vegas now.  My classmates were very friendly, but the teachers sometimes were a bit too strict.  The funny thing about this school was how people would steal bicycles and assemble a totally new bike.  So I'd see a bicycle with a bigger tire in the front and a smaller one on the back with different colors of parts attached.  Hilarious.  There are also a lot of people holding signs promoting either their religion or other beliefs.  There's a lot of different type of people here which is why I like it, but then again, I wasn't totally impressed by my teachers which is what I mostly looked for."
3,This hotel had it's ups and downs. Checked in late on Friday night and the non-smoking room we requested was given away so we had to settle with a smoking room. They told us to come to the front desk between 12-3pm the following day to change rooms since they gave our room away so we agreed. \n\nNext day rolls around and after a great time at the pool and gym we called and they kept pushing back the time on when the room would be ready. We wasted 5 hours of our day not being able to leave and waiting for our non smoking room to be available. For someone who comes for the weekend and hours are limited it really sucks to waste time. Finally they gave us a non smoking room after complaining for 5 hours and sounding upset. It was a big disappointment. I'm giving three stars because that was an awful experience but the hotel itself wasn't too bad. The room we got upgraded and it was really nice. \n\nOn a positive light the hotel is in the middle of the strip and it's across the street from Cosmo and Bellagio. Had fun shopping and eating at Gordon Ramsey's Burgr place.
3,"I wish I had better things to say, but this is sadly a joint that should have stayed in my undergraduate days. I wanted to say this is for people on budget BUT, its not that cheap either.\n\nThe place is decent, clean and the sushi chef is friendly greeting us when we came in and was leaving.\n\nI would say, I wouldn't eat any raw stuff here, and the cooked dish I got was also so-so. Tonkatsu was dry and batter was not really there. $14.50 instead of the $10 lunch price I get at King Muramoto... nah. not gonna work.\n\nThe only saving grace was the hot miso soup on the cold day I visited. \n\nJust not worth the price you pay, and the low traffic in the restaurant on Friday night makes me doubt the freshness of the sashimi and sushi they have."
3,"HUGE PORTIONS. HUGE. This place is inside the crappy Imperial Palace hotel on the strip (upstairs).  I was surprised at how big the place was, it is kind of sectioned off into two difference rooms. I had a simple breakfast with eggs, hash browns, and a biscuit and coffee to drink. The biscuit was so buttery and fresh and warm, and like everything here HUGE. I usually love me some carbs, but I could not finish the biscuit or the rest of the meal. The food was great the prices matched the huge portions, not overprices but accordingly to the amount of food you get. My entree was one of the simpler ones and it was 9 bucks, everything else was above that. Only bad experience was someone straight threw up in there. Was walking aND \""bleeaaaaacgh!\"" *splaash*. I was confused as to what happened when I heard it and saw a guy running out, until I saw the horrified look on a puke-splattered woman. I am assuming the patron had a rough night of drinking in Vegas and that it wasn't the food there. Still pretty horrific to witness on your first meal of the day.\nFinal thought :This would be a good spot to pig out in...maybe wear rain gear...?"
3,"This hotel looks really nice and the staff are really nice. The fitness room has a few different things and they work. The free breakfast is amazing. The room isn't very functional. There's a refrigerator, but no microwave. When I eat out I have leftovers and I hate wasting food. The shower in the single bed rooms is something you would find in a dorm room. It's a tile shower only with a single shelf and there isn't a full shower door. When you stand in the shower, there's always a draft. I'm getting kind of tired of staying at \""nice\"" places that are just pretty and serve no function."
3,"I go to this restaurant usually on Sunday morning because they have their awesome double stamp days. \n\nNow for the restaurant-The wait can be a little annoying especially on the weekends. But, that's expected. \n\nThe atmosphere-I usually  go to the one in Chandler off of Ray Rd. The atmosphere is very friendly and the restaurant is clean. I like the little breakfast bar they have. \n\nFood-The food is delicious and they have the perfect portions for me. However, my husband often complains that they don't give him enough food. But, this is where the cool little $1 menu comes in. They have a wide  range of things that you can add to your meal for $1. I usually add the fruit cup or mini-pancakes. I haven't had a chance to try a lot of their menu items. They have a pretty long list of items and I often get overwhelmed trying to figure out what to order. I have had the 7 Veggie Omelette. It was very tasty! What made it more enjoyable was knowing that I was eating a healthy omelette. Some of them have tons of ingredients and even one with all meat. The one thing that I have tried that I DO NOT recommend is the biscuits and gravy. I have had better. The gravy can taste a little bland and the biscuits taste chewy on the inside. \n\nServices-The service can be hit or miss. But, I do like that they give a large cup of your beverage to go. \n\nGreat place overall."
3,"I've been in here a few times, each time deciding that this time I'll do what they tell me to and I'll feel like Superwoman. I still haven't!!\n\nBasically it's a health food shop. Kinda. They sell the likes of cod liver oil tablets and garlic capsules etc etc, the staff are WONDERFUL. Can'tt fault them on that!! I went in on day hearing that if I took a spoonful of Manuka Honey at bed time it helps your skin and makes you lose weight, and it did! I was glowing. Ok it wasn't like a heap of weight, but enough to make me feel better about myself. The staff gave me the honey and some cider vinegar to cook with, they knew all their stuff....but it cost me over \u00a340!! Hence the missing 2*.\n\nIf you're serious about this sort of stuff then this is a great place. If not, then go to Boots."
3,"It's K Mart, not bad just nothing special. Nothing really sets K Mart apart from any of the other conglomerates. Gotta shop here from time to time for MH exclusives so you'll see me busting out my Maverick patch & showing it off with pride"
3,"The waiter was attentive and helpful.  The omelet was good.  But holy fatoosh don't order the grape leaves.  Yikes...it had some sort of reddish goo spread over one of the pieces, almost like the others had it scraped off.  Took one bite and sent it back.  The decor was like a yellow mausoleum with small cubby holes surrounding the dining room, like a place for an urn of ashes.  I guess the food would be hit and miss.  Thank goodness the omelet was good."
3,"Decent pizza, pretty close in quality to Setabello. Menu has gotten a lot smaller and the price is a little on the high side for pizza. Good service and cozy environment."
3,I had the smothered chicken with mac and cheese and green beans.I can say it was worth the drive from Balyntyne suburbs to get some good ole southern cooking. i got there at 11:30am on a Wednesday... the lunch crowd has not even came in yet so I was 1 of the first customers I gave it a 3.5  star wish could have given it a 4 star mainly the it was too pricey for the amount of food given... A fair price for that plate should have been $7 tops.. I paid $10 an didnt get a drink with it.. Don't think I will be visiting this place anytime soon..
3,"We made another lunch stop at Braddah's Island Style on our most recent vacation and once again shared a Kalua pig burrito with seaweed rice, black beans, charred pineapple verde, lettuce and tomato. Even though management committed the unpardonable sin of running out of cilantro, our burrito were still very good. The staff seemed less friendly or engaged than on our first visit just 6 months ago.  For example, no samples were offered, tables had not been bussed, and bottles of sauce were not put out until a good 10 minutes after a customer made the request.  A rating of 3.5 would be most appropriate."
3,"This place was decent. Ordered the egg rolls and grilled pork dishes. The wait was SERIOUSLY long for the food for the amount of people that were at the restaurant when my wife and I visited.\n\nThe restaurant was clean and tidy however when we were there there was quite a bit of smoke coming from the kitchen area that seeped into the main restaurant (I think they had some ventilation issues).\n\nBoth the egg rolls were super small and they served it with sweet and sour sauce (not the traditional fish sauce), and the grilled pork was tasty but portion wise small for the price.\n\nOverall, it was worth the visit but will most likely not worth another visit."
3,"Decided to yelp for a good breakfast place while I was chilling at vegas and came across this place. \n\nIt was a sunday morning about 10am and it was already super pack. It was about a 30 min wait. Which i thought for good food, should be worth the wait. \n\nFinally got in and everything look really good. All portions are huge! I end up ordering a original Benedict.\n\nI thought the food was good on presentation but the food was just okay for me. My order was kind of cold which I thought was a buzz kill. It wasn't even a little bit warm. I would think if it was nice and hot everything would have tastes great but I guess i would never know."
3,"Le Marly is ok.  I did not eat here, I only drank.  They have a signature raspberry martini with Vodka, raspberry puree and a basil leaf, which is good.  Most of the drinks are under $10, for example liquor drinks are about $8.50, 20oz beer about $7.50.  The appetizers ordered by some of the other people in our group looked good, but I did not try them.\n\nWhile this place is located on Beaver Hall in the middle of downtown, it's unfortunate that it is not very frequented.  Literally no one came in while we were there for almost 3 hours on a Thursday.\n\nThey have a very modern decor with a Purple theme.  \n\nThe staff was nice, took our coats upon entry with out a fee.  Also were very attentive to our needs (drinks)\n\nPersonally, I wouldn't pick this place for an evening out, but if the group was already going, I'd tag along."
3,"We eat breakfast here frequently. It's typical IHOP, but the food is fine and the staff takes good care of us."
3,"This hotel is really cool for the younger group, I'd say 27 years and below.  I am thirty and I have to say that although its a great hotel, its not quite my style.\n\nThe rooms are pretty good.  They are decorated very sexy but there were a few little things that could have used repair, such as the wall plugs were a little loose and rattley.  Be warned, they have vibrators and lube in the mini-bar, so if you have little kids, probably not the best.\n\nI definitely think that the pool brings in a younger crowd.  I didn't go to the pool, but there were so many guests there in their early twenties, clearly coming from the pool and highly intoxicated and loud that I think the hotel could do without. \n\nI do recommend eating at the Pink Taco inside the Hard Rock while you are there.  Very good Mexican Food.\n\nI think its a great hotel, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to people over thirty and definitely not to people bringing kids.  However, if you are in your twenties, this is the spot.  The guests that were there in the appropriate age range were having the time of their lives.\n\nIf you are from out of town, which I assume most people in Vegas are, please note that this is not on the actual strip.  It is really close, but you will have to take a cab ride to and from."
3,"Well, the plan was to have our getaway day lunch at L'Avenue, but as seems usual with that place, the line was out the door, and we just didn't have time to wait.  So, we ventured directly across the street to this friendly looking bistro with a nice streetside patio area, and were pleasantly suprised at the food, portions, and service.  Actually, those portions were quite huge, which made the prices quite reasonable.  Plus, Boreale draft pints were on special for $5, which is just stellar.  Hey, is it me, or does everyone in Montreal seem to like to have a beer or wine (or two) with lunch?  It's sort of like Europe, and I am totally down with that.  Anyway, this is a safe bet sort of place."
3,My boyfriend and I dropped in for the first time on a Sunday afternoon.  The atmosphere was nice and the restaurant was very clean.  Our server Dan was knowledgeable and pleasant. The food was average but good for the price. We will definately be back.
3,"I went here for the first time yesterday and was waiting to meet someone.  When I arrived I wasn't greeted for a good 5 minutes in a mostly empty dining room.  I had to wonder around until someone attended to me.  After telling them that I'd like a table for 2 they sit me at a big table with 5 places as opposed to a booth.   \n\nAfter my friend arrived our order was taken promptly and our waitress was nice. The food was lukewarm and could have been seasoned better although the meat on my dish was cooked tender and came in a good portion size although there were a TON of onions I'm contrast to the meat portion.  The rice was bland and boring as well.  \n\nThe decor looked great and very classy and the staff was overall friendly.  The price was fair for the portion size and I'd be willing to give this place another go, but I hope for better food and someone at the door to greet me right away."
3,"This is one of those three and a half star moments for me, Bison Witches is a sandwich shop with a fairly impressive beer selection and fair prices. I like their chili cheese nachos quite a bit and Kristen likes the miss pris. There's really nothing extraordinary here though, good food, good booze, good service, good prices. It's all good. Three and a half."
3,"I think this mom and pop restaurant is awesome! The food is great, I had the lobster roll with the clam streamers. Granted not huge compared to something you get at the coast, but living in las Vegas. It'll help cure the ache until you can hit the coast."
3,"Okay, first of all, we have driven by this place maybe 4-5 times a week and thought it was a coffee house. Never would go there with Hava Java as an option. So we were shocked to find out that this was a bar.  Like the atmosphere with good lighting and an all around good feel to the place. Cocktails were spot on. Even with a spilled cocktail the staff was excellent and gave us another at no charge. The food wasn't that memorable. We got the tamale burger. Very dry and the tamale had an off taste to it. On the bright side the fries were delicious. Not sure what spices they put in it, but we thought they had a hint of nutmeg or cinnamon which was very tasty. Definitely go back for drinks and will give the sweet and spicy burger a try. The waitress recommended that! We will reyelp next visit!"
3,"First visit was two days before NYE.  We had lunch.  The Green Papaya salad and the panang curry were both excellent.  Service was good.  Beer was cold.  There was litter on the floors and no one picked it up throughout the lunch period, but other than that it was just fine.   If I lived in Vegas, I would go back and explore the menu a bit more and then I would adjust my review accordingly.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this place to anyone who likes Thai food...btw:  Their Hottest setting is not really very hot."
3,"Not so bad. The entrance looks like a hotel check-in. The security team here was cool, which is refreshing for a club on the strip. Usually security crew's think they are real cops with a Napoleon complex.\n\nIt was a week day when I went, so it wasn't too crowded. Lil Jon was playing and he's a decent DJ. \n\nSince I'm a local and I usually avoid the strip, I was (as usual) SHOCKED when I was told it was $52 for a beer, wine, and a shot for the the birthday boy. This is why I stay away from the strip. Not that it is their fault - that's how they pay their rent. I wish clubs like this would offer local prices even when it comes to drinks. Because seriously we could just stash alcohol in our car and run in and out of the club. It's not like we're staying in a hotel and have no way to get more booze. Just a thought!\n\nOverall, compared to Haze, Tryst, ... (and all the other clubs I've been to but can't remember at the moment), this one was pretty decent. Moon is still my favorite, but XS wasn't bad."
3,"I'd give this place 3.5 stars... after reading the other reviews I expected a half of a cup of pasta or something ridiculous but I thought the portion was adequate. And, I was REALLY hungry when I got there. \n\nWe ordered the olives as a starter (they are all green and served warm) and were able to get some bread to accompany the reserve oil. \n\nOur server voluntarily explained menu items with important details like: it's ricotta gnocchi, not potato and the extra items in the puntanesca sauce (my recipe only has 7). We both had the orecchiette with sausage and greens. I found it to be a bit oily but the pasta was cooked well. \n\nHe described the deserts perfectly and the chocolate bark with almonds was a nice finish with a second glass of nero d'avalo, and, by the way... I though the wine prices were very reasonable! \n\nWithout tip, we spent about $36 a person and we each had two glasses of wine and left satisfied!"
3,"Seemingly, bars such this are effected massively by the clientele. This particular All Bar One, nestled in the middle of Edinburgh's financial district results in mostly desk job monkeys frequenting the place.\n\nOne thing I've learnt in my time in Edinburgh is that such clientele and students don't mix. Thus, All Bar One is best avoided .\n\nDrinks, food etc are all pretty standard - not that dissimilar to Wetherpoons in what it offers."
3,"After seeing the Fry's Signature in Scottsdale, I had high expectations with this supermarket. The store was not as fancy, but it was still nice looking. \n\nBathrooms are located next to the pharmacy. The air fresheners gave the bathroom an extra touch.\n\nThis supermarket has a Starbucks, sushi area, etc. No price scanners though.\n\nConsidering that this supermarket is in the middle of nowhere, it does have a lot of customers!"
3,"Not a bad place. Service is good with friendly employees. The food, although not the beat does taste good and is fresh.  While there I had the angry whopper. Im not a fan of thick french fries, but theirs was still good. \n\nWhat I liked most was their choices of soda. They have \""orange coke\"" flavored soda. I never even heard of it before, so I had to try and and wow. Was it good.  \n\nSadly the whole time I was thinking there they never swept the floor that needed it. Yeah its a small thing and I am not going to eat off it, but visually it is not appealing. The same is true of their bathroom floor."
3,"I'm here for a convention at the Mandalay and have made this place my go-to spot for two meals. My first night, I had a very good angus steak burger with bleu cheese and mushrooms; with tax, it came to $20. Not cheap but the best value I could find inside of this this giant casino hotel at 9:47 p.m. after checking in!\n\nThe next morning, I went back for breakfast. Very pricey to order a meal. So I ordered two side dishes instead: two eggs any style for $8 and home fries for $3. An oversized cup of tea was $3.50, which is a ridiculous price, but it was worth it because it came with a fancy English Breakfast tea bag, honey and there was even soy milk available.\n\nThe service here is very friendly and efficient. Not a special restaurant but it will do just fine for a decent meal at a bearable price in this pricey casino complex."
3,"I guess I don't get it?\n\nEverything was wholly average. Burgers, service, prices--average. I ordered Kiki's burger--average. Some bites were overly sweet, but the mushrooms added a good savory touch. I had the garlic fries--average. They trick you into thinking you're getting an f-ton of fries and you're getting about a handful.\n\nAlso, their hostesses kept seating people directly next to us, too, which was kind of irritating considering the restaurant was nearly empty. Twice the other diners asked to be moved so they weren't joining us for our meal.\n\nI'd have to be dragged back---to me, it's not worth a revisit."
3,"You should come here to enjoy the atmosphere and to see what the hype is all about. Order a frozen hot chocolate and you've experienced the same Serendipity experience there is to the one in NY. Maybe, not quite since that one is a little shack. Mind you, this frozen treat is super sweet and even though you'll most likely share it with another human being, your'e bound to finish only half of it and leave a bunch of whipped cream behind.\n\nTheir food is so-so...typical food you'd find at a TGIF or any other place that serves typical American \""bar food.\"" Loaded potato skins for $11? Who are you kidding? Extremely dry chicken dijon pizza for $14? Don't even think about it...you're better off buying frozen pizza and sticking it in the oven yourself. \n\nLike I said, people come here for the experience and for that, it gets 3 stars! There's just something so 'cool' about the ambiance. It makes us ladies feel special! :)"
3,"I've been to the Bank twice and I'm not sure if I'd go back. I think my first trip was an anamoly. The club was poppin with amazaaaaaazing music. I wish I could have got that mix! The club was packed and since the Bank is kinda tiny, it felt like a house party. Everyone was dancing and having a great time, you could really feel the positive energy. We met some cool people and hung at their table majority of the night so it made the night more enjoyable. You never realize how much you value being able to sit down when you want to LOL! I didn't want to leave the club because I was having so much fun, but I had an early flight so I had too :(\n\nThe 2nd trip, 6 months later on Christmas Day was less thrilling. I was on the guestlist so we walked right in at like 11. It was DOA and as time went by the club filled up the crowd looked very unattractive. I can't even blame the lameness on the fact that it was a holiday so it may have been so an off night because we left and went to XS and it was packed with better looking people *shrug*. \n\nOverall I'm thinking that on my first trip to the Bank either I got really lucky or maybe Christmas night  just so happend to be a wrong place/wrong time bust? Maybe the third time will be the charm??"
3,"It's consistently pretty good.  It's chain food, and I am a little against big corporate restaurants as they are all pretty vanilla.  That said there is nothing run of the mill about their chambord margarita."
3,"This was our first time going to Tandoori Times.  The atmosphere was pleasant and I thought it would be more crowded than it was.  \nThe good: the food. Food was great. I had the goat curry which was their Friday special, and it was wonderful.  My husband who doesn't like most curry dishes stuck with the tandoori chicken which was wonderful as well. A side of pesto naan rounded the meal out.  No complaints about the food at all.\n\nThe bad: the service.  Our waiter was very polite and friendly the few times we saw him.  He brought us menus and then left us waiting for 15 minutes before coming back to take our order.  He then disappeared for most our meal. We had to ask another server to track him down to get our bill.  Needless to say our drinks were not refilled.  We also waited a very long time for our food.\n\nThe ugly: the belly dancing.  Actually it wasn't the bellydancing. More specifically the dramatic rise in music and the incessant finger chimes of the dancer grew to be irritating.  The dancing was fun to watch in the beginning but became tiresome after first few minutes.  It was impossible to chat without shouting at my husband.\n\nGood place. Prices were reasonable and the food was good. But the service needs some work."
3,"My one pet peeve about some \""shi shi\"" restaurants are snooty patooty hosts and hostesses.  Our party did not feel welcomed at all by the hostess (who said we'd have to pay $7 per plate for a surprise birthday cake we tried to bring in) and who looked at us like we were paupers.\n\nOnce we got past Cruella DeVil, I ordered a Lycheetini from the bar.  Loved it and would've ordered more but wanted to save room for the food.\n\nWe were escorted into an elevator which took us up to the restaurant.  I was impressed by the modern Asian decor.  Our waiter and bussers was very attentive and never was a sake glass empty.  I ordered their special California roll, freshwater eel roll, and adobo chicken roll.  The food was good, but the atmosphere and ambiance is what you pay for.\n\nBased on the lumpia, pancit, and adobo on the menu, I assume the chef is Filipino.  One of the staff asked if I was related to the chef.  Didn't know all Filipinos were related.  \n\n\nThe restaurant lives up to its name.  The Social House is the perfect place to spend time with friends, enjoy some authentic sushi, and get tipsy on good sake.  If they would only get rid of the snotty hostesses."
3,"For such a thin pizza, it's really overpriced. I ordered extra cheese as a topping, and it was barely any cheese on the pizza. \nThe pizza is much different from what I am usually used to. \n\nThey have only a few items to choose from on the menu, like salad and pizza choices only. \n\nIf it gets cold it pretty much has to be thrown out because it gets really hard even when heated up. \n\nGreat thing about this place is that they use a coal oven. That's really good, it always makes pizza better. \n\nThe pizza was decent, but just not my type."
3,"The only reason I visit this Dunkin' Donuts a lot is because the one near me closes early.  If I have a late night craving for iced coffee, I have to go to Sam's Town.  Fine.  I love DD's, but this location is just so-so.  Depending on who makes the drink, the coffee is very inconsistent.  Every time, I get the same thing... and every time, it's like I'm getting a very different product.  At my normal DD's, the coffee tastes exactly the same each time.  Here, my fianc\u00e9 and I have learned to order our drinks a certain way based on who is making them, and even then, we sometimes end up with a Frankenstein drink.  Also, the workers are usually friendly.  However, there is one young girl who is often there late at night who seems to get really angry whenever a customer walks in.  I really wish she would get an attitude adjustment, because it makes ordering something really uncomfortable."
3,"OK so today someone in my office brought me a sandwich from City Market Deli. It was the Santa Fe Club. Oven Gold Turkey, Bacon, Avocado, Lettuce, Tomato, Alfalfa Sprouts, Chipotle Mayo served on Our Toasted Multi-Grain Bread.\n\nThe bread is very good and the sandwich has a good amount of flavorful turkey. The chipotle mayo has just the right amount of heat. Overall a very tasty sandwich!"
3,"let me start off by saying the food itself was definitely a 5. my boyfriend and I split yakitori and onigiri, and I had a pork rice bowl (very fatty but the stuff I did eat was delicious) and my boyfriend got a tuna and salmon salad special from the wall. we also got wine specials from the wall which was only 4 dollars a glass - amazing! the prices were pretty decent overall. we ate as much as we could. now for the not so great part:\n\nwe sat at the bar, it was SO HOT we lost our appetites. the service was good but know it was more of a communal effort than one server. also the food just came out randomly when it was ready not like appetizers then meals. fine with me but some people might not be cool with that. also the place was TINY. we had to wait about 2 minutes to sit, which was fine, but the line was pretty bad when we were leaving."
3,"Stopped by on our way home from Vegas. The food was good, I actually like their sauce better than Boiling Crab (LA). However, the waitress def could not explain the spice levels to us, they way she talked about the food made me not order as much as I normally do. She basically said the Cajun fries are too hot, and to order the mild sauce because the medium is too hot for her. This was after I told her I like spicy foods. I def could of gone for the medium sauce, and I probably would of tries the Cajun fries if she didn't dissuade me from getting them. Not a great way to sell your product! Would of given then 4 Stars but they made one of my friend chicken wings instead of fried shrimp, it took foreeverrrr for it to get corrected and they still handed is a bill with the chicken wings (their mistake). Would go back but they need to work on their service."
3,"It's a flat odd coloured mess, I can't wait to go back. I had the Dic Ann cheeseburger and sauce, which is a flat cheeseburger with meat sauce, and they give you a popsicle stick to lift it out of the cardboard basket. And the flattest hot dog with all the fixins, I can't really explain it, but it was squashed and tasty. Think White Castle but with Wolverine-like origins, from the Wilds of the Canadian wilderness, Montreal."
3,"Not my usual Goodwill drop off location, but this is pretty large (locationwise).  Looks like the moved from the stand alone building next door over to where the Hannaford... well I guess the Food Lion is still there, they just gave up some room for the Goodwill to move in.\n\nConvenient drop off location in the back of the building... have to turn around in the loading dock area, but it gets the job done."
3,"I came here the other night because I was craving Banh Mi and I really hate the Banh Mi at Lee's Sandwich. I read somewhat good reviews abotu Mr. Sandwich's Banh Mi so I decided to give it a try.\n\nThe sandwiches were definitely better than Lee's, but I have had better. Unfortunately, it was in California that I had better so I'm still on the hunt.\n\nI am, however, intrigued by the other items they have at Mr. Sandwich, so I will be back to try those. Until I find a better Banh Mi spot, I will be coming here to get them."
3,"Staff is great. The restaurant is clean, yet the food is missing something in comparison to Chipotle. Location is awesome (across from Wells Fargo)!\n\nMy boyfriend loves this place(only one like it that offers buffalo chicken), but despite multiple attempts I never finish it. \n\nNormally I love the bowl, yet I've tried the burrito too. I want to love this place. \n\nFavorite item is chips and cheese dip. They've never let me down there."
3,"Experienced my first spring training game on St. Patty's Day with a matchup of the A's Vs. the Giants.  Half my family was in A's gear and the other half in Giants.  First the good.  I really liked the size and feel of the ballpark, felt like there was no bad seat in the stadium.  Parking was inexpensive and plenty of it.  Concessions were good and they had extra people out with buckets of beer and water.  Now the bad.  We had seats in the outfields and the bleacher benches were built for 8 year olds, not someone over 6 ft tall.  Also, there was no grass areas in the outfield.  Overall, I really enjoyed the game, Giants won, and we all had a good time.  I look forward to going to Scottsdale stadium."
3,"Sort of a race to see who can shove the most meat into their bodies the fastest.  The food was okay at this place, but it does take them a long time to bring around the different meats so if you find one you like, you might get a little bit and not get a chance for more for another half hour.  Its really small and crowded for a casino restaurant, the side dishes were weak, and the drinks were expensive.  \n\nMaybe I was just disappointed at the wait, even with a reservation, but I would never be excited about going back here"
3,To go was nice and hot when I came in.\nWings were VERY GOOD. The maui wowi and the hot ranch. I don't think I would dine in though. I got a pretty cool extra room setup for parties and everything though
3,"5 Star service, this place is very homely and hidden on the side of Wynn road.  It must compete with Dai jung gum (korean place) and Pho.  I think that their dishes are very homestyle:  The Panang and Veggie green curries are reminiscent of that from a can that I can make at home.  Their soup that comes with the lunch special however, is spectacular- No MSG and sweet from overloading of chicken and veggies.  \n\nI had the Sliced beef noodle soup, Thai style. I was anticipating something spicy sour and sweet, but instead it's just beefy broth and thin pho-like noodles...  Not quite the kind they have in texas"
3,"Not sure what's going on, slow service many of their own beers out of stock on a slow Sunday evening.\nFood was so slow I cancelled my entr\u00e9e and left."
3,"Doc and Eddy's is okay. Nothing special, nothing great. Might be a decent place to meet with a larger group of people for some bar food and drinks. The place is huge. You won't feel cramped going here.\n\nTowards the back, there are many pool tables and various games to play. There are more tables toward the front to eat. You can't go far without a TV in sight.\n\nI had the SoCal Chicken Sandwich on a recent visit. The sandwich was okay, a bit dry. I did like the seasoning on my fries though. I think the food is decent for a bar. I was actually full from the food when I left. That doesn't happen often. \n\nService was okay. The service was just enough to keep you satisfied, but not great that you felt you needed to tip extremely well. My previous experience the service was well below average. \n\nMy draft beer was pretty flat with no foam. I'm glad it wasn't half foam, but maybe a bit? For a place that serves draft beer, this is BAD!\n\nI can see myself going here from time to time, but mainly because it would be a few minute walk."
3,"very elegant but after  our bad day we decided to eat here and this was our last day so we enter it was clean only few people by the bar I order the fagioli soup  it was good, and veal piccata I did like the flavor but vegetables to plain of flavor, hubby order lasagna he didn't like it  and the bread they serve it really good also the vinaigrette they serve I really love he flavor so it was good for the prize we pay"
3,"So why doesn't this place get 4 or 5 stars you ask? I have seen 3 unbelievable shows here, BRMC, The Black Keys, and Guster, all great performances, but hey this isn't a yelp about the bands, it's about the venue. This place charges mad fees for online purchasing, plus 5 bucks to park. Which adds about 10 to 12 bucks to your ticket. Now, if that went to the band, no problem, but I guarantee the maintenance on the place doesn't justify the extra fees. It's basically a big concrete room with speakers, oh the ground slopes to the stage, so your back gets all out of whack standing. \n\nWhat this place does have, good drink selection, OK prices, and big bathrooms, good security, and a descent stage. You can get a good seat no matter where you stand, and they get really good bands to perform there. I recommend it, because I have too, this is Phoenix, we have to pick and choose our musical opportunities as bands seem to skip this area, even thought it's the 5th largest city in the U.S. \n\nLet's yelp about that!"
3,"Jollibee has been my favorite fast food ever since I was a little girl.  My mom used to take me to Jollibee for my birthday - so it's quite memorable to me.  \n\nThe Jollibee in Las Vegas was the first Jollibee I have ever visited outside the Philippines.  My first visit was a while back (not so sure about the date maybe 5 years ago), but I go to this place at least once or twice a year.  \n\nMy favorite food in Jollibee: Chicken Joy with spaghetti, Peach mango pie\nOther than my favorites, I think everything else is OK."
3,"My parents Like to come here, so I often meet them for lunch.\nThis means free food for me, so the price is awesome.\nService is always friendly, and the food is pretty darn good.\nI love a cold beer and some fried zucchini, and they have it, so that's pretty sweet.\nThey could expand on their beer selection, that would be OK by me.\n\nConvenient location, cold beer, tasty BBQ.  Even if I did have to pay I think I would come here."
3,"Just stopped in there this afternoon for the fall pumpkin pretzel.  The space is pretty bare, and they could do a little more with the decor to entice customers.  The service was OK, not rude but also not friendly or welcoming.  The choices are limited to 5 flavors plus the special of the day which happened to be pumpkin.  I thought the pumpkin pretzel could have had more pumpkin flavor to it.  It tasted like a cinnamon sugar pretzel.  It was tasty though, so I won't knock them too much for that.  I'll probably be back, if they offer some more interesting flavors."
3,"How I have not written a review for the Palazzo as many times as I have stayed here I don't know. I guess what happens in Vegas really stays in Vegas! Anyway, it is a great hotel, great location, the rooms are a good size and split between a sleeping and living room type areas. What I can't stand and why I don't stay here anymore is the bathroom lighting. It is so dim and so bad you can't do your makeup at all. It totally sucks."
3,"I've been here a couple times on blurry nights in the Southside. Local can get obscenely packed, way moreso than other Southside establishments, most likely due to it being relatively new. \n\nIf you're lucky enough to be there on a night where it's jumping but not suffocatingly packed, Local can be a decent hang-out spot especially out on the patio in the summer.\n\nThe crowd is the typical Southside bar crawl crowd but if you're looking for sophistication and cosmopolitan feel... why go to the Southside? Folks are friendly enough, the service is fast if you can get to the bar but the prices can be a little expensif esp. for shots.\n\nStill, I'd say I like Local for a night of drinking and swearing, if the weather's nice and the place isn't jam packed."
3,"Standard overall. Came to look at a PS3 and some games, but realized that Black Friday would produce better deals. Ended up looking around the store for CDs and DVDs. The selection is not too impressive since everything can be streamed, purchased, or downloaded now-a-days. \n\nMore than anything, Best Buy is around for nostalgia. This store does have friendly staff which are helpful in searching for items though."
3,"Got a cotton candy sorbet on top of vanilla custard with sprinkles. It was absolutely delish and not overly sweet. The custard was so nice and thick that I was afraid the plastic spoon they gave me would snap. The servers could be a little friendlier and less monotonous. They were helpful but gave me the impression that they just didn't want to be there. The store gives the ambience of a darker Baskin Robbins. For a nicer experience, my advice is to get your stuff to go and eat it at the nearby park."
3,It's a decently good sized store with lots of cheap stuff that is almost fashionable.  There were lots of people in the store and people buying quite a bit of clothes.  Not certain why I ended up dropping dough but somehow I felt like I just needed to have something new to carry around and bring home I guess.
3,"We have friends who rave about mu shu. We like it, but not enough to make it regular, and we live just a few blocks away. Price/value is measured in pounds. Friendly service, still it's cafeteria quality"
3,"Through all our trips to Arizona, we kept driving by Nielsen's Frozen Custard when we went to and from our hotel to our daughter's home.  Each time, I would say to myself that we had to give it a try.  However, many times we would drive by it when it was closed.  Well...this trip (our final one to visit our daughter who has now moved), we got here!\n\nUpon entering, we were surprised to find that in addition, to frozen custard, they also served meals (burgers, sandwiches, salads, etc.).  We were there strictly for the frozen custard.\n\nWe were greeted by a very friendly young lady who worked behind the counter.  She was patient with us as we perused the massive topping menu---so much choice!  In the end, I chose a small cup of vanilla with sprinkles and my husband had a small cup of unadorned chocolate custard.  After ordering, we were given a number to put on our table then the young lady brought out our order quickly.\n\nWe both agreed that the frozen custard had a nice, creamy consistency.  However, we found that it didn't have much flavor.  Neither the vanilla nor the chocolate had a strong enough flavor---and that was disappointing.  We were expecting much better.\n\nYet, we don't regret giving it a try.  Had we not done so, it would have been one of those things that would have nagged at me.  I would have always wondered if we had missed out on something excellent."
3,"Clean moderately priced hotel. Came in during CES week and paid about 160$ a night for 4 nights. Got a smoking room, you can hear plumbing next door, stains in the bath and toilet from cigg burns, sitting chair had white stains on it. It costs 5$ for hot water! It seems it's always the expensive hotels that don't have a microwave, coffeemaker, fridge, and charge an arm and a leg for stuff like hot water, and wifi.  Anyhow I got smart and just heated up my water with a glass cup and the iron. PH you think you can work me, but no no no.. LOL."
3,"It's a Grassmarket pub of reasonable size, with a reasonable selection of beers and spirits and a reasonable decor. There are some hidden treats though: be sure to seek out the back garden on a summer's evening, or head upstairs to the quiet and reserved dining area. There's also a healthy festival pedigree - a small room even further upstairs finds itself converted into a snug and cosy performance space for comedy acts of the surreal and experimental end of the spectrum (in my experience).\n\nWell done Beehive: you're there when we need you."
3,"We go to this location when we don't feel like driving too far, or are in the shopping plaza and need to get feeder crickets for our lizards. \n\nit is always a hassle to find someone to help us, even after asking 3-4 people. The cashiers are generally friendly, and have offered discounts for standing in line for more than 2 minutes while they are having issues getting a customer through the checkout process.\n\nWe will go back for the same reasons we go there in the first place, it isn't our first choice for pet stores to go to though."
3,"this Frys has come a long way,  there selection of better quality and variety , decent selection of avalible produce organic as well as non and  breads,i can usually find a decent selection of meats, lamb seems to be hit and miss same with fish I dont under stand why they buy farm raised color added salmon ...oh and from the east coast except maybe for the price aspect hey fish buyer for frys the nw is alot closer and offers better quality  salmon but my biggest pet peive w/this store is the service at the deli there slow and incompetent i dont know how many times i have waited way to long to be waited on and ended up just walking away or avoiding the deli all together knowing the outcome ......."
3,"I'm not sure why they call themselves barcelona, not very authetic spanish cooking. but the tapas are good. they could have a bigger selection of tapas. service was excelant. check them out on half price night!!! And try the Sangrias, free samples are available..."
3,"I don't get the 2+ hour wait? \n\nThe hostess isn't very nice. Had two encounters with her and she's just snobby.\n\nAnyways, the food... Shared a bunch of stuff. The pork belly tacos, bone marrow, tzatziki dip, skewers with chimichurri, a sushi roll. All were okay but nothing super amazing. The skewers were a little bland. \n\nHad the pistachio ice cream which was good but super melted when it came out.\n\nAgain, don't understand the hype. It was okay but don't think I'll be back anytime soon."
3,"Stopped in for Sushi. Trendy atmosphere. Loud club music playing to pump you up as you eat. Classic Bruce Lee flick projected on wall is good for a few laughs. Sushi is fresh. Stuck with some of the more basic Maki rolls (Spicy Tuna, California). Both were on par with what you would expect from most Sushi restraunts. \n\nThe Sapporo Beer in 22oz can has an interesting steel shaped design to it."
3,"This small place is not easy to find.  They have a good menu, I ordered the fried beef flat noodle to go.  It was just okay.  \nThe owner speaks Cantonese and I was able to chat with them a bit.  I think I need to order something else next time just so I can provide a better review for this place.  But the first dish didn't pass my test. \nI will go back to try other things."
3,I think Rito's is overpriced for what you get. The burritos look huge because they use an over sized tortilla that hides the tiny amount of meat they use so most bites are filled with tortilla not meat. If the green chile burrito I ordered was filled with meat then maybe it would be worth $8. The beans were above average and I thought their salsa was amazing even though they charge 25 cents for two tablespoons of it. I expected to be blown away by the food here but it tasted just like the food I grew up eating. It made me want to hug my mom :)
3,"I would like to try Richardson's again. I went on a date here and we were going to order a couple things off the menu, but the manager said, \""Let me take care of you- you're going to love this\"". We looked at each other (date and I) and were like, \""Ok, I guess\"".\n\nThe manager sent out a garlic plate. It wasn't the worst thing for a date, since roasted garlic isn't stinky, but it was a cheesy heavy gross mess for me. I'm not into that kind of food at all and would have much preferred to choose something different. It was huge as well, we couldn't even finish it and didn't have any room to try any entrees on the menu. \n\nSo, well, next time I know better and will stick to my own palate preferences rather than be persuaded by  a stranger that thinks first date food should be the size and style of a fancy superbowl platter. The dish wasn't gross, but it was incredibly heavy for 2 people. i might order that as an app if I was with a party of 4 or larger.\n\nOverall, the place is beautiful and it's a great date spot. Call ahead and make a reservation though. I hope one day I can go again and try something that I like better."
3,"Five stars for the low-slung bar for and manned by midg--ahem, I mean, little people.  But that in itself is not the entirety of the place.  If there's any place in Scottsdale that screams Klassy, this would be it. \n\nGiligin's tugs at the senses like a trashy but fun cousin would, whether it's the sticky floors, the tacky wheel of misfortune, the swing hanging randomly in the bar, the refrigerated cases behind the bar like you're at a liquor store or the nightly promotion gimmicks - goldfish races, anyone?  They have a menu, but I will admit I'm scared to try the food here.\n\nWe came here a couple of weeks ago in the hoopla that was FBR Super Bowl weekend and after ditching all places on Scottsdale Road, we ended up here.  We had a blast before and after the $1 jello shots, and I even got some rad photos with the Captain Morgan's guy.  Later, I found myself walking around with a giant Coors Light, while being soundly defeated by a visiting Wisconsinite girl in a rousing game of beanbag toss. Midwestern bar games were never my thing."
3,"If I could eat the pepper jack mac and cheese all day long, I would. I get it every time I go. The sandwiches are pretty good too. It's got a great, laid back atmosphere where you can get pretty decent bar food and a have a beer or two."
3,CVS is known as a great Pharmaceutical chain that also offers everyday grocery items.  This store located off the 215 and Valley Verede is a great addition to this wonderful chain.\n\nThe savings and weekly specials are very hard to beat at CVS.  I have always enjoyed the service and 24 hour drive through Pharmacy at almost every location.  Awesome store!!!
3,Chicken parm was just average. Field greens salad was great. Wait staff was great. The seating is right under the blue sky and in front of a large fountain in the Forum Shops.
3,"If this is a golf club, I'm the abominable snowman.  Looks like a pleasant place, but there sure as heck aren't any *golf* holes getting balled here."
3,"I like the idea of Sidebar, but I don't really love the place. The drinks are decent, so I would go there for that- though I just have never found it to be very fun. Once I went in and had an amazing bartender from Sanfrancisco- I really enjoyed that visit, but then the next time I had this bartender guy and he was really uptight and condescending whenever anyone asked him a question. It really bugged me, and it made it a less fun experience. I have never gone back."
3,"This is a fairly new place.  It's charming and homey.  The restaurant has been very clean both times we visited.  Both times there we sat at the bar, and drinks were made well, however we did not eat.  They do not have beer on tap and carry no craft beers, although one of the owners days that will change soon.  They have a nice bar, however the bar top is not as wife as the foot step on the bottom of the bar, making sitting at the bar rather uncomfortable.  They do have a game room in the back with pool tables, foosball and darts.  They also have a back patio with corn hole and horseshoes.  Being new, the service is a little slow and they don't seen to have enough staff, but maybe that was the time of day we went there each time.  We will definitely go back and try their barbeque."
3,"Whenever I'm in Vegas, I always like to eat at a nice restaurant. This was my choice one year. \nWe had ordered for appetizers was the bone marrow and maple glazed pork belly. These were amazing. Melt-in-your-mouth goodness!!!! \nAnd for our entrees, I had ordered the 8 oz. filet mignon/American Wagyu while my bf ordered the \""A tasting of New York sirloin\"". We both requested med-rare as how our steak should be cooked. As for the sides, we had the wild field mushrooms, creamed spinach and broccoli-rapini. And of course, a bottle of red wine(I don't remember what it was). When our steaks and sides arrived, I was excited to cut into the steak and taste the wonderfully crusted meat but to my surprise, I was disappointed and didn't like my steak at all. I like my steak crusted but not burnt!!! I didn't touch my steak for the rest of my meal but I did enjoy the wine and the sides we had ordered. I can honestly say that I will not be returning. That's only based on my steak alone bc the service was impeccable."
3,"Parking SUCKS.\nEverything is over priced. \n\nIt took me 25 minutes to get a cup of coffee, and I wouldn't have minded the wait if someone had acknowledged my presence and given the polite \""I'll be with you as soon as possible\"" report. Clearly, that was too much to ask for.\n\nBut if you happen to go when it's not busy (i'm not sure when this is...) I'm fairly certain the ambiance would be delightful. It's an interesting concept. Also, the spaces are WAY too tight for the type of traffic they have in there.\n\nThe gelato on the South side of the building is really bland and boring. I'd rather eat store brand ice cream. Their Pizza is really awesome, though.\n\nGreat idea - mediocre execution."
3,"Ladies, please be careful especially on a Saturday night. I was here last night (Saturday) with a couple girlfriends seated on the patio. We ordered drinks from the server who brought them from the inside bar so we could not see them being poured or who had access to them before delivering to our table. After just one Cosmopolitan I was barely able to walk and got very sick later than night. This has never happened to me before and I'm concerned something was slipped in my drink. Not necessarily by staff but possibly a patron at or near the bar before our drinks came to us. Thank god my girlfriends were there to get me home safely. Just a lesson learned to always keep an eye on your drinks from the moment they are poured... No matter where you're at!"
3,Someone here does not care about his job. Now this is usually not true about the Bookman's employees I have encountered over the years.\n\nMaybe it is because he is old...or just had a bad day.  He did not even glance at all the trade I was bringing in...before flat out telling me no.\n\nAs I said..this is usually never a problem.  Yet I always visit the 19th ave location because it is closer.  So for a change of pace we sometimes visit this location.  I always seem to find something here....actually found 2 items I have been wanting.  But changed my mind on after the issue at the trade counter.
3,"Went here for lunch today for the first time and loved the atmosphere and service. Everyone was super nice and helpful and the booths are so cushy and comfy! \n\nMy friend and I shared the Mushroom and Sausage Pizza and the Chicken Chopped Salad. The crust, mushrooms and sausage on the pizza were excellent. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the red sauce. It needed more development, it tasted a bit like tomato paste out of the can. \n\nThe chicken in the salad was grilled and in nice, small, easy-to-eat pieces. The dressing was a bit watered down and lacking in flavor. \n\nAll in all, it seemed like Nook just needs a little bit of fine-tuning but has great potential. I would definitely be willing to give it another go, mainly based on the excellent service."
3,"Pretty average experience. Great view until you walk closer to the wall and you see nothing but abandoned buildings until you see South Mountain. It was cool being next to US Airways Arena and Chase field. For some reason I thought this bar was on the top of the hotel, but it's only on the third floor. Decent spot, drinks were okay, I might come back again if people from out of town are here."
3,"I admit we went here because of DDD (Guy Fieri).  The dive atmosphere did not disappoint.  Good bartender, even though the bar was wet/sticky.  We ordered wings and pizza.  The wings were very good, as was the pizza, although it took a very long time before the food came out.  \n\nThe food was good, but they don't have the ability to handle the popularity of this place.  It's a tiny kitchen with one person cooking."
3,"I don't know what it is about Herb 'n Flavors, but every time I go there something is off.    Don't get me wrong, overall they have some tasty dishes, but some others fall flat.  It's really hit or miss.  The first time I got the Spinach 4-Cheese Quesadilla and it was just too greasy and cheesy.  I know, I know it's \""4-cheese\"", but there is a delicate balance with cheese.  My friend ordered it another time and the balance was much better.  The second time I went I got the Veggie Rice Bowl.  Wonderful seasoning, but they overcooked the tofu.  We also ordered the Vegan Spinach & Artichoke Dip.  No thanks.  My friend had the salmon - loved it.  My other friend got the Pollo Fresca and the Chicken Shawarma Wrap separate times.  He liked both. The 3rd time I ordered the Veggie Bowl without the tofu (much better).  The falafel fries are yummy.  The tiramisu is absolutely INCREDIBLE!  I must say the owner is really personable and KNOWS how to cater to his customers.  That type of treatment will keep me coming back for the things that I really enjoy."
3,"The place is fine, but a bit loud when crowded. Plenty of people with laptops and couples chatting away. The coffee was standard fare, as in sugary and tasty. The two things that I noticed are the number of tables made it feel crowded even when the number of people dwindled, and the bathroom was not the cleanest I have seen in other stores. Although not my favorite place, it's a good place to pop in or stay awhile, just a bit tight if at capacity. I would return."
3,"I came here with my mom to order take out because she really likes this place. I already have a place to eat Chinese, but she was driving. The place was clean. They have pictures of food up, but I couldn't tell what any of them were. \n\nThe service was good. I had a Sprite from the fountain, or what I thought was a Sprite. When I took a sip it was not Sprite. I told the guy at the counter and he said ok and made no effort to check the machine. Then I tried the Lemonade. That was water. When I went to pour it out, there were floaties of I don't know what in my cup. I sat down thinking they would get to the machine, but they didn't. \n\nThey have lunch specials that go till 4p.  Unfortunately, we had gone in the evening, so I'm not sure of the portions they serve, but their prices are reasonable and about the same as other restaraunts. \n\nI had Udon soup which was good. At the same time unappetizing because I kept thinking about the machine. I'm all about supporting small businesses, but first impression is key."
3,"As others have said it is a nice bowling alley.  We came around 5 on a Friday evening and the wait was an hour so that was a bummer.  We decided to wait and played in the arcade and it had nice equipment but was outrageously expensive.  If you don't mind spending a little money it isn't a bad place, but maybe next time we'll try stopping by at a less busy time."
3,"Went here for lunch with my 2.5 month old on a Friday because I had a taste for some pasta, plus I had a rewards card coupon. It wasn't crowded at 1:30. Because I had a stroller, I opted to sit in the bar area. It took 5 min. for someone to come over to see what I wanted to drink. Since, it took so long for drinks, I went ahead and ordered when she came over. Food came out fairly quickly and was tasty. However, I only had water and I only got a refill when it was time to bring me my check. \n\nI thought the bartender/waitress was strictly for the bar area and it would be fast service, but I was wrong. \n\nAlso, they have a good happy hour, so that would be the only reason I would go back."
3,"This place is very quirky and reminded of a place I would find in Los Angeles. The service was great and the menu diverse. Even though it's a raw, vegan restaurant, cooked food and meat were available. My only qualm was that everything was too salty, as though to compensate for lack of cooking. The desserts were delicious, although the crusts of the pies too salty. I think I drank six glasses of water, which was way too much."
3,"My boyfriend and I came here a couple of months ago and I was slightly disappointed. They mixed up our orders with another table which happens I understand. The food was pretty good, but it wasn't incredibly memorable. I think we should give it another shot sometime though and try a few different things. The bird cages next to the restaurant were pretty cool."
3,"Was mostly disappointed here.  Had heard good things, but the pizza was mostly uninspiring.  The crust was bland... and too dense/hard/chewy.  I appreciate light and airy crusts and that was what I was expecting, but really nothing like it came through.  The fig appetizer was delicious, but otherwise not really worth the $$ I spent."
3,"Johnny Rockets holds a special place in my heart with memories of mall trips with my friends in high school. This location wasn't as fantastic as those of my past. There's only bar-seating and everything is definitely rushed. They've done well with they space they have, but I truly miss being able to tuck into a booth, listen to our own jukebox and sip on a beautifully pulled milkshake. \n\nUpon our trip we ordered a Big Apple shake and a Dark Chocolate shake. We received one but not the other and had to fight for the attention of the staff to ask for our second shake, which was definitely not even on the radar of being made. Once we actually received the second shake, everything was delicious - but it's just not the experience we were hoping for :/"
3,"I stopped in here for lunch today, joined this time by friends Shelley M. & Arlin B.  Here's the long and short of it:\n\n*  The food they serve here tastes great!  (That's one thing, isn't it?)\n\nHOWEVER:\n\n*  The first time I came it was freezing cold inside!\n\n*  The second time I came it was roasting hot inside!\n\n*  This time it was freezing cold inside!\n\n*  The service wasn't as friendly this time as during my previous visits.\n\n*  Our food all arrived on one tray, & it was up to us to try to figure out what was what.\n\n*  They usually give each diner a little tray of cooked onions, peppers, plus lemon & lime slices, but this time we only received two of these trays for the three of us.     :-(\n\nThe temperature should be controlled better in here, & it's important for the counter & table service to remain friendly, as it was before!\n\nMy order this time was for...\n\nCarne Asada (beef) Taco:  $1.25\nAl Pastor (pork) Taco:  $1.25\nPescado (fish) Taco:  $2\nBeef Tamale:  $2"
3,"I promise I am going to give this place another shot at providing a better experience.  I always want to write a great review of a place.  Their sushi was really good, although i took it to go, it might have been even better if i ate it there.\n\nThere seems to be a pretty good happy hour menu that is on my list of happy ours to try.\n\nAs I was waiting, I noticed the music was loud, so conversations might be a little hard to have here.  The prices are pretty much in line with other valley sushi restaurants.\n\nSo I hope to actually dine in and upgrade my review."
3,"Thirty-five minute wait must mean something's tasty here. Good thing they have free coffee outside while you wait. Nice touch.\n\nI liked the atmosphere, like a southern hospitality cottage-type setting. It went well with the friendly service we were given by all of the servers there, since none are assigned to a specific table. They all work together to cater to all guests.\n\nWe came for breakfast, so I wanted the stuffed French toast. Not a fan of pb, so I asked if I could get a Nutella & banana one instead. Wasn't a problem at all. Cool. But then when my food came out, it didn't look like Nutella. It wasn't as dark. I tasted it, and turns out they do a Nutella + cream cheese mix. Disappointment. I tasted more cream cheese than Nutella. Meh.\n\n3 out of 5 at our table ordered the corned beef hash. They picked the right thing. Definitely better than my french toast. Oh well."
3,"Sometimes when I'm at work and I get overloaded, I go into old-people f*#k mode, ie; any way to get the job done.\n\nI suspect that's how the chef functions at AF when the place is packed to the gunwales because my herb roasted chicken sandwich, a long standing favorite of mine became my least favorite...all in the space of one visit.\n\nI've rarely had a bad meal here, but Saturday, the place hosted every old woman's birthday, baby shower, and all-around chick event. I think the kitchen panicked and started throwing shit on plates like monkeys were ruling the kitchen.\n\nAnyway, it wasn't good.\nCome here when it's not so packed and you don't have to listen to the gay couple next to you bragging about their trip to Barbados and how they frolicked nude on the beach.\nThe image of swinging dicks combined with a bad sandwich was over the top.\nGlad I have a Xanax prescription."
3,"I see what you're trying to do here and I do like it, I can't just grant a good review for only being.  What I don't understand is the overblown reviews for the place, to me it is not worth five stars.  First of all, it closes at 7pm on a Saturday, no good.\n\nHad 3 pieces of fried chicken, 2 waffles, cornbread and mac and cheese.  While all of this was good, it wasn't great.  The chicken was juicy and well seasoned, but it was lacking for meat.  The mac and cheese seemed to use liquid cheese, instead of taking the time to really create some down-home goodness.  I'm going to stick with Honey Bears for my glutenous indulgences.\n\nI wish Lolo's had some outside perspective on their food and menu.  This type of place can compete where there aren't many options but there are so many restuarants that have better quality, better service and cleaner spaces in the area.  \n\nThe Fried Chicken (strips) at Four Peaks beat this place.  Bring on the hate mail."
3,"Starbucks has become quite the institution here in the good ole' USA. As most folks do, I enjoy their coffee. Generally I'm a Venti Mocha, no whip kind of girl but on occasion I will branch out and try a Columbian Roast or a Frappaccino.\nThe breakfast sandwiches are not the best, but better tasting than McDonald's in my opinion. The bakery items are fine for prepackaged stuff. \nI don't usually go in as it's always crowded, there is a long line (even in the drive thru - plan a few extra minutes for waiting) and for some reason it's always cold. \n\nAll in all I prefer home grown coffee shops or small hole in the wall places but this is, just as it is called, a Starbucks, and nothing more."
3,"i was craving the frozen hot chocolate...it was monstrous! it was pretty good tho not quite how i remember it from new york...\n\nwe had ordered a bunch of other things like the nachos, a burger, the hotdog. everything was pretty good - but not sure if it is quite worth the hefty price tag for diner type food (ok, it's a bit fancier than diner food).\nwish we had some room for dessert - we decided next time, to just go for dessert.\n\nservice was just okay. a bit slow and we needed to flag down our waiter a couple of times. they do take harris' comps - so that was a plus."
3,"There are many bigger and better Harris Teeter locations in Charlotte, but if you live in Plaza Midwood or NoDa, this one is your best option. Unfortunately, the produce there isn't great. And the location is pretty small. It's packed and frustrating around 6 pm, when everyone is getting off work and stopping there to buy groceries. I will say, the VIC card rewards are pretty good. You get good deals, and I got free luggage once through the program."
3,"This spot is great had a little trouble checking in as the system went down right when we got there, the free breakfast from 6-9am made up for the lost time will be checking out all the other spots that offer free breakfast for now on now that i know they exsist"
3,"There's no doubt that XS is a beautiful club.  But, I really didn't have much of a great time here considering it's suppose to be one the best in Sin City. Maybe, it was the music.  Which was more Techno than Hip Hop.  Or maybe it was the crowd, which I wasn't feeling.  There were some nice ones out of the bunch, but most of them were stuck-up. Although, I have to give it up to security though, because they sure did a good job at making that line move.  I was kinda feelin' bad for the guys during Memorial Day Weekend though.  The cover charge to get in for a guy at XS was $100 and later on that night it jumped to $200 just to get in!  \n\nRidiculously XS-cessive indeed!\n\nBut honestly didn't think it was quite worth all the hype."
3,Waitstaff was great!   Food was excellent.   \nUnfortunately the manager was not very helpful.   There was a large party seated prior to us and held up the kitchen.  The manager did not come over and explain the situation nor asked what can be done to help the extra long wait.   The manager also did not help out with the last minute confusion at the end of the meal.
3,Lee's sandwiches are lee's sandwiches iam just excited I don't have to drive all the way to China Town to get my Viet Sandwich fix...Yay!!!
3,"Cafe has new owners that are very nice as well as the staff.  We ordered burgers, fries, salads, and grilled ham and cheese sandwich.  All were delicious!"
3,"Sunflower is now Sprouts after being bought out. And I'm not so sure the changes Sprouts introduced are better. This location carries a limited line of Boar's Head Deli Meats and a few cheeses. The meat and seafood counter is also a bit on the smallish side as well but staffed by some friendly people. The bulk of their floor space seems to be taken up by fresh produce...and while prices are not exactly cheap, they are competitive with or cheaper than Whole Foods. \n\nSince Sprouts took over their supplement selection seems to have dropped in quality and selection. Case in point: Kava Kava. Where before I had 5 different choices in capsules alone, on my last visit I only found 2. And the brands they did carry were not ones I would buy. If you need basic supplements to start out this is a good location to explore. But if you've got experience with supplements you may find this selection to be a little on the pathetic side. \n\nAs much as I want to like this place, 3 Stars is the best I can give them."
3,"Meh..not particularly memorable.\nI've eaten at this location and the one by ASU, though I like this location better. I would probably only eat here if I was walking by and I was starving. \nThe cookies ROCK though, I like that you get one with your sandwich. And they have my favorite flavor of Jones Soda (Sugar-free Black Cherry) which kicked ass. \n\nWarning: The roast beef sandwich (Overture?) comes with horseradish sauce and it is hot as a mother.  I like the spice but it was almost unbearable. My nose pretty much turned into a snotty waterfall. \n\nGo to Opa Grill next door instead."
3,"Interesting restaurant.  Limited menu.  I assume the menu will grow as this place finds its way.  We had the cheese plate(ok), beets(very good), mussels(very good), iceberg sald(big and good).  Pretty good beer selection.  The music was defintely off.  I am sure this will change as well.  The brunch menu looked very good.  \n\nI'll go back sometime to see what changes have been made."
3,Went here for breakfast last Monday and had to wait almost 20 mins to be seated as it was very busy. This also showed in the food which seemed to be hurriedly prepared. I had the pancake combo and found the turkey bacon to be extremely salty and the pancakes themselves to be flat rather than fluffy. The other members in our group also felt that the food was lacking. So overall a very OK type of meal and nothing like the IHOP that i normally visit in Torrance.
3,Very low key kool area. A salon right across and beanch to sit on in front of the wondow. Overall it is like being in San Diego Ca.
3,"Food quality disappointing. Not the best steak in Vegas.\n\nThree of us enjoyed two ribeyes ($52) and one filet ($46). Waiter told us their ribeye is the best steak in Vegas, but don't believe it. They were cooked correctly. The rub was rather bland and the crusting on the filet was hard. On a scale of one to ten, my ribeye overall was a 7. I've had 10's before in Vegas, so the competition is tough! But just claiming you have the best steak doesn't make it so.\n\nThe sides ($9 each) were disappointing. We ordered four. Creamed spinach, always a favorite of mine and recommended by the waiter, was just odd and bland - didn't taste interesting or flavorful at all. The best side was the asparagus, but honestly, how hard is it to steam asparagus?\n\nDesert, as it often is at these kind of places where desert is an afterthought, was disappointing and ended the overall experience on a \""blah\"" note.\n\nWine list was excellent.\n\nWith so many great places in Vegas, you can do much better. Everything else was top notch, but the food is the core of the experience and Delmonicos is just average, unfortunately."
3,"I've had this place on my radar for awhile now, having checked out their menu online, I was wanting to try the pear omelet.  A friend and I stopped in after the National Kidney Foundation Walk and I expected for a late Saturday morning to find a line and a long wait.  I was surprised when we were seated immediately.  The atmosphere was like being in someone's home, very homey and comfortable.  I must say though, I was a little grossed out by the thick gray carpeting, it just looked dirty and and didn't feel very sanitary to me.\n\nMy friend and I both ordered the pear omelet and it was good, not great.  Needed more pears in it if you're going to name the dish after them.  We noticed what others were eating and I must say I'd probably come back to try the fantastic looking french toast!  \n\nAll in all I thought our experience was just average, nothing really stood out as being all that good or bad."
3,"Good bang for the buck buffet.. It's been awhile since I've been here, but I go for dinner. They had hand scooped ice cream.  It is cheap.\n\nThe meats were decent.  Not 5 star quality.. but it isn't bad. You just need to find something you like."
3,"Mediocre galettes and that was a really disappointing thing during my recent trip to Montreal.\n\nI told that to my Montrealer friend who said, \""told you so\"". \n\nThat being said, their desserts and coffee choices were fantastic. Anything with chocolate, Juliette et Chocolat does okay. Just don't rely on their dinner menu!"
3,"This is small quaint place that sells pizza by the slice or the whole pie if you wish. \n\nThis is a 1000 times better than Sabarro's but nothing to write home about either.  If you want something quick and cheap, this is a great place. \n\nIf you are waiting for someone to arrive at the airport this is also a great pit stop."
3,"We enjoy happy hour here. The Tuscan Taster appetizers are very good. The spicy shrimp and eggplant varies from time to time in flavor and preparation ie., crispy vs oily. The burger is always a solid choice.  It would be nice for a healthy appetizer option.\nYou need to stick with the happy hour drinks or else your tab gets sky high quickly.\nAt the San Tan location, the blonde bar manager is efficient but super serious and curt.  We always leave satisfied but not thrilled."
3,Wow. Can't believe this location is closed. I was not aware that it had and tried to stop by to grab some lunch to take back to the office. What a disappointment.
3,"I would have given this a higher rating except for the prices.  Ok - in this economy, I am lucky to be able to eat out at all.  However, $11 for their smallest sandwich and two small sides and a drink ($1.99 each!!) is a little pricey especially if you have a family to feed.  They should consider making it a buffet since they charge buffet prices or giving you a little more for you money.\n\nBut, yes, the food is good."
3,The food is good....selection is ok.  The service is good. It is WAY loud ALL of the time.  I understand that it is more of a sprots bar kinda feel but not being able to hear the waitress was a little frustrating/\nWe will go back I am sure of it.
3,"I haven't stayed here but I've been inside. Hotel looks really nice. Nice lobby and very well decorated. Its located at a descent location on the Strip. However, their casino isn't the best. If you are a gambler, might wanna hit up some other casinos."
3,"Good place, but i was kind of annoyed how my friends got there orders way before i did , and i ordered it right when we walked in i was starving and they take a while to decide what they would like to order , spicy mayo , is just straight up mayo and spiracha which was weird because i have always ordered it at diffrent locations and its actually there own take on a sauce not a blob of mayo with spiracha on the side -_- , eel sauce was alright , there rainbow roll was delicious and eel roll , my friends were also happy with what they ordered which was arizona roll , crunch roll , and a caifornia shrimp tempura roll , it was good over all , but im a sauce person , and they were clearly lacking in that =]"
3,"My sister and I headed over here last week and I have to say, I was a little mixed about our visit.\n\nWhen we first walked in, there was no one there. Literally. We were eye'ing the ice creams for almost 5 minutes before the server drifted in from the Z Pizza side.\n\nI had the Pink Spot sundae with two ginormous scoops of kona coffee and hot fudge. The ice cream was meh, but the hot fudge was very good and served in generous portion. My sister had the low-fat coffee with ribbons of chocolate and she raved.\n\nThe prices weren't outrageous considering the serving size; just one week before I spent three dollars more for the same exact thing at Mary Coyle's.\n\nI wasn't overly impressed with the ice cream, but they get props for always having at least one low fat, sugar free, or sorbet offering.\n\nIt probably wouldn't be my first choice for ice cream, but because they are in the neighborhood they get a gold star for convenience!"
3,"It took me a while to decide whether to give Diablo's 2 or 3 stars.  I decided to go with three since most decent places in Vegas are expensive and at least Diablo's had very yummy food and generous portions.\n\nHowever, this was the worst service I have ever experienced anywhere...ever.  Our server, on the rare occasion she stopped by, was straight-up rude.  She was so rude it seemed like it had to be intentional- she even got frustrated with my friend just because she wanted fresh cheese on her nachos instead of both fresh and creamy/processed cheese.  The waitress sighed loudly and said in an irritated voice, \""It's NOT going to taste the same\"" and shook her head when my friend explained that she's never liked that kind of \""fake\"" cheese.  She also grumpily said, \""Well, what do you want?\"" when she came to take our order.  No hello, no eye contact, nothing.\n\nIt also took at least 30 minutes for our orders to be taken even though the restaurant wasn't very busy, another 90+ minutes before our food showed up, and another 30+ minutes to get the check.  What was supposed to be a quick bite to eat for 5 of us turned into a 3-hour ordeal.\n\n1 star for service\n5 stars for food\n2.5 stars for value"
3,"I've been to The Joint 3 times--once in the old Joint and twice in the newer, enlarged Joint.\n\nFor the current Joint, the flow of people in and out was well designed but I wonder why they didn't install a reversible escalator so part of the crown could go downstairs that way and the rest by stairs.\n\nFor this concert of KISS, I got balcony seating.  I liked it better than floor seating because I found the floor seating to be very tightly packed next to each other.  The balcony on the other hand had theatre style seats that were comfortable.\n\nThe sound and lighting in the Joint are exceptional.  Needless to say, KISS had a lot of pyro effects and the lighting was great.  It would be nice if they could have raised the catwalk.  It was in the way for some of the stage viewing.\n\nThere aren't too many shows that I would go here to see but if I went again, I'd try to get a table seat on the side balconies.\n\nAs a tip, park in the Paradise garage for easy access to the Joint."
3,"Forget the casino where your wallet takes a pounding, this is where your body takes punishment. But look at yourself in the mirror, man, you did it to yourself. Leg of lamb, prime rib, wild boar, kalbi ribs, spicy shrimp, mac-n-cheese, gnocchi, cheeses, salads, breads, and then the... OK stuff, which is too much too mention. Eye in the sky sees you eating like a gluttonous pig. Pace self with sanctity. #foodslut"
3,"This place had its ups and downs. The atmosphere is lovely , very old school great for a date at night. The food is ok depending on what you get, kinda pricey. And nothing outstanding for the price either. Portions I think are big or at least enough to share.\n The main thing with this place is the service, I wanted to give 2 1/2 stars. The service is just slow, inconsistent and dreadful. By the time we got our food we didn't care and just wanted to leave. A formal complaint was actually made at the end.\n Save this place to try on a busy date night when they got something going on and it might be worth it. I don't suggest coming here for a quick lunch or entirely for food itself. It has location, a vtg vegas feel atmosphere and I don't drink but it also has booze too. However just for the food and the service alone would not be worth the trip."
3,"Decent bubble tea, surly service.  Got a ginger milk tea and asked what type of jelly they have (Didn't see any selections on the menu or on the board).  The woman at the register gave me a really dirty and annoyed look, and said \""What type are you looking for???\"".... Not sure why that would cause such annoyance?  Anyways, my ginger milk tea with lychee jelly was OK, a bit too mild for me (just a hint of ginger flavor), and a bit too sweet.  Plus, it was WARM in there!  Please put the A/C on!  (Maybe that's why the cashier was so surly, I would be grumpy in such a warm store too if I had to be in there all the time!)"
3,got two chocolate croissants and 1 mini cake..  \n\nIf i'm paying 2-3 dollar for a croissants at least enough chocolate for taste.
3,"Mr. Lucky's is nothing special - except for their off menu $7.77 Special.  It's salad, steak and shrimp and mashed potatoes for $7.77.  It's a good meal for a good price at a 24/7 location. If you need something to eat and most of the places are closed - get this.\n\nObviously this is the reason to go here - just look at the other reviews!"
3,"Thai Basil is alright, not great but alright. I ordered the Pad-see-ew and the weirdest thing is that the noodles were tasty and delicious but all the veggies and chicken were pretty well tasteless. Plus, my medium to hot dish was much more mild to no spice. \n\nHowever, my iced Thai coffee was delicious and the service was very friendly, they even went to find me when I stepped out to Tops while waiting. Also, the the prices are very reasonable, my whole meal was less than 10 bucks.\n\nSo, ok for now, I'll try some more dishes and hopefully be more excited."
3,"Just passed by this DD the other week, and sad to see it is now CLOSED.  Blame the economy I suppose."
3,"One word: waterfall.\nIt makes Tryst amazing... especially in the midst of the swarm of drunkards. There was NO WAY anyone could move around.\n\nMy girls and I got invited to a table with bottle service, stayed for a few drinks, then wanted to split... and in turn the guy whose table it was STOLE our purses because we didn't want to stay! We spent the better part of an hour trying to track them down, and eventually a guard gave them back to us.\nAfter asking where they were, he simply stated, \""Just be happy you have them back.\"" THEN, one of the guys at the table \""coincidentally\"" had my friend's camera in his pocket.\nNOT COOL.\n\nI know this isn't the club's fault, but right after this incident happened my friends and I wanted to get the fuck out of there.\n\nOn the other hand, the benefits were that we got right into the clubs, got some of our guy friends in with no charge (rare in Vegas), had fun on the pole and on top of tables, and the outside area with the waterfall was breathtaking."
3,"It's a bit more expensive than some other competing Chinese buffets, but still a hella lot cheaper than anything I can get in New York, so I have no issues.  There's a decent selection and they at least have some sushi and korean food options.  I also like that they have a station to make your own soup with whatever you want in it.  Other than that, everything else is run-of-the-mill chinese food.  I wish they would turn over the fish dishes a little more often so they wouldn't be so overcooked, but it's still edible.\n\nI could tell that they were itching for me and my family to hurry up so they could turn the table over, but I didn't see anyone waiting and there were plenty of other open tables, so I didn't mind taking my time to get my money's worth.\n\nI'd go back if I had to, but wouldn't necessarily go out of my way."
3,"I've been here for the weekend brunch on a few occasions, and for the price, really can't be beat. If you are a local take advantage of a super cheap meal on Mondays and Wednesdays: $3.99 for breakfast, $4.99 for lunch, and $6.99 for dinner. All you have to do is show your Hilton rewards card and local id. \n \nThe weekend brunch has crab legs, prime rib, and beer/wine or some days champagne for either the weekend brunch or dinner. There is all the classic breakfast items already made and then a made-to-order omelet station along with grilled meats and sausages. All pretty much traditional buffet food, nothing fancy or ethnic, but solid. \n \n18 bucks for prime rib, cocktail shrimp, and crab legs is a deal...take advantage of it if you are looking for a decent weekend brunch buffet but can't pay for one at the Wynn or Bellagio. Service might not be 100 percent, but come on it's a friggin buffet."
3,"Kinda like a family Italian joint but too bright inside. Food is good enough for what it is and service is sufficient. Food is a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10. Not great not bad. Cutesy place with an \""almost\"" feel. Experience it for yourself. You will understand what I mean."
3,"You don't really have to twist my arm to get to me to try a restaurant where pork prepared in any way is the main attraction.  So, when my husband and I had a chance to get away for a meal, I naturally chose Salty Sow.  I wish that I could talk about the wonderful dishes that I had, but they were all only okay.  I had the candied pork belly.  I guess in my head I pictures something somewhat crispy.  I was very wrong.  It's a braised dish.  It's not a bad dish, just not something I would convince me to come back again.\n\nMy husband had the lamb burger and I had to sample.  It was pretty good if you enjoy tapenade. It's not really for me.  \n\nService was good up until we asked for the check.  It felt like a lifetime before it finally arrived, and then it was wrong.\n\nOverall, it was an okay experience."
3,"Okay but the noodles were over cooked and some of the vegetables were frozen,  not fresh as we would have preferred.  It's worth trying but it wasn't the caliber we were hoping for.  We've gone to a few different build your own wok houses in different areas, and this one was just so-so in comparison."
3,"I've shot my share of guns (see http://www.yelp.com/biz/bullseye-precision-indoor-shooting-range-san-rafael). I came here with a bachelor party. We did the $110 package for 12 guys.\n\nThe guys running the shop seemed to be arguing with each other a lot. Maybe that's why they like guns? \n\nAnyways, I thought the guns looked pretty worn out. The ear protection they gave folks using the range sucked, my ears hurt the entire time. We shot the uzi, thompson, two other automatic weapons, and a dessert eagle hand gun. The bachelor shot the grenade launcher, but don't get your hopes up, they don't give you a real grenade, it's more of a shot gun shell fired from a grenade launcher ($35 bucks a shot).\n\nBest quote from the gun store, there always is one... We were selecting a target for the grenade launcher, and pointed at the Ossama Bin Ladin poster. The guy from the store says, \""you mean Obama poster?\""\n\nDecent place to bring a group of guys looking to get out of the casinos. I recommend getting a limo for a big group since it's hard to get cabs back from this place."
3,"The hubbie's sister and her husband were in town and wanted to try RigaTony's since they have a friend who is a Snowbird and likes the place.  We had not eaten there in a while.  \n\nWe've been eating at Olive Garden a lot, mostly because I get $25 gift cards thru work. Having gone to RigaTony's, it will definitely be the go to place when we are dining solely on our dime and want a nice dinner and salad. It is well worth the slightly higher cost per menu item.\n\nI got the chicken with lemon and artichoke...yum.  I love their house salad.  One of my bunco buddies always gets that salad when it's her turn to host.  Hubbie liked the bread (and the salad).  The hubbie got the lasagna and enjoyed it...until later in the evening when he had some major acid reflux.  Getting older sucks.   Stubborn cuss won't try my crystalized ginger remedy...I haven't had a Tums in a looooonnnnng time.\n\nWe topped the evening off w/ a trip to Angel Sweet.  Yum."
3,"This place is showing its age. I went to see Avatar in their Imax theater and the seats were pretty banged up and the movie crapped out as it was starting due to some technical difficulties. It took a good 10-15 minutes before they fixed the problem and restarted the movie. I do have to say that as far as movie theater food goes, their hot dog and nachos are decent."
3,"The sushi was surprisingly really good, but the rest of the food was mediocre. The place was clean and service was decent. It's no five star buffet, but my experience was much nicer than the previous reviewers. I would recommend for large parties as there are many options, especially for kids."
3,"Espect\u00e1culo entretenido, las chicas bailan muy bien, pero se ve que los guionistas se fumaron algo cuando idearon el gui\u00f3n.\nMickey es el mas divertido de los actores."
3,"So-so Mexican food.  I have heard people raving about this place and I don't really get it.  Don't get me wrong, it's better than Manuel's or Filiberto's... but that's about all I can say.\n\nOkay, their Pollo Fundido is good (but not great like you will get at Ajo Al's). But let's talk about the purple and teal accent colors that scream \""I was remodeled in the 80's\""! Lame.\n\nGood chips and salsa but small-ass bowls! \n\nOh, and don't expect to park in their little lot during dinner rush.  Also, the surrounding neighborhood is definatly the ghetto-side of the Moon Valley area."
3,"So I recently went here with a friend of mine because they were craving IHOP, and I didn't care were we went to eat as long is it had food.\n\nI got one of there new healthy choice menu items the balsamic chicken and my friend got the club sandwich with a side salad and a side of pancakes...don't ask.\n\nThe food was surprisingly really good and the service was excellent."
3,"Some people will be upset with this review, but when we are asked to write a review, Yelp wants us to be honest right? \nFinally tried out Hash House a go go for lunch yesterday. Had read great reviews and many a celebrity have endorsed it. \nThe interior is great and the service is pretty good too. That is why I gave Hash 3 stars, but the food did not appeal that much to me and I consider it forgetable.\nI tried the mushroom and goat cheese sandwich and have no complaints about my dish, The potatoes au gratin looked very cheesy, but tasted good as the cheese wasn't not all overpowering as I had expected. My wife tried the chicken and waffles and we both agreed: nothing special! The all white meat chicken and waffles were both too dry and bland and we prefer Roscoe's for sure.  \nFor the average 'white' person, this food probably tastes great, the presentation looked above par, but for those among us who consider themselves foodies, the wide gamut of Asian food offered in this city is soo much more appealing. And finally their lunch prices are a little high at $38 for two. Again, this is just my honest opinion."
3,"My uncle owns a pretty famous bbq restaurant in Memphis, TN. So I am always a bbq sceptic and tough critic. I have only tried the pulled pork sandwich and the bbq chicken breast sandwich. Both really good. All the way down to the bun it comes on....tasty and not too thick. The potato salad is good, except I did miss the chopped egg. A few customers walked by me w/ amazing looking deserts that made my mouth water. The true test of great bbq is the ribs. Next time I shall try them and update....\"".y'all come back now, ya hear?\"""
3,"This is a great, quality Taco Bell recently built with fast service and consistant food. I love Taco Bell because it's cheap and yummy!"
3,"Really great atmosphere, wines, etc... but I didn't think the food was very good, so I give it only 3 stars.  The bread is very thick and maybe uncooked, no oil.  It was not what I expected.  I was hoping for crunchy bread with creatively delicious toppings.  The toppings are great combinations, just not executed like I expected.  I thought the bruschetta would be warm, but instead it was cold, nothing melded, and the bread was very large.  Great concept, but I don't get all the great reviews."
3,"basic food, nothing special, but all tasted good.  Limited menu, funny wine selection, no multipuciano, or other usual italian wines.  Just the popular basics.  Right next to Goodwill, but better than you'd expect"
3,"This only gets three stars cause the food is amazing! Other then great tasting food, place is very confusing. When you walk in there is a line that no one has any idea what line they are in. The first two are for tacos, but if you want a burrito or fish tacos you have to go to another line.  They tell you to go there but then you pass 10 people and I feel like I'm cutting everyone in line.\n\nEveryone stood and looked at each and was  like what line are we in? Once you get to that line your suppose to be in, they don't speak English.  I ordered a carne asade burrito, and they tried to give it to someone else. I told them that's mine and he said ohhhh, and had to open it, but looked at me weird cause he did not speak English!\n\nI would give them a 1 star but the food is amazing! Great prices too! Just really confusing.  We also came on a Tuesday night and damn if there wasent 50 kids running around up and down making a ton of noise!"
3,"If you read all my Yelp reviews so far, you will find that the majority of them cover barbecue joints. Yes, we like barbecue. My wife and I each have a sibling living in Austin, Texas, so we think we know the real deal when we taste it. Dickey's isn't quite that, but it's a nice addition to the Madison 'cue scene and I hope it's here to stay. \n\nThe meats have a good smoke flavor and they're tender, if sometimes overcooked. But that's to be expected in a fast-food/fast-casual place where I'm not sure the meats are smoked in-house daily. They might be smoked elsewhere and delivered, but for the price, that's OK. The ribs and brisket are worth ordering. The chicken is a grilled breast you can get anywhere.\n\nThe sauces (original, spicy), are served hot, just like in Texas, and they're of that thinner, Texas consistency. I like them. The option to top your meal with jalapenos and onions is also very Texas-like, but the smoked sausage isn't. The slaw and potato salad are decent sides; the others are unremarkable. \n\nDickey's offers free soft-serve ice cream where the most clever among us can make a root beer float in our big yellow drink cups. Kids eat free on Sundays with each adult meal purchased. We are always satisfied when we leave. What more can you expect for under $20?"
3,"We have been coming to the Dragon Noodle for years. The food is good, the prices are a little high and the service is okay. I agree with some of the other Yelpers. If you sit in the back section of the place it is a bit gloomy. We liked the place before the remodel. It had cheesy decor and t-shirts for sale. \n\nAfter a long day at a trade show we just want to relax and not venture too far from the hotel. The Dragon Noodle is never that busy so you can usually get a table for any number of sized party. \n\nWe hardly ever order from the sushi menu since the prices look high and we have never have been thrilled with what we have had in the past.\n\nOur group sticks to the Chinese menu and is always satisfied with the portions and taste. Our favorites are the Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef and Wonton Soup. A group of 6 of us ate last week for $140."
3,"I dined here on a recent trip to Vegas.\n\nI had the Kobe beef sliders.  They were ok, but not worth the $13 I paid for them.  (Side note:  My friend almost got sick from eating them because they were too rich for her liking.)  I also had their Shichimi fries.  Those were good - nice & spicy.  Also had some Yukon Gold mashers, and those were good too.\n\nThey poured decent cocktails.  \n\nI would probably go here again next time I go to Vegas if I am hungry and in the area."
3,"Came here for a networking event a couple weeks ago. They had some apps out to try and my friend ordered the quesadilla that was on happy hour. Nothing remarkable about this place food wise. I ordered a moscow mule and it was good.\n\nWe were outside on the patio which is super cute. Definitely a great place to have some wine and sit outside and enjoy the perfect weather. \n\nI need to try the main dishes because I wasn't that impressed with the food we had. We tried their chicken wings, ahi avocado salad of some sort, flatbread and parmesan, and then my frriend's quesadilla. It wasn't that the food was bad, it's just not something that I'm ever gonna think about and be like \""hey, remember xyz at Kitchen 56?\"". \n\nWorth a shot to try but it's just whatever."
3,"One shouldn't expect too much from restaurants centered around the main touristy drag of a city. I've found that these restaurants are typically expensive and low on service but that might just be me.\n\nWe started with a tasty platter of cheeses which included four local cheeses I forget the names of. Except for brie, all others were new and I quite enjoyed them, especially the goat cheese variant.\n\nWe had a variety of mains. I got the pasta Arrabbiata(don't know why I order that dish), and it was expectedly very ordinary. Others in our group got mussels and a quarter chicken respectively. Overall the portions were decent and the food was A-OK."
3,"I am a hertz gold member so i always go straight to the gold check in area. This location is hit or miss. Sometimes they are very good and the car i have requested is ready to go and easy to pick up and go. Other times they have given me cars that either had too much mileage, one time a car that looked like it had been driven thru rocks, another a car with stickers on it. Also, they are sticklers about the gas tank being full. Due to this fact i always fill right by the airport now. Always check to make sure the car they give you is acceptable and dont be afraid to ask for another one if there is a problem. And check the tire tread. Otherwise the gold service is useful especially when the regular counter line is long."
3,"Today, I was rushing from one place to another and needed some fast food.  Not feeling like a burger, I thought that Panda Express sounded convenient.  I was not disappointed though at the same time, the meal was not a gourmet one either.  There was only one person working the register while at the same time serving food so there was a bit of a wait (and the staff member was a bit flustered with much going on at once).  I am guessing that another staff member was on a break as there was a second person there by the time I left.  The restaurant was also kept quite clean though it appeared that the forks and napkins needed some restocking.  \n\nThe food, however, was fresh and as tasty as I had hoped it would be.  I got a two-item combo with fried rice, beef & broccoli, and string bean chicken.  I also added on a chicken egg roll.  The restaurant had several families, a few people on their own, and a couple all also eating, and it appeared that everyone else was also pleased with their meals."

3,"Stopped in here for lunch today, joined by Arlin B, Robyn N & Mike C.  Scott's was a bit of a disappointment for me this time.  My expensive bowl of Kreplach Soup was lukewarm & only contained one little Kreplach the size of a Ping Pong ball!  Even the smaller cup sized soup should have two or three of them.  My corned beef sandwich was good but the service was only so-so.  Considering all of this and the prices, it's down to 3 Stars this time for Scott's.\n\nCorned Beef Sandwich $10.95, bowl of Kreplach Soup $7.95 (!)"
3,"I was drove past there this weekend, and then read yesterday on azcentral.com that they have closed their doors.  I had never dined there but the building & decor looks awesome, huge outdoor patio with a glass enclosed fireplace, guess it's just another sign of the struggling economy...."
3,"Maybe it was my long day of travel that got me disoriented, but I couldn't find my way out of the airport when I arrived! I felt like I was wandering around on the lower levels trying to get to the street and was thrown for a loop when confronted with that super-speedy tram. \n\nStaff was friendly and the facility was clean.\n\nIt's an OK airport. You fly in and fly out. Nothing can touch PDX!"
3,"My coworker recommended this place so I decided to give it a try. I had the Gyro lunch with fries. It was pretty good, nothing outrageous and I've definitely had better but given the area and it's limited lunch options I can see myself coming back here in the future.\n\nThe restaurant was small and service was friendly. The \""bar\"" was awkward; looked like it didn't really belong but I guess it's always great to have the option of enjoying a drink with your meal. I guess I see this more of a quick service dine and dash kind of joint, that's why."
3,"I'm reviewing my rating. After Mor telling me i had to wait for them to come inspect the table (i'm moving dont have time for this) and i left my review, i ended up getting a call the next day from a manager & they actually delivered a brand new table, said the old one turned out to be from a bad batch- \n\nSo overall i'm NOW happy with the customer service- and i'll take their word that it was a bad batch and not bad quality overall.\n\n\n\nOld Review: Bought a dinning room granite countertop table from here, within 6 months the legs are cracking, the marble actually stains real easy from heat. Absolute garbage, $800 wasted"
3,"I ordered a spider roll, a lobster roll and Uni. The rolls tastes delicious, especially a spider roll. A fried soft crab in the roll was fresh and crispy. But for Uni, it tasted fishy, not fresh when I had it. Maybe you have to ask a waiter about its quality before order it."
3,It wasn't horrible. The girl seemed like she couldn't be bothered and wanted to be else were. The guy was trying to be impressive with all his different topics. He was be over bearing and ignoying  to me. I wasn't  impressed by his conversations.\n\nThey job they did was standard.
3,"I am not a fan of public car washes in general, but compared to some of the rest, Classic Car Spa did a great job! There were no smears on my windows, no water drops, either. With a BMW, you have to have the rims almost spit-shined!  I opted to get the full deal, including my rims. I was really pleased with their attention to detail. \n\nI thought I might note that my little Z4 was probably the least expensive car being washed . . . the line-up was filled with high-end SUVs, a Porsche Panamera and a Maserati. If I could afford a Maserati, I could probably afford to have someone come to my house and wash the car for me! :)"
3,"I am originally from NYC, where the Chinese food reigns supreme... and when I moved out here it was hard to find anything that was even remotely close to good.... While China Red is still not NYC amazing Chinese food, it definitely comes close. The portions are nice and big, the flavors are great, and the egg drop soup is fab! They offer lunch specials, which are hard to beat since the price is about $6 for 2 meals worth food :) PLUS, they deliver, which is hard to find out here in AZ!"
3,"We went this past Sun and overall had a great time. My only issue, and why I'm on Yelp, is the food. Just horrible and way, way, way overpriced.\nI would suggest spend the extra $10 for preferred parking and bring a cooler. Don't buy any food in the park. Out of desperation my sons a I had 2 slices with 2 breadsticks. Survey says-I've had MREs that tasted better.\n                              Oh yeah, $14 by the way.\nPreferred parking is only $10. Bring your own chow and have a great time."
3,"SSSSSsssssshhhhhhhhhhh.............. DON'T TELL ANYONE. I like Hooters. \n\nSo, here's the story: We booked a great bargain at the Hilton, but it was only two nights. We needed a place to stay for our last night in Vegas, and we wanted something cost effective and close to the airport because of our ultra-early flight out. Hooters fit the bill. It's at the far South end of the strip, so the cab ride to McCarran is quick. It isn't fancy and there are cheap rooms to be had, so we tried it. \n\nThe guy at the registration desk couldn't have been nicer. We asked for a nonsmoking king on a high floor, and he delivered. We had an amazing view of the Tropicana, Excalibur, and the roller coaster at New York New York. The room was BASIC, but OK. \n\nYou can walk across the street to the MGM and that's what we did for most of the day. \n\nIn the evening, we went back to the Hooters Casino, and guess what? We had a blast!!!! The minimum bets are LOW, so playing feels like PLAYING. It's not as serious as at the high-end casinos. The crowd is young and you don't feel like you have to be \""world champion\"" level to play the tables. Let's face it, I'm not a serious gambler, nor would I want to be, so the atmosphere at Hooters was just my speed."
3,"Bacchanal is okay! They got lots of stations but I can't say much was super memorable and something I must go back to have! Wait... Does dessert count? If so then they do have orange beer sorbet and mango habanero gelato which was a little different from the norm. It was spicy for sure!\n\nCrab legs hot or cold was okay! They plate it for you which isn't bad and keeps from people hogging it so I do like that. Too bad no dungeoness crab tho! Prime rib wasn't bad, lamb chops were good but again... Nothing memorable. I did like the Chinese chicken wings with lots of flavor but a little salty. Oysters were not fresh at all and super obvious for those who eat them on a regular. \n\nGo on a off hour and you'll be seated in 30-45 minutes otherwise plan on waiting forever!"
3,"This is a review for the Tiffany Showroom and the new show \""Yesterday - A Tribute to the Beatles.\""  The showroom is quite nice.  There are three main levels.  The top level has individual chairs and some small round tables.  The next level down has banquettes and chairs.  Finally, the floor level has two rows of banquettes and some small table seating.\n\nThe stage is a good size, and the sound and lighting for tonight's show was excellent.  This tribute show has been well planned.\n\nReview for the show itself: the guys have good voices and play wonderfully.  They are best when they sing with some harmony.  A few times when one of the guys was singing alone, the sound was not the Beatles but the individual.  When singing in unison, they sounded much closer to the Beatles.\n\nThe show was almost exactly one hour in length. I wish I could give 3.5 stars because 3 is a bit low but 4 would be too high."
3,"Indulge Burger is a fun place to stop & grab a bite.\n\nThey are a dog friendly place, with water bowls outside in the patio area.  We first started coming here when a coupon appeared in our mail box, and we've been back every few months.  \n\nThe food is generally good and they have a wide degree of choices.  The sweet potato fries, onion strings, and the garlic chips are great.  The burgers are in the $10 to $14 dollar range.  But they are very large one half of pound burgers.  That's why it important to remember to check for coupons before you come.  \n\nI just noticed after posting the above review that there is a current \""Yelp Deals -- $15 for $30 Deal at Indulge Burgers & More\"""
3,The Cajun Queen is a really nice neighborhood restaurant for me. The service is consistently good especially in the bar. I love the atmosphere and the live Dixieland jazz is a wonderful plus.\n\nWhat troubles me now and has troubled me from the first time I started going to the CQ : it seems like the kitchen believes everything must be really hot (spicy) since it's a Cajun restaurant. But some things just shouldn't be hot. Tonight I ordered the crawfish scampi appetizer. Scampi is generally shellfish flavored with garlic and herbs. Red pepper flakes are sometimes added but not as a predominant flavor. The CQ  added so much chili that it overpowered the crawfish. There is not a lot of difference between the scampi and etouffee which is supposed to be hot. If they would just not be so heavy-handed with the Cajun spices.....
3,"The food is pretty good for a chain restaurant.  The prices are very reasonable and portions are huge.  I ordered the Chicken Katsu with a side of gravy fries...hit the spot!  Katsu curry had corn in it; guess that's Hawaiian style? Fires were the best, but only mediocre, would be better if gravy had more richness to it.  It's not the best I've ever had but far from the worst.\n\n-I'm still really confused as to why they don't redecorate.  The entire outside and interior resembles a 50's diner...it's been like this since they opened and hasn't changed.  It would be more comfortable if they could change the decor and clean it up a bit; the right side of the restaurant has been under renovations for some time now and looks really shabby."
3,"This place was far from where my friend stayed (West Side), but it was worth a trek out.  The place is clean and the food is made fairly quickly even with the lunch crowd.  On a hot day, you can sit outside under the misters, but I'm from Cali, so this AZ heat it not for me, even under the misters.\n\nFood: Fontina burger with blue cheese was fresh.  The burger was juicy and full of flavor.  The blue cheese definitely enhanced it.  I like the different options for your sides.  The garlic fried were a big too greasy.  The beet salad is a nice refreshing touch.  The strawberry cheesecake from scratch that is not on the menu was just OK.  The fried okra was overly fried.  The BBQ pork sandwich looked tasty and my friend enjoyed it.  \n\nBottom line: I enjoyed the food and it's worth a try."
3,"This review is for the upstairs:\n\nI give this place a resounding \""meh.\""  Got the $75 tasting menu and while some of the dishes were pretty good (pork belly, salmon, beef tartare), most of them were entirely forgettable.\n\nBut the worst part was our server, hell-bent on up-selling us to death.  He actually told us that the 5 course tasting menu was \""just a jumping off point,\"" before encouraging us to start our meal with 24 oysters, and insert several ounces of wagyu beef into the meal.  I kid you not.  It was pretty annoying.\n\nOverall, there are many many better places to spend your money in Vegas."
3,"One of my staples for my old school Vegas days. I used to come here a LOT, because I could charge everything on the room and it wouldn't be TOO expensive. Had breakfast the other day...quite a good version of the standard staple of Steak and Eggs.  Minus a star for it being $20 though....this is Vegas, its only supposed to be $9.99.  \n\nI did love that the waitress brought some Heinz 57 though."
3,"I've been to this yard house 3 or 4 times.  I think if I would have written a review the first or even second time, I would have given 4 stars... But, I just don't think it deserves that high of a rating...\n\nThe beer selection is fabulous.. Mostly because they have Triple Karmeliet.. my favorite :)  \n\nThe food is pretty darn decent too.  Great place to grab a steak and I am a huge fan of the hawiian pizza.  Good is good.\n\nA little on the pricey side if you are planning to stay for awhile.. which is fine, but I don't like to have to spend 100 bucks for a diner and drinks for two.... especially when it's only a couple of drinks.. Boo on that.  Pretty much my only complaint.. I'll get over it though and go back soon I'm sure. :)\n\nOh, and one las thing, I love the music selection.. Always playing good tunes."
3,"Ate with a client here today for the first time. Really enjoyed the yellow curry dish medium and the soup that comes before the meal, but the service was slow. It took 16 minutes for my entree to come, although after it came many employees asked if I wanted a drink refill.\n\nNice decor and decent prices"
3,"3 1/2 STARS\n\nThis is Marriott's TIME-SHARE complex across from their luxury hotel. We traded a time-share for a week here in May. I must say, the place was packed - it appeared to be fully occupied.\n\nOur room was small but just fine for us. The employees were all friendly and the grounds were kept in good shape.\n\nWe found this to be a good place to use as a base for a week's holiday while taking day-trips to the Grand Canyon, Sedona, Prescott, Scottsdale, the Phoenix Botanical Garden, and so on..."
3,"I would say this place is pretty much like every other nail salon in Charlotte.  The fumes greet you at the door, they have you pick your color, they point to the chair they want you to sit in, they stare at you and smile, attempting to connect with the few English words they know, they do a decent job and slap you with a bill.  Sound familiar?  That was my experience.  It wasn't bad, it wasn't amazing, it was just....familiar.  They did have a very nice selection of colors which was nice but nothing else stood out to me.  They were friendly enough and priced the same as everyone else.  They did a nice job on my cuticles which other places have not been as detailed.  I would come back."
3,If Spearmint Rhino and Treasures were siblings then Spearmint Rhino would be Charlie Sheen and Treasures would be Emilio Estevez. Spearmint Rhino is a lot more fun with a lot more going on. Treasures is small and booooooring. Bottle service is a lot cheaper though.
3,"My family and I stumbled across this location as we were shopping in Townsquare when we first walked in the ambience is undeniably beautiful we were told by the awesome waitress that happy hour ended in 12 minutes. We agreed we were all going to down the first drinks so we can get the next ones before they doubled in price. Only to be told that when she asked the bar manager Jessica , she said \"" no\"". We were still well within the time period. When the waitress came back it was two minutes after happy hour. We ordered $160.00 in food, it was fabulous. The service was undeniably outstanding. However, we will not be back because of Jessica. When I find someplace I like I am always loyal and would have return time and time again with my friends and family. I hope the $18 savings was worth it."
3,"This is a pretty small dog park, with only one area for all dogs backed up next to a baseball field. My husband and I used to go to this dog park all the time when he lived over there, but now I only go occasionally when I choose to bring my pup to work and we both need a break for lunch. The people have always been nice, but the grounds have not always been kept up.\n\nI understand that it's a dog park and it will get messed up from time-to-time, especially in the summer, but a little upkeep would be nice. They recently \""remodeled\"" it, but I don't see much difference, besides them reseeding the grass and taking out grass in half of the area. Not sure why they would take out the grass, as now it is dirt/mud/sand, and your pups are SURE to need a bath once you leave. \n\nI will come back to this park because it is the closest one to my work, but other than that there is really no other reason for us to come here. We have driven past this park to go to Chaparral Dog Park because it is much nicer, although we would prefer to come to this one because of proximity. Oh well!"
3,"I had passed this restaurant dozens of time without knowing what magic was behind the plain building. I was very pleasantly surprised upon walking in at around 9pm on a Friday night to see ducks and turtles swimming around. The tables outside were filled with lovers, adding to the romantic ambiance of El Encanto. There was a older gentleman singing Spanish love songs while playing the guitar. It was like another world from the street that we entered from; it almost felt like a secret club for some reason. And I was happy to have found it.\n\nAnyway, on to the food. I shared the pollo fundido with my other half. I wasn't TOO impressed, because I still think X Tapa Joe's has the best Pollo Fundido in town, but the yellow rice that accompanied the dish was superb. Usually, I am disappointed at the dry and bland Mexican rice that comes with entrees. Not here. It tasted like the yellow rice that I make, which is moist and rich in flavor. The margaritas were a bit too sweet but still okay. Overall, I thought it was a great place for a date night as it seeped with romance. I would love to try another dish sometime to give them a higher rating, but so far, the 3 stars I gave it seems right on point."
3,"Although the food, wine, and atmosphere are all good, sadly I must say I have been let down. One of my problems is the sometimes slow service. Also we decided to go here for a friends birthday and they ran out of food. It was not fun feeling like you had the angel of death for a server ready to kill your order. I really would love to give the place four stars, because the food and wine are certainly worth it, but due to my traumatic experience its just a-ok. Maybe I will get a chance to go back and update my review to what I know it really could be."
3,"I'm local and saw part of the infomercial and decided to try the place. Club card benefits are average except when you first sign up. I like smaller casinos and this has a good mix of new & older machines. I didn't win much but my spouse had good luck. We used coupons to eat at the deli and liked the food. I had the breakfast special & spouse had a burger. The burger was tasty, tomatoes & lettuce fresh and the fries were really fresh & hot. You can't do much harm to eggs, toasted muffin & sausage and it was good. \nWe'll go back & see if it's consistent."
3,Went on Tuesday (18 December 2012). Not the best Italian in Edinburgh. Probably not the best within a few hundred yards of the Assembly Rooms. Fairly good antipasti despite the crostini being slightly stale. Nice pork belly. Tip top roast potatoes. Too rich chocolate tart. The room was interesting and enjoyable. \nBut with average food there has to be something really special to make you come back. It lacked wow or pizazz. The staff were competent and pleasant. But in competition with family run places like Nonna's in Morningside they're sure to come second.
3,Is a pretty large storage facility with a lot of different size units. The facility is pretty clean. I use it to store files so I have the smaller unit they offer.  People in the office seem pretty nice. My only complaints I have are how much dust gets into the units and how far away it is from my house.  They could use better doors to seal out the dust.
3,"I was driving through downtown Chandler and spotted this free standing location, the first I've ever seen for a JJs. \n\nIt's the usual Jimmy John's faire, but slightly less expensive ('bout 50 cents) than their Chandler Fashion location. Now I love JJs, but I need to take them down a half star for all the nonsense going on inside the store.  \n\nIt's very much like the old high school cafeteria. Employees yelling at each other, goofing around and tunes dial up to ear splitting decibels, which makes it hard to enjoy a meal here.\n\nWe've all enjoyed high school once, once. Bueller? Bueller? Bueller?"
3,"I like that Pei Wei will let me get a kids' meal, even though I'm not a kid. \n\nTruthfully, I need the help with portion control when it comes to rice and sauces and allowing me the kids' meal option makes this one of the first places I think of when I'm looking to satisfy a rice craving -- and, it's definitely the only \""guilt-free\"" place that comes to mind. \n\nThe parking lot here STINKS!! Otherwise, I'd totally give you one more star."
3,"I have been to Toby Keith's a couple of times over the years. The first time was a couple of years ago for a local concert that became ridiculously overcrowded and claustrophobic but I will disregard that initial experience and review only this experience today. I met my mom here for a late lunch around 3pm because we were in the area so it was convenient. Our waitress was really nice and attentive and we wanted to take our time and she didn't have a problem with that.\n\nI ordered a green chili chicken sandwich (with no bun) and a side of coleslaw. My mom had a turkey club sandwich. My chicken was pretty good. It was a little overcooked but it wasn't bad. Nothing to write home about. My mom's turkey club was a HUGE serving and she said it was just okay.\n\nOverall for a midday dining experience we had an okay experience. The food was okay, the service was good. Would I be back? Maybe..."
3,It wasn't spectacular... Started 10-15 minutes late... The Comedian was the highlight of this show... I'm still googling her youtube videos with no luck... Some girls were really pretty but they weren't in sync much...
3,"We came here because we had a Restaurant.com certificate to use. It was ok, but nothing special. The taco shells were fresh and made onsite and the chicken was delicious. The rice, however, was mushy. And they used preshredded cheddar cheese. Not very authentic but a nice cheap meal."
3,This place is located in a pretty low end locals casino but with that said it's a fun spot for a quick & hearty breakfast. It's also super cheap! They have a fully stocked bar so having some cocktails with your breakfast is always a good idea. The menu has a little bit of everything but I think the breakfast options are the tastiest. Service is always great as well!
3,"It's so difficult to pick a place to eat in Vegas with the multitude of options. I guess a packed house, like one is sure to see at Mon Ami, is a good sign.\n\nI found the bread to be stellar and a cute display (served as baguette style, as one would find in France; although in France, they don't have paper bags for their baguettes. I'm just sayin'). I had beef bourguignon and I bet even Julia Chiles would be proud of this version. Although, she might have been disappointed by my noodles that were waaaaaaay too soft.\n\nI'm pretty disappointed by my cocktail. How can a French restaurant mess up a French 75? \n\nThe ambiance was nice with the heaters, the music and the Bellagio fountain show. I did feel a bit crowded on the patio though. There was little space to move. \n\nAll in all, I would like to have my money back to try an equally expensive restaurant with a higher quality food and experience. You know Vegas has it. When you find it, let me know."
3,"Oh Espee, you have gotten way too expensive.  A three item combo is, get this, SIXTEEN DOLLARS!   I can go to a beautiful restaurant like Agave and not pay this price for a taco meal.  And it really seems like the tamales at Espees have gotten smaller.  And the salsa bar is completely disgusting now - what happened to the pico de gallo? \n\nThey still have a pretty good happy hour with 2 for 1 margaritas and half price nachos - but I had to knock down my four star review to a three because of the ridiculous prices and shrinking portions.  Why do order at the counter restaurants try to charge the same prices as a sit down restaurant?"
3,"I want to so badly give this place 4 stars! \n\nI've been to this place a few times and every time I usually try something new. Each item Ive tried has always been tasty to say the least. \n\nHowever, since I live so close to MTO Cafe, I usually end up placing an order for delivery to get my fix. Prompt this delivery service it is, there is always something forgotten in the order i.e. Green drink, salad along with the chicken and waffles, a side mashbrowns, the list goes on. \n\n\nNevertheless, it's always a very tasty, somewhat healthy, way to remedy my hangover, or simply stay home on the weekends for brunch. The second location just opened at the new summerlin mall, I will likely check out this location as well."
3,"I have been to many sushi restaurants, cheap to fancy. But at Yokoso, sushi is definitely not their strong point. The sushi pieces were mouthfuls of mostly rice, that too little dry . I ordered a Rainbow Roll and The Pitt Roll. Not good. The prices are OK not very reasonable. I dont know about the other items on the menu, but sushi was meh!\nOnly go here if you are absolutely craving for one.\nBut the service was good and prompt."
3,The prices are a little high and the food is ok. I have had better pizza. The wings where also ok. The people where nice both times we have eaten there.
3,"Came here a few weeks ago with friends. Breakfast was good, tea was nice, atmosphere ok. I wasn't blown away but I also wasn't disappointed. I love the location and the interior is vintage and original. The outside was ok to have breakfast and enjoy the weather. Moderately priced."
3,"For a place that's supposedly known for wings, it wasn't so good. I was very hungry but couldn't finish the 20 wings I was sharing with my friend. The 10 grilled wings were tossed in this super spicy tangy Cajun sauce. Eeee. Should've had the sauce on the side. The other 10 wings had sauce on the side but the batter was chalky tasting. Eeee.\n\nThe shrimp and spinach salad was good. Tsk. Was so craving good wings though."
3,Rio De Janeiro\n\nPlease add...\n\n*Looser slots \n*Cordial security staff\n*More cute shops & under 21 crowd entertainment\n*Some much needed glitz & glamor upgrades all around\n\nTo your already...\n\n*Delicious seafood buffet\n*Spacious rooms\n*Fun vibe\n\n...and it'll definitely turn the Rio back into a poppin' place! I'll be back nonetheless (YAY for rewards points).
3,"Solid food, but nothing exciting or different. I'm not sure what kind of theme they are going for, which makes the place lack personality.\n\nStrengths - good wait staff and some good beer options\n\nDownfalls - not sure it is worth the price and nothing too exciting."
3,"I went here tonight for a girlfriends birthday. Food was great. Our server was attentive but it did take a while to get our food and drinks.\nI highly recommend the soft pretzels with fondue, so yummy! Everyone enjoyed their entrees. I had the Sweet Corn Cannelloni; the flavors were very rich and I was happy to see they had several vegetarian options. We also got to choose a complimentary desert, and had the Monkey Bread. Sounded so-so but was delicious. Also, I love decor! Comfy chairs, that are different at every table and the gorgeous chandeliers make it feel very upscale.\nMy only complaints would be the amount of time we waited to get our food/drinks, it was pretty loud, a bit too dark, and the portions were fairly small for the price."
3,"Let me state that this initial review is pretty old (sat as a draft that I forgot to post), but I can't update it yet. Review 1,  2 stars : Poor service. Had to wait 6 minutes or so just for someone to come to the front and take our order. Asked for mayo and ketchup only on the burger and the girl taking our order was a smarta**, stating that if we had been here before we would know that ketchup and mayo was on the table. Of course the whole burger came out wrong because the girl interrupted us when trying to order it with her smarter-than-thou attitude. The second girl I talked to fixed it and was really nice.\nReview 2, 4 stars : We got some food while we were bowling for my little sister's birthday. Service was good. Food was pretty good. Overall, a pleasant experience."
3,"Ok, this place can get pricey quick, but if you know how to get \""bang\"" for the buck like me you'll be ok.  My friend and I got the Veggie sandwich with extra roast beef.  I really need to invest in a real camera, because what we got was a 5 star Roast beef sandwich for 15 bux.  With Coffee and cake we were under $30 bux for the both of us.  I will say this....if you eat more food than what came out you really need a diet.  It was MORE THAN enough.  Split your food here as its just too much for one person and you don't want to take leftovers back with you do you?  Great sammy, half sour pickle with decent coffee.  Geez the chocolate cake is good.  Fries mehhhh."
3,"The place is really cute and has a really nice outdoor area to include a bar. Went for lunch and sat outside on the artificial turf.  The lights strung up outside I'm sure will provide great atmosphere at night. The food was good, but noting spectacular. I had a garden salad and the other people in my group had a chicken panini sandwich in which the chicken was dry and a strawberry salad where the strawberries were mushy. I could look past all of that, but the thing that got me is how slooooowwww the service is. We ordered fairly quickly and the it took forever for the food to come out. I hope that they get it figured out and pick up the pace because this place has potential, especially in a neighborhood that lacks these cute, trendy places."
3,"Order to go!  Definitely authentic and they don't speak much English.  But the service is friendly.  They even let me try the barbacoa when I asked what it tasted like while looking over the menu.  The flavors in their tacos really come through.  Chicken tacos are spicy all by themselves, and the guacamole is very simple, mostly avocado and lime juice.\n\nBut I will throw in a few dings for the table seating which consists of metal fold up chairs, booth seats that are all torn up, and there was even a rusty nail sticking out of the side of one of them.  But the booths are still the best way to go if you insist on dining in.  \n\nThe cuts of meat could be a lot better.  This is not going to become a regular place for me because I'm picky.  But I'll mark it down as an interesting experience and recommend it to anyone who wants to give them a go.  \""You should try it, but it's not for me...\"""
3,"I had a very pleasant dinner at Fleur de Lys last month but nothing wow'ed me.  I ordered from the $59 prix fixe menu, which includes an appetizer, entree and dessert - all in all, a good value!   \n\nI enjoyed the onion soup, served with shaved truffles and duck.  It was rich and earthy with an unexpected presentation.  Next I had gently heated salmon with juilinee vegetables and a green horseradish sauce.  My salmon was perfectly cooked and the dish looked beautiful, but the sauce, frankly tasted like grass clippings!  Bitter and overpowering.  My friend seemed to enjoy her stout braised short ribs.  The dessert, a \""trio of chocolates\"", was a miss: a dry souffle, a salty peanutbutter shake and Baily's ice cream.  None of the desserts really did it for me.  \n\nI may have expected too much from this place, but hey, it's Hu bert Keller's spot!  Who knows, maybe I caught them on a bad night.  I'd like to return some time and give the regular menu a chance, but with so many INCREDIBLE places to eat in Vegas I can't make any guarantees.\n\nPROS: Great service, Great wine and Reasonable prixe fixe menus. \nCONS: Too many 'miss' dishes for a 4 star"
3,"Average at best.  I am pretty sure that my buttermilk pancakes, potatoe pancakes, eggs, and sausage links were not cooked enough.  Granted, I recieved my food less than 3 minutes after I ordered but I would have been okay with waiting another 2 minutes for a completely cooked meal.  \n\nMy mom's pancake recipe is much better anyway..."
3,"This place gets a 3 star because they've never blown my socks off with anything, but I've never had experience with them that made me want to quit pizza. It's pretty close to my house and my nephew loves pizza so I'm here a decent amount. They're very consistent, very friendly and my food is always ready on time. On the single time my order was messed up, they were very quick about fixing it,  which was majorly appreciated. To be honest I have nothing bad to say about them at all. They get the job done"
3,"We ate here on a Thursday night.  To begin, we have a 14 month old son.  Although the restaurant has child seats, it is not a good place for children.  So, we would not recommend taking small children to Steelz.\n\nHowever, we do recommend eating there.  We started with the crabcakes, which were good but I wanted a little more crispiness on the outside.  This could have been achieved with a little more pan time.  The spicy aioli on the side was great.\n\nI had the brie and bacon burger, which was wonderful.  Good quality bacon and beef, and a soft yet strong bun to hold it together.  Burger juicy and cooked to a proper medium.  It does not come with fries, which was a disappointment.  My wife had the lobster bisque.  This had good flavor, but was too strong on the sherry.  She also had the beef and blue salad, which may have been the star of the evening.  Very good quality blue cheese, we loved this salad.  \n\nWe will definitely return."
3,"So much better than I remembered.  Last time we had breakfast here and it was horrible.  This time, we tried dinner. \n\n24 hour buffet pass for $40...how can you go wrong?  Except after the 2nd buffet, you really want to run straight towards a toilet or grab a roll of Tums.  Seriously, no one should be eating more than one buffet within 24 hours.  Heck with it all though, this is Vegas...the city of losing wages and eating just as much as you freakin can!\n\nThis was our 3rd buffet on our pass...a dinner stop. \n\nHighlights:  \nCREPES!!!  Yummy delicious crepes...I take em plain with some powdered sugar. Really nice lady making em...the crepes were perfectly chewy...I had 2.  Ugh. \n\nSeafood.  A combination of crab, shrimp, mussels, and clams.  Not the greatest...but good enough.\n\nDessert.  Probably the biggest display out of all the buffets we went to.  They're your usual buffet fare...nothing was really wow but enough to satisfy your dessert craving. \n\nThe duck was also pretty good...it was made with orange sauce and rice pilaf.  Can't think of any of the other standouts as the buffets mostly had the same things.  \n\nPretty decent buffet...#3 on our buffet list."
3,"When I have needed to be in the Las Vegas STRIP area and yet didn't care to pay the LV STRIP surcharge, I discovered and stayed here ever so slightly just OFF LV STRIP.\n\nThere is a POOL and free wifi with your room.\n\nFood just around the corner.\nParking included completely with their parking lot."
3,It looks just like the Hofbrau Haus in Munich. I think the only Germans in the place were in the band! Service was good. Music was good. Beer was good. The food was another matter. My wife's Jager Schnitzel was so tough you could barely cut it with a knife. The sauerkraut with my wurst plate was bland and over cooked. The mashed potatoes tasted like they were made from a mix. We definitely had better German food.
3,"I like the suite at Mandalay Bay its 750 sq the service at the front desk are always friendly, But I dislike it when my room were comp and they still charge me if I didn't look at my credit card the same week I wouldn't catch it that they charge me for 2 nights when those 2 nights are suppose to be free."
3,This is a great bar for a Tuesday night and highly recommend going after 9pm to get the $3 burger special.  Go early to get a seat because this place fills up slightly after 9. I sat all the way upstairs and the bar was quiet but it was a Tuesday night after all.  They had a great list of draft beers including Pumking which I would have normally gotten but at $10 for a small glass that was a little much for me. I ended up with a bottle of Purple Haze another favorite of mine. The bartender told me there was a glitch in the computer system and it only rang up for $3-nice surprise.  Unfortunately this didn't happen for the second round but the bartender made sure to tell me in advance which was perfectly fine.  I stayed for the 9 o'clock burger special and it was declivous. Pleasantly surprised by the double burger and highly recommend the Stack'd special sauce!
3,I would give it 3.75. Never would guess a cool little breakfast spot would be located under some shady apartments on 7th street. Sat at the bar and ate. Could see right into the very small kitchen. I only had scrambled eggs and bacon which are nothing to rave about but it's hard to mess those up. Some of the other dishes that came out of the kitchen looked great!  I'll have to try the pancakes next time!  Would definitely come back.
3,"I'm not sure what the hype is about this place. I came here expecting a lot given the large amount of 4-5 star Yelp reviews, and I left disappointed. I ordered the original because I figured that I couldn't go wrong with an original. I guess I should just not expect so much when I eat at a 4-5 star according to Yelp restaurant. The sandwich was tiny. The flavor tasted off because of the horseradish. I was so, so, so disappointed. \n\nI also got the chicken noodle soup because it was cold, and I wanted soup. That was average. I'm glad I got the soup or I'd have still been hungry after that tiny sandwich. To be fair, I was eating buffets during the earlier part of my trip to Vegas. But, I still think the sandwich could have been a lot better given all these rave reviews."
3,"I had heard several good complements about noca and was excited to have dinner here. Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed. \n\nAll four of us ordered the tasting menu. Two of us had it with wine pairings as well.  The presentation was good. We started with some type of a small palette cleanser. Our first course was either a mushroom soup or a salad. I had the soup and my husband had the salad. It was good though not amazing. Our second course was pasta with meat type sauce. This was the best course by far. Our entree was a flat iron steak. It was good but again not amazing. Dessert was blue cotton candy and chocolate cake w banana gelato. The cotton candy was a nice surprise.\n\nWhat was very disappointing was the wine pairings. Our waiter knew very little about the wines and strangely did the same pairings regardless of whether we ordered. The soup or salad and the fish or steak entree. The entire wine line-up was completely in the red family. \n\nOverall the presentation was good, portion size was good, service was ok, food was ok. But nothing spectacular. \n\nIf you are looking for a wow restaurant I would rather recommend alto at the hyatt gainey ranch."
3,"I honestly love the decor in the place really industrial meets classy, but thats just party of the experience. The food here is like any other brazillian steak house. You start with salad and soup ( unlimited offerings even throughout the meal ) , when your ready a flip of a card brings sides and entrees to the table. Steak's of all cut from top sirloin to flay ming yong wrapped in bacon. There is also rib which are excellent, lamb which is fair, chicken. Why anyone would consume more chicken here then steak is confusing but its there and offered wrapped in bacon! Sides are Pao de Queijo ( baked bread rolled into balls with cheese ) , fried bananas, and gralic mash potatoes. Deserts here are pricey but a good way to end a meal. \n\nI am really unimpressed with a few things. Though my service was excellent the food really wasn't. Bacon wrapped steak was good, i've had better and larger pieces at Fago de Chao. The other meats were so so, lack of seasoning and  meat options ; as we came a little after they opened. The lobster bisque was OK. Reading some people who raved over its taste is amazing, because it really wasn't that great and probably the least liked thing by my party."
3,"This McDonald's is conveniently nearby the Pepsi Center.\n\nIt opens late, and was perfect for the post-clubbing crowd I was with.\n\nA friend bought me a McChicken sandwich (not sure why, but I appreciated it), which I made short work of - it tasted normal, as expected."
3,"As usual, the food and service is very good here but can you please refinish the floor? It's really showing it age. Worn and discolored, it takes away from the overall experience. The ottomans in the lounge area also need cleaning or even better, reupholstered. \n\nThe place is looking rundown and that's really a shame for a high end, Summerlin dining spot."
3,"Cute spot and lots of fun for the kiddos.  However, when we went out to the pumpkin patch to pick pumpkins, I saw one sitting in the field with a sticker on it from a store, complete with bar code.  I don't mind paying a little extra for locally grown pumpkins, but I am not paying $12 for a pumpkin they paid $4 for at Walmart!  I immediately put our pumpkins back.  I know they grow pumpkins there, you could see the vines, but if you sell them all, it feels wrong to me to supplement your inventory with store bought ones!"
3,"Oliveo's is a good place to get decent food, whether it's late night or lunchtime. They are slightly pricey, at least to me, but it is Greek food. I have never gotten a bad dish from them. I've had the chicken souvlaki, gyros and chicken breast plates. All are great, cooked well and have lots of flavor. The bonus is that Oliveo's is open extremely late, so they are usually my go to if I want late night food that isn't McDonald's. I recommend if you want healthy in a college town!"
3,"Nice place. More upscale than a \""pub\"" ...menu wise that is. I had a newer item..chicken tacos. each one had a alrge deep fried/crusty chicken finger in it ( I was expecting more shredded chicken)  They were pretty tasty and had a nice spice. Harder to each with one large chunk of chicken though. The table we were at was a little warn and slightly sticky. They could use to take a step up on cleanliness. take everything off the table when you clean it so its done right."
3,"Yikes. I completely forgot about the fact that my boyfriend found a big black hair in the food close to when we were almost finished eating. How could I have forgotten that?? \n\nAs delicious as the food was, that can NEVER happen when you are running a restaurant. Super gross :("
3,"I'm not sure how this made it onto eaters list but I wasn't impressed. I've been a couple times and had different experiences each time. \n\nPrice is decent. Style is fast casual but chicken was too greasy.  Burgers are very messy but decent in flavor. However I would  consider come here before going most fast food places.  Honestly, I've had amazing burgers so I have high expectations. \n\nI liked the French fries and flash fried veggies... Probably not healthy at all because it was too salty but I give them credit because it very unique.  It's not something I would order frequently though."
3,"I think the mac and cheese is their best dish.  Get it with the bologna.  Good comfort food.  Their cheese plate looked good and their onion rings are great if you like heaps of the thin cut type (which I do).  \n\nThe perch is my favorite of the fish selections.  I had that tonight while there.  Ordered a bowl of the beer cheese soup, too.  Somewhat flavorless and they garnished it with popcorn.  Bleh.\n\nThe rest of the menu is passable.  They try too hard for down-home Wisconsin cooking.  Whatever that is."
3,"I was actually at the Staple's next door, but had seen this place several times before, and was curious enough this time to stop in, not knowing at all what to expect.\nI was here in the early afternoon, and it was plenty busy, but nothing like the megacrowds that others are describing. Probably depends on the time/day.\n\nI didn't get a chance to experience the aggressive customer aspect, but most likely because I wasn't shopping in the women's section, and 95% of the other customers were women, who did look a bit frenzied. The 4 or 5 men in the store were, by contrast, subdued.\n\nI will have to come back again when I have more time to explore what they have, but to say I was \""impressed\"" with the selection of (men's) shoes would be understating it. It was wingtip heaven in there! And unlike many of the items in this place, most of these shoes were in great condition. The worst thing to have happened to any of them is maybe a missing lace or two, which is an easy fix anyway. I came out with a $30 pair of Maison Forte boots which have no imperfections at all, and were originally $215.00! (I should add that I'm not designer/brand aware at all, so I'm mostly impressed that the shoes are gorgeous, and don't so much care about their brand names).\n\nWill definitely come back, even if just for more shoes! :)"
3,Good food overall but the storefront could use some work to make for a nicer dining experience. The place was clean and service was fine. I would absolutely order take out or delivery from here.
3,"Decided to have dinner at Tofu Hut tonight. Overall experience was not bad, but I wouldn't call it great either. \n\nThey were a bit short staffed when we first walked in. I would say it took them over 5 mins to even acknowledge our presence even though they did see us walk in.  I expected a \""Hello, or Welcome\"" at the very least.\n\nWe passed on the AYCE tonight & went ala carte. We ordered short ribs & spicy chicken. Both orders were good, but nothing memorable or anything to rave about. I did love their banchan offerings! I liked the fish cake, japchae, spicy cucumber, and I don't recall the others but it was yummy!\n\nI would go back.. but don't think I'll be a regular at this place."
3,"I love this hotel, but I think the Bellagio still wins in my book. \nMy family and I got upgraded to the 60th floor, which had an amazing view. The rooms are SO cute and clean and there's a TV in the bathroom... lol! However, the TV in the room didn't work at all, despite the \""directions\"" on how to use the TV on the remote control.  \nAlso, the walls were SO THIN! I could hear people talking in the hallway all throughout the night, plus I could hear the neighbors during the middle of the night (although this might be because they were fighting...). \nAnyhoo, I'm a fan of the hotel itself, La Rev the show, the buffet (for brunch and dinner), and the shops."
3,"The sushi was good.  The service was ok.  We couldn't keep track of who was serving us...there were so many coming and going.  We didn't like that different rolls we ordered were all coming at different times, instead of all at once.  We stayed at the Wynn so it was right across the street and we gave it a shot."
3,"Picture show has its upsides and its downsides. It's a smaller theater, so they can only show 6-7 movies at once. However, the theaters are super comfy and have a lot of leg room between seats! Tall people rejoice! Unfortunately, the lights illuminating the pathways in the theater are so bright they are distracting. It felt like someone was shining a light in my eyeballs the whole movie! Not cool.\n\nThe prices are pretty average, but only $5.50 for students, so dig out your old high school ID and trick them by wearing your retainer or something.\n\nPark in the parking garage and walk through the food court to get there!"
3,"Seeing as I've been reviewing my recent Vegas adventures, I should probably get this one out of the draft burner.  I have a habit of letting drafts collect dust on Yelp.  So allow me to finish my four month old thoughts:\n\nZumanity is said to be \""adults only,\"" but it's no Absinthe.  It caters to adults with a few raunchy jokes here and there.  And it caters to Vegas with a few topless acts.  But for the most part, it's very tame and even a bit campy.  I didn't find the show pushing the envelop on anything and it didn't appear at all sensual to me.\n\nI brought the boyfriend.  he enjoyed himself but didn't see why I fuss over Cirque du Soleil so much.  On reflection, I should have taken him to see something a bit more awe-inspiring (like \""O\"").  \n\nA lot of the comedy is just heckling the nearby crowd.  And a lot of the acts highlighted in the program were absent during our particular show.  No midgets, no fat twins.  Perhaps that would have added some flavor to an otherwise lackluster evening.  Maybe I was suspecting something too outside the norm and my expectations were bridging on pornographic?  To me, this was a typical Cirque show with some dirty jokes and sexier outfits thrown into the mix.\n\n50% off tickets for military.  So a good deal to fill a few hours of your time."
3,"We tried this restaurant because of all the good reviews, so I went in with high expectations. I was so disappointed that the food was just ok. The fish taco was dry and lacked flavor. The guacamole on the rolled tacos was tasteless. I also had the carne asada taco which was the best thing I ordered but still nothing to brag about. My husband had the steak and eggs. It looked more like machaca. The dining room was clean but the bathroom was disgusting. I would only revisit this restaurant if it was the only thing open and I was starving."
3,"Holy SMOKE, this place had so much cigarrette smoke in the air it looked hazy.  It made the dining less enjoyable.  We went for the famous \""Steak Special\"". And I must say it was pretty darn good.  The green beans and mash potatoes that accompanied it was enjoyable as well."
3,"As a \""gastropub\"" Public House has the mandatory dark wood decor and decadent dishes like poutine and fois gras.  Being Vegas, all restaurants have a hook or gimmick, and Public House is no different with its expansive wine list  stored in its fancy schamcy ipad for guests to play around with it - half the fun was picking the wine.  \n\nPublic House also excels at some light fare as well.  Went with a group of girls, and half of the table ended up getting the scallops entree - the scallops were super sweet and tasted very fresh.  The salads were great, pomegranate seeds added a nice burst of acidity."
3,"I am a huge fan of North Kierland, but this was my first time at North Arcadia. Other than the decor of this restaurant (which was beautiful and cool) I was totally underwhelmed. We were there for lunch and we were about the 4th/5th table seated as we were there before 11:30.  There was nothing offensive, but the service was really slow and had a bit of an attitude. The zucca chips (one of my favorites at North Kierland) were over cooked. The $17 lunch portion of bucatini with meatballs was pretty small in size for the price. Nothing here was terrible, but out the door we were at $59.00 for 3 people for lunch with no drinks. Just saying you should go have a less than $20/person lunch at a much better place nearby like T. Cook's or Coup des Tartes."
3,"The good things about City Cafe: their breakfasts, their pool table, their beer pitchers (which save you a few quid), their nice atmosphere which has the American diner feel down. Their big burger challenge, though it is painful to watch let alone attempt. Their chips which come in their own little wire fry baskets.\n\nThe bad things: their cocktail pitchers are very, very weak. You could drink from them all evening and only get mildly buzzed (this was my experience with their elderflower one, their long island iced tea, and their Pimms). Their food is odd. Their nachos would be OK, except that their guacamole tastes exactly like mayonnaise. I once had their veggie burger as well, and something in the way the cheese on top of the patty stuck to the upper bun made said bun go extremely soggy and frothy in an extremely unappetising way. It was liquid bun by the time I neared the end. This burger inspired me to make a yelp account.\n\nThat being said, I go there a lot and will probably continue to do so. But I will stick to pints and chips."
3,"This place has a great location in Tivoli Village. They have a good indoor outdoor bar and several inexpensive offerings for happy hour. One of the best features of this restaurant is that they allow your dog to sit out with you on the patio while you dine. \n\nThe food is not traditional (authentic) Mexican food which doesn't bother me. But, the poor execution is an issue. We have eaten here a handful of times. I guess because I keep hoping to select something on the menu that I love. Unfortunately, that hasn't happened. The highlight of the menu is their guacamole and chips which are made table side. Their complimentary salsas are also very tasty. \n\nI would give Cantina Loredo another try. It's a shame that we haven't found a good Mexican restaurant in the Summerlin area. My husband likes this place a lot more than I do. He is a fan of the fajitas. So, the 3 star review is an average of both of our opinions."
3,"Food and service was good not great but  certaintly not memorable. The noise level is horrendous with the waitress having to almost yell to describe the specials,etc. This was in the dining room too not in the bar. Also, the table are way too close together. Better places can be had nearby."
3,"I've been to local Red Robin's in the Bay Area and considering that it's a franchise, they make everything the same at all restaurants. Needless to say, this place isn't all that great. I can come here to eat every now and then, but it's not off the wall where I tend to want to come back more than often.\n\nWe ordered an onion ring tower which was HUGE! and ok tasting. I'm not much of a onion ring lover and that might have an impact on why I didn't think it tasted great. Me and the wifey also shared a chicken pasta which wasn't all that tasty in my opinion, probably won't ever order it again. But what I do like about this place is their fish, fries and shrimp sampler appetizer, although we didn't order it at the time we came to this place, I did have it a few times when coming to another Red Robin and I do recommend it to others when coming here.\n\nAll in all this place doesn't deserve more than 3 stars as food wasn't that great here when we ate. Sorry Red Robin I just know you can do better."
3,I have eaten here two times now the first time it was pretty dead in the place and there was what looked like a group of kid's part of the family... My server seemed to cater to that group over me I am a paying customer keep that in mind... I ordered the General Tso's Chicken (Crunchy fried white meat tossed with scallions in a spicy sauce. I was a good meal nothing above and beyond... The second trip was for a lunch and I ordered the Mongolian beef (Spicy marinated beef saut\u00e9ed with scallions and sweet yellow onions served over a bed of crispy rice noodles and sprinkled with sesame seeds... This was a really good meal and great service so let's hope the third this as good.
3,"In my search for great BBQ this place stands out.  Not only is it tasty but it doesn't irritate my stomach.  That is a major plus in my book.  The one drawback is service.  I've ordered online and arrived at the specified pick up time 30-60 minutes later to still have to wait another 15-20 minutes.  So be advised to just go to the take out counter and order, as it will take just as long."
3,"Here for dinner with my family.  We were staying at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak Resort.  Nice location, casual dining.  Good menu with choices.  Service was OK, food fairly well prepared although lamb was overcooked for one of our party.  Overall, OK experience."
3,"The place was a lot of fun because I was with a group of girls and comped drinks kept on coming to our table.\n\nThe service and staff were amazingly friendly.  Although I wasn't there for the food, it wasn't too bad.  In fact, I don't remember much of what I ordered but it was only from the appetizer menu. \n\nThe place does get really busy, so make sure you call for reservations."
3,"GRIMALDI's PIZZERIA has a lot going for them with tools and technique at the top of the list. to my sensibilities, a coal fired oven really produces the perfect crust and, at least in my experience, GRIMALID's consistantly does it well.\n\nbut the quality of their toppings is really no different than the national chains that dispatch pimple-faced kids to your doorstep when you're too tired to drag your ass to a \""real\"" restaurant and that's kind of disappointing.\n\nand i can't say i'm wild about their sauce either. theirs is raw (and \""lightly drizzled\"" over the other toppings so the crust stays crispy) and i'm partial to a long-simmered version -- i enjoy the additional depth of flavor.\n\nso, the quest for the perfect pizza goes on ..."
3,"Ah.. the Flamingo.  First time I was there was back in 1987.  My buddy's parents went to Vegas to gamble and I tagged along to keep him company in the arcade as we weren't old enough to drive yet let alone gamble.  We spent a couple hours on a turbo speed Ms. Pacman machine and walked around the strip.  \n\nI haven't been back in that place since, until last week.  It seemed a bit nicer back in the day.  It's a bit dingy now, and walking in from the parking garage you get hit with a wall of stale smoky air reminiscent of a smoking room at a Super 8 Motel.  Blech.  Circulation is better once you make it through the hall.  The layout is confusing, but I was able to enjoy a few Sam Adams on tap at the bar with the owner of my company who had just flown in from Germany so that was nice.  I refrained from playing here though as I have issues with Harrah's properties after enduring some horrendous customer service at their Rincon San Diego casino."
3,"When I lived in the area, I used to come here a lot both to eat in and take out. The quality has gone down a bit over the last year - the last few times we went, the service wasn't great, the portions are getting smaller, plus they are giving too many vegetables and not enough meat. However, they do make a great Pad Thai."
3,"It's a new small place, clean, order at the counter fresh fish fry. They had several types of dips and the french frys were good. No beer :( sad hope that's too come soon. There was plenty served in one serving didn't need more. Husband wished his was crisper and wanted Texas toast.  Fish was white and very good. Coleslaw ok.  Hope they stay and grow - we'll be back."
3,"Well my first time at the gun range,and I must admit...it was FUN! So here goes my Pros/Cons\n\nPros:\n1. Knowledgeable Staff\n2. Plenty of fire power\nsadly that's where it ends\n\nCons:\n1.BUSY-that's good thing for them, but you will have a wait! Especially on weekend\n2.Small-there were people sitting on the floor, standing in corners. Literally shoulder to shoulder\n3.Flustered Range officers-they are not unfriendly, just a lil overwhelmed by the amount of people and trying to keep up with everything going on. I guess I would be too if  30 people carrying rifles and pistols came walking through the door all at once\n4. Price-seemed expensive to me. I shared a lane & gun plus ammo with my two sisters for 30 minutes and it came to $88!  All I remember hearing was $15 per gun\n\nNot a bad place to visit if  you've ever wanted to go to a range, just keep in mind the small size and the long lines.."
3,"I was in search of Shrimp Pad Thai and found this via google. Ordered placed for pick-up, ready in 15 mins...Great! \n\nParking was down a dimly lit drive thru/alley way. Got startled by what appeared to be a worker smoking in the corner; may I suggest you park on Spring Mt and walk around to Valley. \n\nUpon entering the restaurant, the staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was inviting. I must say the dish was very tasty with a spicy level of 4. \n\nThe only complaint were the noodles were thinner than what I was used to, almost like angel hair pasta, and the shrimp were the tiny ones; I was a little disappointed, but yet it was still very tasty. You can order up for larger shrimp, but since it was my first time I wanted to experience the regular dish. If I had to eat here again, I would definitely order the larger shrimp next time."
3,"Very cozy, love the various rooms ad seating opportunities. Must be a great place to hang in the warmer weather on the patio. \n\nLost a star for two reasons:\n1)they pour the cream for you. I didn't realize this and would have specified skim milk ahead of time, but instead watched a big glug of half-and-half go into my husband's coffee. They were very accommodating and made me a new one, but I would still like to be able to doctor my coffee myself. \n\n2)The music is a radio station, complete with annoying, repetitive GreatClips ads (Men's haircuts just $7.99!!!). Come on, just plug in an iPod and play some constant music. No one wants to listen to radio ads while chilling at the coffee house. \n\nCoffee was fine. The food looked good; people have complained about the prices, but why are you going to a coffee place for food? It was maybe a dollar on the pricey side, I guess. \n\nI have no problem with the presence of beer, but what with the beer and the gigantic PIZZA banner out front, it makes me wonder if Hob Nobs is struggling with identity. Pick one and go with it, please. \n\nOverall a pleasant experience; just a few glitches."
3,"I had high hopes for Cheddatruck. I love a good burger, it's seriously one of my favorite foods. Unfortunately though, Cheddatruck did not really win me over. My boyfriend was hoping to get the burger with mac n cheese on it but they were out of mac n cheese so he got one with an egg on it instead. I got just a plain cheeseburger. We also ordered tots.\n\nOur burgers were just okay. Mine was a little overcooked and just kind of lacking flavor overall. My boyfriend said his wasn't real memorable. The tots, while they were hand-made, were a disappointment. Like the burger, the flavor just wasn't there. Even though they had cheese in them (supposedly) and they were served with an herb cream cheese, they were bland and just kinda blah. And $3 for 7 tots is a bit steep. \n\nOverall (and considering the price) there are much better burger options around. Sorry Cheddatruck, but you can just keep on driving."
3,"Ate here on a recommendation from a friend while on vacation in Phoenix from Chicago.\n\nI thought the wait was pretty extreme; if I weren't on vacation and willing to just kick it I don't think I would wait 3 hours for a table anywhere.  Luckily hanging at the bar next door was fun, and the wait was bearable due to the circumstances.  \n\nThe pizza was very good and the bottle of wine we got was fine - I guess I'm a bit spoiled by Italian pizza (not to be confused with Chicago-style) in my hometown though, as this place seemed solid but not special.  Definitely a quality brick oven pizza with seemingly fresh ingredients though, and an enjoyable evening once you can get in."
3,"I have never gambled here, nor had a meal in any of there Restaurants.  I have really only been here to go see a movie in the theater.  So, with that said.... parking was easy, all of the employees we came into contact with were nice and the signage was easy to follow.  So, I have no complaints nor did I have any expectations.  I will update my review if I ever do anything substantial here."
3,One of the larger Second Cup around.  Always tons of fresh goods.\n\nCan get busy on Sundays where students come to study.
3,"Came here for lunch a couple of weeks ago, and it was just alright.  I've been on a pizza journey lately, trying to find little mom and pop pizza shops to try.  I've always been a fan of little pizza shops as opposed to the bigger chain pizza (Pizza Hut, Dominos, etc.). \n\nThis place was kinda nice, personal and friendly staff.  But it wasn't too busy and that always concerns me.  The pizza came out in about 20 minutes, which is pretty average for a pizza joint.  But the pizza appeared to be sloppy.  I'm not one to critique the way food looks, but when it looks sloppy, it tends to taste that way as well.  \n\nThe pizza itself was alright, nothing to write home about, and not the worst pizza I've had.  I will definitely try this place again though."
3,"Came in super late for some munchies and to cure our sweet tooth. I got the bread pudding and my friend got the french toast. The food was solid, but the service was less than desirable. The bartender was more concerned with her phone and gossip than being personable to us."
3,"If the caf\u00e9 out of Eastenders were real, I'm pretty sure this is what it would be like. I've never seen somewhere that better sums up the definition of \""good old greasy-spoon caf\u00e9\"" as well as Brambles.\n\nIt's only just opened, and I assumed it would be yet another of these sandwich/wrap/panini type places that Edinburgh is crawling with, but I was very wrong. Although Brambles do offer things like baked potatoes and paninis, their specialty is anything fried served with chips and buttered bread. And I mean literally everything - from good old chicken nuggets, chips and beans to remind you of school dinner days, to friend haggis and chips and mushy peas.\n\nThey did have some slightly healthier options on the menu, like lasagne (served with chips, of course!) but it's not really the kind of place you go to eat healthy food. The lace curtains, neon sign in the window and plastic tables should be the most off-putting thing you've ever seen, but it works in that sort of way that it's so bad it's good. It's kitsch, a bit tacky and dated, despite only being open a few weeks, but it does exactly what it says on the tin and serves good honest junk food at really reasonable prices."
3,"Definitely not as good as Ka or O, but not a bad show to watch in Las Vegas.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the acrobatics were very impressive. However, the show as a whole was kind of slow... (My mom fell asleep a bunch of times). Also, the little acts between the shows were long, and useless (in my opinion).\n\nAnyways, if you are watching a Cirque du Soleil show for the first time, you will be impressed by Mystere. However, if you have seen other shows, I would skip this show and watch something else instead."
3,"My girlfriend and I attend a soft opening dinner. The vibe is very man cave, which was cool with me. This is a great place to grab a burger and drink on a Saturday afternoon and watch the game or take a date on a week night. The Grind is a welcomed dining option for the Arcadia neighborhood! \n\nThe wait staff was super friendly and attentive. Propers to them for having their act together for the opening. \n\nMy girlfriend and I shared the melted rosemary brie with strawberry relish. The brie was cheesy goodness and did take on some of the rosemary flavor. The strawberry relish was flavorful. A balsamic reductions would make this dish. \n\nWe moved onto the BLT burger and the Sweet and Spicy Burger. The 1000 degree coal fire oven does seal in the juices and creates an nice crispy exterior on the patty. All the other ingredients were fresh and tasty. The bun was toasted, yet fresh and spongy on the interior. \n\nFries need some improvement, but again this was a soft opening. \n\nDrink list is inventive and educational. \n\nLooking forward to coming back."
3,"This place is good, don't get me wrong. I love this Italian style pizza, the service was good, and i enjoyed my meal. The thing is, if you go a few blocks over to eastern there is Grimaldi's pizza, which is that same Italian style pizza, but its just much better. The pizza was a bit cold and soft, so maybe mine was just undercooked, i dont know. Also the flavors were a little bland. So try this and you wont be too disapointed, but missing out on Grimaldi's would be the crime when its so close."
3,"establishment is great, and quite large. We were immediately greeted and seated. Our waiter was very friendly and made us feel comfortable\nI ordered the 12oz NY strip steak MEDIUM RARE.\nIt took about 30-45minutes and I was quite disappointed. My steak was overcooked, nowhere near medium rare, I could of made a scene and complained but my body was in much need of protein so I ate it and told our waiter to notify the chef about the overcooked steak. They apologized and offered me a new steak but I was in a rush and hungry so I was letting it slide.  Giving it another chance next time I come back to Vegas\n\nEstablishment 4/5\nWaiter/Staff 4/5\nFood 3/5\nPrice 2/5 (lower score the pricer it is)\nCleanlines 4/5\n\nOverall 3/5"
3,"Vovomeena why were you so hard to find!!! Whether you're driving down McDowell or 7th avenue you won't see it. Maybe we just missed it, but I didn't see any sign whatsoever. The only one was right about their door, but you can't see it well from the street. We got lost and drove around and couldn't find it. I had to text my sister to see where it's at. \n\nI ordered the banging pocket which I didn't think was very banging. Lol. It comes with sausage and eggs wrapped in a pita with a side of potatoes. It would've been nice with some onions or mushrooms or something. It just wasn't anything great. \n\nThere isn't a lot of seating at the restaurant. You probably have to come early to get a table or you'll end up sitting outside in the hot weather. They should really install misters. The service was really good but it was a far drive for mediocre food."
3,"This would be a 3.5 star place - \n\nLove the old vegas look, cheap prices, glittery light show, and more local feel.  99 cent frozen chocolate covered bananas are the bomb!  Hennessey's is a great value with really good food.  2 dollar blackjack!  Fresh donuts from Krispy Kreme!  Free shows (good and bad).\n\nNot in love with the rude people (but they're everywhere).  The casinos have low ceilings, which means lots of cigarette smoke lingering.  Wouldn't walk far from the light show, but plenty of security on the strip itself.\n\nIn general, it's a good contrast to the mega-corporate new strip, doesn't have the awesome food, but doesn't have the awe-inspiring prices either.  A lot of fun for the right reasons.  Just a matter of what you're in the mood for.\n\nJust remember:  Vegas is about fun - and the Fremont Street Experience packs a lot of it into a 3.5 short blocks."
3,"From all the other reviews I read it appears my experience was the same as many others: great atmosphere, good good, terrible service. \n\nI go up for a refill of my coffee and a worker is standing in front of the espresso machine pouring herself and drinking espresso shots. After standing there for about a minute I finally say something to her, \""Could I please have a refill?\"" She then decides to acknowledge my existence and hastily pours me a refill. \n\nThe coffee tasted great and so did my sandwich, but I don't think I should have to wait for the barista to finish her self-poured shots of espresso before I'm allowed to get my refill."
3,"It's not a bad hotel for the price.  Really.\n\nThe room I stayed in was fine (save for some odd stains on the curtains), the casino and show offerings are about standard (Carrot Top, Criss Angel), and there's a fairly diverse selection of restaurants.\n\nThat said, if you want to drop an extra $40 or $50 a night and stay somewhere else, I'd probably recommend doing that.  While I'd take the Luxor over the Imperial Palace, it's certainly no Caesar's or Mandalay Bay."
3,"Dalkeith Road is so sad-looking. I don't know how a street can looks sad, but it does. It's sort of saying 'I'm out of the way, I'm long and there are other roads parallel to me that are much better and get there quicker. sigh.' Is it possible to feel sorry for a road? \n\nAnyway\n\nC's Tasty Bites thus lacks the va va voom I look for in a snack shop. It tries, nonetheless, and 10/10 for effort. \nThe place itself is small, I think too small to breathe so only ever come here for take-away. The price is alright and the food isn't amazing, but maybe i;m lacking enthusiasm because when I leave i'm left with Dalkeith road. aw."
3,"Came for a drink after work before I went home to surprise and was told that if was going to pay by debit that I would have to spend $10 minimum. Why can't you pay for what you order regardless of what type of payment you use. Normally I would drink more than $10 worth but today happened to be a day that I can't stay long. And to top it off I asked if I could pay with cash for my one drink with cash, which you can but, the ATM was out of service... Normally I don't care but that I did..."
3,"MGM is a decent place to stay if you can get a good rate... Check-in/out is a waiting game, as with any other hotel on the Strip. My room was actually much nicer than I expected, and I especially loved the blackout shades. They really work!... Internet was fairly fast, the minibar selection is good, and I was fortunate to be on a quiet floor.\n\nTheir higher-end restaurants were also better than expected, except for Fiamma- blecch\n\nNegatives included boring, often rude blackjack dealers, poor cocktail service in the blackjack area, very little shade available at the pools unless you purchase a cabana (and, you know, it's HOT in the Vegas sun... there was also very limited waitstaff working the pools), the room air conditioner couldn't keep my room cool, and huge crowds everywhere\n\nOverall, if you like staying on the Strip, this isn't a bad place. There are better hotels, and there are certainly worse places"
3,"The staff hears what they want to hear. They don't really care what you say or order. I mean, I barely got \""cafe\"" out of my mouth and the dude was already gone. What if I didn't want condensed milk, huh? What of that? Same thing for pho orders. And AND the menu had me flustered due to their lack of rice plates. Who does that? Who doesn't have just charbroiled pork as the first thing on the list of rice plates? \n\nDespite my complaints, the egg rolls were excellent! Loads of filling in them! And the coffee was old school, with the metal drip thing and the cup of ice. Pho was good, but something about 105 degree heat makes me not want to eat a big hot soupy bowl of pho."
3,"The restaurant is located in the lobby of the Westin.  I was staying at the hotel but avoided the restaurant given that it was less than 3 stars on YELP.  The last night, I was tired and worked until 9PM, so decided to give it a try.\n\nThe menu itself is good.  They have seafood and sushi and there were plenty of dishes that caught my eye, though settled on a couple of sushi rolls.\n\nThe sushi rolls were good, and they have a good draught beer selection.  From a food perspective, I would give it a 3.5 stars, approaching four, but then I only had the sushi.  Still, just based on food, I'll try it again.\n\nHowever, where it may get a bad reputation is service, which isn't very good.  The bar was about half full, otherwise the restaurant was at most 10% occupied.  Still, anyone sitting at the bar had to wave to the bartender to get his attention, and it took about 25 minutes for my two rolls to come out.  That might explain the 2.5 star rating.\n\nSince I'll likely be staying at this Westin for awhile, probably will try it again."
3,"The good: great flavors- the pork is delicious, different options, clean and friendly team\n\nThe bad: this is my first time here so my biggest concern was the temperature of the food. I came for a late lunch, I get it, but didn't feel like the items were super fresh or hot. I think this would have been different should I have come during lunch or dinner hour. My other suggestion: the sauces should've served warm, not cold.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed it and would try it again. Love the concept."
3,"Tried the brisket the other day, and it was excellent.  Juicy and tender, it's a definite re-order.  They put the sauce on top, next time I'll ask them to put it on the side, so I can just eat some brisket by itself."
3,"Spent $200 on 2 ppl when u have a $200 dinner  u have high expectations. My Girl hated her steak it was dry the sauces they offered where nasty, My beef wellington was good but not great, the mac and cheese is hella dry ,,,, why?????? overall more hype... u pay for the environment and the way they serve the food. Will not return but will try Burgar next  time."
3,"Located on Flamingo right next door to the Rio. it is in walking distance to the Las Vegas Strip if you like to walk , but it is not such nice walk (on a freeway overpass) . That being said this place is a bit of a gem. Very reasonable rates, although not the swankiest place in Las Vegas. Coast properties tend to have a lot of amenities, making them self-sufficient. In other words you can stay here, not leave and still have a great pick of restaurants and the like. So if you are on a budget and want something a bit laid back give this place a look. Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"
3,Didn't come here to eat just drink but can't really go wrong with 2.50 coronas this is definitely is a college bar and a bit noisy what's wierd is there Oregon duck fans and not ASU fans? Great place for day drinking though
3,Typical mall but a bit over priced and not geared towards locals. Definetly a tourist trap mall but still has a few nice specialty shops and occasionally a good sale here or there. The coffee bean here is awesome and the mall has free yoga on sundays at lululemon so thats a plus as well.
3,"Popped in for a few tacos today... The carne asada was lacking in flavor, no marinade, and pretty bland. The carnitas were very good and I'd eat a dozen at one sitting :)"
3,"Nice local establishment with great food and fantastic patio to hang out on in the summer . The interior is dark and the tvs need to be bigger and placed in better viewing areas . If you don't know where this place is , it is Kind of hard to explain to people how to there . Still a nice clean and safe place to hang out ."
3,"This is your average Chinese restaurant. Cheap but average food. They have a really cheap lunch menu, for only $5.95 you get an entree and a drink.\nTheir customer service is very good. They checked on us on a regular basis and refilled our drinks in a timely matter. \nThe food is just ok, but again you get what you pay for.\nI found it kind of strange that they do not believe in plates.  The food is delivered on styrofoam and no serving spoon, which makes the food look even less appealing. \nOverall, the restaurant is just ok if you are looking for a cheap and quick meal."
3,"I've frequented this location a couple times & I've never had an issue with them, service or food wise. I just enjoyed a peanut buster parfait & it was just like the picture, how many restaurants can say that!, lol  when I'm in the mood for DQ & I'm in the area I'll stop in here for a bite"
3,"After having such a horrible experience at Babystacks (see prior review), my friend and I drove over to Lulu's. I don't know if it was the contrast to the poor service we just experienced but it was so nice to have such good service.  Although  you order at the counter, you can sit in the Metro pizza area which is easier with kids. Also, they brought out drinks over to us, which again helps with kids. They didn't bat an eye when my friend sent her egg back because she forgot to ask for it to be over hard instead of over easy as it normally comes. The manager is always nice and has gone out of her way to make us feel welcome before. \n\n I had the Herman breakfast sandwich, a little pricey (about $8 if I remember correctly), but I love that it comes on a pretzel bun and it is surprisingly filling for just being a sandwich. It is just the sandwich with egg, sausage, cheese and a stone ground mustard. \n\nI have had the chocolate croissant before and it was okay - but of course I am a chocolate croissant aficionado (aka snob) and really only like the traditional french chocolate croissant (as served at Patisserie Manon and the Baguette Cafe). The lemon tart is really good and reminds me of a sour cream lemon pie my hubby makes which is phenomenal. They usually have cookie and muffin samples out which is nice."
3,"Read the reviews on Yelp while I was visiting Phoenix.  I am a Doo-Nut fiend, so was looking for a place.  Lamar's was middle of the road.  I am a classic glazed donut kind of guy and I love them even more when they are hot and fresh.  I think had I been there when the donuts were hot and fresh I would've enjoyed them more.  Yet, it wasn't bad."
3,"Specialty food should be special. There should be a reason why you pay a bit extra for a few morsels of goodness. Reid's has a lock on these specialty foods with a nice looking meat department, array of choice cheeses and impressive wine selection. Let's break down this location a bit, shall we?\n\nThe Good: As mentioned, it's a great spot to grab a quick bite, snag a bottle of wine, some tasty snacks and get on your merry way. The service is pretty spectacular - whether your seeking said bottle of wine or dining on a sandwich during lunch. Many of the sandwiches and salads I saw coming around looked fresh and delicious. Also, there's a decent sized wine bar next to the wine vault/selection area that could kick your feet up while you taste away. \n\nThe Meh: The parking is pretty much horrendous. Unless you're stealing parking from business across the street, you better be comfortable walking a ways. The sandwich I ate here was underwhelming - the grilled pimento cheese was gut busting-ly greasy (granted, it's grilled pimento cheese) and also missed the zing I was looking for. I barely got through half of the sloppy mess and had to put it down for fear that I may have a heart attack in the shop. \n\nIf I'm walkin' around Selwyn and need to score a few snacks before heading home, Reid's is a fine choice, yet they definitely have plenty of competition in the area if we're talking tasty sandwiches and wine tasting!"
3,"The sweet crepes are great. From classic simple lemon juice to the Nutella bananas . But the savory crepes are quite run of the mill, uninspired. But the coffee and the relaxed coffee shop vibe is welcoming. But the service is uneven, and a fly bothered us on the last two visits.\n\nWas undecided between four stars or three, until I ate crepes today in San Jose, CA. Smoked salmon, and fast friendly service. A good reference point, so overall it really is a three star place. But come in for coffee with friends and share a sweet crepe? Then maybe five stars!"
3,"It's a bar.  You walk in, mechanical bull, TONS of guys, loud, huge beers, and GREAT lettuce wraps (They really did have great food)!!  \n\nI don't really have much to compare it to because this was my first place to visit in while in Arizona, but it was a fun place to start the night off at and have a few beers."
3,"Been going here for, shit, 10 years? I really want to love it (pakalolo no Swiss sub pepper Jack) but lately it's been kinda pissin me off, for all the reasons mentioned by everyone else here.\n\nGreat subs, not so much meat on them, kinda pricey, ultra slow, thumbs up for having mtn dew on tap.\n\nOh, and not green/sustainable at all!! Tried to redeem about 5 punch cards totaling 10 punches for a free sammich but they wouldn't let me. They could have just reused the cards, giving the ones with one punch to the next customers instead of punching and wasting all new cards.\n\nHippies my ass . . .\n\nI will probably be going back, though not nearly as much."
3,"The Pros: Inexpensive menu, fresh food, great malts, clean restaurant, friendly smiling employees, pepper bar. \n\nCons: Stale and not creative dining area, awkward layout in the dining room, seen before menu options, pre-made salad dressings.\n\nGood for a quick burger. In my opinion there are other burger options in town that I prefer."
3,"This is definitely a bento box place that is a GREAT place to go to just pick up some sushi for lunch that tastes yummy and reasonably priced. However, this place is NOT awesome for a sit down date. \n\nThey serve the sushi in the to-go packages, and there are no real silverware available. It's just disposable stuff and styrofoam cups. They also didn't have any sugar for their tea. It took quite a while for the rolls to be made as well. The service was very spacey - like the guy didn't know what he was doing.\n\nHOWEVER, their roll (rainbow roll) was AWESOME and their green tea was TO DIE FOR. They don't serve any white fish (at least they didn't when I was there). I would definitely recommend this as a place to pick up a good lunch, but not as a date or a dinner meal."
3,Nice seafood place away from the casinos.\n\nFood: 7.5/10 - Nice menu selections. Well prepared.  The flavors will not wow you but they are a solid meal.  \n\nService: 8/10 - No problems. Nothing spectacular either.\n\nCleanliness: 8/10 - No visible issues.\n\nDecor: 8.5 / 10 - Sat outside on a beautiful night.  Was very nice.  Inside looked nice as well.\n\nRestrooms: 7/10 - no problems.\n\nParking: 9/10 - Tons of parking.  \n\nOverall: 7/10 - A nice place to eat.  I personally like the Texas de Brazil located right next door MUCH better.
3,"Walked in and the SeaHawkers club had just left.  The place was a wreck and they were scrambling to get the tables cleaned and the restaurant back in order.\n\nGood service, good food and cold drinks.  Use the 4Square app and unlock an additional dollar off your drinks, even during happy hour."
3,"Fun environment, good service.\n\nIf you are tired of high prices for average drinks, then this is another place to bring a flask to. I did not see a single tap and the beers are kinda standard; nothing to exciting and prices just over reasonable.\n\nBeen there 3 times and the bartenders are attentive and helpful. One bartender accidentally gave me too many beers in a bucket and other other politely explained to me that \""she gave you an extra, enjoy it and don't worry, but I didn't want you to be surprised when there is 1 less next time.\"" This is a situation that makes guest service snobs like me very proud to give an establishment by business."
3,"I gave it a 3 star because overall the hotel was just ok, I did expect It to be better..  First time at the Trump hotel and found mold food in the refrigerator!! Customer service is not that great..Housekeeping took forever to clean my room, I did call early in the morning to inform them I need housekeeping which was provided but finish around 3pm... The hotel is away from the strip..we have to take taxi to and from Caesars Palace even though there was shuttle provided because we have to wait at least more then 25 min. Shuttle does stop at midnight which sucks because we can't enjoy ourselves just worrying the shuttle will stop soon and that's why we have to take taxi which charge us $20 plus tips and taxi driver doesn't want just $1 tip, they want more....\nIt's best to stay on the strip so no more taxi or shuttle rides !!\nPros:\nQuiet, luxurious, doesn't smell, kitchen in the suites, luxurious bathroom\nCons:\njust a few minor things. The shuttles stop way too early and it take a long time to pick you up. It's far away from the strip if you were to walk..there's really nothing to do at the hotel..it's just a basic hotel with a pool and a gym.."
3,"great eats, even if you don't get the all you can eat spaghetti. Had the arugula and white bean salad plus two penne pasta dishes. Both very good. Good Italian food in a nice atmosphere at decent prices with good waitstaff."
3,"we have gone to this \""ol'school (of the strip, local)\"" restaurant/casino/brewery a ew tims (btw are you confused yet---so am I)\nto say the least it is a jack of all trades but, you cant beat there breakfasts, cheap and good, last time i went it was steak and eggs for $3.99. as i stated previoulsy this is also a brewery and they make there own root beer, yeah its good stuff..this is not a place i would staay at or even gasmble at but its good bang for your buck......last time i went with my pops in law we had a coupon all u can drink for 1 whole hour, no purchase necessary, i think we rocked 22 coronas, pretty awesome..."
3,"Service: our server was flustered with too many tables and we felt like a burden when we asked her for a refill of celery sticks.\n\n\nmango-spicy: very spicy and good\ngarlic asian: not as spicy\njerk chicken: not spicy at all!!\n\nOverall very good buffalo wings, though they could just throw in more celery sticks.\n\n2X celery refills =$1.20 seriously???\n\nBeware. You will get charged for extra celery sticks even though a stalk of celery is less than a buck each."
3,"Napa location is on a different level compared to Vegas. The food and service at the bar were both a little rough. Our server/bartender completely forgot about us several times and we had to reorder a few times as well. In addition, I overheard the bartender blame the chef for an error in food to a customer. I thought that was very unprofessional. Quality of the food did not seem up to par from my previous experiences in Napa."
3,"I love Trader Joe's, can I say that?  Best prices/best quality for nuts (almonds, pecans, walnuts, etc.) and nut products (almond butter, etc.) that I have found anywhere.  Awesome produce, awesome stuff that you can't find anywhere else.  Also, Joe Joe's, FTW!\n\nI would give this particular one 5 stars except for 2 things:\n\n1. Just try and find a parking spot around noon on any weekday.  I dare you.\n\n2. It's so smaaaaaalllll :(\n\nOtherwise, awesome."
3,"Oh Treasure Island, and your old-school pirate show, where have you gone?  Welcome to TI, and the scantily clad pirate show...my have times have changed.  Across the street from the Venetian/Palazzo sits TI.  Definitely has seen better days, and by that I mean pretty much everything.  Rooms, casino, food.  If you want to save a few bucks and stay down at this end of the Strip, this is your place.  Just be prepared to hear the pirate show every night!"
3,"You know, after going back to the convention for a second year and eating at the Golden Palace Buffet again, I have to say that ordering off of the menu provided a significant improvement over the buffet.\n\nThe food wasn't nearly as greasy and was actually quite flavorful.  I was pleased with my meal and I'm sure my friends were, too.  My friend, who was wearing a giant costume, was treated with courtesy."
3,"Nice and firm please, that is how I like it, not soft and squishy.\n\nUnfortunately the tofu here is the latter. I ordered the yellow curry tofu, and the tofu was just chunks of softer tofu cut up into my curry. It was not fried or prepared in any other way first.  The curry was rich and had a good spice to it, there was also an ample amount of vegetables. The presentation with the rice moulded to a small cone was a nice touch. \n\nThere is a lunch menu full of the usual Thai suspects, curries, pad Thai etc. \n\nThe business it self is located in a odd small strip mall, the inside consists of high top tables by the window and normal tables in the inside.  It was pretty empty when we went for lunch on a weekday."
3,"Stopped by this Subway on the drive back home to Vegas from Phoenix.  It is conveniently located on the right side of the road heading to Vegas.\n\nI ordered a 6\"" BMT w/Jalapeno Cheddar Bread & had it toasted.  I added Tomatoes, Lettuce, Green Peppers, Pepperoncinis, Mustard, Mayo, Oil, Vinegar, Salt, Pepper.  They made it quickly and I was eating in no time.\n\nThe ingredients were very fresh and the Sandwich tasted great.  A nice snack for the ride home.\n\nA bonus is the clean restrooms....a quick tip is to stop here to use the restroom instead of a nasty gas station....every gas station in Wickenberg was busy with travelers using the restrooms.\n\nWill I return?  Next time I drive to/from Phoenix, I will."
3,"The last time my friends and I stayed in Vegas, we ended up at Treasure Island because we got a really good deal.  When we checked in, we noticed there was a Pho Restaurant and thought it was so random.  We scoffed at the patrons dining inside who had paid the exorbitant prices to eat Vietnamese food we were certain was mediocre at best. Little did we know we'd be there the following afternoon as well as the next slurping up the noodle soup to cure our pounding heads from our mad hangovers.\n\nBottom line: Prices are steep but it is Vegas after all and it's definitely not the best Pho I've ever had but if you happen to be staying at Treasure Island, check this place out because nothing cures a hangover better than some noodle soup."
3,"I don't know what it is about mainland L&Ls...but the food just doesn't have the same taste as L&Ls back home in Hawaii.  The food is edible and very bland.  Beware when paying, though.  The prices on the menu board say one thing, but check your receipt...you may have been charged more.  I brought this to the attention of the worker who was ringing up my purchase, and his response was \""I can't do anything...that's what it says on the computer.\""  Really?  Businesses need to realize they can't advertise their price publicly, and then charge more at the register.  Very bad business practice!"
3,"Had dinner with a large group. We had a superb wine, but I'm sure it was not cheap and was chosen by the host of the dinner. The food? Well...the chopped salad was pretty mediocre, and too filling with all the red kidney beans it it. The table breads and muffins were too dry, kind of inedible.\n\nDuck pancake...like someone had poured half a bottle of cheap, sweet syrup on it so who knows what the duck tasted like.\n\nThe porterhouse lamb chops - very good. This was by far the best thing I had. The lamb was perfectly grilled, and the sauce was inoffensive so you could enjoy the meat. \n\nDessert - that warm, pudding-like cake that I can't remember. It was good, and chocolate. Like many restaurants they served the dessert and then came around asking for coffee as kind of an afterthought. The coffee service took so long that it was tough to wait on eating the cake. Dang, I like coffee WITH dessert. But, most restaurants haven't figured out how to serve both at around the same time.\n\nThe restaurant is a nice spot in Caesars so I don't want to dissuade people from going. But, I'd make the grilled meat the centerpiece of what you order and not get too high on hope for the rest, based on what I experienced. And get a nice bottle of wine to go with it!"
3,"It's Wal-Mart and it does not disappoint.  This store location just opened recently and I thought, \""well, it's somewhat close to ASU, maybe it'll have a different vibe than the typical Wal-Mart experience I'm used to.\""\n\nNope\n\nIt's your standard issue Wal-Mart with your standard issue merchandise at those low low prices Wal-Mart's famous for.\n\nIt also still draws the same type of customers.  They're the ones we've all come to know and love at www.peopleofwalmart.com.  If you're looking for an environment where kids scream out the numbers they know (and failing to exceed 5...I'm serious), if part of your shopping experience includes the oblivious blocking every isle, and if you are enamored by the grandma pace cars you have to follow to get up to the front, then this is the Wal-Mart for you."
3,"This is a 'Superstore' and the biggest close by supermarket for Leith / Shore residents. \n\nIt has 2 entrances one at the Tesco Car park at the back and the back entrance on Duke Street. \n\nIt is a Tesco supermarket and they do what supermarkets do. In addition to that they have also clothes and electricals available.\n\nFor a so-called Superstore it is a little small. but it supplies what is needed and it is open from 06:00 till Midnight. \n\nBe aware that the law of baying alcohol before 10am  and after 10pm also counts for supermarkets.. Some Leith residents tend to 'forget' that rule and get into a discussion a the till. - happened a few times. \n\nThey have a section dedicated to self-service tills and 2 fast lane basket only cashiers. \n\nThey are not as frequently visited by me, certainly after the whole Horse meat scandal. But they are a handy go to for packaged products. Whiskies, spirits, wine and chocolates. - that's about it. \n\nNot the worst of shops, but not the best either"
3,"I'm giving it 3 stars almost solely on decor & atmosphere. \n\nAfter reading all of the rave reviews I really expected to be amazed, but sadly, that didn't happen. \n\nI did get a nonfat chai latte instead of coffee, so maybe that has something to do with it. It was kind of bland, nothing special :( \n\nBut like I said, the company was good, the atmosphere nice & I love the look of the place :) \n\nIf I try it again I'll try the coffee,,, I don't think I want to repeat my chai experience."
3,"Not bad. Better than other fast food joints in Scotland. Actually WAY better than the fast food joints in Scotland. \n\nI kinda expected more, but was won over by the rootbeer float. That was definitely worth going. OMG, you have not experienced American fast food/diner fare til you've had a rootbeer float. Brought me back to the days of Dairy Queen and the likes. Yet the burger wasn't all that. It was ok but it just felt like there was something missing, to make it a home run. Also, I probably should've ordered the cajun fries. I ordered the onion rings. They were good but clearly frozen. So now I'm on a mission to find fresh made onion rings, any rec's?"
3,"well i wanted a place at center strip. would i have gone for the flamingo for a little more money, knowing what i know now? yes.\n\nbut... hey, can't complain. it was a little shoddy, a little dirty, and totally just fine. we had a balcony! which my sister's suite at the mirage did NOT! so there.\n\nthe buffet was fine. nothing to write home about, but so far no food-borne illness, which i'm all about.\n\nso yes, it may not be much of a step up from the motel 6, but it is a step. a good deal at center strip. and if you're spending too much time in your room you're doing something wrong anyway!"
3,Went here for dinner last night. 3 courses and a glass of wine (making use of the \u00a310 set menu) strikes me as good value for money. The service from boath the greeter and waitress was pleasant and attentive and my sardine starter and hake main course w/ side of spinach were both very well cooked and presented.\n\n\n I'd like to give them a further half star but as ever having to dock a full one instead. The cheese board was the one minorly negative aspect of the meal. It could have done with a couple more oatcakes and maybe more onion marmalde and the slice of brie had clearly been allowed to dry out and harden a bit + the cheese knife had seen better days (the plastic handle was cracked clean through on both sides near the base of the blade).\n\n\n No idea if the interior's changed much since it was a Harry Ramsden's but it's well decorated and gets a lot of sun. I intend to go back.
3,"Hipster heaven. Bring on the 1920s era boots with dungarees to match. \n\nReally cool space. A terrific, vintage roaster is prominently displayed and obviously used. \n\nThere is clearly a craft coffee shortage in my hometown. A line was nearly out the door. \n\nI scored an espresso. It was served up effectively and efficiently. In my humble opinion, the coffee was good...not great. A little too much fruit/acid. Not enough chocolatey smoothness. But, that's my taste. Not necessarily everyone else's cup o' tea!\n\nHowever, my girl ordered a pour-over. And, pour-overs take a while. But, after ten minutes of waiting, we asked. Oh! We forgot about your pour-over coffee! Just wait another ten minutes. Derrrr...I don't want to wait another ten but I guess I have to cuz my girl is a caffeine junkie and so am I. Can't function without the wonderful stuff. \n\nI got to taste my girls cup o' joe and it was delicious. \n\nAll in all, they have a good thing going but need to tweak a couple of things. I would return."
3,"We ate there with the family, nice, cozy environment, it was kind of dead for a Sunday. At the entrance of the buffet it smelled like sewer, we were grossed out but wanted to give it a try. We eat sushi 15 times a month... no joke! This place is NOT grade A sushi at all.. you can compare it to Grocery store sushi... it was OK. \nThe variety of the buffet was really good, it would even be better if everything tasted good for that amount of money!"
3,We saw this place on Bar Rescue and wanted to check it out. My wife and I showed up about 9:30 PM. I was starving and planned on eating here. Unfortunately the bartender said the kitchen was closed because they had a slow night. I had one beer and left only because I couldn't keep drinking without getting some kind if food in my belly. Next time in Vegas I will definitely give this place another shot. And maybe more stars. The locals were extremely friendly and greeted us as soon as we walked in. The bartender was also very friendly. Wish I could have experienced the food.
3,"I enjoyed the food, I got the chicken fried steak and it came with mashed potatoes and the gravy that comes on the steak. Also some green beans and a side salad that comes out first. All in all the food was good. \n\nComing in was confusing. We weren't greeted and since it was our first time there we were very confused. Because it's a cozy place I'm ok with there not being a hostess stand. But I do feel like someone should be on top of greeting the guests so that we know how the waiting works (you just walk in and stand awkwardly at the door and they ask who was there first when they have a table ready.)\n\nAll in all it's so so. But I do love that it's a famiky business and the food was good"
3,Food and service were okay. Among the dishes I ate were sweet & sour soup and tofu with baby bok choy.\n\nThe decor seemed fancy. I liked the jellyfish lights near the entrance and the wood-covered menus.
3,"Very nice bar and the prices are very reasonable, if they put 2 (diamond) tables in there instead of 1 bar table and 1 build at home type pool table it would make this bar a very awesome place to hang out at and take pool league teams all week 24/7."
3,"Average American restaurant, good food, but nothing special. Safe choice restaurant.   Bar area is loud, a bit difficult to talk and hear."
3,"Pros: Nicely laid out store with a wide variety of vintage merchandise.\nCons:  Booths are not individually signed with percentage off discounts for store sales which makes things rather confusing.  Employees are hard to identify as they don't wear aprons, badges, etc.  Your purchase will be wrapped in used newspaper instead of clean wrapping paper.  All things that can be improved upon for a better shopping experience."
3,I liked this place.  The ambiance is nice and the service is superb.  The mojito was delicious and so was the waffles.  My daughter was excited by the red velvet pancakes.  The down side was price - SO EXPENSIVE!  An order of pancakes was $13!  I can't afford to frequent this place very often.
3,"A good place to eat, trendy. You can't call ahead or make reservations so expect to wait about 20-30 minutes for a table. The food is good, but when I went there I got an Eggs Benedict and it was more of a hard boiled egg, though it was well-seasoned. \n\nI'll be giving it another try, but I was much more excited about this place before I tried it."
3,"We stopped here for lunch because we were tired and didn't feel like walking any further. We both had the potato leek soup, which was excellent. My Sweetie had the tuna sandwich with fries and I had the plain salad with a side of fries. I was sad my salad had a more than a few not-so-fresh leaves, but the waitress (Dana) did not charge us for it. The fries were crispy and hot and tasty. The food was good but not memorable in anyway. Dana was one of the sweetest waitresses ever. So polite and attentive."
3,"Quite disappointing when I expected the same flavor and price when I was in LA. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the waiters/waitress were super friendly. We ordered bulgogi and ribs. The food was flavorful but average. No refills for the side dishes when you are grilling at the grill-your-own-bbq table. \n\nExtra: went with a groupon deal but still ended up paying way more than expected and received less food. \n\nTL;DR: ok place for food, clean, but does not justify the price."
3,Upstream is probably thought of as one of the best restaurants in Charlotte.  I am from Philadelphia where there are excellent restaurants with iron chefs so my viewpoint may be a bit skewed.   The food was good but not great or amazing.  Every dish (except the house salad) was over salted.  My husband had the tuna and I had the seabass. They were both very good but as I said before not great.  We would go there again but for sushi/raw items not necessarily the cooked menu items.  The salad was was the highlight for me (house salad) and the crab bisque was pretty tasty too.   Overall the service was very good but slow.  Our waiter was one of the most knowledgeable wait staff we have encountered since moving from PA.
3,"After Harlow's down the road was so packed we couldn't park, we decided to give this new breakfast cafe a try.  The portions are extremely generous and overall the food was really good.  The prices are a little high I think, but not so much that I wouldn't return.  I knocked down a star because the ham I received was \""off\"" and tasted like it was past it's shelf life, and the oj was just so-so.  They do give complimentary chocolate covered strawberries that are epic!"
3,"It's BBQ at an airport.  If you're in the mood for BBQ while in the airport, well friend, you have pretty darn limited options.  This place is affordable for an airport, and decent.  Great BBQ it is not, but it's serviceable, and quite a bit better than your options to the left and right.\n\nI went with the three meat platter.  The brisket was 1/2 fat; I'm pretty sure I got the end chunk.  The pulled pork was decent, and the turkey had a good smoke but was pretty dry.  They have one sauce option...yes or no.  Definitely not mustard-based, but recommended as it's not overbearing.  \n\nFor healthy sides...well, you're at a BBQ joint, so good luck with that."
3,"....and boy are my arms tired!\n\nComedy clubs are easy to review when focusing on the club itself, and not the talent.  You could be in the perfect comedy club and see a horrible act, just as you could see something amazing at a dive bar's open mic night.  \n\nThis \""club\"" is really  a conference room that has been converted into a comedy club.  The staff sets up chairs around the room for the patrons the night of the show, adding seats when needed.  There are a few VIP couches, but since this intimate setting is quite quaint, there really is no reason to pay the high price for them.\n\nThere are two waitresses who run around frantically trying to fill all the patrons' orders, but be ready to wait for your beverage.  Walking up to the bar in the room is usually a better way to go.  \n\nI saw the late (9pm) show on a Saturday night.  Seating starts at 8:30, so get there early if you want to sit in the front.  Really, there isn't a horrible seat in the house though.  \n\nI saw Todd Paul the night I went in, and laughed my A$$ off.  He was charismatic and hilarious.  His act was a mix of magic, stunts, and comedy.  He did an amazing job of making fun of Las Vegas shows, specifically magic shows.  I would definitely return for another fun night."
3,"We ate here a few weeks ago per a recommendation from the hotel we were staying at.  While I do not eat steak a few of my friends do and they said they liked it.  I ordered the Chicken Peppered Penne which was delicious.  I asked them to make it extra spicy which they did.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, the sauce was creamy, and the dish had a great flavor.  The service was good and the prices were reasonable."
3,"This is the best Pho I've had in Scottsdale!  Now, as far as Pho goes, it's mediocre. The broth is good, but the quantity is small and price high!  It's seems as if they are scared to give you a good sized portion of noodles and meat. I get irked when I sped over $8 for Pho and I'm not stuffed. I think they do try hard here, but get away with the poor sizing and simple taste because they can!  \n\nThe staff is attentive ms friendly. Overall, give it a shot and order extra noodles and meatballs to get full!"
3,"Nice pub, very touristy. In the upstairs part, the food is very good, but the ambiance not even remotely comparable to downstairs.\n\nDownstairs the selection of real ales is awesome. Why does leaving your business card get you sparkly wine? Why not one of these awesome beers or whiskies? I found it pretty cool that they count how many hand pumped ales they pump every week. The week before I was there: 1987. Cool."
3,Not a big fan but Tax free yeah!  Off base has more selection and you can find deals. Unless your buying a high price item i would shop elsewhere. The lines get bad so don't be in a rush.
3,"Okay, the decor is awful and cheesy (but I guess that is part of the fun as well as a statement that the times may change, but Peppermill doesn't out of some sense of righteousness, laziness, and/or lack of funds).  They make the waitresses wear these awful, ugly uniforms (it reminds me of the flair Jennifer Aniston had to put up with in Office Space).\n\nWe went here for breakfast, and it wasn't actually okay.  The omelettes and pancakes were both good.  And for breakfast, it is a little different food and atmosphere than you get in the buffets on the mostly Disney-fied Las Vegas strip."
3,"The beer was ok, nothing special! I think it has a good atmosphere. But really only seemed to focus on sweeter beers. \n\nGranted they were out of the blonde and anything else lighter. We will try them again another time and re-judge!"
3,"I would not recommend this airline if you are traveling with kids. This is a no frills airline. Nothing special. There was no TV, period on our 5 hour flight from NY. All the kids in the plane were going nuts. The seats are very cramped and small. The plane seemed very old. \n\nGo Delta, if you have kids."
3,"Decent place, good food, great  atmosphere to watch a game. Thank god the karaoke was not there tonight. Service could be better, mainly faster. The servers are spread too thin, as there seem to never be enough top handle the crowd. Otherwise a decent pace too have a drink, grab a bite and watch sports."
3,"This place is open 24 hours and is located outside in the Paris Hotel Casino. It very nice and the Ambiance is really nice and classy. Food is actually OK, but nothing special. The dessert are great though and actually cheap for the amount you get. I got the banana split and share it with two other people and we didn't finish it. Cost like $10 bucks or something. The Sugar Factory store however is over price. Mints and such are like $5-$8 for a small tin. It one of those place you should try once. It a fun place and has outside seating. Dessert and Drinks is what they known for."
3,"Scale of 1-10 (single visit):\n8 Food\n5 *Drinks*\n8 Service\n8 Atmosphere\n7 Value\n\nI thought the food was pretty good.  I love the egg-on-top thing New Mexican restaurants do.  The blue corn tortilla of my enchiladas was thick and good.  But the marg was bad.  Tasted like sweet and sour.  No bite whatsoever, and I'm pretty sure it came out of a machine (rocks), instead of hand made.  Also the salsa wasn't anything special.  It had some nice heat, but just average flavors."
3,While at Fiesta Mall with my son who was getting his hair cut we decided to eat. We wondered around the food court and was approached by an employee of Sarku Japan offering free samples of their teriaki chicken. After trying it my son just had to order from there.  The staff was friendly and the price was reasonable.  He ordered the teriaki chicken & shrimp. The amount of food that he got was way more than expected and he was happy it tasted like what it was suppose to. \nA definate place we'll visit in again and highly recommend!!
3,"Maria...host, rolled her eyes and seemed to have a attitude problem\nKyahl?  Sounds like Kyle. was actually pretty good, he answered my mother in law's questions to the best of his abilities.\nThe food is always kind of hit or miss...the veal parm was good but the macaroni rosa was very bland and the broccoli in it weren't cooked and the pasta was a more al dente than we are use too...there was still a crunch"
3,"I've been here a few times and its decent food. There is nothing special about this place that makes me want to specifically go back. Although, if someone is holding a party or special occasion here I doubt I would avoid this place.\n\nI've never been here just for lunch or dinner, so that may effect my review. Although, I've eaten this food on multiple occasions for events at the restaurant. Its good Indian food, and you can never say no to good Indian food. It just wasn't spectacular. I would give most Indian food places 5-stars if the quality of the meat they used was better and if the quality of everything they use is just better. The salads weren't green, the meat in the korma and tikka was very small. It just felt like they were cheaping out on us.\n\nDesserts weren't really special either. If you give me gulab jamun or some jelebi, I am a sucker for that stuff. Theirs was decent, but there wasn't much of it available. However, there really isn't much better stuff in AZ in this vicinity. I'd say India Gate is a little better, maybe try that place out first."
3,"Awwww MAN!!! I have written a review on their Pecos and Washington location, which I love and obsess about during the summer when craving sea food. However, felt like this location is lacking that \""touch\"". I ordered the shrimp ceviche and fish tacos and they were definitely not as flavorful as they are at their north town location. The ceviche tasted way too fishy, needed lots of lemon and salt and the tacos where just blah!  \n\nThe restaurant itself is nice. Waitress was nice and attentive, just didn't get the same experience. The people I was with also agreed as they have also tried the other location. I will not be coming back to this location, especially because the prices have increased but worth it if you get the \""Islitas\"" experience. This place does not have it. Go to north Las Vegas location. They are overpriced for the quality. I give them 3 starts only because I know they have potential on improving, or else I would give them 2."
3,"Ordered the white pizza with tomato onion and kalamata olives and was pretty tasty. They recommended that the pizza be cooked for an extended amount of time because of the wet ingredients which caused the crust to be slightly burned with a tad too much crunch for my tastes.  Plenty of staff inside.  Interior atmosphere was o.k.  The only markdown I give them is the price. It seemed to lack value and was over priced.  Probably will not return given it is too far away from me...and even if there were one closer, other places would get my dollar first."
3,"This place was not what I expected.  It is a huge open space with a large bar stuck right in the middle.  The menu is more upscale than the usual sports 'bar' selections, but I guess that is the difference between sports bar and sports grill?\n\nThe food was good, but if I remember correctly they had little to no draft beer.  They could have had Bud or Coors or something, but to me that translates to no beer on tap.  \n\nThey have a lot of flat screen tvs as they should,  but I like a little bit more character in my sports bar.  This is much too commercial for my taste."
3,"Nothing really special about this hotel within the hotel besides maybe shorter check in lines which is nice and asain themed room. Basically this just seems like they tried to do something special with some old space and while its nice its not really 5 star worthy.   The problem is Caesars palace is old and has horrible customer service.  Everything is slow and understaffed.   Wynn, Bellegio and Venetian are all better places to stay."
3,"Have been to Joe's a number of times and enjoyed their food.  We have had terrible service every time, though.  It's worth going because the food is good and the atmosphere is fun.  Just be patient, and your night will be fine."
3,Great selection of beer. Plenty of it! The food is so-so. Typical bar-food. Very nice wait-staff and bar tenders. Large enough place to accommodate a busy night. Worth the stop.
3,"I went here for dinner with my guy last night and I completely agree with the other reviews, the patio is fantastic. It has a great view and its surprisingly quiet and secluded while being right above Indian School road. The wine and beer selection is impressive. I really like all of the local choices. \nThe food however was underwhelming. I started with the fries which had rosemary and parmesan and a dipping sauce similar to a thousand island on the side. It was good, but not great. For our entrees we had the sausage and mushroom pizza, and the penne ragu. The pizza was tasty, it had caramelized onions three types of mushrooms and Italian sausage, the crust was just the way I like it not too crispy and not too soft, but definitely a fork and knife needed pizza. The ragu was interesting; it reminded me of everything that would be inside a shredded beef burrito but instead of a tortilla it's in a bowl with penne pasta underneath. It wasn't bad just unexpected. I wish we would have tried desert they all looked delicious, perhaps next time. \nAll in all I think this is a great place for appetizers and drinks especially on their wonderful patio."
3,"Good coffee ... i'm not eating doughnuts or bagels at the moment, so it's hard to rate their signature foods. Ask me again in 40 pounds."
3,"I came here with some friends yesterday and we shared a number of items. As I walked in, I noticed how lovely it smelled and was excited to try their waffles.\n \nWe sat and perused the menu for a while and I was a little disappointed that no one really checked on us or even asked if we wanted waters or more menus than just the one for our group of three. We finally figured out what we wanted and went up to the counter to order.\n\nThe lady behind he counter kept interrupting my dining companion as he started to order by yelling behind to another person who worked there. I thought that was a little rude, so that definitely put me off.\n\nOur food took a while to come, but it looked really pretty. \n\nWhat we ordered:\n-red velvet wafflenut \n-Nutella and almond wafflenut \n-The Fat Elvis waffle\n-Strawberry and chocolate waffle\n-Vegas churro waffle with honey, cinnamon, sugar and vanilla ice cream\n\nEverything was solid. The consensus was that the churro waffle was the favorite and I personally enjoyed the strawberry waffle, minus the chocolate sauce. \n\nService needs work and the location is awkward, so I don't see myself making much effort to come back to this place in the future."
3,"Service was fast, but the burger, hotdog, and fries were overrated for the expensive price.\nInn n Out  is still my favorite fast food burger and Bachi Burger is my favorite gourmet burger place in Vegas!"
3,"It's a tourist destination, and sometimes the wait can be atrocious. So I mean you need to know that heading in. The Crispy Duck on noodles is freaking amazing, but for what it costs it should be a portion about 50% bigger. That's really my knock with LOS. The portions should be bigger given how much you're paying, or the food should just be perfect. That's where my 2 stars were lost."
3,"My wife dragged me in here after she tried their surf n turf and raved about it. I can't comment on that yet.\nWe sat at the bar and played poker for awhile. Not a big deal but they make you play max bet for a 2nd drink. They were nice enough to warn me about that and still comped my 2nd drink. Might be a reason why we were about the only ones playing.\nWe ordered food and then sat at a table and brought our drinks with. The portions were big for the sandwiches (philly is great) and very good BUT wait till you get the bill. Yes, we saw the prices but by the time we got done with food and tip it was almost $40 for 2 sandwiches and we didn't have any drinks to pay for. \nIt was good but I just don't see the attraction for a sandwich place and their prices."
3,"We went here for our engagement dinner with our family. It was BUSY for a Wednesday night and parking...well let's just say there isn't that many parking spaces available. For a party of 13, we were stuck in the corner closest to the door. Every time someone opened the door a gust of cold air would come in or the smell of cigarette smoke. YUCK! This was when it was raining for a couple days straight. Luckily, my brothers and sister are tiny, because putting them 4 in the chairs closest to the wall worked out. No average size adult would be able to fit....yes that is how crammed we were. \nIn typical Chinese fashion, there was Lobster, Red Trout, Fried Flounder, Chicken, Beef and a lot of veggies. I felt that everything was just ok. Nothing too special and they had messed up one of the kids orders. I believe my Grandma liked it for the most part and that's all that mattered to me. Overall, I do prefer other places, but I won't be against coming back here again as long as I'm not sitting next to the door when its freezing outside."
3,"Paul Martin's has a lot going for it - too bad the stuff on the periphery was bad. \n\nPaul Martin's is a nice and rather classy steakhouse that definitely reminds me of D.C. steakhouses. The lighting is dark but pleasant, the music energetic but quiet, and the ambiance rather pleasant. \n\nThe food is also good. I had the Sunday special offering, which is salad, prime rib, and ice cream for $25. The salad was good and had a decent flavor palette without being overwhelming.  The prime rib was tender and had an amazing spice rub that took it to the next level, but the interior was something of a vast wasteland of okay meat. The desert didn't happen for me - they had no options for lactose intolerant patrons, which was rather disappointing (and perplexing, given the upper echelons this place places itself in). \n\nThe service was rather poor. The server was clearly overwhelmed at times - at one point, he responded to our lactose intolerance inquiry by telling us that the ice cream was gluten free. It actually became rather offensive when we were made to feel guilty about using one of their gift cards - I have no idea why a steakhouse would make paying customers feel so awkward about using a gift card they sold!\n\nLong story short, the food here is four stars, the service two. Three seems appropriate."
3,Staff here is usually very nice and helpful and not overbearing. Everything is kept nice and tidy. I just feel that this location does lack in variety and sizes...
3,"So, heres the deal...Uncle Bears is a great place to meet up with friends for dinner, a few beers and a game. The menu is ok. Nothing too great, nothing bad. I like the sliders. They're pretty solid every time I get them. The Chicken Fajitas are good too and contrary to what some other yelpers have said, they do not taste like rubber. \n\nBeer selection is great for the area. There are several local beers on tap from Four Peaks and several national micros as well.\n\nThe theme and decor are great. As a dog owner, we love looking at pictures of everyone else's dogs and wondering after all these years of going to this place, why we've never brought in a picture of our own dogs. \n\nThis is just a good old all around neighborhood bar and grill."
3,"D'Arcy McGee's serves up a mix of various cuisines that can be best summed up as Anglo-Saxon origin.  Ranging from dishes such as Irish boxty, corned beef and cabbage, Scotch eggs, Canadian poutine, and British Yorkshire pudding, portions are hearty and service is cheerful and pleasant.  The food quality itself is just OK, but it's a nice change of pace from your standard wings, pizza, or sandwiches that you find at other bar-type restaurants."
3,"Pho is good but its not best pho or egg rolls (they don't even serve it with the lettuce and herbs) you can get in Pittsburgh. On the flip side though, their owner is super friendly"
3,"This Marble Slab Creamery is located in Stonecrest Shopping Center, towards the front of the development near JoJo's, Miro, Dean & Deluca, etc.  It's your standard ice cream shop.  It had a decent variety of flavors, along with some \""Ice Cream Cupcakes\"" that I had never seen before.  Whole ice cream cakes in various sizes were also included in a stand-up freezer.  A few chairs and tables scattered about, but this is located near the plaza with plenty of outdoor seating near the big fountain, should weather permit.  \n\nOn this visit, I decided to get one of the ice cream cupcakes to try later - it was fine.  I purchased a Birthday Cake milkshake along with that, which wasn't blended particularly well, so the first sips were just sweet milk, followed by clumps of ice cream.  Again, fine.  Nothing special.  The employees were nice enough.  I wasn't wowed, but wasn't expecting to be - it was A-OK."
3,This place is located near the outlet center and is easy to access. In the store they provide you with packing tape if you need it. Unlike some other places that require that you purchase it. The customer service members are nice unlike USPS workers.
3,"My husband and I stopped in before we went to see a movie. We had already had dinner so we only stopped in for a cocktail and some deserts. \n\nWe sat on the patio which was really nice. We were the only ones sitting at the patio, so we were worried that we would be forgotten about but the service was still rather good.\n\nHe had a beer and I had a frozen strawberry margarita. The margarita was slightly watered down and could have used a bit more strawberry to it. My husband tried a beer called Victoria which actually wasn't bad at all. I also ordered a frozen ice cream. I went with the vanilla ice cream. The presentation was lovely and I enjoyed the deep fried ice cream. \n\nI did hit up the bathroom before we headed out to the theater and I was very impressed with the bathroom. The women's bathroom has a large full sized mirror and the handicapped/nursing bathroom is very large and has ton of room. \n\nOverall, it was a nice experience and we may end up going back for dinner on our next date night."
3,"Rented a 25 footer that had electrical difficulties on three occasions over a ten day trip.  Luckily their help desk personnel were fabulous in getting a service technician out to remote national parks to try to fix the problem.  Unfortunately the rig had been improperly serviced before and the problem persisted.  It was disappointing the rig was put on the road but once we got the battery problem solved our experience was quite good.  I would rent again but would try to get a newer vehicle (ours had 98,000 miles) and try to verify the condition."
3,"We went to Fairview Grill for dinner and drinks one night. We expected an evening of pub food, draft beer, and an unpretentious atmosphere, and that's exactly what we got.  \n\nWe had a coupon for a free entree, so to us the prices were VERY reasonable.  Generally entrees (mostly sandwiches and burgers) are about $8, which is an excellent value considering the quantity of food you get. We both had burgers, and we were both very pleased. My husband had fries, which he enjoyed, and I got onion rings (of course), and they were above average. The waitress got our order correct (even the \""hold the X, extra Y\"" order we placed) without writing it down.  She was very attentive, and kept the beer and water flowing.  \n\nThe atmosphere is one of a relaxed pub--everyone was very friendly there too, including two guys who waved at us upon entering and asked how we were doing.  \n\nBecause we are right down the street from Fairview Grill, we will definitely be returning.  Might even shoot a game or two of pool. I don't know if it stands out among pubs in town, but it was an enjoyable evening overall."
3,"The hotel and hotel staff are great. I like staying at Hiltons and as far as a place to stay, this is good. The location isn't the best since you have to take a cab anywhere you are going, but the room and the building are nice.\n\nIf you can avoid having to sit through a timeshare sales presentation, I would do so. The discounted stay at the hotel was definitely not worth the bad taste the 2 1/2 hour sales gauntlet of despair left in my mouth.\n\nSo if you are already an \""owner\"" and have \""made a commitment to yourself\"" regarding vacations, then yes, this is a good place to stay.\n\nIf you're like the rest of us and can't stand high pressure sales douchebaggery, I would pass on any deals you might think you are getting for sitting through a sales presentation because it's definitely not worth it. I would gladly go back in time and pay to not have to sit through that thing again."
3,"I like the idea of this place - live music, fun to sit at before you see a comedy show next door. The food was tasty. My only complaint is that the service was ssssslllllooooooowwww. It took over an hour to get our appetizer of chips. They were delicious, but it should not have taken an hour. Other than that, great beer selection on tap. Hopefully the service improves with time."
3,"I expected more...Overall, the food was very good (thus, the three stars), but the experience overall was a big let down.  My entree came before I was finished with my appetizer and the dessert was a disappointment.  I expected impeccable service and a long leisurely dinner.    Instead, I felt rushed and let down.  Not worth the money."
3,"It's a decent paper with great access to their writers. Plus, I really like the location! (They are located directly next to my office, so whenever I need something...I just walk over) \n\nIt also makes a great filler in my fire pit! Lol"
3,"Overall spent a fun evening in this buzzing,pseudo loungy Portuguese.\nThe Pros: nice atmosphere where you can watch the kitchen if you're into that kind of thing. You can rub elbows with a hip very well to do Montreal crowd. The food is very good and the menu extensive.\nCons: this place is quite expensive for what you get and  you can easily spend more than $150 per person if you go with a variety of tapas,mains, dessert drinks and wine.\nLots of sea food and fish items but at nearly $40 a plate it's almost at the ripoff price point. Conclusion if you got money to burn by all means go.  If you don't skip it or beware."
3,"This is my first time to this Hampton Inn location. The set up is typical of other Hampton Inns. But, the staff is friendly and helpful unlike some other locations I have been to. I arrived before 3 PM and the front desk was able to put me into a room right away without fuss. The room is clean.\n\nI went to the Fitness Center in the late afternoon and discover the fitness closet instead. It was mislabeled as a Fitness Center. It was a small space with three pieces of equipment and a few balls. This fitness closet cannot accommodate more than 4 people at at time. So disappointed."
3,"was, okay.\n\nI had the lamb entree, nothing exceptional.  could use more fresh veggie on the plate versus just legumes.\n\nlamb cooked well but was not memorable at all. (no rosemary or other good taste)--was SOO PLAIN as if i was eating british food.\n\nservice:\n\nwaitor was nice\none server came with our dishes and we had to move things on our table to make space.  we are used to services being experienced enough to prep our table or manage the dishes they are carrying."
3,"department stores are always awful spaces to be in, BUT, there IS something that changes a bit during the madness of the holiday rush, like the mania of our commodity/consumer culture reveals itself in a particularly fascinating way... the emphasis on the DISPLAY takes on new urgency and obsession during december. I had kind of a great time just people watching as i tagged along behind my brother who was looking for a necklace for his gf. Call it a sick fascination, but i actually like being in the thick of the spectacle for the holidays... so, even though i bought nothing, i did have kind of a fun 25 minutes skulking around the multi-level store.\n\nI will also add, that this particular Bay has the most enormous and endless perfume section I've even experienced... each of the aisles in the near-infinite procession of stocked smells is equally attended by some charming model-esque figure who is only too eager to spritz some Cher-endorsed stink in your face... hellish yet hypnotic!"
3,"those that know me know i like to have a good time. \n\ni usually do.\n\nwent with a group of around 30, so yeah it was crazy.\n\nfor some strange reason, i just wasnt feeling this place. yeah the usual things youd find at a strip club are here..  cute to a few HOTT ladies walking around preying on drunk folks. random ass femalecustomer getting it on with a group of said ladies.... hella expensive ass drinks......\n\nbut strip clubs are like masturbation.... in the begining it all seems like a great idea, youre all excited and during, youre having a great time..... but after a few minutes after, you realized, damn i just fucked myself.\n \n+1 star for that cute stripper that actually seemed like she was enjoying chatting and took me over to an abandoned area not being used that night just to chat about random ass shit and not to clean me out of all my money."
3,"Bonne nourriture, ambiance et d\u00e9cor.\nPar contre, service tr\u00e8s in\u00e9gal et boiteux.\nProbl\u00e8me \u00e9vident de gestion du service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le. Soyez pr\u00eats \u00e0 attendre tr\u00e8s longtemps."
3,"I was excited to come here last Saturday to see Billy Gardell.  I knew I was going to get royally screwed out of tons of money by this place so I was semi-prepared.\n\n\nPros:\n* Great acts\n* Very intimate setting = every seat is a good seat with a good view of the stage\n* Reasonable ticket prices\n* Parking validation\n* Decent food at reasonable prices for good portions\n* Friendly service that is relatively fast and efficient\n\nCons:\n* They cram you in like sardines\n* Their drink prices are ridiculous and they make you buy two of them\n* If you order food you still have to buy 2 wicked overpriced drinks.  The price of your food does NOT count towards some stupid minimum.\n* They add a mandatory tip % to your bill\n\n\nThe bottom line is that I won't be back to this place until they fix how much they rape you or there is a comic that I really really really want to see.  I realize that they are in biz to make money and are probably raking it in, but they can go fuk themselves for being greedy and making me hate comedy theaters."
3,My friends love this place but I just thought it was okay.  It really depends on the style of pizza you like.  I don't like pizza that is really more bread based than sauce based.  The sauce makes or breaks a pizza for me.  The pizza here doesn't use a lot of sauce or cheese.  If you are a fan of good crust you may love this place but it is not my cup of tea.  I am spoiled since I am from Chicago where there are great pizza places everywhere.  Phoenix has a lot of places people tell me the are really good but I find most of them to be average at best.  It is hard to compare Lou Malnattis or Giordano's in Chicago to anything here.
3,"It's Carowinds. Some good rides. Most surrounded by stuff you won't ride or games you won't waste money on. The kids will have fun, no doubt. The people are nice enough. The group hospitality is very good with great brisket and chicken. They make you feel welcome. Just enjoy it."
3,"Came here as one of the stops for the \""Buffet of Buffets\"" 24 hour pass thing. It's nothing compared to the buffet at the Wynn but I don't think this buffet deserves so many one and two star reviews. Yes, the selection is limited but the food isn't crappy either. The interior is inviting. The line sucks unless you're a diamond/platinum member."
3,"Need a 1/2 star button. 3-1/2 stars here. Tried tamale chx salad and raspberry tea. The chx salad was good (grapes, celery, green onion, almonds) sliced so thin makes not one thing overpowering..tamale was not bad not dry somewhat flavorful...they were out of strawberry honey tea, settled for raspberry-typical... Meal was only $8, not bad..probably won't be back except to try this strawberry-honey tea ppl are yelling about..very friendly and fast"
3,"We arrived too late to be seated and were quickly told as much the second we walked through the door.\n\nBut we were hungry and so very pleased to find out they would let us order take out. \n\nThe food was prepared fast and tasted good. It was my first time eating at this chain so I'm not sure how it normally tastes. I really liked the garlic aioli that came with my pasta. The salad was tasty.\n\nThe manager Adam Wilcox, accommodated some of our party's particular requests.\n\nThey have gluten-free options - make sure you order them specifically even if you are ordering off the gluten-free menu."
3,"I had a great burger here the night--it was a no-frills deal, like something you're mom would've made if she were in a rush. But it was tasty. Coupled with a few beers (and the P-stone has a TON), it was a great little meal. \n\nThe P-stone's a cool little place, although it doesn't look like much from the street. In fact, it really doesn't look like anything at all, really. Groovy, mellow crowd hangs here, so it's not a real rowdy scene if that's what you're looking for. Very familiar feel--like a mom and pop deal, if that makes sense. It seems like a cook place to hang out with a bunch of friends on a random, quiet night."
3,"Came here a little while back to see Fu Manchu - the stoner rock band, that is, not the movie. This little dive on the southeast corner of Hayden and Roosevelt in a little strip mall used to be called Chaser's. Saw a few local bands there a few times back in the day - Zen Lunatics, One Foot In The Grave. One Foot In The Grave was sort of a Sun City novelty punk band about 2 decades ago when all members being over 50 was actually a novelty. Now that most punk bands from the first wave or even the hardcore years are all past 50 that novelty has long worn off. :) So the bar pretty much looks the same as it did during the Chaser's years and place had a good sized crowd - you had to squeeze your way through to get from point A to point B. Men's bathroom didn't even have a door but at least it had working toilets - no peeing in coffee cans here. Had one gin and tonic - tasted a little watery so I didn't get any more. Headliners were super loud. Like holy crap I forgot my earplugs loud. Like stop by the bookstore tomorrow and get the Sign Language For Dummies LOUD! It's ok for shows but I wouldn't come here again unless I  REALLY REALLY want to see whatever band is playing here."
3,"Best way to describe this place- you get what you pay for. It wasn't a super classy or fancy joint, but it was a decent, cheap place to crash.  Can't complain too much about it.  The service was good, my room and bathroom were clean, and there was shuttling to and from the strip (if you don't mind walking a bit of distance... it only goes to the mall on the Stratosphere end of the strip) and to and from the airport. All my needs were met, thus I was content. Overall, decent hotel at a very good price (especially for such an expensive place like Vegas)."
3,friendly folks and unusual items. I've always found the quality good and the produce fress. I like the dried fruit and nut selection too.
3,"Positives:  muddled cocktail is sublime.  Service was friendly and attentive.  A variety of menu items at different price points.  A great environment & stylish moderndecor.\n\nNegatives:  the food.  It's nothing special.  Lots of highly stylized menu choices, where the title outdoes the reality."
3,We were excited to try Julian Serrano because of their ceviche and array of tapa menus! I ordered the mixed seafood ceviche- it was meh okay.  Nothing special.  Also the steamed the mussels that were pretty good.  The other girls ordered the spare ribs and mushroom risotto - nothing specatuclar :-(
3,"It is alright.\n\nOrdered a chicken pita sandwich. The pita bread itself was good, wished more of the cucumber sauce, and the chicken was thick and enough - to make your money's worth. Just needed something else to give it a 4 or 5.\n\nOf course there are plenty of other options to go to, if not feeling for chicken pita sandwich."
3,"BEWARE. THEY USE LEAN MEAT!!\nhaha, Just sayin', the burger was kinda dry. but definately a pretty good burger and fries. got 2 burgers, and shared a thing of fries. total bill $30. Not bad, wouldn't go back though"
3,Can't beat $2 for a any size latte on Wednesdays.  Small latte?  $2 please.  Medium latte?  $2 please!  Large latte?  $2 please!  You get the idea.  Hint:  I'd go with the large...
3,"Not much to say. Very typical type of spot. Nice look and feel. Decent food. Didnt blow me away, but maybe that is because I didnt try their famous pizza. \n\nI'll update the next time I am out there, but that is only if I actually feel like going back. I recommend it more as a spot to fit a bunch of friends who want to grab some cold ones and some grub while watching the games."
3,"While I don't agree with those that say it's the best fried chicken in the world, I do agree that it's a great local find in Charlotte with really good fried food. It fits perfectly well into the Southend scene and offers locals and out-of-towners an equally god experience. The place is packed by 11am and does not slow down until it closes or the food runs out for the day. They only take cash, so make sure you check the wallet before hand and don't be scared off by the people standing around the sidewalk as it's normal. You'll order quick, get your food quick and be expected to leave quick so the next person in line can get their order on. They have fried chicken and fish...for me, chicken all day long. Add some hush puppies and slaw and it's a good day. Go see for yourself!"
3,"I didn't get anything to get here because I was recovering from food poisoning. But my BF got the spicy pork tacos and he said they were the best tacos he's ever had. This place is authentic and the long lines and people show that it is really good. He gives 5 stars for that.\n\nHowever, one has to ask whether it's worth the 50+ minute wait. The lines bring down the rating from 5 stars to 3 stars. The queuing system was really confusing. As others have mentioned, there are separate lines for everything. There are six lines, two sets of three lines. The three lines are for pork (abodaba), offal (brains, tongue, stomach, tripe, intestines, etc), and beef (asada, etc). The line didn't actually look that long so it was ridiculous how it took so long. \n\nAs we got closer, we found out why. It's because there was one guy doing the job of two people. He makes the tacos really fast but he would have to make like at least 5 for each customer. Also, he made like 50+ tacos while we were in line that looked like it was for to-go orders (paper plates wrapped in foil). So the amount of time per person and the amount of extra work the taco maker is doing for people not in line contributes to long wait times. It feels like there has to be a better way for them to do this!"
3,"Gorgeous casino, d\u00e9cor scheme seems to be taken from the Bellagio gardens- good mix of stores, restaurants, and gaming. Really appreciate how spacious this casino is, lots of space to walk around without cramming slot machines into every available nook.\n\nService is typically very top notch, and restaurants on site are known for being able to accommodate any dietary restriction and have several vegan, vegetarian, and vegetable-laden options at each.\n\nParking garage is smaller than most but easily accessible, casino itself is on the smaller side but more intimate and upscale rather than crowded and gaudy."
3,"Had the popcorn with bacon for an appetizer - it was ok, but nothing great. We split the chicken and waffles - not bad, but not maybe I'm just not a fan of chicken & waffles in general (don't hate me). But - we also ordered the short rib, which was quite delicious! It came with some greens that were quite un-delicious and we didn't take more than 1 bite of them. \n\nIf you try it, get there early otherwise it gets VERY loud inside and you'll be yelling across the table to have a conversation."
3,"This place was pretty nice (not super fancy but decorated nicely) but the food was average.  We came here bc someone had \""the best\"" beef noodle soup here over a year ago and loved it.  Unfortunately, they did not like it this time, stating it was somewhat flavorless.  Food here is definitely overpriced, as I learned many restaurants in the nice casinos are, but we were comped so I can't complain about price.  However, had I had to pay for this meal, I would not have been happy.  I got the Hainan Chicken Rice, which was really dry.  Usually, the rice is simmered in broth, but the rice was pretty dry - chicken, too.  We also got the Beef Chow fun, which wasn't bad but not excellent either.  The best part of my meal was the Iced Coffee (which I think they charge $6 for).  Everyone also liked the Fried Shrimp Balls, which came on a dim sum cart.  I was excited to see Soupy Dumplings on the cart, but alas, they were only moist and not very soupy at all.  Most items were mediocre and I most likely will not eating here again."
3,I recently had a quick bite to eat at this location.  My usual......Bean Burrito and 7 Layer Burrito.\n\nOrder was accurate.\n\nPlace was clean.\n\nFood was ok.\n\nIt's Taco Bell....not much to say.\n\nWill I return?  Sure.
3,"I was here on valentine's day so we had the pre-fixed menu. Meal was overpriced because it was valentine's day. Nothing was really good. Maybe that's because they have to do things in bulk. The portions were small, but I didn't finish anything because it wasn't tasty.  We were still hungry afterwords. Still, we sat right by the window and the view was incredible!"
3,It's an airport. You get to Vegas and then you immediately go straight to partying. Even the airport is calling for a party with the slot machines located at the baggage claims. \n\nThis airport moves pretty quick too. They get the job done and fly you to your destination! wohoo!
3,"minus a star for not having an EPL ticket to show all the games. for F###'s sake you are THE english bar in phoenix and I can't watch my beloved gunners unless they are on ch 167?? come on.  \nIf you are going to hang the flags and scarfs at least have the game, when its 7am and i want to get pissed watching arsenal-chelsea in the '5th' biggest city in the US and I cant, well, it doesn't make daddy happy. haha\nall in all not a bad place\ngreat beer selection\nnice decor, simply put, its one of those places where you get some drinks in for 2-3 hours, walk out and say \""holy sh!t, the sun is still out????\"""
3,"Took my Playstation 3 here after it stopped reading discs.  Had to take it back twice, still wasn't fixed.  In all fairness, the problem was beyond the scope of the repair, and they gave me a full refund.  That's superior policy/customer service.\n\nOn the downside, they removed my yet-unplayed copy of GTA 5 and stuck it in a ziplock bag after I offered to leave the case for them to put it in.  Disc looked like someone ate a bucket of chicken and put their hands all over it.  Also, I came back twice to have it re-repaired and each time was like I'd never been there before.  \""Can I help you?\""\n\nI'll consider this experience a wash, as I left with the same broken unit but was not charged for the time invested.  Not certain I'd take anything else there."
3,"I ate at Tutti Santi while in Phoenix for a business conference.  Met up with a co-workers father-in-law who happened to be in town and he suggested Tutti Santi, which he had visited on previous trips.  Had it not been for that recommendation, I don't know that I ever would have found this place.\n\nThey were quite busy that night due to a special promotion and it seemed that they were not quite used to it.  It took quite some time to place our order.  We ordered a bottle of wine for the table and I ordered a salad and gnocchi.  We started sipping the wine while waiting for our appetizers.  The salad was decent and the bread they brought for the table was actually very good.  However, due to the slow service, our wine bottle was empty long before the food came.\n\nWhen the food arrived, we ordered another bottle of wine and began eating.  The gnocchi was very good, and everyone else seemed to enjoy their order as well. Unfortunately, our second bottle of wine never arrived.  When we mentioned it, the waiter apologized, but that was it.\n\nThis would have been an easy four star review but the sub-par service killed it for me. They may have been busy, but 15 minutes for drinks and 30 minutes for salads is still pushing it."
3,"Table of 4, wait was 20++ minutes late on a Thursday night.   No bar to wait in, plus no alert system (buzzer or whatever) so we couldn't wander around the casino.   Once we were seated, the food was great.....  Just burgers but lots of toppings, etc.   Nothing bad nor was it overly memorable.  Very sufficient for a bite in Harrahs!"
3,"I am not too picky about movie theaters. We usually go to the theater with the show times we like best. They all could use a more frequent deep cleaning, and this one is no different.\n\nIt bothers me, though, when people think it is the movie theater's job to clean up after them, so they leave their trash in the aisle and on the seats. You bought it, you own it, you dispose of it up. Didn't your mom teach you to clean up after yourself?"
3,"Applebee's is usually good for reasonably priced, decent tasting food. My experience at this particular Applebee's wasn't horrible but also wasn't anything that would make me want to go back. \n\nOur party of three was seated quickly but service got fairly slow after that. Our waitress brought out wrong type of beer for one of the people with me, took a while to bring out the correct one and then took ages to bring extra napkins.\n\nI had a lunch special that included half of a sandwich and a small salad. I had the shrimp and spinach salad which was excellent. The sandwich I went with was the California turkey club. The lettuce tasted sour, I had to pick it all off... And the bread was greasier then I would have preferred.\n\nThe sangria was damn tasty but could have used more fruit."
3,"Been here once. It's small, lots of shops. Live music. The praying mantis lights fire around 9pm. I personally didn't like it. It's very much for families. I felt awkward. So my date and I found other things to do. Wasn't my thing, might try it again one day. But not anytime soon."
3,Way too over priced. I mean its great food. With an average sized portion. But for how much I'm paying?... Not totally worth it!
3,"Here's the thing, I really do want to like this place.  It's close to home, the cupcakes always look yummy, and it smells so good.  I've been here a couple of times and they have the most creative flavors that I've seen.  Pink Lemonade, Chocolate Covered Banana, & Peanut Butter and Honey who'd think of that?!\n\nWith these rave reviews, perhaps I just went during the wrong times.  The cake was moist and delicious.  But the frosting is what killed it for me and the hubby.  It was too rich and heavy, even for him and he's the one who could probably finish off a pan of brownies on his own, in one sitting.  He had to scrape off the frosting halfway through because it was too much for him.\n\nI'm not giving up!  I probably will go back because of my cupcake weakness (we even had cupcakes at our wedding) because I so badly want to like them!"
3,I don't see what the big deal is.  Everyone told me that this is the best Buffett.  I don't think. I haven't been to any others but I dint think that this Buffett is the best. The breakfast is way better than dinner. and the basically have the same stuff for breakfast as dinner too! lol
3,"I will start by saying this, the midnight Diner is probably one of the better staple restaurants in Charlotte. However my experience tonight did not reflect that. After being sat and refused to change my order by our server, Ashley - we then received beyond mediocre service.  Feeling somewhat stereotyped into the mold of \""black people don't tip\"". Luckily a server by the name of Larry a.k.a \""Showtime\"" managed to salvage what remained of an otherwise horrible experience. He definitely exempified the prototype of what anyone would call excellent service. Needless to say our server received no tip. Hopefully she learns something from her peers. Definitely will be back...and requesting \""Showtime\"" as our server for the duration of his tenure there."
3,I always know I'm in Vegas when I come here and spend 20 bucks on a subway 5 dollar footlong lmao! Seriously how is it even legal for subway to rip you off like that haha. \n\nSlots of fun is like a 20 ton boulder going down hill....once it gets going...unstoppable. I don't even gamble here. When I stay at riviera I usually just come over to slots of fun to grab a nathans hot dog or some Over priced subway sandwiches. That being said there is something I like about the place. Just really old school vegas. Vegas actually needs more places like this. Hate to say it but I will be back lol
3,"Being from Chicago/San Diego my husband and I are in for a shock here in the Carolinas, this was our first dining experience. I don't know how we ended up here with the plastic coated checkered table cloths and lack of ambience, but we stayed and ate. \n\nI was looking on the menut for the typical California wrap donned with bean sprouts and avocados; instead I found southern fried chicken, skillet fried chicken, veggie lasagna, meatloaf, coleslaw, fried okra, collard greens... and of course BBQ. \nMy question to you is WHAT ON EARTH IS BBQ? Is it a sauce? Pork? Beef? Chicken? No clue... \nAnyways we ordered from their extensive menu ( the variety of \""veggies\"" is outrageous, but mostly fried). \n\n***Note to North Carolina: Food does taste good without having to be breaded and dropped in piping hot fatty lard. \n\nThe food ended up being good and large portions and the waitress was \""sweet as piiiie\"" with her \""yes maam's\"" and polite service. \nOverall, I am hoping to find a restaurant with more of a variety than sandwiches, southern home cooking and the most unhealthy vegetables I've ever seen."
3,"Good location for a decent bite to eat before the game. Gets busy, but the food and service is good. Little on the pricy side."
3,"This place is ok for a vietnamese restaurant. First impression walking in- this place smells of cigars! Later I realized it's the smell of the cigar bar next door. \n\nService was rather quick. The man who attended to us seemed to be the owner, he was approachable and would give recommendations if you ask. \n\nOur food was out pretty fast. I ordered the beef pho with eye round steak and beef balls while the bf got his usual chicken pho. We also got the vietnamese iced coffee. \n\nI love the broth! It was not as greasy as some of the other vietnamese places I've been to, and you can actually taste the herbs. The rice noodles was meh, it was a little too starchy for me, for some reason. The eye round steak was a little overdone. Iced coffee was a tad too sweet, there's a little too much of the condensed milk. \n\nOverall, a decent experience. I'll probably come back again. \n\nSide note: if you like spicy food, ask for the ot satay sauce. it's basically Thai chillies fried with garlic paste and it is SPICY- a much better alternative to siracha, in my opinion."
3,"This place... how could one not love it?! The drinks are amazing and the price is just right!! I personally recommend the \""G Spot\"" or a martini. The food is excellent here as well. I usually get the Fez burger. I am not sure what all is on it, but I can tell you that it tastes amazing!! So why the 3 stars?... Unfortunately I woke up later that night very ill. Since this place was not the only food I had all day, I can't say for sure that I got sick from here. However, I'm hesitant to visit again now."
3,"Evidently there's a zagat survey list on the best chain restaurant steak.  Which I find preposterous.  Would they have a list judging the best movie about grass growing?  \""In the end, Crabgrass beat out Ragweed just because of the potential allergens.\""\n\nNo, because sometimes you can make an entire category of things that suck, and chain restaurants, as a general rule, serve shitty steak. Not that I'm judging.\n\nSo if you go to Outback, don't expect anything amazing, despite the fact that zagat said they were tasty.  But outback is worth visiting anyway, because have you ever had their shrimp appetizer served on their brown bread garlic slab-thing?  The bread is better than the shrimp.  It's amazing.\n\nBut truly legendary status is only accorded thusly: imagine an appetizer with so many calories that three could share and still crack a thousand calories each?  Enter the cheese fries with bacon and a glob of ranch and you will know what spoonfuls of lard feel like to your arteries.  This particular location has a number of great bartenders and if you go there looking for a pleasant time and decent food, you'll be satisfied.  Chicken breast with BBQ sauce: palatable.  Broccoli with crab-butter sauce?  Tasty.  Rack of lamb? Surprisingly good.  Really there are a ton of options here but one thing you will not get is world-beating steak.  So save it, Zagat."
3,"Great ambience! This bar was a great place to grab a drink & people watch or just hang with great company. I really enjoyed the lounge style decor & the drinks here are pretty decent for a casino bar.\n\nI, of course, ordered a vodka grey goose with tonic and was surprised that 75% of it was alcohol. My friend ordered a rum & diet coke and again the drink had a good amount of rum. :-) I'm not quite sure on pricing but seemed decent.\n\nThe waitresses are dressed in cute lacy mini dresses and are very pleasant. Overall, for a hotel lobby bar this is a good spot."
3,"Overhyped. Capriotti's has some good sandwiches and some that just don't connect.\n\nMy favorite sandwich here is the Capastrami, greasy pastrami grilled with melted Swiss, generously topped with creamy cole slaw and Russian dressing. Reubenesque and held together well by the bread.\n\nUnfortunately, that same bread is the reason why Capriotti's cheesesteaks and Italian subs don't work. The rolls on which its subs are served are hard and dense, which means they don't absorb the favors and moisture of the rest of the sandwich.\n\nThe cheesesteaks also suffer from meat that's grisly, dry and flavorless. Bland would be a word for it.\n\nThe Bobbie isn't my thing - I think mayo is gross, and without it the Bobbie sandwich gets unbearably dry. That being said, the store roasted turkey goes great on cold subs with provolone and hot peppers.\n\nJersey Mike's is better for cold subs and Pop's is the place to go in Vegas for cheesesteaks."
3,Good but not sure it's worth all the hype.  Went there with a fairly large group of friends and had to wait a pretty long time to be seated.  It's a small place and right now very trendy so be prepared to wait.\n\nI found their red velvet pancakes a but too sweet and definitely overrated.  I love red velvet but when you add in the chocolate chips and their icing it was just too sweet.  It was better without all the other stuff but then slightly dry.\n\nLiked their buttermilk pancakes more.  Nice and moist and delicious with the butter and syrup.\n\nBelieve I also got corned beef hash - it was very good but the potatoes with it were meh.
3,"My review is mainly for the Casino (As I was staying next door at the Palazzo).  I really wanted to like this place and went in with high expectations. The place itself was crowded with mainly foreigners taking pictures everywhere and walking super slow. I found one slot game that I liked, but could not play long because the guy next to me had his entire family sit on the other machines and they were not playing. Really wanted to get into the table games but just too many people out and about to get by. I will stop in again next time because I did have a good feeling."
3,"I've been here 3 times.  Twice thru the drive thru and the last time I dined in.  So glad I did.  One of the cooks (stawky white guy) wasn't wearing gloves.  Then he went to the restroom and bumped my chair and elbow in passing without a word. I went to use the bathroom and guess what, no paper towels.  So I used the blower which made a lot of noise.  That told me the cook failed to wash his hands.  When I walked out of the bathroom,  he had a hand full of bacon.  My friend had the bacon burger lol.  Oh,  did I mention that when he bent over all you saw was crack.  I'll go back but only if he's not there. The burgers and fries are great."
3,"I had heard about the Pink's in So Cal and I had always wanted to try it. When I saw there was one in Vegas, I was excited to check it out. I was disappointed, to say the least. I ordered the mushroom swiss dog, which costed me $6.50. The hot dog tasted rubbery to me and there wasn't nearly enough swiss cheese on it. The moments where I got swiss cheese, mushrooms, and hot dog were really good but there weren't very many of them. They put way too many mushrooms and not enough cheese. If it had been better proportioned I may have enjoyed it more. I would probably still eat here again, but try something different next time. I heard the chili cheese dog is to die for."
3,"Any pub on Rose St immediately has to compete with swathes of competitive drinking holes. As a result the Auld Hundred seems like another humdrum offering with nothing of particular attraction here. Then again, that may be exactly what the clientele like: a reliable and no frills establishment.\n\nYou'll find typically generous pub size portions with regards to food and a modest selection of ales, A- OK."
3,"I stayed here for a bachelor party.  I've been here numerous times.  I love the location as it is within walking distance to all the hotels I like hanging at.  I like the fact that they gave me a fat discount because of a collective of my friends player points.  It isn't the newest hotel, but the rooms are clean and the staff were good.  I enjoyed their sportsbook.  Unfortunately, I was unable to do any dining over there nor have I ever dined over there.  That's a shame.  I would stay there again just for the price, but there are far superior hotels in Las Vegas."
3,The staff is attentive and helpful. We brought our kids one night to get dinner. Our food was predictably bar food- fried and heavy but not bad. We visited on a week night and they had a musician playing. We literally could not talk at our table. It was so incredibly loud we couldn't even hear each other. I am giving 3 stars only because of service. \nI would give 2 stars for the ambiance and because I wouldn't go here for date night or with my kids for dinner. It would be great just to watch a game or to go with someone you don't want to talk to.
3,"I'll cut to the chase.  The food is okay.  If you are in the area, and you want a quick bite, hit this place up.  If you have a hankering for some good Chinese food, I'd suggest you drive down to Spring Mountain, or better yet, California (the state, not the hotel).\n\nHaving just come back from LA, where I had some mind blowingly good Chinese, I was let down here.  I would put this restaurant in the same taste category as Panda Express.  It's tasty for what it is, but it's not really Chinese food."
3,"I hadn't had Papa John's for at least a year.  It's one of the better chain pizza places, and unlike the Domino's that moved, it's conveniently on my way home from work.  I got a $10 gift card for $5 from www.saveology.com and they had their large specialty pizzas for $11.  The large is only 14\"" which isn't really large, but the Spinach Alfredo pizza is pretty tasty.  I was disappointed they no longer put the butter sauce and pepporncini in the pizza box, but I understand it.  The service was a little slow as they have two registers but only one person working on one of them with a lot of people standing around.  I'd stop here for a pizza on my way home again if the price was right."
3,"I recently watched this show for the second time since I saw it once w/o my husband and he really wanted to see it. The show is definitely different from your typical cirque du soleil shows. This one is more focused on Asian themed/ sword fighting/acrobatics. Most cirque du soleil show is like watching a dream with really no plot just different acts of crazy \""sitting on the edge of chair\"" acrobatics. But KA actually has a storyline and nothing was really scary cause they used wires.\n\nThe language they use and some characters (ie the Tarzan-ish guy) is just hard to take in. Even watching it the second time, it's not my kind of cirque du soleil, so I'm glad for both times I was able to get the tickets for a cheap price.\n\nThe only thing I really like about the show is the big platform that can go vertical and move around. The last scene with the fighting on the vertical wall was my favorite, but the other parts didn't catch my attention like the other shows do."
3,"C'est un caf\u00e9 correct pour travailler et pour se prendre un lunch quand on a oubli\u00e9 le sien \u00e0 la maison. Je suis all\u00e9e \u00e0 l'heure du lunch et \u00e7a n'\u00e9tais pas trop occup\u00e9, donc la combinaison de wifi gratuit et grandes tables pour travailler \u00e9tait exactement ce que je cherchais. Ils ont un bonne vari\u00e9t\u00e9 de plats et le service est bien correct. J'ai pris deux salades : une aux l\u00e9gumes et moutarde dijon, puis l'autre l\u00e9gumes et p\u00e2tes \u00e0 l'orientale, ou bien plut\u00f4t simplement \u00e0 la sauce soya. Les deux \u00e9taient super bonne et j'ai bien aim\u00e9 avoir l'option d'un lunch sans trop de pain. Ils ont aussi des plats chauds et des plats du jour qui ont l'air de changer r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement. Somme toute, c'est un endroit qui m\u00e9lange le style caf\u00e9t\u00e9ria avec le style caf\u00e9 sans fla fla. C'est argent comptant, mais il y a un ATM au caf\u00e9 m\u00eame."
3,"Went here for dinner on Friday night... We had 8 dudes, but even though we had a reservation and it was late (9:45)... we had to wait a bit and they sat us outside...in the 100 degree heat.  The heat wasn't a big deal, but we kind of missed out on the whole decor and atmosphere of the inside.  The kobe meatball was very good.  I just got an 8 ounce filet.  It was good... but it doesn't even come w/ a potato or anything... but the side of asparagus i got was heaping and tasty.  The filet was good though... cooked to my specifications and seasoned nicely... most other people got pasta dishes... do'nt know what they thought, but most looked pretty normal.  Service was good.  They got everything right.  Not super pricey, but pricey.  But overall I was underwhelmed... I just had the feeling that I would rather pay more to eat better or pay less to eat junky.  No real complaints... but I wasn't wowed by anything."
3,"Tried their 2 for $5 fish sandwiches and their $1.89 side salad.  The fish sandwich had too much bread for my liking and the fish was just okay.  The salad was iceberg and not worth me getting again.  The service was excellent and the lady manager is doing a great job,  The place is nicely decorate but I didn't think the food was worth me coming back for,"
3,"Great food and great WINE. Awesome pasta, the description matched exactly what I got. When I asked the waiter to describe the wine I wanted to order, he described it to a T. What was just supposed to be a small appetizer and a drink turned into a meal. Very elegant, very nice, VERY GOOD!"
3,Paid for a venti green tea lemonade and got a tall green tea lemonade . Reason why I didn't go back was because I had to go to school was in a rush I wish the girls that always take my orders were there
3,Best donuts in South Phoenix. It is the one thing that makes working over there totally worth it. The maple bar is fantastic.
3,"I have to admit, the only thing that makes this place good is their interesting looking bread, which is unique in appearance and texture and is delicious. Other than that, the sandwiches are pretty plain and expensive for what you get ($5-6 for a small sandwich). \n\nThe service here is pretty lackluster, since there are only a couple people working at any given time. When I've been here, I've found the cashier to be a little impatient when customers are trying to figure out what to order, so now I tend to just hit the drive thru. \n\nThe building is super old and parking is tight since there aren't very many spots out front. There's another small parking area in the back but it's not much larger. I usually get the small original, which is good, but like I said...only because the bread is unique, fresh and tasty. If they used baugettes or \""normal\"" sub bread for their sandwiches, I don't think I would eat here."
3,"The short: Get the \""white cookie\"" fresh from the oven, at the front cafe for $5. OMG. OMG. \n\nThe long: inside at the restaurant: long waits, water refills - had to ask each time. \""Sunday pasta\"" did a number on my tummy! :-(. Best thing on the menu - the $5 white cookies in front cafe, fresh out of the oven. Wish i spent my groupon on just those cookies. Forget the entrees, they're nothing special - typical ingredients prepared en masse so they can be thrown together and then onto your plate. That's how it tastes. And you'll pay a premium to find out I'm right."
3,"Delicious food, but I must've been missing something about this place. It was okay, and I didn't mind the noise coming from being in the middle of the casino. We were seated promptly despite not having a reservation during the lunch hour. The menu is small (one page worth of food) but varied. I ended up getting the prime steak panini and potato salad. Great mix of flavors with the panini and barbeque sauce dip (with a hint of horseradish). The potato salad was probably one of the best I've had...it wasn't too sour and had just enough mayonnaise to keep it rich. \n\nUnfortunately what brought this rating down for me was the service. Slow service. It took a while to get our check, and even longer to get back my credit card. I think I only saw the server once after my food came."
3,beet salad was fantastic. service was new and they spilled water over my table while I was eating. the short rib loco moco was too salty for my taste.
3,"3.5 stars. \n\nWent with a group of friends this weekend for the open bar mostly. Guys got in for 20, which isn't that bad. Bouncers were a little rude for cover, not cool. \n\nTAO is really nice, appearance wise. Walking though the restaurant before going to the club did make me hungry. what a tease. \n\nWent early enough where there wasn't any issues of space. Our main goal here was drink, so we didn't get to explore the other dance floors, but that's okay, maybe next time. While most of the drink were aight, they made some pretty bad basic well drinks, and the wait to get a drink was long. Like come on, messing up a rum and coke? and waiting as much as I was dancing wasn't too hot either. But hey, was feeling really good after we left, so I'm not complaining too much, The music wasn't that bad too. Too bad we didn't know that dash berlin was playing that night. Well, bad that we didn't get to hear him play. good because we left before it got ridiculously packed. We were ale to dance with a great amount of space. and trust, with a group of dancers, we need our space. \n\nOverall, not a bad time at TAO. Guess I need another trip to really go exploring."
3,"I came here with high hopes after reading the many good reviews.  what I found was good local hole in the wall that is somewhat over rated.\nmy burger was very dry - as the cook pressed down on the patties I kept screaming in my head PLEASE STOP!\nThe fries were very meh.  They were crunchy but had no character.\nThe best thing was that the ingredients were fresh.  While the patties were preformed they were not frozen.  They used plent of bacon so there was a piece in every bite.  The lettuce was green and crisp and overall it was a decent lunch, but over priced for what I got.  I probably won't make another trip back but if I lived nearby I would return rather than hit a fast food burger."
3,Good place to go and eat gyros if your up in North Scottsdale. The staff is friendly and the food gets to you real fast. The price is somewhere between 7-10 per meal but that's usual for N. Scottsdale.
3,"Maybe I've had better Chinese in the past than I realized, or perhaps I ordered the wrong things, but I can't see giving this place five stars. The egg rolls were too salty, the hot and sour soup was lacking in sour, the vegetable pork was bland.\n\nIt's quick, not over priced and not over cooked. I'm willing to try it again."
3,"Grampa's Pizzeria - aptly named.\n\nNo one makes pizza quite like Grampa. It's delicious! He uses quality ingredients and bomb flavor combinations. Seriously, I love Grampa and I love his pizza.\n\nHowever, my last visit to Grampa's made me wonder if he's maybe going senile. Walking in, we got a friendly, though confused look from the host that said, \""who are you and why are you here?\"" That should probably have tipped me off that something was amiss. When we got an appetizer, it came out cold - I asked, \""Did you maybe forget to cook this pork?\"" They poked it, shrugged, and put it back in the oven. Then finally, something happened with the pizza. I don't actually know what happened, our server just came out saying that it was going to be a while before we got to eat. But hey, Grampa is nothing if not generous! We got a free beer for all the confusion.\n\nIt's probably for the best that there were only 3 other couples in the restaurant. A busy Monday would have just gotten Grampa all flustered."
3,"It's been a while since I've had my eyes checked, and even when I did, it was probably either to get my drivers license or just to look in a little machine and tell them what I saw.  I don't know if I've ever had a full-blown eye exam.  That's no longer the case.\n\nSince Denise has been jumping through hoops to have her eyes checked, it meant I needed to have mine done too, so I signed up so that they could see what's happening.\n\nThe Christenbury Eye Center is very professional, and they have quite the setup - you check in, and they shuffle you from room to room, where they (presumably) do all sorts of things to determine if your eyes are working or not.  Maybe they just pretend.  I don't really know.\n\nThey seem to know what they are talking about, and they have lots of famous people on the walls who say they know what they are doing, so that must make them experts, right?\n\nYou can also get laser eye surgery here, but after giving me drops to dilate my eyes (which screwed up my eyesight for the better part of the day - go figure), they told me that my eyes were just fine.  Hopefully I don't have to go back for a while."
3,"Went here last night for the first time last night... Took forever to get in, then another customer decided to get into a fight with us because they didn't want us parked next to them, it was hard to hear parts of our movie because we could hear the movie that was playing next to us, and the helicopters flying around were really distracting. BUT the prices were VERY reasonable for admissions and if you wanted condensations (plus we had coupons)"
3,"I imagine at least a solid 60% of people who are trying to catch morning or afternoon flights out of here are hung over. \n\nWho thought it was a good idea to make this the loudest, brightest airport in the country?"
3,Great menu options. Service was hit & miss. Atmosphere lacked a little bit of energy. Food was good. Grits & Pork Belly was my favorite . Quality of food was even better. Pricey for BBQ. Once management figures it out will be a great place.
3,"Stopped in for a slice with my son, large slice of pizza, generous toppings, a tad on the greasy side, but most likely due to the pepperoni.  all in all, thought it was good.  Food came out quickly, will stop in an try something else next time... Oh yea, no fountain drinks..... For me a negative"
3,"This review is about the dining experience- all I can say is, the meatball is so good that it pretty much made up for the completely distant, inattentive service that I received at dinner last Saturday.\n\nWhat also helped was the perfect weather on the terrace over-looking the Strip.  So fun!\n\n(I have eaten inside of the restaurant before, but it wasn't nearly as interesting.)"
3,"I had some drinks & pizza here on 6/28/12.\n\nI was here on a Thursday, and this place was PACKED & INSANE!  It was pretty much elbow-room only.  Not much privacy, and the atmosphere was very loud.  \n\nThe service was excellent, but the food was VERY expensive for what you are getting.  Thin-crust pizza was tasty, but very well-done & crispy/crunchy.  Some may like it this well-done, and some may not.\n\nThe bathrooms are VERY small (single person - Lock door behind you).  This absolutely DOES NOT go with the capacity at which the restaurant was at.  Expect a wait if you have to pee.\n\nI may or may not come back."
3,"Not that I know what good or real Korean is...but I am a fan of any good asian-type cuisine. \n\nSimple decor and we were attended to quickly (I think we were the second table). The table ordered the Korean BBQ ribs and I got the dolsot (I think). The meat was greasy, fatty with very light sweet sauce - just the way it's supposed to be. The dolsot came served in a huge stone smoking hot bowl. You have to stir it with your spoon to get all the rice, veggies and meat mixed up and a little crispy hot. Not  a lot of flavor but an interesting option for something new.\n\nThe sides were good though maybe uninspired. Who knew that Koreans ate appleas and mayonnaise just like I did in the midwest! It was a good sweetness to counter the spicy kim-chee!\n\nA good option in downtown Chandler when you want to eat outside the box."
3,"Service is great here, but I was disappointed in the fuku burger.  The patty itself and everything about the burger was slightly above average at best. I was expecting something more for the price tag on the burger...more along the lines of STOUT, but it didn't deliver.  Even the togarashi french fries were average.  \n\nIt is in a cool food court hang out spot."
3,"Well the service was five stars. The bread with the olive paste really good. Ehhhh I think that is where it stops. The calamari was bland and too salty the sauce was spicy and decent. I ordered the pesto gnocchi it was mediocre like chef boyardi with green sauce. My partner had the steak and it just had way too too much pepper and the Alfredo sauce for the pasta well let's just say it made Olive Garden look like Ruth Chris steakhouse. The dessert was good. So dessert and bread yes, but food heck no. The portions were also very large just wished I likes my food."
3,"Went there yesterday to watch a postseason game with other Yelpers.  As far as watching TVs went, there wasn't a bad seat in the house.  For those that hate smoke there is a non smoking entrance in the back to the bar side but if you want to play pool or use the Men's room you still have to run the gauntlet of the smoking patio.  Speaking of the Men's room, I have seen worse but this one wasn't really kept up that well and it could use a mopping as my feet stuck to the floor by the urinal. \n\nThey had plenty of good choices for beer on tap.  I was intending on a burger but table quantities of other stuff arrived.  The nachos were ok.  I don't normally care for hot wings because they are, well, hot.  These were grilled and while they left a slight after burn for me were really quite good.  I also had an onion ring, a potato skin and a cheese stick.  Good solid bar food without being Wow.  Service bounced between really good and \""where did she go?\"".  They were out of stuff like iced tea, some brownies and some of the beers.  As a table we were buying enough drinks that those that mixed in glasses of water were not questioned.\n\nAll in all a good solid neighborhood bar."
3,"OK,\n\nPizza delivered to my hotel.  Check.\nOpened up the box and the pie looked delicious. Check.\nPizza had ingredients as requested. Check.\nPizza cut in squares, like a true Chicago pie. Check\nPizza cut all the way through the dough. EPIC FAIL.\n\nMy oh my.  When you pick up a slice (Chizona's cuts the pie is squares) you want to pick up a slice with all of the ingredients on top of the slice.  Three of us (two who never had a Chicago style thin crust) and not one slice was cut all the way through.  In a hotel room, with no cutlery we tried our best to keep the ingredients on top of each slice, but pulling apart slices, that are not cut, created an awful mess.  We ended up with a bunch of hand pulled empty slices, and trying our best to put the ingredients on each slice.  We gave up.\n\nIf you cant cut a pie, which is so Pizza 101, than you create a crappy experience for your customer.  \n\n3 stars for the fresh ingredients, great sauce, the owner adding some Giardiniera (very fresh and tasty). Minus 2 stars for the mess that was created by the pizza not being cut all the way through.\n\nI had so much higher hope's.\n\nStay hungry my friends..."
3,"I went here many years ago and thinking that it was really impressive.  My latest trip has taken a 5 star review down to 3.  There really is nothing extraordinary about this buffet, other than the fact that it is in the Paris hotel.  The buffet is not really long either!  I remember there being a lot of fishy foods, which I could careless for.  The wait line on a Sunday evening was 1 hour!  It is NOT worth the wait!"
3,"Very representative of the situation my wife and I often find ourselves in: it is hard to find good food on vacation. Lemongrass offers classically mediocre Thai food, plus you will get a 1 hour wait for absolutely no reason. Our meal: fried spring rolls ($10) these were clearly straight out of the freezer, no flavor, soggy vegetables; pho reeked of cinnamon ($15); Singapore Noodles Stir-fried rice vermicelli, BBQ pork, shrimp, onion, bean sprouts, bell pepper, egg, curry powder ($18) this was quite good and very spicy, earning Lemongrass 3 instead of 2 stars.\n\nPoor food, poor service, long wait. Do not make a reservation; I would suggest trying a different restaurant."
3,"I also am surprised that there are not more reviews for Betty Lou. We did the Monona brunch cruise and really liked it.\n\nOverall, the gig is pretty sweet, but I'll admit they have some serious room for improvement.\n\nMajor cons: value for price, selection of seats on the boat, availability of crew/service\n\nMajor pros: taste and amount of food, quality of atmosphere/boat\n\nIt was really disappointing when we got on to be shoved out of the way by a group of young children, who ended up getting seats on the top deck. If you get there early (like we did), start to line up right in front of the wooden dock to the boats, as that's where they board from. It would be much more organized if they called groups onto the boat in the order they were booked.\n\nThe food was AMAZING. So good and perfectly organized into appetizers, main course, and dessert. I loved it!\n\nThe mimosas were tasty, but were weak and it was difficult to get a waitress/bartender as there were only 2 of them tending to the entire boat of 50 people. You are dismissed from your table to go and get food, but we were never dismissed for the first round. Again, it was difficult to get the attention of the crew/waitresses.\n\nThe views were really scenic and the captain does a quick spin at the end so that you can take photos with the Capitol and the Monona Terrace in the background."
3,"As much as I love this place, I really think I'm twenty years too young to be here. I really love the genres played here and I consider myself pretty well versed in the music. I can't figure out if I'm a young person with a taste for real music, or if everyone who likes real music is older than I. \n\nI showed up on a Friday which is the night when Baddness plays. I think it was them because they played stuff from EW&F, Gap Band, Maze, and bunch of others. No blues that night, just funk. The thing I loved about this band it that I would've expected to see them in an early Jarmusch film like Mystery Train. They were a five or six piece band in all red suits with the lead vocalist in an all red, sequened coat. It was quite possibly the most badass thing I've seen on a music stage in Phoenix. A definite A plus for music and style.\n\nAs far as a blues house goes, I don't really know if I'd consider this one. The Rhythm Room seems to be more up my alley and they seem to have to be a real venue for artists passing through. This definitely seems more like a dive bar/lounge for people who like the music. Again, I really want to come back to this place but I think I should wait a few more years because clearly I should've been born twenty years earlier."
3,"I am going to be the party-pooper here and say that my visit was only so-so. My brother and I both ordered here and neither of us finished our meals. Maybe... we just weren't that hungry.\n\nWith that said, maybe I just don't know good (real) Asian food when I have it in my mouth? This could be the case... or my brother and I both got bad batches. After all, we did stumble in about 15 minutes before they were closing (which generally doesn't make the cooks happy).\n\nThe owner however was super nice. Actually, absurdly nice. He had a demeanor that had us both walking out going... \""could that guy be any more calm?\"" Seriously though, I've never met someone so peaceful. \n\nSeeing as how we had never been there the owner also whipped out a little picture book with all the stuff they serve. It was nice for us two un-cultered folks.\n\nWith all this said, would I go again? Not really unless I was right there and someone else wanted to go."
3,"Whenever I past by this restaurant, it always give me this homey feeling to it and thought to myself that one day I'll make some time to go. And I did. When I went there, I was promptly seated planned to be unbiased throughout the whole meal. Service was good.. Unfortunately, their food was just mediocre for the price I've paid. The menu is what I call, \""tourist price\"". (Over priced) Tofu Hut serve similar things there for a less expensive price. If their food was as good as the place looks, I would've give them another star but eh, food was alright."
3,"The food is tasty, but so much MSG!  I'm usually not very sensitive to MSG, but man you can really feel it after you eat here!"
3,"Why the hell does everyone have stuffed animals?!\n\nApparently, they give you a stuffed animal after taking your order so when you're seated, they know what table to deliver the food to. I thought it was a just a nice gesture so I said 'No thanks' to the dirty stuffed animal. Then I wondered why the food never came.\n\nChuy's reminds me of the surf n' turf taco shops by the beach. I like the meat and seafood options and especially the smell of grilled food but the flavor could use a lot more spice. The menu was expansive and offered a lot. Too much to list and I think they even have fried chicken? Weird. \n\nI ordered the Broiled Whitefish Taco Platter ($6) with a side of Shrimp Skewers ($4). The shrimp skewer was awesome, sprinkled some lemon juice on it with some hot sauce and that was a better meal than my taco platter. The fish didn't taste 'fresh\"" and I'm not exactly sure what whitefish is either. The rice and beans were standard. The cabbage salad could use some help. It was chopped cabbage with a vinaigrette. \n\nI was not impressed by Chuy's but I could go there again. It's a safe option, maybe next time I should try their $2 margaritas that they serve all day, every day. Now we're talking!"
3,"OH MY!! I cannot believe I forgot to rate this place.. I went I believe July 3rd around mid-day. It was hot as he** outside and didn't help that half the seating for serendipity is outside on the patio. Needless to say we waited to be seated about 20-25 mins or so. \nThe food was pretty good. Huge portions, for me anyways so I split the sandwich I ordered which was \""The strip steak sandwich\"". Good but I would prefer a better cut of steak... eh anyways moving along it was all good but a little overpriced. \n \nIf weather permitted would have preferred outside seating and dessert but I was too full and it was too hot to try either.. However I did come back the next day and I tried the frozen hot chocolate and the oreo frozen hot chocolate but this time I went to the walk-up, to-go window...super convenient and fast by the way.\n\nBoth were good but oreo one was better. Had a richer taste to it. The plain one was somewhat iced down.. I'm a chocolate lover so.... they also weren't as big as the ones I seen inside. not sure what difference was.. I posted some pics also of the items. \n\nAnyways I will go to the one in New York next and see what the diff is and I will come here again next time I visit Vegas."
3,"Underwear for $1 and bras for $10?!?! Yes, please!*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Disclaimer: Only in the sale section, and only if you can locate your correct size."
3,"They serve the simple \""street\"" style tacos I like. I had one al pastor and one asada. Both tacos were tasty. The al pastor had a nice spice to it. I also had a green tamale that was really gross. All masa and barely any cheese or green chile they said was suppose to come in it. Can't seem to find a spot with good tamales around here. I also got a jamaica to drink and wished I had gotten the horchata that I initially wanted instead. It was watered down and sour without the sweet.  So basically... come here for the tacos... don't bother with anything else. \n\n*Note: I didn't receive this as I ordered take out, but there was a sign that said \""free chips and salsa for dine in customers\""."
3,"I go to Vegas a couple times a year  and I stay at different casinos .  This last time in September I stayed at the Excalibur.  We have stayed here before.  We always enjoy this casino, the rooms are clean and comfortable and the price is reasonable.  This last time we left a tip for the maid who was cleaning our room. She left us a thank you note, which I thought was very thoughtful of her.  It is the first time anyone has written us a thank you note for a tip. Her name was Clementine and she did a wonderful job."
3,"This isn't the greatest costco I have ever been too. I have a few issues with it. The parking can get pretty bad but that is most costcos so I just go with it. \n\nI love costco because of their samples. That is my favorite part and the marketing usually works well on me. I almost always end up buying something I sampled. This costco just has the worst samples I have experienced. The sample service is so slow. They always run out of samples right away and then they start making the next batch. This process is not effiecnt and frustrating. Yes, I know what you are thinking- They are free, why am I complaining? Its because samples are a big part of my costco experience. I have been to other costcos where there samples are running like a well oiled machine and they are passing them out left and right.\n\nAnother problem I have is the car wash. It does a great job washing the outside of my car, but there is nothing to do with my inside. I need vacuums! What car wash does not provide vacuums? \n\nI do enjoy getting beer and wine there. I love the large costco size vodkas and what not. I also recently found out about their discount restaurant cards which are nice. \n\nSo basically, I will continue to go but will scowl when the wait between samples is 10 minutes. Feeed me costco!"
3,"Three stars for taste and unique style pizza. But for a quick lunch, fogettabout it. Slow......Come on guys, your customer base in the industrial area have to be in and out in 20 minutes to get back to work. Here is a clue....SLICES! And while you are at it, a \""slice and a drink\"" lunch special  please. Most pizza joints have this, right? I would enjoy your great pizza more often, if in a reasonably time and price......"
3,"We stumbled across this place and decided to grab a late lunch. We had the hummus and chips, onion rings and fries. All were prepared well and tasted great. The only issue was the service, it was fine when there were a few other tables, but as soon as it thinned out we had to wait for ages for anything. I tried to get anyone's attention, but they seemed to walk away or pretend they didn't hear."
3,"Popped in here for a dinner with friends and having only been here for lunch I had yet to try the BBQ.  I ended up splitting the big boy plate (I forget the actual name) with my girlfriend.  All the BBQ on the plate was delicious although I thought the chicken BBQ was a bit too dry.  That's a hard one to keep from drying out though.  The pulled pork was good and moist.\n\nThe interior is a little dated but I'm doubtful any of the patrons of this place really care.  It's got a pretty cool neighborhood feel.  The service was great and friendly.\n\nBottom line is, there are so many great choices for BBQ in Charlotte, this place is easy to overlook.  It just didn't stand out to me."
3,"On the weird chance that someday I'd get to meet the inventor of the soft serve ice-cream machine, this is how our conversation would go;\n\n\""So..how did the idea of a soft serve machine come to you?\""\n\n\""Well, I was taking my dog Toots for a walk one day when all of a sudden, he decides to shit all over Ed and Dolores Feinsteins front lawn.\nI was horrified. \nEd's an attorney and he warned me about Toots shitting on his front lawn one more time...how he'd come after us both.\nHe did. \nThere Toots is, happily shitting away...a huge creamy brown dump slowly oozing its way out , when Ed comes flying out of the house with a broom.\nToots freaks, and hauls ass without even pinching it off. \nAnd that was my inspiration.\nI thought, if I ever invented an ice-cream machine, I'd want it to cleanly pinch-off, unlike Toots who left a dashed trail across Ed and Dolores's lawn.\nSo I guess we can thank Toots for the idea.\""\n\nMany thanks Toots.\nI used to love frozen yogurt...when someone else was serving it up.\nNow that I have to serve it up,  all I can think about is how this machine was designed by some lunatic who managed to create a replica of his dog, shitting on Ed and Dolores Feinsteins front lawn."
3,"I would probably not visit Galaxy again if I still lived in Vegas. The people who work there are straight up weirdos when it comes to customer service. I went twice in a week, and both times the people working were so clueless as to how to work or, more importantly, work together, that I would not come back. \n\nThe breakfast sandwiches are alright, but they are a bit on the pricey side for the ingredients being from the freezer. It filled me up on the way to LA so I can't complain too much. \n\nThe coffees are alright, but nothing outstanding. Something that I like is that they have almond syrup, which I have a hard time finding, so they get a few extra points there. \n\nStar Wars and other \""nerd\"" decor make for a cool atmosphere, but I wouldn't seek out a business that can't train their staff to work together or efficiently."
3,"Stopped in for lunch.  They have nice specials which include: Miso soup, salad and sashimi with rice.  Staff is very friendly.  Here's the thing: Miso was great. Salad was wilted and with bell peppers?  Never had Asian salad with Bell peppers..chilis yes, but bell peppers? Yuck.  The rice did not come out with my meal.  I had 4 people come over all confused about who was doing what. They had the right heart, but..service was disorganized, but friendly.  When asked if everything was okay..I made the statement about the salad..it was old and wilted and... I wasn't offered a replacement.  When the rice finally got to me it was a HUGH softball size and so dry and nasty and tasteless that  I didn't eat it.  The Tuna sashimi though...was EXCELLENT,  the wasabi was powerful and they serve white ginger, but it was dry.  So...they need improvement--period. It was a $12 lunch plus tip."
3,"We order our food from their carside service.  We found the food to be great, but patience trying to get your food from the carside pickup!!  (over 15 minutes past the time promised and ignored until the manager brought it out!!)"
3,"This place is now \""Las Americas\"" and its Colombian food. It's authentic and the people are nice, but nothing about it really stood out."
3,"You know what I like best about this place?\n\nI love going to places where I am the youngest customer by a considerable margin.\n\nAnd I'm old enough to have spent the first half of my years so far using phones that were attached to walls and stuff. You know, the ones where you had to turn this twisty thing to make a call and you didn't know who was calling you before you answered?\n\nAnyway, the older generation seems to like good deals on veggies and other produce, because they usually have them here. Sometimes you can get in and out without being overcome by the feeling that the zombie apocalypse is upon us, and they are all on walkers.\n\nIn more-or-less typical Basha's practice, some of the items are weirdly overpriced. Stick with the loss-leaders and you might make out ok.\n\nOh, and also: The parking spaces are nice and wide. Wide enough to fully swing open the door of your Buick Park Avenue."
3,"This place was pretty good! My husband and I got a take out order and were very happy with it. That was probably one of the best chili rellenos I've had. I was disappointed with the veggie salad, however, as it was mostly just lettuce. The black beans were pretty spicy and salty, so plan on having something to mix them with like rice or an extra tortilla. I probably wouldn't dine in if I could help it, the dining room isn't very comfy, (free wifi while you wait for your order is nice, though) but I will definitely be getting more take out! \n\nOh, and: a snickerdoodle with every order! A good one, too!"
3,"Never knew how big the place was. Seems like an awesome place for sporting events. I didn't get any drinks, but the specials appear good. It was freaking dead in there, but I want to try and go on a busy night for further review."
3,"Looking around town for Jin's chicken and fish which wasn't in its normal Francis location we found this spot. Fulfilling after bar chicken/fish sandwiches. Would never go here for a meal but it's a perfect after bar spot. I got a chicken sandwich which was basically two chicken fingers drenched in Franks Red Hot, mayo, tiny lettuce piece on a thin hamburger bun. Did the trick for what I wanted."
3,"Some healthy-ish options on the menu. Breakfast till 10.30am would be even better if it was all-day (as I arrived here at 11am.)\n\nI got the chicken beer bread... What is that? Grilled chicken in a wrap and served with fries or salad. Of course I got the fries as I really wanted fish and chips but tried to be good. That was a mistake. The chicken was processed, covered in melted cheese which I picked out as cooled and congealed...(better left on the plate than in my veins.) I tried to enjoy this meal as I picked out the good stuff. Because the wrap was cut up you couldn't pick it up and it was too \""wet\"" to cut. Then I looked around at this decor and noticed the odd combo of a dance music soundtrack. Very odd...something not quite right here. If I had to come again I'd probably go with the fish & chips or a burger."
3,"The ground chicken was the best thing I tried at this restaurant. There was plenty of delicious flavors with each bite. Unfortunately, the boneless chunks of chicken that came with the chicken soltani ($17.99) weren't nearly as good. The beef kabob ($16.99) looked better than it tasted due to a lack of seasoning and its course texture. \n\nOn the plus side, both entrees came with some amazingly fluffy and delicious Basmati rice. Portion sizes were huge, with each entree big enough for two people. At the moderately high prices they charge, it would have been best for us to split one of them. \n\nThe hummus was decent and the yogurt and cucumber dip was too heavy on the dill.\n\nIt's a sit-down restaurant with a large open interior with two lit up trees stationed in the center.  If you want a more casual spot to eat (meaning cheaper) you're probably better off elsewhere."
3,"I can't believe I forgot to write a review for Ceres. I remember every single detail the day I went here for brunch with a group of Yelpers. It was life-changing! From who I sat with, me ending up paying for 2 people, the food, the music...everything. It really helps not getting drunk for brunch!\n\nLocated inside JW Marriott, the parking situation was a bit of a mess. Some jerk almost ran me over...that was my first memory of him. From that moment on I just knew...\n\nBuffet-style brunch was good. There was a waffle station and an omelet station. I stood a long time waiting for my omelet since they gave mine to some old grumpy lady. They have the usual breakfast fare: eggs, hashbrowns, sausages, bacon, Danishes, bread, potatoes, etc. So, for $20+ brunch x 2...this place was just ok."
3,"Ok. \n\nSo this place is NEVER busy! and its open real late.\nSo already I like it because its open late, however the food well the food is alright.\n\nThe meat that they use have too much fat, especially the slices of beef, however for the price its a good deal.\n\nThe service is pretty good, and they pay attention to you, mostly because its never busy, or at least its never been busy when I go there, which is quite late most of the time..\n\nSo if its late, everything is closed, use this as a plan B most definitely. However it is a good plan B"
3,"Kind of did a breeze in and out, I rarely eat at Chipotle, so the one time I did want it there was one right down the street where I was at! It wasn't busy at all inside, I mean it's located at West Gate and there's a ton of eateries around there, depends what you're up for!\n\nBut I was up for Chipotle that day (12/12/14) and the staff was super nice, me with my bad hearing I had to ask the gals to repeat it to me twice - I'm still young! This shouldn't be happening to me! But they were patient haha, the food was good too, a nice warm burrito for a chilly day!\n\nI think I will stop here again, and just ask for a little less red salsa since it ended up being too hot for me!"
3,"I have been here quite a while. Had the best experience all these time untill the last two.. i have always came here during  the day which i may say it was awesome  the staff kept up with everything(food, drinks, refill) always checking  in on us. Each time  we always  hit the  bar after words. Till i went during  the evening place was pack and had a group  of 9. -.- lets start  by saying the server  didn't  show up to often. We all order food at once  so we wouldn't confuse  him. He had a smile  on his face but knew something  was wrong. Only 3 plates  showed  up when good came and when wr ask him where the rest was he replied  by saying he forgot. An average  drink took about 15 min.  And we had to hunt our server down for our  tab. At the end we still think its a awesome  place but will not go at night, it sucks.!"
3,"I will start out with the good - The food.  I had a burger and tots and they were great. I tried my boyfriends catfish Po'boy and it was amazing. The mac and cheese is very good. Onion rings were just okay.\n\nWe went to watch the Pather's game and they turned the sound on. It wasnt very packed and the service was pretty good. \n\nThe bad part - there beer selection needs some help. They only have a few taps but where are all the great local beers?\n\nAlso, a palmeto bug kept flying around us while we were eating. Hard to prevent but still not very fun."
3,"So the rooms are super small and the tiny bathrooms are dingy & outdated. You get what you pay for, right? The rooms are clean and updated with a slightly vintage feel (Elvis & Beatles framed prints on the wall of our room). The shower WAS either freezing or scalding, but this place has been in business forever so it's an old building. I'm not crazy about the $20 resort fee for wifi that doesn't seem to work, especially since there's no pool-what's the resort?! But for the price it's good. \n\nEdit: the Fremont street experience was RIGHT outside our window (past our view of dumpsters) and we weren't there to party so that was kind of a drag, but if you're going to party till the wee hours you won't mind."
3,"Good food, laid back, good beer choices... great place if you're looking for a sit back place to enjoy time with friends or family and want good food but don't need stellar foodie meal. The mix match 6 - pack of beer is good deal if you want something to go and keeps you from making that extra trip to liquor store. Only negative we've had here is the service can be slow. It seems they assign tables in rotation order instead of zones so wait staff is all over the place and can't attend to tables as quickly."
3,"The food was good, but when the bill came there were issues.  I want to start off by saying Luke walked around and introduced himself and made sure everything was OK- which was very nice especially on a Saturday.  The food came out fast, fries where underdone, but sandwiches made up for that.\n\nThe issue...The sandwich board out front said bloody mary's $6 - we were charged $8.  When we questioned the price difference the waiter seemed baffled that we were questioning it.  Being in a hurry, we paid the bill.  We had 6 drinks  paying $12 too much for the bloody Mary's that my group consumed.  If we go back, we will push the issue if it happens again."
3,"I used to not like this place, but I read they changed everything. The Now use these amazing organic cibatta rolls and have removed the High Fructose corn syrup from everything!!! The also are the first restaurant to take it upon themselves to remove trans fat form 100% of everything sold there!. The Royal with light mustard is super good and I usually just switch any of the sandwiches for turkey and ham if I only like the toppings. \n\nIt has totally improved and I come here often now. Oh and I read a review that said you get Soft serve with any meal? Is that true? Why did I not know that?\n\nI would give them an extra star but they have a lesbian that works there that is thinner than me, jk ....but there is"
3,"After having the ice cream cookie sandwich from next door I felt we needed just a little something else.. so I had a 'like it', sweet and tart ice cream, meh.. its their attempt at the tangy tart fro yo which was mediocre at best. They need to focus on their strengths. However the customer service in here was awesome! 3 adorable and friendly guys who were super eager to help! Such a great change from the usual little bitches behind the counter. I'd come back for sure!"
3,"We've only been once so far but the wings and fries were good.\n\nThey have subs (fried fish, Philly or chicken cheesesteaks, cold or hot veggies...), wraps, burger platters, fish plates, chicken plates and more.\n\nI was reallllly happy to find this place. It reminds me of carry outs from back home. I've been in the Charlotte area for seven years now and this is the first time I've found a spot like this one.\n\nIt's in a small-ish corner so keep your eyes open when you go."
3,Just came in for a smog check. It's $19.95 regular price but with the coupon mailer it's $14.95. Can't really complain much about it. Simple service in and out and cheaper than jiffy smog definitely.
3,"This place was so packed when i was here. Like everyone else says the dance floor really isnt big at all. EVERYWHERE, and i mean everywhere possible is reserved for bottle service. Lucky for me im a woman and flirted my way to a grey goose cran and a seat- i feel sorry for the guys!\n\nAdd 2 stars because the line was HUUUGE and we walked straight to the front and into the club."
3,"Lightning fast \""strip-mall\"" style Chinese food.  It's exactly what you expect it to be.  It's a great spot to stop by after work and pick up a quick take-out meal for the family, but I wouldn't expect too much by the way of \""cuisine\"".\n\nHad the beef with broccoli, kung pao chicken, and sweet and sour chicken recently.  All of which were made from picky-eater friendly ingredients, and were a hit with the kids.  I do like the fact that the staff is all Chinese and a few words spoken from the customers in Mandarin seem to go over well.\n\nOverall it's nothing special, but a decent value for a mid-week take home meal."
3,They have a grill for those steaks that u are craving for. Typical ham and roast beef! It was good for the price and for my boys who are at that age they can't stop eating.
3,Decided not to come back because last time I was very disappointed with the super expensive honey toast ( cant remember the name all I know is $12.99) and it wasn't that good but had to come back because we couldnt find anywhere else to play card. At least this place has a better service than tea station tho. Overall is not that bad just a little bit pricey.
3,food was fresh and authentic but way overpriced. owner was nice and so was girl behind counter will I be back maybe but only ordering food once you add in $2 drinks and $3 desserts the bill begins to rack up
3,"Smart and stylish, The West Room has an enticing cocktail menu, but I'm not sure the food was good enough to merit a repeat visit.\n\nOverall, we said: \""the West Room is smart and appealing, but I'm not convinced it's all it could be or wants to be. Their menu doesn't quite compel you towards the dishes it wants to serve you, so could use a little trimming to focus it better. It likes to market itself as the west end's \""hidden gem\"". Certainly, if you stumble upon it on your travels, I think you'll be impressed, but impressed enough for regular repeat visits? I'm not so sure of that, as things stand."
3,"My family from Korea came to visit and on our trip to Vegas, they were desperately craving something familiar.  My plan was to take them to Grand Lux but on the way, my grandma began looking pale.  So, we saw signs for this restaurant and detoured over to Imperial Palace.  Up the elevator we went to the deserted 5th floor dining plaza where we were welcomed by a familiar Korean greeting.  My grandma smiled and immediately announced that she felt better already.  \n\nTheir menu included Korean, Japanese, and Chinese dishes but we opted for solely Korean.  We had the duk mandoo gook (rice cake dumpling soup), dolsot bibimbap (mixture of rice, veggies, fried egg served in a hot stone bowl/pot), soft tofu soup, and bulgogi (marinated meat).  Everything was just whatever but watching my grandma grasp her bowl of rice with both hands and eat like her life depended on it made the meal more enjoyable.  \n\nPretty expensive for mediocre Korean food in Vegas (like $90 total plus tax and tip .. just for lunch!) but the staff was accommodating and friendly.  \n\nI personally wouldn't come back but I appreciated the service and convenience."
3,"We stumbled in off the plane and had a tasty lunch. For 2 people - calamari a la plancha, xato salad, scallops in romesco sauce, white ceviche and raspberry tuna skewers - it was all good and beautifully presented. No drinks. $80 for a light lunch felt a bit steep."
3,"I went to CUT w/ some friends.  The portion is great (considering the $ I am paying =)  ).  I love their bread sticks.  I was kind of disappointed because the steak was a bit blackened and overcooked.  Taste was okay.  For the price given, the food was more on the average, there were many staff compared to the # of guests, which is good.  I am not sure if it's me or what, it seemed to me the staff's services were a bit \""fake\"" and not too friendly.\n\nMaybe people like the lighting?  but to me it was a bit too dark.  You can barely see the food.  \n\nI might try it a gain if given the chance."
3,"We only ever get the Louisiana Chicken pasta or cheesecake any more.  I think the menu is so big that it is hard for them to have any specialties (other than cheesecake).  The last 5 dishes I've had have been nothing special at all, and one I even sent back because it was so bad (and I NEVER do that)."
3,"My boyfriend and I just had dinner here. I have to say, I'm very underwhelmed by the food here. I was pretty stoked to get a tastey but simple sandwich and fresh made soup. Regretfully, I had the grilled cheese and it was quite lacking in flavor. The red pepper lobster bisque, though a tad \""clumpy\"" was quite tasty. I will give Cafe Zupas another shot, but I'm hoping my next choice in sandwich will turn it around for me."
3,"Maybe I was just super hyper up and expected way too much but the Blue Man Group wasn't all that.  Don't get me wrong, there were some really cool parts but there were also some boring parts.  I wanted to fall asleep a couple of times.  My husband's review would be even more critical.  He thought almost the whole show was boring.  For the price of the tickets, I don't think it's worth it.  Maybe if the tickets were $20-30 cheaper, it would be a better bang for your buck.  Some parts were very funny, some parts were neat, and some parts were just like okay-can-this-be-over-already.  Overall, it just gets three stars from me."
3,"I really like this place.  The food, drinks, and wine are always delicious.  The service is great,  but I can't get over how loud they play the live music on Friday and Saturday nights.  The music itself is fun and provides a great feeling, but don't plan on being able to have a conversation if you're in the main room while they pump it in on a speaker."
3,"I was looking for something to do with the in laws and this seemed right up their alley. It's a tourist trap, lots of  touristy stuff for sale and everything costs extra money. It was neat to see, got great pics and the history was great. Won't go again, once was enough but it was something to experience and glad I did."
3,"There's so much else to see and do in Vegas that I wouldn't bother spending my time here unless its absolutely freezing cold or scorching hot outside and you're just looking to spend some time indoors and not have to hop from hotel to hotel. It is a pretty nice mall though with one of the bigger indoor food courts I've seen anywhere.\n\nIf you've got lots of money to spend, then this is a good spot to go shopping. Otherwise I'd check out one of the various outlet malls in the area around Vegas where you'll find much better deals on stuff."
3,"Went here with some friends and was not familiar with the menu.  The order counter seemed confusing to me too. Got a turkey sandwich,  but think they used miracle whip not mayo.  Not a fan though."
3,"I saw these reviews and decided to try this place. The Pellini is an Italian burrito. You get to pick you meat (chicken, steak, italian sausage, shrimp), sauces (tomato and white), and topping (cheese, veggies). There are lots of choices so you can really have fun and personalize it. \nI had the chicken and Italian sausage and I thought that it was ok. Not great. I didn't think it had a lot a taste but maybe it how I put the Pellini together. \nMy wife had the chicken and shrimp and the shrimp really brought out the taste. Her Pellini tasted really good.\nThe decor was up to date and clean. It thought the the service was pretty good. They were very helpful and friendly. \nNot to sure if I will return but my wife enjoyed it, so we'll see."
3,"Napoleon's Dueling Piano Bar\nOverall\n3.75\n\nGold Medal - Extraordinary Pianist\nSilver Medal - Peppy Fun Environment\nBronze Medal - Free entrance\n\nThese pianist knows every song!  From Journey to Metallica.  Truely amazing.\n\nThere were people singing, dancing, and drinking.  People were having the time of their lives.\n\nThis is a free activity at night.  There is no admission fee and no drink minimum. Unlike comedy improv shows, where you get in for free, but the waitresses are hounding you for drink orders, causing you to miss the entire show. Here at Napoleon's, you pay for what you want to order.  If you want to request that special song that makes your body alive, you pay a tip with the name of the song written on a piece of paper.\n\nThe crowd was mainly 40 years old+.  All the younger hipsters are probably out hitting the dance clubs.\n\nHAPPY DUELING!!"
3,"I was here for lunch a few days ago.  Nice ambiance - and cosy and warm inside while it blew a storm outside.  I had good service, but wasn't overwhelmed by the food.  An halloumi sandwich with ciabatta and salad.   I enjoyed the salad, and the halloumi, but frankly the ciabatta didn't do it for me - and didn't bring out the best in the halloumi (even with the chilli jelly).   For dessert I had carrot cake - which was rather dry.  Much better carrot cake to be had in town.\n\nI'll be back though - apparently they do a good eggs benedict."
3,"I like this place because it's cheap.\n\nThe food isn't outstanding, but it's tasty enough.\n\nWe go fairly regularly because it's easy.\n\nI'd recommend it."
3,"I have been to Spinato's three times now. Twice for takeout, once we ate in the dining room. I have three thoughts:\n- The pizza is good. \n- The pizza is overpriced.\n- The service is craptastic. The first time they made me the wrong pizza and I had to wait an additional 10 minutes after everyone else had received their food. No discount was given on my order. The third time I called an order in and they told me it would 30-35 minutes. My wait was actually 57 minutes. When I complained the takeout person just looked at me with a blank stare. No apology, no discount.\n\nThe service is so bad it is enough to send me elsewhere, like Grimaldi's, if I am going to spend that kind of money on pizza."
3,"Heading out for the night and want to get a drink before the craziness begins?  Caramel is a decent choice.  It's definitely nothing to write home about, but it made me happy for one reason;  It was my 3rd night of madness and my priorities were simple....I wanted a seat.  \n\nWe walked in after dinner and meeting up with a few other girls and immediately were approached by a cocktail waitress and told we could sit at one of their reserved tables.  That was music to my ears (and my tired feet!).  It's a small lounge and the crowd was random, if anything.  Not anywhere worth spending more than 30 minutes but  the music was decent and you can get some really good infused vodka and if you're lucky, a seat."
3,"Not my cup of tea. I did not like my tuna entree, despite it being somewhere around $35. \n\nI do enjoy their cocktails, and like to come to the bar for happy hour."
3,"I absolutely LOVE Cirque shows, having seen a couple before (Ovo & Zumanity), so I was really excited when my boyfriend was offered comp tickets for his birthday in Las Vegas. Our seats were perfect, right in the middle about 6 rows up from the stage. I was extremely impressed with the set, as it was beautiful, and the water acts were gorgeous. Unfortunately, I was slightly underwhelmed. I don't know if it was just me, but I found the comedy to be lacking...the clown humour wasn't funny and I actually found it to be pretty boring. I was expecting to see more \""AMAZING\"" acrobatics, but aside from the beautiful diving (that takes talent) and a couple other acts (fire dancers, jumpers) I was really unimpressed. I didn't understand the story they were trying to tell, and some of the scenes were downright confusing. What was with the guy holding the 1-800 sign? Not to mention, I felt creeped out by it, like it was a weird acid trip. Those guys in the red coats are what nightmares are made out of. I love Cirque du Soleil and \""O\"" was a nice way to spend an evening, but overall I'm glad we didn't pay for the tickets. We found ourselves yawning towards the end and unfortunately, we were glad when it ended. Next time, I will see Ka or Mystere!"
3,"As a pub, it's fine, although it's an over-the-top Vegas version of a pub, and the price for a pint isn't exactly what you'd call reasonable.\n\nAs a restaurant, I don't think I'd go again. The food is perfectly good, and my appetizer (slices of pork belly over a kind of eggy bread with a maple glaze, topped with a poached egg) was delicious. But in contrast to the friendly barmen, the table service is passive aggressive, and my main meal (fish and chips) was nothing special. For the price, I'd expect better service, finer food and a better atmosphere.\n\nStill, if you're on the Strip and hunting for a decent beer, it's worth a trip."
3,"Love me some Famous Dave's catfish! Another unique quality of Famous Dave's are the sauces that are at your dispense on each table. Be sure to try the Georgia Mustard-goes well on just about everything. The reason for the 3 stars is because the most consistent factor here is the careless service.  I recently had a server not only talk to us for over 10 minutes about his name before he took our order,but also had the nerve to solicit help and funds for his charity.  I was appalled that he continued on and that the manager did not put a stop to it.  i think I was more irritated because if he spent as much time on assisting our table as he did talking about himself, our order would not have been screwed up so bad!"
3,"Who likes the DMV? Nobody. Then why do I give it a 3 star? For the self-service kiosks, where you can be in and out in less than 10 minutes. It's the best thing they could have done to help keep people moving. Now the only time I dread going is when I have to actually see a human to get done what I need. Visit the website to see what you can get done at the kiosk. And they have kiosks in other businesses (AAA's, grocery stores, etc) around Las Vegas, so check that out."
3,I thought the food was pretty good. I have done alot of really good Tapas and this was just pretty good. These guys pack it in like sardines and a young good looking crowd it is. Too busy for me on the weekends I would go back but there are many other fish in the sea so it won't be soon.
3,"The service and ambiance were very good. Small and intimate. Tables were a little close together in our section, and the heater was blowing directly underneath our feet, so it got a little uncomfortable as the night went on. Used a living social deal, which made the meal an excellent value. Ordered the escargot appetizer and the french onion soup, which were both delicious. Unfortunately, several appetizer and entree menu items were unavailable, including the frog legs, which I was interested in trying. I ordered the steak and frites (ribeye). The steak just wasn't good. The meat seemed very bland and I had to chew through some very tough and rubbery bits. Even though I  enjoyed the soup and appetizer, I left a bit unsatisfied due to the less than stellar ribeye. I do intent to come back and try something else on the menu in the future."
3,Don't buy the bananas!  They refrigerate them.  They turn brown by the end of the day. Dole bananas are the worst.
3,This place used to be better and more knowledgeable and helpful.  I guess I hit bad staff day or something.\ngood prices and a great selection.   \nNeed chairs to sit and read.
3,"MEDIOCRE, and \""bring your own wine\"" is overrated. I had the fillet mignon. Maybe in comparison to the steak houses in strip malls, this place is ok, but not in the Old Port, where there are MANY better restaurants. Maybe I'm too much of a meat lover to appreciate a tolerable steak. The thing is, I can make a better steak at home for less money and with the same effort (very loud dinning room). \nThe only time I would recommend this place is if you're doing a corporate dinner on a weeknight, not too busy, not too pricey, not too despicable."
3,Fries are great but everything else is terrible.  I would eat here more often if they improved their burgers even just a little bit.
3,"This place was just \""okay.\""  I would use the term \""old timey\"" to describe it.... I would also use that term to describe the clientele.  I went there for a business lunch, I would say that most of the older male population of Phoenix did the same.  I must also note that there is ZERO ambience-- it looks like a Best Western dining hall.\n\nOn to the food.  I had been craving prime rib, so that is what I ordered.  Though it was accurately cooked to be medium rare, the texture and flavor were not great.  The meat was bland, and it was not all that tender.  Even the au jus lacked flavor.  It was served with some sort of potatoes that I didn't really like either.  However, I have to say that my companion ordered the filet-- also medium rare-- and said that it was really good.\n\nI am not going to give this place a bad review, but I can't give it a stellar one either.  Im addition, the prices are a little high for such boring food.  I am truly ambivalent about Stockyards.... and life is too short to eat mediocre food.  ;)"
3,"I have a love/hate relationship with this place.. I used to go here for all of my nail needs but during the last couple times they did my gel mani/pedi at the same time which is way too much going on.. I can see if I asked for it or didn't have an appointment but switching hands and feet in to the lights at the same time is just too much, takes the relaxation out of it. However, they do do one of the better pedicures I've gotten in vegas (the hot stone one is awesome!)"
3,"It was 10:45 Saturday morning and I wanted coffee. I knew of a place right down the street from me and to my disappointment it was closed! WTF! Any way I went searching for a cafe. I wanted to sit down and read the new times with a cup of coffee. I actually started my journey thinking I would stop at the drip. But when i got there that place just seemed to modern for me. I was in a funky mood and just wanted a nice cup of coffee, nothing fancy. So I saw an older man waving a sign that said \""Best lunch in town!\"" and he was kind of dancing too! And I said to myself \""Yes, i think I will\"". So I stumbled upon MacAlpines. They had just opened and I sat right down at the counter. I had two cups of yummy diner coffee and after realizing I was hungry too, I ordered a stuffed tomato that was oh so yummy with super fresh veggies. The decor was adorable and welcoming and I loved the juke box. 25 cents gets you two plays! anyway, I'm not giving it four stars because it took some time for the staff to warm up and be friendly. I don't know if it was just because they had just opened or if it was because I was still sleeping and needed a caffeine fix badly. But I want to go again, with company, not by myself and I'll rate it again."
3,"Not as good as their flagship out on Sahara, but this one's right on the strip, although with the renovation you have to wade thru some dust and scaffolding to get here. The portions were just as monstrously large though, and this time we split 2 dishes among the three of us lightweights, and we left full having not even finished either of them. I'd have picked the chicken and waffles for sure but democracy won out. Here we tried the chorizo skillet and the Tractor Driver Combo. The chorizo skillet was good, although the one tortilla it comes with is inadequate for the amount of filling it comes with. The tractor driver combo we upgraded to a banana pancake which was well worth the extra dollar. Service was excellent. \n\nThe experience at their standalone restaurant on Sahara was better in terms of the atmosphere, the food, and the overall experience, but this was still fine."
3,"I was here for my 21st birthday. It was a lot of fun, but it was rather small. It felt like they were double their max capacity. The dj was awesome, but again the dance floor was too small and crowded :("
3,"The food was good, portions huge, and there was a good variety on the menu.  However it took us an hour and 12 minutes from arrival to getting our food, even though the place wasn't full.  So worth it for the food quality and portions, but be prepared for a long wait to get it."
3,"I was skeptical about authentic Hawaiian food in Vegas, but Island Flavor proved to be a spot that locals could satisfy their craving at.\n\nPortions: HUGE. One plate could feed three of us had we known they were going to be so big. Kahlua pork is mild, but super tender. I could've used a bit more salt on the meat, but it was still good. Sweet and sour pork ribs were tasty but almost a little too salty. Furikake chicken was bomb. I added Sriracha and it became super bomb.\n\nMy only complaints are regarding the rice.\nBrown rice - too much water so I basically had two scoops of brown rice mush.\nFried rice - now this is where I think Island Flavor failed because their version of fried rice is basically white rice with some lapcherng and veggies doused with soy sauce. I've eaten and seen fried rice made enough to know we weren't eating fried rice. The portion was a potful. No joke.\n\nCOCO PUFFS = yum. I have no idea what the buttery yellow stuff is on top of the chocolate cream puff but it's ONO.\nMud pie = good. I liked the chocolate cacao or coffee nibs in the kona coffee ice cream. Really nice touch. Could do without the flavored syrups on the plate though.\n\nStaff were friendly even though very busy.\n\nSpam musubi was right on. Reminded me of all the musubis we've eaten in Hawaii."
3,"I love a good massage. My husband purchased a gift card for couples massage and gifted it to me for Christmas. Scheduling the massage was very easy. This location is very clean and the waiting room was very therapeutic. The massage room was ok. It was barely decorated and in kind of a weird layout. Our massage therapists were very friendly and professional. I can't say that I will be back after I use the rest of the money on my gift card, though. The massage was ok, but I've had much better ones. They really try to sell you on becoming a member when you are checking out, which I do not like."
3,Was surprised that the jerk fried rice was not as spicy like the first time I went here. The portions seemed smaller than before and barely filled the round foil container. The food was still tasty and satisfying. I recommend the black beans over the refried since they have more flavor. Service was good and prompt. The staff was friendly and helpful in making our choices. The order paper is a bit confusing and the staff is there to explain to the newbies but it still takes a couple of times of doing the paper before you get the hang of it.
3,"I was at the Starbucks in the Trails Village Center and needed to stop at the ATM at Wells Fargo.  There wasn't a single car in any of the three lanes even the one with the ATM.  That's almost 4 stars without thinking.\n\nThis is an OK place, but it's not in my neighborhood and it's a bit of a pain getting in and out with the traffic coming in and out of the Trails Center.\n\nI have lived here over a decade and this is my first check in here says something."
3,"My review of Fin is pretty much the same as all of the other Yelpers. I found Fin to be a bit pricey for Chinese food, and the staff is very overly incredibly attentive. If you take a sip of water, someone is there to refill it for you. \n\nThe food is good, though, there's no doubt about it. I ordered the stir-fry chicken and was very satisfied. They also follow up your meal with a delicious house made fortune cookie and shot of Baileys. \n\nThe ambiance is fantastic if you sit toward the back and can block out the chachings of the nearby slot machines. \n\nHighly recommended for a nice dinner as long as you're aware of the price and overly attentie service staff."
3,"I suppose its well stocked and closer for me than Tesco but it just doesnt have that friendly neighbourhood shop vibe. \nTwice in the last couple of weeks Ive been short changed and instead of a 'are you sure' or a 'lets see' the dude looked at me as if I just declared an interest in his wife.\nBoth times they were out by a pound or so. we aint talking 2p here man!\n\n\n They are on to me though. Last week I was overcharged for a coke and so I said 'I paid less last week'. He replied 'oh we undercharged you by mistake'...Good move that one...\n\n\n Finally, dont try and haggle. I haggled them for 20p off some Snapple but the only one who sanctions haggled goods is the Old Man. The other staff were taken by surprise and looked a little scared as I tried the haggling."
3,"= = = = = =  DAILY LUNCH BUFFET!  = = = = = =\n\nMonica O. spearheaded a UYE up here today and 15 of us came out to enjoy some tasty Thai food and great Yelpie fellowship!  (Thanks Monica!)  The Buffet featured 15 items including two soups, Vegetable with Egg & Tofu, and Coconut with Chicken.  There was plain and fancy rice offered, and a good number of hot dishes including chicken, beef and fish, as well as several vegetable combos, 19 items all together.\n\nEverything was good here, and with only 3 Thai Buffets currently being offered in the Valley it's a plus to have these guys here.     :-)\n\nThe dining room here is comfortable and the table service was fine, but for me there were three drawbacks this time:\n\n*  Nearly all of the meat dishes were chicken.\n\n*  There were no dessert items included.\n\n*  They only allow one credit or debit card payment per table.  In our case that meant that 14 of us were expected to have cash for our meal!  WHAT???     :-O\n\nBy some miracle I guess that all but one of us did have enough cash, but I think that policy is unsatisfactory.  Why not put the customer first?\n                                                                                          `\n\nLunch Buffet:\n\nTuesday thru Friday $9.99 from 11:30 AM.\nSunday:  $10.99 from 12 noon."
3,"I had the fish and tofu tacos for lunch. They use corn tortillas, which I respect. The fish was good and the tofu mixture was interesting, but the tacos were not particularly great.  The location seems good though. The bar has a lot of space around it, and I assume the patio is quite nice."
3,"Quirky interior, clearly popular and possibly the best priced pot of tea in town.\n\n\n Could maybe do with opening past 18:00."
3,"Price was right. Cool concept but I like 5 guys better. What A Burger is my favorite burger, guess you could say I'm old school. In and out was busy and had good service but as for the burger's. A lot of hype."
3,"I'm pretty sure most of these new reviews are from employees and their families. \n\nRefused to honor my Groupon (prepaid of course).\nThis is exactly the same place as before. Their sign even still says Greek Grill & Fry Co. and it's run by the same people. \nThe server was polite and made good suggestions,  but failed to alert me that they would not honor the 50% off Groupon before we ate, but instead offering a 20% discount. I always mention any deals on the way in for this reason.\n\nThe food was good,  not a huge selection but it was hot and made to order. We seemed to be the only customers that whole day. The Uncle/Grandpa of the family was in the dining area watching TV and talking on his phone. It's a very casual place."
3,"There are some tables and a lot of slot machines. If you live in the area, it could be a good place to go and hang out. I would never recommend a drive from the strip to gamble here, but not bad for a locals hang out. With dollar beer and hot dogs, how can you go wrong!?"
3,"Its americanized, but pretty tasty! I love the fried rice and usually just get that. We were getting takeout once and waited at the bar, and the bartender gave us free tastes of the lychee cocktail while we waited! And that was tasty too!\n\nIts also never crowded, its quiet and the service is consistently not bad. \n\nAll that being said though, there isn't really anything special about this place. Its just kind of...eh... Best as take out."
3,"I don't know about the lounge part everyone else has reviewed, but I had dinner there and was like meh about it. The portions are extremely small for the prices. Even the sake was a bit overpriced, I felt. The waitstaff, as much as I appreciate attentiveness, was maybe a little too overeager to get us the hell out of there. My husband's plate was actually cleared before he was even done eating. We eventually had to tell them to leave the plates until we were finished. While the ambiance is very cool and romantic, I don't think I'd drop another buck in there in the future."
3,"This is not the same restaurant of past years.  Been eating at the Golden Steer since the early 1970's and the service and food was outstanding.  Going down hill since the 2000's.  Will not eat there any more.  Not worth the value.  Staff was very friendly and they decor has not changed.  I ordered a NY Strip steak and they butterflied it and took all the flavor out it.  We used to brag about his place to all we know who were traveling to Las Vegas, no more."
3,"I'm not crazy about the food here, but there's a great (huge!) patio and I would go for a cocktail or glass of wine anytime :)"
3,"I'm with everyone when they say that this is not a hike. lol.\n\nIt's basically a quick walk with man made steps to see a somewhat view of what is Phoenix. It's right next to the zoo, can't miss it. I liked that it was a stop over and a cute quest for my boyfriend and I to do on our trip, but it's definitely not a hike! \n\nI was wearing a super cute outfit with dressy boots and was able to walk up this hole hill :)"
3,"I was here before the supposed end of the world, and it seemed like everyone here was having a great time.  My gf got a tip from her promoter that got us to get in for free, alongside the complimentary drinks that they offered just before midnight, so it was pretty cool to come in hang out for a bit.\n\nBlush is really small in comparison to XS and Surrender. Blush doesn't have a dance floor, just walkways in between the tables. You can try to dance in those areas, but you'll end up looking kinda awkward dancing in the limited space. The music seemed to be mainstream, with less emphasis on hip hop. We only stayed in there for about 30 minutes and ended up leaving to meet up with the others outside that couldn't get in."
3,"Chef cooking in the open facility. Mostly noodles. Pad Thai noodles, beef. A most desirable appetite for the hungry man. Couldn't take this to heart."
3,"I went for lunch today with friends after a hike.  We were hungry.\n\nI had a lunch meal.  The sandwich was fresh, hot and generous.  My side salad was wilted.  I would have thrown out the lettuce in my home.\n\nOne of my friends had a traditional breakfast, and he said he was great.  Eggs cook properly, and again generous portions.\n\nMy last friend (at breakfast, not on the face of the earth)  had a breakfast burrito, and said it was very good.  I think my salad was the weakest link.\n\nThe service was good, and everyone seemed very friendly.  We were seated within 10 minutes, and being warned there would be a wait.  They left carafes of coffee, iced tea, and soda on the table for self-refilling.\n\nThe prices were fine.  I'd go back, but avoid the salad...at least at lunch time."
3,"we ate here for our last day in vegas. everyone was hung over and we needed some soup to make us feel better. i ordered the fire chicken wings which weren't spicy at all. but it wasn't bad. the dim sum was yummy because they had a good amount of shrimp inside. the duck noodle soup thing was ok. the duck was good. hot and sour soup- a bit spicy, too much pepper. and the chrysanthemum iced tea was delish."
3,"This location was right by ASU. It was empty on a holiday. Our server was great. The food was cooked perfectly. And they even had a \""study hall\"" for students which I thought was a great idea. The only suggestion that comes from who I attended with is that if there is an upcharge that the waitress mentions it prior to getting a surprise on your bill. There is mention of it in the menu, but it doesn't spell out that there is an extra $2 for a slice of cheese on your eggs."
3,"The prices were great, but they were out of stout...\n\nI was a bit crowded and that left the staff super spread out... Our table faced the kitchen door and it was obvious they only had two cooks in the kitchen, I wonder how the dining room got so croweded?  But for the price I don't mind having to wait for our food, beg for water and the check.\n\nI will say the people watching was priceless!  It looked like perhaps a convention of middle-aged mid-west salesmen had hit the place hard just before we were seated! Hilarious :)"
3,"We got a room for $35/night, a Motel-6 price for a better-than-Motel-6 room with much-better-than-Motel-6 amenities.  The pools are awesome.  You get a free drink pass.  Gym is pretty nice, too.  I approve."
3,"Finally, someone got smart and decided to open a Metro Pizza in Henderson! I no longer have to fight UNLV students on their lunch break for a nice booth and some pizza. The new location I believe is better than the original. It has a full bar area, a party room, and regular dining room. There is also a separate wing for pick up orders so you don't have to trek all the way through the restaurant in your pj's and slippers. The pizza is great on its own, but the nuclear fries are so good, I would go just for those. They are spiced and have a bit of a kick, and make the perfect addition for a pie. They also have a variety of beers on tap, which also obviously pairs well with pizza. Avoid the weekend evenings though because the hype around the new restaurant is still prevalent. It's packed. Lunch is the best time, and things stay pretty quiet. \n\nRecommended pizza: The margherita.\n\nRecommended beer: Hefeweizen with some lemons."
3,"This is the cheapest option if you are in Paris, which isn't saying much. We'll actually there's a place two doors down that had sandwiches in a display case but for an extra dollar or two we got a much more appetizing sandwich here. \n\nI definitely would not go out of your way for this place. However, if it is 2pm, you just got in from your flight and don't want another airport refrigerated sandwich, then just maybe this is the place for you too."
3,"First and foremost, I don't mind spending money on good coffee.  I do have to say that the ambiance has definitely changed quite a bit in the last 6 months.   I used to walk in and see my favorite baristas and we'd chit chat a little but now they all seem to be gone.  I'm going to assume that's because of the new location?  I'm not sure.  Regardless the coffee now seems to taste less satisfying :(.  It's saddening because we really adored this place but now go elsewhere.  If anything it's a testament to the difference people can make in that sort of environment."
3,"this is a review for flaverz the buffet inside harrah's. whenever i go out to vegas i always try to eat at this place. its one of those places that is not so cheap but they have a great selection of food. they have mexican, italian, sea food, fresh foods, chinese, and deserts. everything is great and all the times that ive been there is always some new item on the list. its great. i think that it is like $20 per person. however if you do the timeshare stuff then you can get 2 for 1. however having gone this week we discovered that you have to be 28+ to do the time share :( im just 24 but a few months ago i was able to do it :) oh the time share thing is at the entrance to the casino, just walk around and they will get you specially if you are a couple or look like one."
3,"My wife and i went for lunch last week.  The food was so so and the service was a bit slow.  We both got lunch specials that came with soup, spring roll and fried wontons.  The soup was not what I would call a traditional Thai soup, the spring roll was too greasy, and the wontons were bland.  My wife got the yellow curry and I got Panang.  I ordered mine \""Thai spicy\"" but it was more like medium.  Next time we go for Thai we'll try the Thai Cafe which is just a mile or so away."
3,"The fruit and veg from here isn't always at its best and I did once buy a bag of plums from here on the cheap just to find they'd gone off, but it was on the cheap and luckily for this review I know to slow cook them and they turned out to be delicious.  This means there is a risk if you are buying the really cheap or out of season items, but other than that you should be okay.\n\nIn general I don't want to put you off because there are some nice items on offer here, but you do want to keep your eye out for something that's simply too far gone."
3,"I'll start with the food. It was good. My husband enjoyed the steak and I got the halibut. Both really tasty. Baked potato was stellar and they have a 'wine of the month' which you can get for $20 or if you have the hotel coupon book, free.\n\nService. Was very attentive in some ways, non-existent in others. Served us drinks/wine right away. Never brought bread and we had to ask for our entree after being there about 75 minutes and then rush to make our show. Not a huge deal EXCEPT the server was super defensive about it and made excuses, which I thought was weird as we weren't irritable when we mentioned it, just asked because we needed to get out of there.\n\nSeemed super pricey for South Point too, but if you want a special occasion and are staying there - I'd say try it. It was good."
3,Very brisk for Christmas lunch. I strongly recommend reservations. It is very humourous that they would turn us away when the place was empty when we walked in (see picture). But clearly a popular place and by the time we left every table in the place was full. \n\nWithout a reservation in busy Christmas lunch season I would recommend a reservation for anything more than 2 people. We sat at the bar.\n\nExpensive lunch:\n$10 soup\nLunch special $19 soup and pasta\n\nFood was ok.... one of my colleagues had to send the lunch special back and the meat was raw. To their their credit they did check shortly after the first bite and were quick to bring a new plate out.\n\nI have great respect for restaurants that have staff that can recognize a problem quickly. I think this was reflected in the tip.
3,"I really like Lavo (as a nightclub)! Have yet to have a meal here though, so this review is for the nightclub only. Space-wise it can get pretty cramped because it's a bit on the smaller side, but nowhere near as uncomfortably packed as Tao. Dance floor is pretty tiny, but honestly, I didn't notice it until the place had mostly cleared out and I got a good look around. They play hip-hop and a lot of old songs, but old in a way that makes you go \""oh man, I haven't heard this song in a while, but  it's still awesome,\"" which I think is a nice change of pace from all the clubs that play almost exclusively house music.\n\nLavo is probably a 3.5 in my book, though I have to admit, part of the reason for that is because we had open bar, courtesy of our wonderful promoter (who also got our guys in for free!) There's a main bar area, but we got all our drinks from the side bar, which was super crowded and only had one bartender working there. But he was a really adorable and sweet bartender, so no complaints.\n\ntl;dr: Everyone in my group had a fairly fun time. Would definitely come back-- especially if we're staying at the Venetian/Palazzo!"
3,"It's OK.\n\nThe good:\n- Nice location (glad to have something at Town & Country)\n- The parking was fine\n- The service was great\n- Prices are cheap\n- Chocolate milkshake was really good\n\nThe bad:\n- The Wreck\n- Sandwiches had hardly any meat and hardly any toppings\n- If you like a sandwich that is mostly bread then this is for you\n\nOn the cheap, I'd rather go to Subway.  Ho hum, at least at Subway I get my lettuce and tomatoes."
3,I would give this a 3.5. I would expect the pizza to be a lot better just because it is a Pie place. It was good but I've had a lot better. The thing this has is great ambiance. I love how low the lighting is. Dark tables that are turned perfectly so you don't feel like you are apart of other people's dinners. Great fire from the oven and open area bar. Had a good solid wine. We got the cheese board which was good. We both got pizza but like I said it was good just nothing special.
3,"I do not go to Fresh and Easy very much.  The stores just aren't appealing to me except for a couple of items--generally snacks.  They have peanut butter filled salted pretzel nubs, some good salted kettle chips, and very decent trail mix for hiking.\n\nThat's about it for me.  I was going by here yesterday and thought it would be a quick and easy stop and it was.  Since I have no preconceived notion where things should be, I just walk around like a zombie with a purpose to find what I want.\n\nCheckout was quick--I only had two items, and then I went across the street to Albertsons where I did a bit more serious shopping."
3,"Really great salsa bar, tacos, quesadillas and burros.  This is 'authentic' mexican; not Macayos.  \nA few downsides though, it is really small & not really built for families or large groups; plus, I wouldn't park in the neighboring streets.  I got yelled at by one homeowner saying if they saw my vehicle again they're having it TOWED!."
3,"The burgers are as good as one could hope for the price and the setting sure makes for good conversation. I like the fact that it's not a chain fast food place, but its missing some beer variety (i.e. other than Molson/Labbatt) and the fries could really be improved."
3,"Food is great but service is terrible. This is one of my favorite restaurants, but this location doesn't make the grade. Waited 15 minutes in an empty restaurant at 1:30 for a bean burrito to go. Seriously..."
3,"Good flavor, good service, long wait and under done pepperonis. Gotta go to Grimaldis in Brooklyn to compare the two. Nothing special."
3,"This is for the Sunday night concert series. If you like families and dogs and strollers and people running around your blanket and trains blaring their horns and lousy sound systems and parking from hell, the Sunday night concert series should be on your radar. My chunky date and myself found a decent location away from the stage, but still experienced most everything previously mentioned. None of it really bothered us too much, so if you can endure all of that or actually somebody with multiple dogs and kids, then this is your piece of cake. The Scottsdale douchebag factor was not in effect, but you will have to arrive early to get a spot across the street. Now, it might have been more crowded due to holiday weekend, but who knows unless I go again which I doubt."
3,Went on a night that they had a live band on the patio.....was a nice atmosphere. Drinks were good but food was just okay. May go back if other places are too busy.
3,"Nice room.\nStayed here for 3 nights.\n\nEarly checking cost $50 extra. Better than napping in the parking lot with wife, baby and mo in law in our tiny Honda insight.\n\nNot many places to plug in all of our chargers for cell phones so we took turns and used the restroom plugs.\n\nCheck in line was always long, with not enough staff to handle it...\n\nCheck out was a mad rush too. Vegas wasn't very busy this time of year. End of march.\n\nParking was free. \n\nThe iPod dock didn't charge the iPod and it had the wrong time.\n\nThey had a fridge and safe in the room.\n\nNo coffee pot in the room.\n\nThe checkout was kind of weird.  I suggest an easy checkout.  Get the folio under your door and just walk out if there aren't any problems with the bill.  We ended up standing in a 30 minute line just to check out.\n\nGood Job TI, but I think for the price, I might stay somewhere else."
3,"Hit up merts for dinner last night..  Had the Fried catfish and Beef rib combo.  Whole fried catfish was a little tough to negociate the bones and didnt not yeald much fish. \""The beef rib\"" was chopped up and in a small pile bones and all.  Like other have said the goodness in in the sides..  Mac and Cheese was real and had a nice crust on the top and the corn bread was good.. athough the piece my wife got looked like it was in the oven a littlel too long and dried out a bit.  Overall decent stop"
3,"I love John Hughes movies, but this Breakfast Club did not live up to its namesake. The eggs were serviceable, but the potatoes O'Brian (I learned a new thing here!) were nothing special--kind of soft and oily, with large chunks of pepper. The jalepeno biscuits, which sounded conceptually grand, were not quite what I'd call a biscuit. They were tough, unflavorful little disks with jalepenos baked in. The heuvos rancheros looked like something my cat barfed up, however, they tasted fine, according to my breakfastmate. \n\nOverall, I think this was a shade greasier than we were expecting. And outdoor seating is nice, but a mixed bag when abutting a busy road. The service was good, but something about the waitresses reminded me of the Stepford Wives."
3,"Overall it's a nice place the reason for only 3 stars is this: $5 to park,$35.99 entrance, $8 small locker, $3 water and only 5 working slides, a wave pool and lazy river. Make up your own minds ..."
3,"Fairly typical Chinese food with a Sushi menu and nice restaurant seating area.  I wasn't as wow'd as I was hoping after reading all the rave reviews here on Yelp, but it is a pretty decent offering.\n\nI tried the egg drop soup, which was a good value, the pork dumplings, which were meh - I think the sauce was overly sweet, the kung pao chicken, which was pretty good, and the chicken lo mein noodles, which were meh (but aren't all lo mein noodles pretty meh?).\n\nOverall I would come back and get some take out because it does lie somewhere in between your PFChangs and your strip mall cheap Chinese take out place.  However, I don't believe it's that great of a value offering.  The prices are a bit high for cheap Chinese, and the quality is only just a bit higher.  Doesn't feel like you're getting a great deal."
3,"The decor here is adorable. It made me want to sit and stay a while. I had my first macaroon, well two, mixed berry and raspberry. People always rave about them (not necessarily from here, but in general) so I decided to indulge. I didn't love or hate them. I'll definitely be back to try other options."
3,"Footlocker isn't that exciting, it stocks all the shoe brands you would expect to find in a trainer shop such as; Reebok, Nike, Adidas and a seemingly unnecessary amount of basketball sneakers. The prices are medium to expensive but they often have sales on where you can bag yourself a bargain but the sales usually only offer terrible looking shoes that nobody else wants.\n\nI guess Footlocker is more of a guys shop because whenever I've popped in they've had hundreds of guys shoes but a rather a measly amount of ladies ones so it's not somewhere I pop in that often. If I am looking for a new pair of trainers I will pop in to see what's on offer but more often than not I find myself going elsewhere."
3,"My fiance said I should write a review.    I replied that the restaurant didn't strike me as good or bad.  It was pretty middle of the road.\n\n2.5 stars for me.\n\nService was fine.   No real complaints or compliments there.\n\nFood.  During happy hour, you get 2 tacos for $3 Chef's choice of tacos.  And I delighted in eating the salmon taco.   \n\nI was expecting grand things from the guacamole and was disappointed.   The dried cranberries were an interesting addition.  But I much prefer good ol' Trader Joe's guacamole.\n\nFood was rico.   Rico means \""rich\"" in Spanish and usually a compliment.   I just found the food rico in terms of calories.\n\nI wouldn't mind going back but neither am I itching to return either."
3,"This isn't a movie theater that I frequent regularly since I live in NLV, but the \""renovations\"" since Rave owned the place seems favorable. They've added extended armrests between each seat with a heavier duty cup holder than you're used to but has pros and cons; while it makes sharing drinks and snacks easier, it also makes the armrest stationary. \n\nPRO:\nNew armrests are larger.\nSnack bar seems to be larger than most.\n\nCON:\nThe movie (White House Down) started about 20 minutes late, apparently nobody was in the operating room.\nThere were only like 30 M&Ms in the package I purchased at the snack bar."
3,"\""Ja... ganz OK.\""\nF\u00fcr \""Jawohl. So lob' ich mir das.\"" fehlt noch etwas...\n\nEine Location mit dem Ansatz \""Burger & Bratwurst\"" au\u00dferhalb einer Fast-Food Kette anzubieten. Eher Restaurant als Bar...\n\nIm Prinzip gibt es keine fertigen Gerichte sondern einen Baukasten aus dem man(n) sich seine Portion/ Gericht selbst zusammen stellen kann.\nDer Service war bisher immer sehr freundlich (aufmerksam aber nicht aufdringlich)\n\nKeine schlechte Location, aber das Gesamtkonzept (Preis-Leistung) ist IMHO noch nicht ganz schl\u00fcssig umgesetzt. Im Augenblick kommt es mir so vor wie eine Kreuzung zwischen Szeneladen Berlin-Mitte und den aktuell sehr angesagten M\u00fcnchner \""Currywurst-Bars\""...\n\nHohe Frauenquote ;-)"
3,"A group of us went here to eat some burgers since we heard they had good burgers. The food was good but somewhat oily and dry. I woul of given the restaurant 4 stars if it wasn't for the horrible service provided by Olivia. She had a bad attitude throughout the whole time we were there for no reason at all. We asked for a To Go box and she just threw it on the table, which we thought was so rude. We asked our waters to be filled 3 times before she actually got around to it. The restaurant is expensive, so I expected better service. Overall, it's worth going if you enjoy a good burger. Hopefully, you get a better waitress/waiter."
3,"So I thought I'd drop in for a little afternoon delight. Lots of Yummy Flavors to choose from.\nI was looking forward to a real sweet treat with lots of candy on top!\nIt's March so I  chose Irish creme mmmmm with almond roca topping.\n\nI was enjoying it for about the first 3 bites then all I could think about  was \""Twangy Tart\""!\nAll this time I thought I loved the Golden Spoon, that is until I let the Ice Tango do a little dance on my tongue! \n\nTrust Me once you try the Twang you'll be like Daaaaaang! \nAnd Nothing else will ever be the same!\n\nDamn You Ice Tango! You have ruined me from enjoying any other Frozen yogurt joint!\n\nGolden Who?"
3,"Its good food.  Its just not the greatest food for the price you pay.  I had a spicy chicken of some sort, and they dont mess around when it comes to the spicy stuff.  This stuff was HOT.  I enjoyed it quite a bit, but I just didnt feel like the food justified the price.  $11 for a lunch special?  No thanks.  I would give the food 4 out of 5 stars though."
3,I only ordered pho there and wasn't impressed at all but I saw some other dishes other people were eating looked pretty good.  It gave me the feeling that it's a more Americanized joint comparing to the ones on spring mtn. I'm willing to try again.
3,"This used to be the best mall in the area.  Then along came Arizona Mills, Chandler Fashion Center, and Tempe Marketplace.  Those three places, in my opinion, seems to have taken at least those patrons who live in Chandler, Tempe and Gilbert.\n\nThere are still good stores here, including many of the same stores you will find at the other malls.  We have found that Fiesta is now much less busy and crowded than it used to be.  This is particularly nice during Christmas season/sales.\n\nAnd they have an area of covered parking which the other malls don't.  Very nice in summer."
3,"I know I said that they were professional and all, but the other day we received a bill for what the insurance wouldn't pay.  It came in a decent envelope, but then we opened it.\n\nPlain sheet of paper with printing.  No tear-off portion, no return envelope (not to mention return postage - I wouldn't expect that from anyone).  Just a sheet, badly folded, printed out on a cheap printer.\n\nSo much for professional.  I guess that only extends to examinations - and presumably procedures.  Definitely not to the billing department.  We get a lot of medical bills since we started buying our own insurance, and this is definitely the cheapest of the bunch.\n\nI get that it's only a few cents for an envelope and all - but it can't cost them much more to have some reasonably pre-printed invoices with tear-off return portions, much less a return envelope.  It would just make for a nicer experience, you know?"
3,"Awesome location, cool place....the Chopped Salad is by far the most amazing salad I have ever had in my life (but way...and I mean way to small)...If it were double the portion for the price I would probably visit more. I had a flight when I was there...it took forever (as I know flights are supposed to)...but this was ridiculous...the buffalo meat is so gross...it reminds me of when a stray dog visits my lawn...\n\nThe BBQ sauce is good....the staff is just OK. Nothing mind blowing. I think staff in a place with a pricey menu should spoil the guests a bit...Give away a free desert when you know the service and meal is just OK...this may bring your customer base back to visit just because you redeemed yourself at the end.\n\nOverall its a cool place. It fits with the downtown Scottsdale lifestyle. But stay away from the buffalo, because it will give doggy bag a whole new meaning...."
3,"The food here was really good. It was filling and tasty. However, when compared to other taco joints or mexican food, it is just very average. I love mexican food and the food here lacks the authenticity of other places... But this should be obvious since its in a casino. \nMy problem is that they are very very pricey. For two people, it was $54. The food was good and it was discounted for gamblers, but if I had to pay over $50 for the quality I would be upset.\nDefinetly people should come here and try it out, just know the quality isn't worth the price."
3,Decent food for the price however I've been to better sushi places for the similar price(and sometimes its worth pay extra for better food). Their makis are often sloppy and unfinished looking and certain fish(fresh tuna or yellow tail for example) are not the freshest. I guess it's good for quick lunch once in a while but not for a fancy dinner.
3,"Met someone here to play on the tennis courts.  Surprisingly the courts were in good shape, the nets were missing the straps, but we played through it.  Overall it's a nice complex.... my one complaint would be that the parking lot is a bit of a maze to get out with a lot of curves (which means a lot of blind spots if you are backing out).  Yes, it keeps the place looking interesting, but I would hate to be a grounds keeper here since there are no straight lines in sight.\n\nThe apartments look pretty solid, all-brink.... there is a lot of highway noise coming from 485 though.... I didn't go inside one unit, but it was fairly loud from the tennis court."
3,"Applebee's is just one of those boring chain restaurants.  I do really love some chains, but alas, Applebee's is not one of them.   Everything is just ok.  Nothing ever blows my socks off or makes me crave to come here, but it isn't bad either, just blah.\n\nI found myself here yesterday because I was outvoted by the group I was with.  Oh well, it happens.  We went for lunch and it was an ok experience.  I had the Bourbon Black and Bleu Burger.  It was surprising yummy.  It had a lot of kick and I had a small party in my mouth.  It was better than I was expected, which was a nice surprise.  The other people in the party both got the 3 cheese penne and chicken dish.  I didn't sample it, but they both enjoyed it.  My picky eater, my 18 month old did surprise me by eating half of her grilled cheese.  She never eats anything, so that made me happy.  I tried a bite and it was quite good with the bread being a sweet, eggy bread, like brioche.  \n\nThe service was really good and we always had what we wanted without having to ask for it, which made for a pleasant meal.\n\nSo over all, the food was good, the service was great, but I am still bored with the overall place.  Give me Chili's anyday, but this Applebee's did a good job today.  Way to go Applebee's for slowing changing my opinion about you."
3,This was my second trip to this location and I noticed their salad bar had fewer items from before.  It was still very good but am disappointed that they seemed to have eliminated some items. I am not a big meat eater and came for the salad bar so I noticed these things. It was still really really good however.
3,"I enjoyed my meal at Spago, but wasn't as impressed as my companions. The wedge salad is good but not notable, however the heirloom tomato and burrata salad special was outstanding - the best overall dish of the night.  \n\nWe ended up splitting 3 pizzas - I have to say, I found the crust to be disappointing on all of them. Not much flavor at all - more of just a vehicle for the toppings.  As for the specific pies:\n-Margherita - crust was a bit undercooked, and overall I would call this a pretty average Margherita pizza\n-Proscuitto - this was the best of the 3 - the Proscuitto and Fromage blanc worked perfectly together.  With a great crust this pizza would have mind blowing potential.\n-Lamb Chorizo - a very nice pie overall - enjoyed the chorizo, and the toppings all worked well together. \n\nService was excellent."
3,"Great place for the price. Not the most luxurious place on the strip but the amenities are decent, the service is good, and the location is fantastic. Very good value overall.\n\nThis is the 4th or 5th time we've stayed here. The rooms are clean and comfortable, and there is a decent selection of food downstairs ranging from McDonald's to 5 star French, and everything in between. The casino floor is a bit small and smoky, but perfect for when you're not in the mood to get dressed up and go out. The spa is small and reasonably priced. And it's only a few minutes' walk to other casinos, restaurants, and shopping at the many malls nearby.\n\nThe only things we didn't care much for were the showers (high pressure mist that's definitely not my idea of pleasant) and on our most recent trip the TV didn't work properly (but we didn't call to have it fixed because it just wasn't that important to us).\n\nYes, you can stay at a nicer, trendier, and/or more luxurious place on the strip but you'll pay about twice as much. We prefer to stay here, where we're always satisfied, and use the cash we saved to eat, play, and party while we're in town."
3,"Kind of tucked away and hard to notice, especially being next to the really glammed out Ella's Deli. But worth a visit if you're looking for a good gyro or kebab. :]\n\nThe donuts are alright too. They have a wide variety! Myself, I really rather like their cookies. They also offer homemade baklava.\n\nReally though I can reccomend their sandwiches with a side of the seasoned fries. Quite yummy! Vegetarian options also available such as potato kahbi or falafel sandwiches. And they had a lot of beverages to choose from too.\n\nAlthough the location is not ideal, it's worth a stop if you're in that part of town. :]"
3,"when this place first opened it was really good, back then I would have given it 5 stars. Now it is just ok. My dad likes to go there, that is why we went. \nWe started with the grilled artichoke. Usually this is pretty good. Not so much this time. Maybe artichokes are out of season?. It was hard and not very flavorful. The aioli that accompanied it was tasty. \nThe prime rib was ok, the portions get smaller each time I go. Very tender, good flavor. Nothing outstanding. We all had the same cut. Same side of baked potato. No dessert. \nProbably will go again as my dad loves this place."
3,"Barneys is a multi layered bar that is more low key than many of the other bars in the area. If you are looking to just have fun and not overdress, pay a cover etc then this might be the place for you.\n\nI found the second level my favorite. The bartender was friendly and was prompt with the refills. I could see the roof level being a cool place when it's a bit warmer, but the drawback would be the smoking for me.\n\nYou've got to like how the beer is poured from the bottom up! When you have a bit too much to drink, what else could be more fun than trying to catch the lobster  (think the claw game to get stuffed animals).\n\n3.5 start"
3,My wife went there recently during the week with a few friends. It was a Monday afternoon. She said it was not what she expected. It was a neat experience but not as many animals as she thought. 10 bucks to get in for locals and that seemed kinda steep after she got in and realized how minimal the park was.  Also it was over 100 degrees and there was not a drop of water to be had. Every water fountain she stopped at....it said out of order.  This is very dangerous for visitors. They should have water available st all times.
3,"As a UNLV student, this place has one of the best deals around. 5 tacos, 2 sides and a drink for $5, and the tacos are really good.  They are traditional street tacos, so on the smaller side, but they don't skimp you on the meat.  It's a fun place to go with friends, get a bucket of beers, and sit around and chat.  It's order at the counter, and they'll call your number when your food is ready.  I think that they also have either live music or a DJ on some nights, usually Latin themed, shocking, I know..."
3,"I am very torn about First Friday. I absolutely love community events. Especially art walks, and more creative culture, but this is very lacking. I want to love it because it's in my back yard, too! \n\nHowever, First Friday leaves me with a sense of empty feeling. Located in the arts district downtown should be plenty of reason why this event should boast art, but it doesn't. \n\nThe art galleries are lacking, and the street vendors that sell art are more there to just get a buck than they are about art. \n\nThen there's the riff raff of downtown trying to join in, and so many kids everywhere! I guess police try to crack down on curfew, but there's always so many grungy kids that are up to no good running around. \n\nThe food stalls are nice during summer hours, winter many vendors decide to stay home. \n\nI'll probably end up going back in the summer, but I'll go early before it gets dark, and the crazy kids (literally kids) come out at night."
3,"I loved the environment, and the staff was incredible.  \n\nthe food wasn't amazing.. just .. good.\nand the cost didn't justify what was on my plate."
3,"Came to TMI for dinner the other night.  It was good, but nothing that special.  We started with the TMI toast which was probably my favorite part of the meal.  Yes, the bread was a bit hard, but still delicious.  I had the Mac & Cheese and was less than impressed.  It was very oily and lacked flavor.  I've never really met a Mac & Cheese that I didn't get along with...until TMI.  The other people in my party had sandwiches and salads and they seemed to like their dishes.  \n\nOverall, nice atmosphere but REALLY hot inside, a little too loud to have a decent conversation and the food was just okay.  Probably won't be back here in the near future."
3,"I was surprised to find that had a TON of brand new irrigation supplies. As a gardener, I am always fiddling with the irrigation, and am in constant need of emitters, hose, and connectors to support my filthy habit. They have it all (at least when I went), and at a fraction of what the hardware store charges."
3,"It's a fun place to go. I love sharing my food family style so this place is great for me. The dishes we chose were hit and miss, though. An eggplant and goat cheese dish had the eggplant so thin, it was overwhelmed by the 90% cheese portion. An egg/potato/something else dish was very... potatoey, though what was I expecting from it huh? Filet mignon and Thai beef salad were delicious though. Glad I tried it, but probably wouldn't return."
3,"So we hadn't been since this place used to be Cafe Del Sol (yes, a few years ago). We used the Groupon we had purchased about a month ago. It was kind of awkward because there's the main dining room and a separate red-headed step child dining room around the corner, not really attached at all to the main dining room and probably all the excitement. We got there right at the end of happy hour and wifey ordered a glass of Sangria, I had a glass of Tempranillo (that totally blew by the way).  I ended up ordering another glass of wine (don't remember the name) and it was pretty good. I got the cola and pineapple braised short ribs, jalapeno cream corn a chile corn casserole. The sides were good, although the corn casserole was a tad dry. The shorts ribs were great, they didn't have that cheap pot roast taste that some braised short ribs can have. The sauce was a bit thick for my taste, but not a huge deal. Wifey had the grilled shrimp appetizer with avocado and mango sauce appetizer and the empanadas. She loved her food. I wasn't a fan of the empanadas. but the shrimp were pretty good. Overall, I think it's a pretty good place and it's nice to have another option in the area. Would I choose to go back? no, probably not, but I know the wife will make me go back at some point."
3,Cool dive bar and a nice break from the normal las vegas scene.  Went in a friday night after getting free beer coupons handed to us on fremont street.\n\nWas pretty empty for weekend night.  Bartenders are as advertised.  Extremely loud with the megaphones bordering on obnoxious.  Fun though.  Be aware though bartenders will bait you into buying shots including for them and then your bill skyrockets.  Didnt think that was cool.
3,"I have stayed at the Hotel Monte Carlo Las Vegas numerous times, and I'm ready to move on to other hotels.  Its outdated, the food at the main cafe and buffet are so-so, however the rates were pretty fantastic.  Compared to the other hotels, especially the newest arrivals, it shows its age.  \n\nHowever, I do like it that the concierge will put hotel guests on the VIP list to get into Haze, and other nightclubs in the vicinity.  That was a cool feature we appreciate, and at no cost to the concierge for to get in.  \n\nIf its deals you are looking for, and \""decent\"" rooms, it is worth looking into."
3,"I've only frequented the one in Henderson on Sunset and the one on South Rainbow, both have been great for breakfast, the steak and eggs especially.  The happy hour at the South Rainbow location, with $2 drafts and 1/2 price appetizers. fantastic.  For that, these two places get an \""A\"".\n\nBut as someone noted, their reward card is now pretty much of a joke.  They changed the earning levels so dramatically, it would take me years to get a $10 credit...so on that, and for doing so without any advance notice or taking into consideration past credits earned, they get an \""F\"".\n\nSo they have 3 stars, the average between an \""A\"" and a \""F\""."
3,"It was ok.... the ordering system was a little confusing, but I am a smart girl and I figured it out. I was looking for a good burger and I found one just the way I wanted it, and the onion rings were good. Its just missing a little personality....?"
3,"This was a typical resort restaurant the food was fairly ambitious and the food was pricey. I had the chicken because almost any other entree was really pricey, and almost solidly steak. Never the less the food was pretty good and the service was great. Unfortunately the table next to us lit up and then it was pretty smokey, but we were already done, and we chose to sit outside so that I don't blame them for at all. In the end it was a little too pricey for what your gonna get, some good food but also it was the resort and I wouldn't expect anything different. I probably won't be back, our server was really nice though that's the only reason I feel bad about giving this place 3 stars. Other than that it was all around ok."
3,"It's amazing what a few blocks can do, in this case... not much if you're heading further East. I love me some Lao Laan... never really had Lao prior to moving to Madison. But I just don't get the same attentive service, sweet menu recommendations and authentic experience I so often found on Willy. What gives? The menu is more compact but the dining room is bigger, so it's perfect if you need room to groove, but other than the size, I think Willy is probably you're best bet if you're looking for curry east of the capitol."
3,Good Burger but on the pricy side for what you get. I work nearby and was hoping for a lunch deal but they aren't open for lunch. Pleasant staff and service was good but no lunch no return trips.
3,"Nice but the menu it is stil the same  for the past 6 years...we are in Montreal \n\nAnyways, the best dish for me is the radish oyster  cannot get enough of the stuff. 12CAD$ for 4 oysters is well worth it\n\nthe rest to my taste was quite ordinary, not worth the money"
3,"I came in to pick up a new laptop charger and get the upgrade to Lion OSX.\n\nGetting the charger was easy enough, but because I'm on Leopard and not Snow Leopard, I have to buy *two* OS upgrades to get to Lion. Ok, that's fine and all, but the stores don't carry the upgrade from Leopard to Snow Leopard. Excuse me?\n\nMy only options were to find a Best Buy that may or may not have the Leopard to Snow Leopard upgrade disc in stock, or order it online and wait several days for it to arrive. They can't keep a few discs in stock at the Apple store? Absurd.\n\nOther than that total stupidity, the location was fine, store was clean (albeit busy at an odd time), and employee that checked me out was nice enough."
3,"Cheap, decent, workman-like meals. Go in expecting a diner serving diner food and you will be satisfied. The service is decent, the food is decent and the price (especially for its proximity to the Strip) is great.\n\nDon't let the 3 stars fool you. It truly is A-OK."
3,"decent... i had the \""sin city\"" burger. i liked it very much. my wife had a classic which i didnt like but i'm not sure what she had on it. she liked it so i guess thats what counts. the sweet potato fries werent that great. i didnt like the way they were seasoned. the regular fries were ok. all in all it was pretty good. its better than most fast food burgers...."
3,"Pretty good for kids, average to below average for adults.  Friendly staff, good price.  Not the best tasting, but you can tolerate a slice or 2.  Limited dessert and salad options."
3,"If you're looking for a sweet, maybe one with some chocolate or even a big sundae - this is your place. Nice old-fashioned ice cream shop located in old town. This place still has the retro pink vibe and decoration going on inside. \n\nMy friend and I came here when we were looking to splurge with the buster brownie sundae. BOY is It sweet but worth it! Sugar Bowl also serves food, which I was unaware of but probably wouldn't order. Service is friendly."
3,"I've had dinner here a few times including delivery, and the hype really died down.  There are so many 5 star reviews that yelpers may start thinking it's flawless, when really it's just a fresh wing with awesome sauce (lol, awesome sauce). I really enjoy the Golden BBQ & order that each time. We've also had the Citrus Chipotle, Jamaican Jerk & Sweet Chili. All had their own unique flavors.\n\nThe boneless wings still are delish & large (chicken tender size). The delivery is fast and efficient.\n\nService is deff hit or miss. I've had really great service somethings, but not-so-good counter service a number of times (i eat here reallllly often, so not sure of the ratio lol) \n\nMy waffle fries that I upgraded to were completely well done. Not a taste of potato.. more like potato chips. I love waffle fries too :/\n\nSo again, great wings & and great mix of sauces, but don't let all of these fabb reviews fool you."
3,"So, I have this weird affliction that makes me feel really uncomfortable when someone puts a HUGE plate of food in front of me. I wanted the chile rellenos, but not the supersized plate! Alas, such is the state of dining in most restaurants these days, but seriously, if I would have known the portions were this big I would have shared my dinner with my friend.\n\nStill, for Vegas we got a table on a Friday night with no wait and no reservation, the service was very attentive, and the bill was reasonable. My mojito was quite tasty also. So go, share, and enjoy!"
3,A Charlotte staple in need of a makeover. Generally solid food but sometimes inconsistent - biggest challenge is the atmosphere which is stale and hasn't kept up with the rest of the Charlotte restaurant scene. You can't go wrong by a visit to PC - especially if the weather is nice and you get to sit on the excellent patio. Salads are great here.
3,"Stopped by here to get a drink before eating out. The place was loud, very loud. Loud from people shouting at the big screens (not sure, something with men on ice skates!), loud from birthday parties all over the place, and loud from the loud music playing. \nIt's mainly a gin bar, so don't expect anything exciting about their beer menu, but their gin and gin cocktails menu is attractive. We tried the one with the Quebec gin (Ungava) and maple syrup and even though I'm not much into gin, I really liked it (but then put maple syrup into anything and I will love it!)\nIt's a bit on the expensive side - 20$ for a beer and a cocktail (I will never, and I mean never, get around to having to add taxes and tips everywhere here!) - but the service was great. The waitress was obviously running between those big parties tables flagging here at every chance but still managed to take care of us in due time.\nGlad I went as we've been meaning to try it since the day we moved in the area though :-)"
3,"This is easy to confuse with Central Library, but this is hwere they keep the special books - all the special books.  Central Library is just a normal library.\n\nTo come read these books you will have to apply at the registration desk for a pass (with ID) that will last for either a few days or about 3 months.\n\nIf there is a secific old book here you want to see then you should definitely come here to see it, but if not then this is a lot of fuss over reading a book and you'll be better going elsewhere."
3,"Good sports bar/restaurant--if that's your thing.\n\nWent here when visiting with my dad who suggested it as \""one of those new fun places.\""\n\nThe stuffed portabella mushroom appetizer was delicious, though ridiculously decadent.  The carnitas libre pizza was also pretty good, but also extremely rich--i.e. you can taste your arteries clogging.  The pollotate pizza was bland and dry--potatos on pizza is fun in theory, but I'm not convinced.  However, the cook forgot the onions on it, which actually might make a substantial, positive difference.  We okayed the oversight (they've only been open for two months) and they comped our bill a bit, so that was nice.  The service was pretty great, actually.\n\nThere's a ton of TVs here and a well-stocked bar with loads of beers on tap.  So if that's your thing, it's probably one of the better sports bar/restaurants out there.  For me, if I'm going to waste the kinds of calories that are packed into these dishes, it had better be for something extra special, which this place just isn't."
3,"Popped in for lunch after a little AM yoga sesh today.  Had been by after my initial trip to Union on opening day - they weren't open when I was there then.  Weirdly, at 11:45 today half the stores in Union were open, half weren't.  Anyway, TDP is super cute.  Love the tables, love the outdoor seating and the small bar.  The staff was super friendly and helpful with our orders.  I could really taste the olive oil on my sandwich and the bread was nice. \n\nOverall, the food was good, but not great and definitely overpriced. $9 for a Caprese sandwich is ridiculous - and the tomato on this one wasn't ripe.    The meatball sandwich needed more sauce.  The chicken salad sandwich looked great, but again, for such small sandwiches I would expect fruit or salad or something.\n\nI think next time I'll just enjoy the free smells, and buy a bottle of delicious olive oil from their store across the way."
3,"Jersey Mike's didn't make me weak in the knees but it is clean, efficient and friendly.  The menu is a little difficult to read for a first timer, so the zig zag lane where you order your food made me feel a little rushed. I went at lunch time and it was packed.\nThe mini sub is what should really be called a regular.  The regular is quite large and the other size is enough for three people.\nThe club had plenty of meat on it.\nIt was difficult to tell the difference between the white and wheat sub rolls, but they were not bad.\nThe most interesting thing was the cups the drinks come in.  There are several different cups with the stories of various Jersey Mike's that have done fund raising for feel good causes. I want to believe this is true because we all like to think we are patronizing do-gooder companies.\nIt may just be branding, I haven't had a chance to really check it out yet.\nI would go back, but I want to try something spicier next time."
3,"Los 7 Compadres has a variety (20) of combination platters for about 7 bucks.  Between my wife and I we had 7 items on our combination platters, which we shared.  7 has been a recurring number for us starting with the OYE at Malee's.  Including the rice and beans, the sour cream and the guacamole this gave us an astounding number of possible combinations for each bite.  \n\nA bite of chicken enchilada.\nA bite of chicken enchilada with rice.\nA bite of chicken enchilada with beans.\nA bite of chicken enchilada with guacamole.\nA bite of chicken enchilada with sour cream.\nA bite of chicken enchilada with rice and beans.\nA bite of chicken enchilada with guacamole, rice and beans.\nA bite of chicken enchilada with sour cream, rice and beans.\nA bite of chicken enchilada with sour cream, rice, beans and guacamole.\n\nPlay this out again with the burrito, cheese enchilada, tamale, beef enchilada, bean enchilada, etcetera.  All of the food was good.  Portions were generally large.  I found the tamales to be the least satisfying item.  They were a bit dry and the dominant flavor was just the spice of jalapeno.\n\nNote-even the mild here has a real bite.  Overall I'd give them 3.5 stars.  Good enough for a return trip."
3,"Well, this place is puzzling and I'm not going to save the bad news for last.  They seem to pride themselves on allowing and maybe even promoting smoking.  It's puzzling because the beer selection is extensive.  The menu is above average, as is the food.  Lots of pizzas, sandwiches, appetizers.\n   BUT, who wants to go home smelling like a filthy ashtray?  It would be great if they joined the rest us in the twenty-first century."
3,"Well...I'm super excited that there is finally, finally some V-food in downtown Phoenix.  The more ethnic cuisine around the better.  It is in a convenient location on 1st and Adams.  The kitchen area is open to the public (a first I think I've ever seen).  I ordered take out and everything I needed was in there.  The plus, fast service.  The minus, I felt like things were not quite as tasty as some of my other standbyes.  The prices also reflect the snazzy downtown locale, a dinner for two came out to be closer to 30 bucks (which is still a bargain) but I'm used to about 15-20 at the divier joints.  I'm still going to support them when I'm in a pinch for takeout or lunch downtown, but if I'm craving the authentic and frenetic pace of a Vietnamese eatery I'll have to head out to the avenue's for some of the more established dives.\nDidn't have the bahn mi (they were out).  Had a standard buhn dice which was nice but i'm used to the nom plah a little sweeter with more garlic.  The egg rolls are good, (not filled with just veggies).  The spring rolls are missing my favorite, shrimp!  The omlette dish is an acquired taste, and I'll leave it at that :)"
3,"Chinatown in Montreal is small (1 - no matter where in the world we go, my mom ALWAYS has to have rice at least once a day 2- they have the fruits my family travels to Canada for) and this is a reliable resource for good, cheap roast pork/duck over rice. Their beef pan fried noodles are not great (as in, not something I would order again). Their wonton noodle soup is pretty good: I got it both times we came here. General Tso'c chicken was pretty good: again, something my family ordered both times we came.\n\nOverall, nothing crazy and nothing that's a must see in Montreal. The service is OK (if you get a waiter that speaks English well, then the service is good, if not, the inability to effectively communicate causes some frustration. The food comes out fast, so if you're starving, this is a good place to go. Their bubble tea is alright: stops a craving, but it's not great. They do get brownie points for giving baby bochoy with everything and for the HUGE food portions."
3,"Dropping down to three stars ... On a recent visit, I saw TWO roaches on the main floor of the restaurant. No one seemed to care, so I got up and stepped on one.  I pointed out the other, and one of the staff killed it, but they didn't seem surprised.  I know that roaches are hard to control, but having two of them wandering about in a busy restaurant just isn't a good thing. \n\nAlso, our waiter was an overly chatty guy who seems to think we are interested in his voice.  They had some good staff in the past, but I suspect the owner, who likes to get drunk and hang out on the patio, gives me the impression of a guy who would be difficult to work for! \n\nThe food is still decent and better than anything else I've found, but I'm looking for alternatives ..."
3,"While $29.99, $32.42 with tax, proved to be too much for this feast.  While there was a lot offered at good quality, it wasn't worth the price as compared to some of the finer hotels.\n\nI was there at 10:15am on a Saturday.  Mimosas are served, and I had two (delicious).  They had a good amount of breakfast and lunch items,  and I had a little of each.  Yes, lunch is already served.  Brunch.\n\nNothing was outstanding, but all was good.  It isn't an enormously large buffet, but ample nonetheless.\n\nI think I would go back if 1) I was drunk, 2) I had a hankering for AYCE, 3) I was stuck without my car, 4) held hostage, 5) I was drunk.  Oh I said that.  Well, if the price was less...I would go."
3,"I like Mexican food and I like Chinese food, so why not? Interesting menu. The Jade Red Chicken is as good as any Orange or General Tso's you'll find, and I like that there is a wide variety of choices here. Good food, especially if you like spicy!\n\nI have one beef with this restaurant, and that is the cleanliness. Walking in, you'll notice that the decor and general feel of the place is very low budget. Uncomfortable seating, very weathered ceilings, and generally messy. No big deal. But the restrooms were disgusting, the eating area was dirty, and the trash was overflowing. The place was busy, but there's no excuse for the condition of the men's restroom! It looked like something (or someone) exploded in a truck stop restroom on a state highway. I would have chalked it up to a busy night, but the door and walls were filthy (almost black) with handprints from weeks (if not months) of neglect. All but one of the trash bins were over-stuffed, and most of the tables were dirty. We didn't see anyone cleaning anything. I'm glad I didn't go into the restroom until after I ate!\n\nIf it were my business, I would put at least a few dollars toward general maintenance and upkeep. Maybe even invest in a few nicer tables & chairs. If it were close to clean, I'd give at least 4 stars."
3,"Just quickly ran in and grabbed some stuff for dinner. Never been inside of this store until today. It's okay. I don't think the fruits and vegetables are the best but they'll do in a time crunch (because the store is located near the house) but I would prefer Safeway for fruits, vegetables and possibly meats. Prices are average - specials on some things but nothing out there that makes this store stand out."
3,"My first visit was decent, but didn't quite live up to my expectations.\n\nI food just wasn't that good for a steakhouse. Neither my wife and I cared for our appetizer. We got the Fire-Grilled Fresh Artichoke. They say it is a popular choice, but I didn't like it at all. My burger was very plain and lacked good taste. It made me wish I had gone to Five Guys instead. My wife got the steak and thought it was OK, but later she ended up getting sick. She ordered off the gluten-free menu as she has sensitivities, so this place may have issues with cross-contamination.\n\nOne positive was our friendly server. Cassie was excellent and we were very pleased because we rarely get good service when we go out. She kept up with refills and offered to replace anything we didn't like. I also wrote about my visit and explained how I didn't like the food. The manager said he would send us a coupon, so I can appreciate that they are reaching out to their customers.\n\nI got good vibes from sitting at the restaurant. I like their tables and seats. I think I will give it a second chance, but the food has to be better if they want to win me over as a customer."
3,"We were the only ones in there on a sunday afternoon which I thought was weird after my friend raved about this place. Our food came out so fast that they would not even have had time to microwave it and put it on a plate so I know everything was pre-made. Food tasted alright just tons of bones in the chicken and the fried pork was so hard I almost chipped my tooth. Is this how you cubans prefer it? \n\nParking lot is around back. Absolutely ensure that you lock your car and DO NOT walk alone in this immediate area. \n\nI would go back but I would try to order something on the menu that they hopefully will make fresh. I gave them three stars for being very friendly, being bilingual, and for not giving me food poisoning."
3,"Is this place closed now, or just \""under renovation\""??\n\nI've been many times for lunch, and have decided that the barbacoa torta is my absolute favorite menu item.  Nothing else on the menu seems very special.  Actually, I tried the breakfast burrito, too....a little disappointed in the proportion of potato to chorizo, especially considering the price and size."
3,"Food was creative, flavored were good. Appetizer portions reasonable for the price and quality. Main courses however is where they fall short. Portions were far too small for the price, about $6-10 more than should be depending on what you order. Bread was a but dry for brioche but a nice light bread to have with the meal. Wine selection is very good and varied. Coming from a food town like Portland, this restaurant is nothing special but is a great addition to the chandler/sun lakes area. I would not return for dinner but would for apps and a glass of wine. They were not very busy for a Friday night either so I suspect many others feel it is overpriced for dinner, too. Would re-evaluate that for longevity.\nNice atmosphere too despite odd strip mall style location."
3,"Some of the best cocktails in town. Only downside is some bartenders make them better than others. Love the mojitos! Reasonable prices. Nice decor. Nice crowd. Nice music. I went for brunch and had a lobster omelette.. I found it had a bit too many different flavors for my taste, but I'm sure others would love it, as I'm kind of picky. The guava mimosa wasn't too good though."
3,"I'm upgrading to 3 stars because the service is awesome.  Of course, there was about a 1:1 ratio server to guests so....\n\nThis place is not doing very well so I do feel bad, however, there are some obvious reasons.  The prices are very high and the portions are not very big.  So for the amount of food you get, the items are very overpriced.  Burgers, skewers, sandwiches and salads are all around 10, pizzas between 10-15.  Everything is a la carte and you get about 3 appetizer size skewers for the entrees.  Appetizers are about 10 as well, and desserts are 7 even with the option to add ice cream for 1.  \n\nI will say the burgers are better than the Grind - they actually stay together!  (the bun falls apart easily at the Grind and makes eating hard after a couple bites).  The fries were good ($5).  The pork skewers were passable but nothing special.  The Dorito potato skins were nothing special - just had a wedge of cheesy chip stuck in the middle of it.  The cupcake was good, but the chocolate was a little grainy.  Very small portion for that one..\n\nAll in all, I probably won't go back for anything but happy hour - for the burgers."
3,"What a little surprise in the heart of Verdun..\n\nWe heard of this place through a friend, and having had authentic spectacular Persian food before, I was quite skeptical. However, Parisa did not disappoint!\n\nTheir house soup was really something special (minus the random noodles that seemed out of place).\n\nWe had the sauteed mushrooms to start - I expected them to be sweeter, but they were quite good!\n\nWe then had the lamb (AMAZING) and the chicken drumsticks (not bad) as our main dish.\n\nThe service was great, the host was super friendly, and the atmosphere was nice and quiet. \n\nFor a BYOW place, it's definitely a nice place to go. Try it, and definitely do not miss out on the soup! Super good!"
3,I tried this place after seeing it in the loafer so many times with rave reviews. I enjoyed my burger and fries although my guest didn't so much. I will note that they DO NOT have air conditioning. I was melting...
3,"This place is OK, not too flashy, but OK. Our family of 12 called an hour before for reservations on a busy thursday and managed to get great seating without a wait. The waitress was phenomenal, totally on top of her game and didn't batt an eyelash when she kept being sent too and froo by various sections of the table (we tipped her really well). However, the food was slightly above mediocre. My potatoes were overly cooked, and the sausage tasted wrong. My omlette was also tasting strange and was rubbery. So service was wonderful, but the food was meh."
3,"Decent bar, nice patio though it can be loud on E-Wash.  Good place to relax with a nice beer however I was disappointed they did not have more Belgians after being places like Brasserie V.  It would fit well with the decent bars on Willy street, but has the bonus of being porn-shop adjacent."
3,"The decor of this place is really neat. It's dim and intimate inside (in fact, it's so dim they have to give you a menu that lights up!) and they have some really comfy chairs to sit on. The DJ who was working on Saturday night was playing some fun music, but the volume was a little too loud for a \""lounge.\""  I could only talk to the people sitting immediately next to me, and even then I had to yell a little.  The patio was a nice escape from the loud music.  They had a lot of seating out there and a nice view of the courtyard to people watch."
3,"I often stop in this place when Im at Tempe Marketplace to get a drink and relax.  They usually have some decent drink specials and they have a nice big bar.  The bartenders usually take a little effort to order from, not really sure why that is, maybe I just have bad luck."
3,"Hmmm I am American and I grew up in the NYC area, so I am fairly confident that I know good Italian food when I taste it.  I am not saying that the food isn't good, but it definitely did not blow me away.  We came here because it was listed as a Top 10 Best Restaurant in Edinburgh, according to The Guardian and I definitely would not rate this in my top 10.\n\nHowever, with that being said, the service was fantastic.  Our servers were all very friendly and attentive.  The portions here are enormous and we did feel that they mislead us into ordering more food than we needed because we did ask if the starters were big enough to shared and they recommended that we order two.  Both plates were huge and we certainly could have just shared one between the two of us.  Not to mention the entrees were enough for 2-3 people to share.  So come hungry!\n\nAmbiance has a little bit of a corny feel but also reminded me a lot of any Italian spot in suburban New York / New Jersey, in the sense that there was Frank Sinatra playing in the background the entire time and the servers were a little over the top trying to prove their Italian-ness (actual, and not the macho mobster Guido kind we see over here in the States)."
3,"So, in the last two weeks I have come here for two separate issues.\n\nThe first, being that I stupidly fractured my coccyx (tail bone). I was seen after a short wait, and taken care of promptly and thoroughly. Dr. Guy did a good job at taking care of my situation, requested an immediate x-ray and saw me right after I was done to discuss my results, options, and pain relief methods. You never know how valuable a body part is until it's battered, leaving you completely dysfunctional and in mind-blowing pain.\n\nThe second, I was having severe bursts of pain in my abdomen. I went to the clinic first because it happens to be right around the corner from where I live, and I needed to be seen immediately. I was shaking, crying, pale and obviously in extreme distress. Although I understand this is simply a clinic, the fact that I was turned away due to over capacity came as a shock. Considering the severity of my ailment, I would have appreciated it more if a doctor had seen me, even if temporarily, just to help relieve the pain I was in as I awaited my transportation to the emergency. \n\nI will still come here in the future when push comes to shove, but my last experience wasn't so great and has shown me that they are not willing to bend the rules in extreme cases that involve a person's wellbeing and health."
3,"I don't hate it. \nI don't love it. \nI'm very blah about it.\n\n\nInitially wanted to come here after seeing pictures on Instagram. I was super excited as I was hoping for snow like that from Hawaii snow places, like Snow Factory or Frost City.\n\nMy friends and I had #3, #4, #5 respectively. I don't like the \""popping pearls\"" in my #5 so, I replaced it with butterfinger.\n\nI'd like to say it was similar in texture being kind of creamy but, they need to improve on their flavors. I got to samps the taro, green tea, and \""kuma snow\"" (whatever flavor that it) and it was whatever......it quenched my thirst in this heat we're having.\nI'd like to see more variety ---- I'm thinking of the variety that Snow Ono food/shave ice truck had --- I miss horchata flavor, I guess.\n\nI loved how the decor is all bright and cute. Tryna get the whole Asian-kawaii market. I mean, that's what got me.....very Instagram worthy pics outta here.\n\nOverall, I'll be back. Businesses tend to get better in time ***cross fingers*** \nI wanna bring more people so we can \""samps\"" more things; this way I don't base this review on just 3 flavors."
3,"I have heard of this place, but never made it over until now.  I was there to support a fundraiser for an elementary school.  What can I say, it looks just like the skating rinks I grew up with in the 80's.  Not sure what kind of improvements have been since.  The evening we were in there the A/C must not have been working because it was hot as heck and smelled like a gym locker room.  But the concession stand prices can't be beat, the music was current and fun, and ALL the skaters, of every age group, looked like they were having a blast!  And you can even bring in your OWN roller blades if you prefer the single row of wheels versus the four wheels.  They even knock a $1 or so off your price.  So as long as you are looking for an old school joint, and not a modern updated place, check it out!"
3,"Good place. The restaurant was clean and pleasant. The food was good too. My wife and I had the clear eggrolls with peanut sauce. We eat these whenever we have Vietnamese food. Fairly straight forward. Not bad.\nWe also ate the combo pho soup. Very generous portions! Good job. The soup itself is reminiscent of fish sauce/mint/and some other requirement. It seems obviously made for American taste buds. It wasn't very spicy. You can do that yourself I suppose. But still for the inducted, you also require a more robust base to start with. If you want a more authentic soup, it is not here. \n\nThey had a small menu. Sometimes that is a good thing, as it helps from choice overload. However, there were some other Vietnamese dishes, I would have liked to see.\n\nThe service was friendly and quick. Overall they did just fine. We may return in time to see how they grow."
3,"We held a co-worker's going away party here and I have to say that for a group of 16 people and one child-they did really well at serving us. The guac was good and I really liked their \""hot\"" salsa that you have to ask for. The sangria is overly sweet but the house margarita on the rocks was better. The meals were so-so. I had some tired chicken enchilada's, but they werent horrendous, just pretty boring. My favorite thing about the whole night was hitting up the Trader Joe's in the same complex after dinner!"
3,"The view is amazing for 360 degrees... The ambiance is quite chill and the DJ on Friday night is decent. Mostly top 40 and EDM infused mixes playing through the speakers. \n\nThe late happy hour is only for food and the reason this place gets a couple of stars knocked out of the sky is because of the service and the food that is served. The buns on the sliders were hard enough to break a window on impact and the calamari was soggy (probably microwaved for happy hour). It also took forever for the waitress to make her way around to us. I could have taken the stairs to level 0, walk to the liquor store and walk back up the stairs to Level 107 before she came back with our order. \n\nThis place has a lot of potential, it just needs a facelift in a few places. The view is main reason this gets 3 stars."
3,The people here are super friendly and nice. Yhe reason I gave only three stars is one their liquid flavors was missing somethin.  I think if they remixed a few  flavors it would be a little better. And the second reason is that their liquid is pricey. Like 21 bucks for one bottle.
3,"Heard A LOT of good things about this place but somehow I don't seem what all the good rants about this place where. I came with high expectations due to the fact that friends and colleagues but they have come to disappoint me in Las Vegas. We came around 1 so it was considered to be the brunch time. It was majority breakfast food with some salads, and other lunch options. \nBut what I ca say was good was their chicken wings, saian chow meain and fried rie, the alfredo pasta, and the calamari skewer. Everything else was just plain jane to my eyes and my stomach. All my friends know that i'm a huge dessert fanatic so I went big on the dessert bar, but I only find just a mere of the plates appealing and taste worthy. The chocolate dipped strawberries, cheesecake and the thai ice cream were my favorites out of my whole plate! THE THAI TEA ICE CREAM IS THE ONLY REASON WHY I GAVE THEM AN EXTRA STAR! IT is a must try for all my thai tea lovers out there! \nJust your average buffet for about $30 a person with a okay food, with an exception of a great dessert which was in fact the thai tea ice cream!"
3,= = = = = =  CLOSED  = = = = = =\n\nSorry to see Him's JL close.  I liked the place.     :-(
3,"Nice and clean buffet, lots of seating. Didnt mind paying $13 per person but then was alittle disapointed when i noticed they had a huge selection of pork to choose from. Not a huge pork fan, would rather take my $13 next time and eat at Buffet@asia because they have more selections to choose from, more seafood and mongolian bbq."
3,"My wife and I were roaming the industrial and business park area of Phoenix looking for a decent bite to eat, preferably Mexican food. We finally stumbled upon a set of about five Mexican eateries. We decided on Salsitas, which seems to be a chain in the Valley of The Sun.\n\nI wished that the woman had done a better job of speaking and understanding English. The food order was correct, and plentiful, not to mention cheap, but we had specifically asked for forks and were not given any. I had to go to our hotel's front deck and beg the clerk for a couple of plastic forks. \n\nThe burrito was huge and very tasty. I had a couple of Grilled Chicken mini-tacos, and while they were pretty good, they were nothing special and I even found a few pieces of gristle. My wife had a chicken burrito and said it was huge and very good. She could not finish it. They also gave us some hot carrots so that scored well with her.\n\nTen bucks for all of that, including four salsas and sour cream. Not bad, but I'd like to try more."
3,"Its an ok place... I wouldnt reeeeeeeally go here if we weren't invited with a table. The place is very small which would be great if there wouldn't be 200 people cramped on 2squaremeters. I felt like I was in China or subway in NYC. At least the people smelled good, unlike NYC subway. A lot of fake plastic chickerias running around there. Hard to guess their age so I felt comftable, being only 27 myself of course.\nThe drinks are EXPENSIVE!! I got us 3 shots since I didnt feel like some metrosexual spikedhairguy buying me drinks, and I can afford my own. Well... it was 36$, yes you read right, for 3!! shots. I asked where the diamonds are cause I couldnt find them in there.\nI wrote on the slip too that \"" I aint no rich bitch \"" under gratidue. SORRY bartender dude. But with these prices you should get the novel price.\nOh well, its still fun. Make sure you PRE BOOZE heavily or bring a dude along that has a platinum credit card."
3,"This is your perfect place to bring someone after going out.\nInstead of going to macdonald or some fast food joint this place is cheaper,healthier and quicker than any fast food store.\nPlus you can grab something for breakfast the next day.\nNo matter what time i go i always see people baking fresh bagel.\nI'm more of a conservative guy so i usually take sesame bagel or butter bagel.\nHope this help,\n\nCheers,\n\nEric Van Nguyen"
3,"As Demetria said, this place is definitely hit and miss. If you want some good eats, get here early. They tend to run out of the real goodies.\n\nFried-chicken, when it isn't too overcooked/dried out, is a home run. I just wish they would perfect cooking it. I swear it alternates every other visit having it cooked perfectly.  Their six-cheese spaghetti is pretty good but can suffer the same fate at the chicken. Sides are plentiful to choose from. Mac-n-Cheese..same case as above. It's a home run if it hasn't been too burnt on top. Love their blackeyed peas and cornbread too. They might just have the best lemonade in Charlotte and I'm too scared to ask if it's just a brand-name mix. I really don't want to know. If you can bypass one of the volunteer's who fills up the drinks, you can make yourself a pretty slammin' Arnold Palmer.\n\nSpeaking of the volunteers, they're always extremely friendly and will even give you an extra dollop of mac-n-cheese if you know how to charm 'em like I do. Be sure to tip at the register.\n\nYour pal,\nWalter"
3,"Warning: This review is mostly based on service and lack of information, rather than food!\n\nWe came here for happy hour and I was going to give this place 4 stars, but they get minus 1 for not advising us where to sit for happy hour prices... and no, I didn't think to ask \""geee...what is the designated happy hour seating?\"" We were the first people there and they just told us to sit where ever we wanted. Also, by the time we left, there was only one other couple and they were definitely not getting the happy hour prices either.\nNote: Happy hour seating is ONLY at the bar and bench.\n\nThe food and selection was tasty but I've had better in San Diego. I guess I need to try the other tapas joints in the area to provide a better comparison. And I do agree with others that it is a bit pricey, but some of the dishes were worth it. The red sangria was lack-luster. The lamb was good, but small for the price. The croquettes were a little bland. I think my favorite was the Patatas Bravas with was just roasted potatoes covered in a tomato sauce. It was very basic but tasty and satisfying. \n\nThe bill came to approx ~$60 without tip, and when we checked the happy hour prices on some of the items we ordered, we ended up paying an extra $20 at least to sit at a table instead of the bar."
3,"This place is beautiful inside. I really enjoyed the process of watching the owners transform this great piece of historic modern architecture into something a lot of people could enjoy. \n\nThe other location is cool too, sans the DB scene. I found this location to have scary parking, but good valet service. \n\nThe service was good on my Friday 3pm visit. Was there to celebrate a friends birthday. We had some of the apps (The Trifecta, Double Down, and Crabmeat and Artichoke Dip) and they were good. The waitress was always coming by to check on us and even told us when happy hour started. \n\nYou could tell it was getting close to 5pm. The place was a mad house with 40 something dudes trolling for a place to sit all sweaty from a golf outing. The place is chill and there seemed to be no pretencious DB's. Sure there is a healthy mix of an older crowd, but there was a good mix of younger groups too. \n\nGood amount of TVs so there is always something to watch. It was kind of noisy near the enclosed patio, but we were at a table being loud anyways. There is alot of room to move and enjoy the space, and not to be bumped into. I have only visited just once for a Friday happy hour, stay tuned for a dinner visit."
3,"I would give The Green Owl 4-5 stars for their food, but unfortunately their service really knocks them down. I came here with my boyfriend last week. After we were seated, it took us a little while to flag down our waitress so that we could order. We split an order of crabby cakes; my boyfriend ordered a bowl of chili with sour cream and cornbread, and I ordered the \""meatball\"" sub with kale chips as a side. The crabby cakes came out very quickly, and they were covered with a delicious creamy sauce. We instantly devoured them. My boyfriend is a meat-eating tofu hater, and even he enjoyed these. Upon bringing out the crabby cakes, our waitress told us that our entrees should be out \""very soon.\""\n\nOur food didn't arrive for another 40 minutes, and our waitress never stopped by to assure us that it was on its way or to explain what was causing the delay. Oh well. The food, once it did get to our table, was delicious. My sandwich was piping hot, the bread roll was crispy, and the eggplant meatballs held up well in the sandwich (they weren't mushy) and were flavorful.\n\nI would've liked to try a dessert, but $6 for an average sized portion was a little too steep. \n\nI will probably come back to the Green Owl. Even though the service is lacking, there are so many more items on the menu I'd like to try!"
3,"the food was alright but definitely cost more than it should.  we went for a quick lunch and the service was alright too but the food was not up to par with your typical vegas food.  btw don't get the kim chee, not good."
3,"Came here because Oregano's was packed on a Saturday night.  I wonder how many of their customers are in the same boat.  I was initially craving Mexican food anyway, so I didn't care.  \n\nThe service is awesome, the beer was so cold it was almost icy (read: awesome) and the salsa is yummy yummy.  I ordered the specialty chimichanga and my mom got rolled tacos.  The plates were hu-hu-hu-huge.  And can I just say that cream cheese makes everything better, especially chimichangas.  YUM.  \n\nNot the best Mexican joint I have ever been to, but definitely decent enough to visit again (for the locals)."
3,"I went on a hip hop night and not  much hip hop was played. However, it was still a good time there."
3,"This sushi restaurant has fresh fish and is the best I've found for a reasonable price in the valley (This coming from an east coast foodie who LOVES sushi.) However, the service is bad more often than it is good and NEVER go here in a hurry. I've never made it out of there in less than an hour. Once I went in there and asked for an itemized check, it took them 25 minutes to bring the check back AND it still wasnt itemized. In fact, I still don't know what it was. I love their sushi but its about time for me to find a new sushi restaurant after how many times I've had waitresses be rude and even ignore me. \n\nTheir redeeming quality that kept me coming back so long was their happy hour prices Sunday-Thursday. Its a lot of sushi for a small cost. So if you have plenty of time and don't mind a bad waiter or two check it out!"
3,"Decent store with knowledgeable staff but the prices are a bit higher than other stores. One employee recommended a collar that really helped with our dog that was a puller.\n\nEveryone is friendly. There is a huge selection of many things for many pets. The prices are not bad but a touch high.\n\nBut Banfield. Don't do it. Avoid them. My aunt had awful experiences with \""the plan\"" for their old dog. She was pressured into expensive treatments, they would sometimes not do ones she wanted, and it wasn't exactly cheap. Our experience was the same. We bought 1 year to try it, and canceling took a few tries. They pressured us to do more than we normally would have. And the \""savings\"" included hundreds of dollars in services that most people would not buy.\n\nCome here to get your pet some exercise in the summer. Get food, litter, check sale prices, visit the partnered pet rescue people, maybe grab a treat or toy for your pet. But Banfield felt even higher pressure than our last car purchase."
3,"-Note* Review is for casino/shops/ pool area only. \n\nI don't love it nor do I hate it.\n\nShops: They have a new renovated shops it looks great and clean.  I would probably only enter the Urban Outfitters store. \nPool: I love the beach pool they have going on. They have the waves and sands in their pool.  I always have a great time here and it is never too packed here which I like. \nCasino: It's pretty self-explanatory. All casinos in las vegas is very similar. I do love they have these chandeliers in the ceilings, it is a very nice touch.  \n\nOverall: The casino is clean and pretty much okay.  I don't mind coming here or passing through the casino.  They offer a lot of great restaurant and they have the house of blues. Families can have a great time here and can even check out the Shark Reef in this hotel."
3,"Nice place to take the parents in Vegas... good food, although a bit on the pricey side. Then again, Vegas isn't the place to start scrimping on pennies. The menu had an interesting variety of selections, but the food didn't taste outstandingly exotic. Just your basic American breakfast with a twist here or there. Service was solid and we were seated fairly quickly (although I noticed a growing line right around the peak time for brunch)."
3,"Interior can certainly be modernized, however the food is solid. I'm not a fan of paying to sub hash browns and a english muffin for fruit. Seeing as how I am now paying more for less food. All in all, US Egg is a solid stop in spot every now and then. One of those resturants you're glad that exists, but you'll never take anyone there to show them."
3,The Chilenita they have the best empanada in town. It's a great place to take out or sit down for lunch. The staff is friendly. The food is so good. The price is affordable. There no other place that has 13 different empanada's to choose from. I love the Chilenita.
3,"Food is average with sandwiches being $8-$10.  Had a burger with Pork Barbecue on it and onion straws and an iced tea for about $14.  Little pricey at lunch.  Surprised there was only 1 bartender/waitress for the whole bar area, but she did a good job managing it.  There were probably 20 people at the bar.  The restaurant has a bunch of TV's on sports or trivia.  The restaurant was crowded which is probably due to its location in the USX building."
3,"We went to Red Lobster for lunch just after 2 PM.  It was moderately busy but we were quickly seated.  All three of us had the Endless Shrimp and between us, we had most of the varieties.  All were good, but nothing spectacular.  Service was not exactly speedy, but wasn't slow enough to put me off either.  Everyone was extremely courteous and pleasant.  $57.00 for three lunch specials was more than I am used to paying in a town known for inexpensive food, but it wasn't unexpected.  All-in-all, just as the rating says \""A-OK\""."
3,"It could have all 5 stars if the service was better... Food is very good most of the times, but yesterday my pork kebob had way to many bones! They made me wait for my drink and then for my sauce, so if you like your food without soda and ketchup go for this place:))"
3,The locations in phoenix have chicken we can add to our meal. This location does not. We drove an extra 10 minutes to get here  to find out they don't have chicken was not a pleasant surprise.
3,"Food is good, service is bad.  Have been here twice...both times our order was screwed up.  The second time we received no apology.  Wait staff is reactive instead of proactive.  Food is decent but expect more for the money.  I really wanted to like this place but I have been given too many reasons to go elsewhere."
3,"Food is unique and tasty. Try the ultimate grilled cheese.  Service is poor. Three employees hang around at a table in the bar area chatting while the cook is preparing my food,  lunch came out wonderful but the front of house staff needs to find something to do and pay attention to a the few customers that are in there. I stopped in today at 1 for lunch but they changed their hours they are not open until 3 o'clock weekdays. I feel this place is going to close down quite soon. Prices for pool during promo hours are great."
3,"my best friends girlfriend came for a visit from austin, being an architecture major, this was a place we obviously had to go.\n\nbeing there was obviously amazing... here's my beef... a tour was between $30-$80, seriously.  there was no way we could afford this obnoxious fee so we walked around the house and checked out the gift shop. we were pleased with this, but pretty disappointed not to take the tour."
3,"This is one of our favorite stops for a quick bite, particularly if we have Aria resort credit that we need to spend. I used to only get the baked goods and some chocolates to go for friends and family back home (I like the bear claw in particular), but I recently tried the crepes which I really like. We had a savory one with ham, cheese, and sauteed mushrooms that was great. It also came with a side of greens and baby tomatoes. Our favorite dessert crepe is the one that has the vanilla custard cream on the inside with the mixed berry sauce drizzled on top. The lines are always busy whenever I go but they do a good job moving the customers through quickly. It's definitely pricey though!"
3,"Can't understand why this place is always so packed. Well actually, the sound system is probably the best out of any club on mill. So that part I liked. There is room to breathe once you make it to the pool tables, but it's a battle to get there in the first place. There is a good amount of tables. Overall, so so. But I'll visit another time for further review."
3,"Very colorful, especially if you want to smoke weed surrounded by a bunch of weirdos playing African drums...other than that it is rather boring"
3,"After reading all the good reviews we came here because my wife was in the mood for Indian food.  Its not a big restaurant and It is a buffet.  The mother's day special included a mango lassi (yum!) and  a dolsa (a rolled up pancake with lentil in the middle).  \n\nThe cold bar had varius kinds of churney, a salad, some fruit, and other sauces.  There were also 3 different kinds of soup.  A tomato soup that tasted a bit sour, a lentil based soup, and a spicy soup.\n\nIts got a lot of the standard Indian fare.  What stood out to me was the goat curry.  The goat meat was fall off the bone tender and the curry had an excellent flavor.  Also, the tandoori chicken was nice and juicy.... not dry like a lot of other joints.  The paneer sagg (a spinach and cheese dish) was also pretty good.\n\nThere were some vegetarian dishes but being the carnivore that I am, I did not partake.  I got a taste of India without blowing out my palate on ridiculously spicy food.  That makes this a decent restaurant in my book."
3,"A lot of these reviews made me laugh because I'm not quite sure what people were expecting - it's FAST FOOD, (albeit pricy fast food)lol! I had a Groupon so my friends and I went all out so that we could get a variety of things.  I thought the staff here was really friendly, even bringing food to our table.  The shakes are amazing and I love all the topping options!  The veggie burger is tasty and my friends devoured their beef burgers.  Although the curly fries are the most popular, we decided the skinny fries are the best. Thumbs up!"
3,"UltraStar is new to the Phoenix area. It has a spacious lobby with all the warmth of a airplane hanger. Its corporate vibe is immediately apparent in every aspect of the consumer experience. One can almost sense the calculated, committee-approved decision making that dominates the theatre. \nThe concession stand and gourmet coffee bar must seem amusing to Europeans. The seating area has little ambiance and is certainly not a place I'd spend any time hanging out. Boring.\nThe theatre I viewed the film in was serviceable, but nothing outstanding comes to mind. The film started on time. The UltraStar management really would benefit from a visit to a Harkins theatre to get this whole thing 'figured out.'"
3,"Decent food and the usual waitresses are busy but attentive.  The salads are good but be warned they usually take just as long, if not longer, than other food to come out to your table.  Chicken strips are good and I hear the wraps are excellent.\n\nOther than that everything else is good but not great.  The potato soup is very good but don't order it too often as it is the soup-of-the-day about 90% of the time.\n\nA decent option when you are tired of to-go food in the downtown area or want something besides a sandwich."
3,"While the restaurant itself was nice and the staff was also very nice the food was nothing that I can say was truly amazing. We were expecting a very 5 star experience when it came to the food and we were surprised when the food came out just a few minutes after we ordered. Most everyone in our party thought the food was average, nothing to right home about. We have a restaurant near us called Frida Mexican Restaurant in Glendale,CA and there food is much much better. On the bright side I did order the Nachos and this seem to be the hit on the table So much so that everyone started munching away at my food \n\nSo heres the deal for me, I am always looking for amazing Mexican Food, something above and beyond what I can expect living in Los Angeles. Diego was not it for me, Great looking place, Friendly Staff, with So-So Food."
3,"Let me start by saying that I LOVE the food and flavor combinations at Layers. Also on the fabulous list is that it's organic :). I have been a fan since this new location opened. However, (and this is why I rated only 3 stars, they used to be 5 in my book) I have been disappointed the last few visits. The baked goods remain awesome, but the \""kitchen\"" food isn't as amazing these days. Last time, the pasta has far too much oil which knocked off the entire dish. This time I went for the meatloaf sandwich, The Conservative, and while the flavor combo of yummy meatloaf and carmelized onions snuggled together in a panini were a hit - the presentation was a mess. The bread was so broken and soggy that it really had no business being called a sandwich because I could not pick it up. Had to eat with a fork and knife. I've had this sandwich, or a similar one in the past (when the store opened) and had much more success in getting it from the plate to my mouth in a ladylike fashion.  Maybe the bread was different?  Possibly the chef was different?  Something has changed....\nTo clarify, I would not discourage anyone from ordering anything off the menu, but I just know that Layers can do better than I have recently experienced.  I hope that they will strive for their best because they are one of my favorites!"
3,"Make sure they know if u r in a hurry.  Was disappointed bc I called ahead and gave very specific directions (Please make sure the 3 dozen bialy's are in plastic bags bc I need to pack them in my suitcase.  Unfortunately, they were not and I had to make the taxi wait...  costing me more money.  UGH!  In the long run, it ended up costing $72 for 39 bialys (including taxi)"
3,"Been here twice... the selection seemed about the same... but not so sure. \nIt's like walking into an aunt's house. The workers there are friendly, speak Tagalog to you right off the bat, even if you don't speak it (good or bad? Hmmm) and make sure you're ok for the most part.\nI like the pork gisantes they have, and the pancit is pretty tasty! At $7.99/ person there's not much to complain about. They also sell other goodies and snacks at the register.\nProbably will be back with the fam soon.\n\nHonorable mentions:\nPusit\nDiniguan (dinardaraan)\n\nOhh, parking is somewhat odd. One way only, so make sure you take the correct entrance! Although the lot is small, I usually find parking right away!"
3,"Stopped in here after looking on Yelp for something different. I was pleasantly surprised at the wide selection of fresh authentic Poke. I like that I was able to sample before I bought. I finally chose the spicy avocado ahi. It was good, and mildly spicy. Not over spicy. I really enjoyed this as it was all I had for lunch that day. I know this doesn't look like the place to get amazing Poke(NLV), but you will be happy you did stop in."
3,"After a day at the park I was really hungry and not in the mood for the usual fare on East blvd. so I trekked up to Thai Taste. Walking inside it was the usual traditional Thai decor. The restaurant was small and cozy, but I imagine if I had went at a busier time it might have just felt crowded.\n\nThe menu is laid out so you pick your entr\u00e9e and combo it with choice of meat. I went for the green curry with chicken. Usually when I have green curry it has a decent kick to it due to the paste being made from green chilies and balances out the sweetness of the coconut. This green curry while pretty aromatic seriously lacked some much needed heat. After reading some reviews on here though I'll probably try it again and request it extra hot.\n\nThe prices are pretty reasonable and the service is attentive enough to keep my water glass full which is much appreciated! My meal arrived in a very timely manner and I left full and happy. Probably one of the better Thai places I've been to in Charlotte, I'll have to come back and try out their Pad Thai along with a hopefully spicier green curry."
3,"What can I say it's The House of Blues, if you've seen one you've seen them all. mostly standing room unless you pay for bottle service or the balcony is open. Good sound I have no complaints."
3,"Normally I wouldn't bother to write a review for a Pizza Hut. Or even check in on Yelp. Some secrets are best kept in the family. It's Pizza Hut after all. Everyone knows what they're going to get. \n\nSo what's the motivation this time? I noticed some really bad recent reviews for the carry out location I occasionally use. The workers there, however, are consistently nice and really seem to be trying to do a good job given the limitations that Pizza Hut presents. I just wanted to give them a little \""thumbs up\"". \n\nThree stars, the maximum rating allowed by law for a Pizza Hut."
3,"I've used this restaurant for large dinner parties that were held in their private dining room and they have all been A+ experiences.   This time I made a reservation for 2 in the dining room for a happy birthday dinner.  The restaurant was full and busy and we were seated upon arrival.  Our drink orders were taken promptly but then we waited....\n\nOur waitress took our salad and entree orders and the salad arrived pretty quickly.  She was also assigned to a 10 top table that the chef/owner was hosting so we were ignored by her for the rest of dinner.  We had to flag down the bus person for water refills, asked for additional bread while we waited for our entrees, another request for water refills and a final request for the check.  \n\nThe food was okay - I had angel hair with tomato sauce and husband had gnocchi.  Both were good portions and served steaming hot."
3,"D'abord, le bouquet d'\u00e9pices fait acte de pr\u00e9sence. On se souvient de son bouillon, adroitement appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 de clous de girofle, de badianes, de graines de coriandre et de cardamomes. Diverses variantes sur le m\u00eame th\u00e8me. Les Classiques sont plut\u00f4t impersonnelles avec des coupes de viande plus propres et immacul\u00e9es. Les Aventuriers  se prononcent d'une anatomie bovine moins pr\u00e9venante, flancs gras et tripes croustillantes. Si le d\u00e9faut d'asepsie vous emmerde, s'abstenir de la toilette. Je soustrais  une \u00e9toile pour cette raison."
3,Pasta was good. wine was good. but I cant trust an ITALIAN restaurant that puts Herseys syrup on their tiramisu. Sorry.
3,"I came here because I got a free voucher from a radio station contest I won and dont think I would of came if it weren't free. \n\nThe steak was good but not great and expensive. There is however a sampler entree / mix grill on the menu. About 70 bucks but you get filet, kobe shirt and a new york cut. \n\nThe Kobe shirt was good but it's kobe, never had a bad cut of kobe ever. \n\nThe mash potatoes were pretty good too, I got the trio and the truffle and lobster one was good. \n\nOverall don't think I would go back with so many other great choices out there."
3,"I love their sandwiches but they are VERY over priced AND.... they do not have whole wheat bread.  They were definitely behind the times by not having a whole wheat bread instead of WHITE bread.  Every other sandwich place I know has whole wheat..  Fire House Subs, subway, port of subs, quiznos. etc..\n\nCome on Capriotti's get some damm whole wheat french bread."
3,"MTD is a great way to get to class when the weather is nasty.  However, the buses are often late, so be sure to choose a bus that arrives to your destination a few minutes early.  At least the MTD buses are free to students."
3,"Not too bad!  Been to this location several times, still have not loved it yet.  \n\nThe antipasta platter was ok.  The mozzarella was good; the brushette had too much pesto; and calamari was not crispy enough.  The chicken marsala was ok too.  I tasted more of the grill of the chicken than the marsala sauce.  The mash potatoes were good.    I should have stuck to my usual pasta carrabba.  \n\nThe service is always excellent!"
3,"\""WU DINNAE NEED THEM INGLISH! WU CUN LOOK EFTER WURSEL BUCOZ  WUR A NATION!!!!\""\n\n\""FFFFRRREEEEEDDDOOOOOOMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!\""\n\nThe cultural cringe is alive and well."
3,Decided to go to Einstein for breakfast. It was just before 9am on Sunday morning and the line was literally out the door. I thought about going somewhere else but we decided to wait. Fortunately the line moved fairly quickly and we ordered & paid in about 13 minutes. The dining area is a good size so there were still some open tables. Our food was ready about 4 minutes later. I got the applewood bacon & cheddar egg sandwich on a plain bagel. It was hot and good. A little pricey for what you get though.
3,"I went here for a meet up, we were about 20 people so I was able to sample several dishes.. some were really good some others very bad.. on the good side they offer European beers which is always good :) .\nThe food took a long time to arrive even though we RSVP weeks ahead of time, They were not prepared to serve a large group. On their defense this is a family owned business so the entire family runs the restaurant, I believe mom and dad were cooking and their son was the server. I guess is good thing that we were supporting a family  business in the Valley"
3,"First time coming here today and it's a great place if you want something to satisfy your boba craving without having to drive to Chinatown. I got the boba milk tea with jelly which tasted very similar to volcano tea so I was happy with it, my bf got the taro smoothie which he said wasn't good at all. So I guess it really just depends on what you get and I had to dock off points because there isn't much of a selection as other stores and the atmosphere. Inside of the store is small, plain, and very boring. Kinda makes you feel like ordering and getting out, not a place to hang or relax. Wish they also sold snacks."
3,"I was very excited about playing golf here since its firmly entrenched in one of the more exclusive housing areas in Summerlin called The Ridges.  I was here for a fundraiser so we played shotgun.  \n\nThe golf course is billed as Jack Nicklaus' best holes in one round.  I can definitely see the potential but this time around, I don't think the potential was actualized.  Granted it was over 100 degrees but the course was very dry and the greens spotty.  It was definitely punched recently but wasn't healing as well as it should.\n\nChecked out the club house to see if there's anything to purchase but the guy working at the counter looked right at me then looked away.  I do not expect to be pampered but a hello would be nice.  Needless to say, I didn't buy anything.\n\nAgain, every hole has the potential to be phenomenal with great views of all the beautiful homes as well as views of he strip on a couple of holes.  Unfortunately, I think I caught it during a bad stretch.  I will be back and re-review if I find the experience to be different."
3,"Salads are delicious there jumbo shrimps go perfect on top! There unique dressings to choose from Lime infused ranch was amazing! \n\nCons- Poor customer Service, not helpful when it comes to being undecided or asking for their recommendations"
3,"I have been to NY and had pizza and I am sorry to say this was nowhere near what you would get in NY. We ordered the NY style pizza and it just okay. The place is nice and the service was good, but I do not see myself going there ever again."
3,"I don't know that I would have gotten oil changes for a few years if it hadn't been for this place.  \n\nOne stop shopping for getting an oil change and car wash - and there's a Wendy's right next door to grab some grub while they mess with the car.  They've expanded their offerings recently and now they do things from replacing your headlights to changing out belts.  My last trip there was an oil change, new air filter and car wash for $47 after tax.  They also do a basic car wash from $3.99 and a super was from $7.99.  I've never gotten anything but the basic, and I always find things they missed so while I'm not too impressed with their quality, it's nice to have the basics all taken care of in one location. \n\nThey have 48 hour guarantees on the washes, which is nice and when you get work done it always includes a \""limited time\"" coupon for additional work.  Not a bad deal..."
3,John's place is a good local bar. The decor is pleasing and clean. The food is average. You can order from the Mario's Pizza menu (Which is attached via a hallway) or order from a limited bar menu. I actually enjoy their sliders (chicken or cheese burger). Really tasty. There is usually some type of drink special and enough TV's to get a good view of whatever game happens to be on. Service is good although can be spotty at times. Pretty much a regular crowd via many of the neighborhoods around the area. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here but it is a convenient and nice local pub.
3,"Had a nice breakfast at Gertrude's before checking out the Chihuly exhibit at the botanical garden. My traveling companion and I like to check out the botanical gardens in the cities we visit, and it was nice to have a breakfast option right there on site.\n\nWe both had the breakfast sammies, which were good, despite the fact that I don't think anything should be called a 'sammie.' The coffee was strong, and my only complaint was that it didn't get filled very often.\n\nWe were able to eat on the patio, which was nice since we were visiting the area partially to get away from the cold. It was very comfortable and pretty."
3,"Went here for lunch last week and the place was packed, with a long line! We almost left, but they enticed us back with a fresh tray of lechon kawali (roast pork belly). I had Filipino-style corned beef and potatoes and oxtail stew (\""kare-kare\""). Boy were they good. Small, homey place, in a busy strip mall in a Chinese plaza. Lots of other foodstuffs for sale. The name of this place means \""neighbor\"", but literally it means \""house-connected\"" - shows you that Filipinos have close ties to their neighbors, as a culture. Price is reasonable as $6.50 for two viands and rice."
3,"Store carries high end merchandise and a nice enough selection. But I would have to agree with previous reviewer, the staff needs basic customer service training. Contrary to what one would expect, the older staff members are extremely nice, courteous and helpful, while the younger ones are rude and exhibit totally inappropriate behaviour: talking loudly about personal matters in the presence of customers, showing annoyance and irritation, eye rolling, or completely ignoring shoppers. It's hard to believe a store that brands itself high end does not ensure its staff behave accordingly."
3,"Well, I'm sitting here while my son plays.... Music is so loud you have to shout to communicate.... I asked them to turn the volume down a bit, they did but then turned it back up..... Inappropriate songs come on and staff needs to be told to turn it.... I mean what parent wants their kid listening to a song about a$$ and twerking? Other than these issues (that can definitely be addressed), it's a great place...."
3,"There is nothing really exciting about the Boozery, which is disappointing for it's location. The bar itself is pretty small but they are able to accomodate more with outside seating. It has a nice ambiance inside but the small size of the place cramps the style a bit. They have very limited special drink menu with your average Freemont street drink prices ($7-$10).\n\nThe Boozery is just your average downtown bar. Nothing to complain about, but also nothing to brag about."
3,"I planned an event here with some girlfriends for an early dinner. The place is easy to miss, because it's a small building so if you blink or aren't paying attention you will get lost (trust me...I know). Also, just a head's up with the place being so small parking is a bit of a pain. In fact it's pretty non-existent. There's a few spaces in the front and if you're lucky they have a few in the back...if all those are full....good luck! \n\nThat being said, the menu is pretty simple. I think they are going for down home favorites. There are your staple dishes like meatloaf, burgers, fish and salads. But I just wasn't overly impressed with the menu. I opted for the Veggie Burger and fries. It's your typical Morning Star veggie burger so nothing to be amazed about there and the fries were just okay. \n\nThe service was great but I'm just not sure I'd make it a priority to give them another try. Based on the reviews, their brunch might be worth another visit. We'll see!"
3,"Loud. Very loud. Good for beer, sports and grill grub. Conversation, not so much.\n\nThe beer selection is outstanding. The food is well-prepared and tasty.\n\nThe service was a little slow, and I can't figure out why. Wouldn't make a difference, except that the food was already cooling off by the time it got to the table.\n\nThat said, our server and the owner were very friendly, and the gravy fries and mac & cheese were VERY flavorful.\n\nI live in Glendale, so don't think I'll be driving cross-Valley to go again, but would recommend it to friends who are in that area anyway if they're looking for a fun place to watch a football game and drink really good beer."
3,"(+)\n1. Great location - Located within walking distance to Notre Dame, Old Montreal, Chinatown, Latin Quarters, St. Catherine's, a few arts museums, the metro and a lot of shopping and restaurants.\n\n2. The room was big. Very high ceiling with a king size bed and a small kitchen.\n\n3. Nice and friendly staff. They provided an extra cot with no charge.\n\n4. Free internet - they provide a code to you upon check-in.\n\n5. Free continental breakfast - toast, croissants, cereals, fruits and coffee.\n\n(-)\n1. We requested 2 beds and ended up with a room with only one. We went to talk to the front desk and they were out of rooms to switch us to. But they provided the cot at no extra charge.\n\n2. The towels smell. \n\n3. The parking is $22 a day which is OK. but it has to be valet. If you need something in your car, you have to go through the concierge."
3,"I know this is a rare 3 star review for this place and I will preface it by saying it is the only Las Vegas buffet I have ever been to, so I have nothing to compare it to, but enjoyed the experience.\n\nI went here for dinner while wandering along the strip one night and I thought it was your typical buffet with a wide variety of options that weren't gourmet but still good.  I think the key is to choose the right options.  The crab legs were awesome and totally worth the $20 since I probably ate $30 of legs alone.  Other favorites included prime rib, mashed potatoes, and spicy tuna rolls.  Salad bar was just OK and so were the desserts.\n\nThis is a really good deal if you are hungry! The atmosphere is pretty tacky but it is within the Imperial Palace so that's to be expected."
3,"I've stayed here twice, and had very different room experiences.  Only one side of the hotel is renovated and that of course makes a huge difference.  My boyfriend and I had a room with a king size bed and it was nicely updated and had a great bathroom.  I booked again with the girls and we had rooms with 2 double beds, very dated, worn furniture, old carpet.  If you're going with friends and don't plan on spending much time in the room then it's a good choice based on location and price.  The other negatives is that you have to pay to use the gym and the pool area is VERY crowded...tough to get a lounge chair.  Gambling is OK...but the drink service is a little slow."
3,Maybe my expectations were too high - but food was very disappointing.  It was ok - nothing spectacular or noteworthy.  Therefore it was definitely overpriced.  Wait staff was great though.
3,"Just ordered a pizza and wings for delivery. I picked up my pizza before and I got a weird vibe from the staff. They are very unpleasant, thought if I phoned it in I would get a happy tone on the other end.... WRONG! They need to hire delightful people to work the register and take the phone calls. This will be my last time ordering from them until my free pizza coupon is valid lol! Oh and the pizza's not all that bad! Definitely better than Pizza Hut!"
3,"Hakkasan is located inside the MGM grand. I was on the GL so we went to the GL line and it was free before 1am, so we had to hurry our asses there! We made it & it was free, thank god! Anywayyys, bouncers were nice and they made our transition inside the club pretty smoothly. Once we got in, I immediately noticed how SMALL it was. The dancefloor was sooooo tiny! :( When I finally made my way over, I could barely move/dance. It was literally body to body ... and this was on a day where there's NO ONE famous dj-ing! So imagine how bad the crowd would get if Tiesto or Hardwell was up there .... I wouldn't wanna be there! \n\nBut that's all I can really say because I got super messed up and I can't remember anything else. Only that I couldn't dance at all because there was no room and the parts where it's kinda open, the security made you move :("
3,"I have been to this particular location for eyebrow threading twice.  On both occasions I walked in without an appointment and was greeting right away.  There was no wait and the desk attendant was very professional.  The brow threading person did an excellent job.  I would recommend that she improve her customer service.  She did not ask me how I would like my brows done or even speak to me at all.  Overall, I would come back again since they did make my brows look great!"
3,"For a buffet, I thought this place was pretty good. Food was authentic, the food and spices were prepared the way I remember real Indian food tasting. They had a good selection, even though I had no idea what half of it was. I think next time I may go to an Indian restaurant instead of buffet simply because all the flavors started to meld together and I like just one dish to enjoy, like chicken marsala or curry."
3,"Pretty expensive compared to Ghandi's just down the street.  Food was fine, but not wonderful.  A bit nicer ambience than most Indian places"
3,"I'm not going to lie, I had a really good time at dinner.  The space is gorgeous, and feels as trendy as they are shooting for.  There are catwalk \""stages\"" that go throughout the restaurant where scantily clad dancers are entertaining above you while you dine.\n\nSo why 3 stars?  Well for one, the hostesses were just a little much for me.  I should have had a reservation, I was standing there when my Host made me the reservation on the phone before we left the Hotel, but they claimed to not have received the call.  Regardless, there were clearly tables available, and yet we still had to wait an hour.  It was just annoying that they acted like they were doing me a favor and were pretty frigid each time I asked how much longer.\n\nOur server on the other hand was fantastic.  And the food was.....good.  Not amazing, but good.  An appetizer of Black Cod was well done, where I found the crab cake appetizer to be just OK.  We had a fried shrimp dish app which was also very good.  And the steaks, well it's a Morton's concept, so they were standard, solid Morton's fare.\n\nOverall fun, but with the stupid amount of great restaurants in Vegas, I doubt I would be back."
3,"This is a fun place to eat, but just not my cup of tea.\n\nThe service was very good and is what gets it a passing grade.\n\nUnfortunately, the food was very average. Everything was completely over-seasoned, so much so, that i could only eat half the food, and I was starving. Do not get the special hash and the potatoes on the same plate, they are seasoned nearly identically and would require you to drink a gallon of water to even attempt to finish it all. The quality of everything else though is fairly good though and i think this is why it is popular here. Maybe just stick with waffles and pancakes, they did look pretty good.\n\nIt is hard to say that i would recommend this place, maybe i would if I knew that person loved over seasoned food. It is a fun place though."
3,"Once just a Panera ripoff, Atlanta Bread has since added many more of its own creations. I tried the Italian vegetable panini the other night: tasty but expensive, given the portion size. Even after finishing the pickle and kettle chips that came with it, I felt barely satiated.\n\nDecor is nice, as is the free wifi, but service is somewhat lacking. Nonetheless, this place feels like an adequate option if you're in the mood for a sandwich. (The pastas, however, are quite bland.)"
3,"In a sea of gourmet restaurants sometimes you want something ordinary.\nFor a cafe, it's not bad. We just wanted something \""normal\"" for a late lunch. Alot of places weren't even open yet, many others had a limited lunch menu. It was Sunday with football games on so, alot of the bar type places were packed.\nIt really reminded me of Cheesecake Factory. Lots of menu choices. Staff was nice.\nI got Fried Chicken with Mashed Potatoes, it wasn't greasy, but it was a bit salty, I've had better, I've had worse. The potatoes were a bit bland, but my salty chicken helped even things out. I ordered a Pear Martini and they were out of the ingredients, so I had a delicious Strawberry Martini. My husband got a Cheeseburger and fries, the fries were good, I didn't try the burger but it looked good, he devoured it, and said it was better than he expected.\nI would eat here again if in a pinch, but with so many better restaurants in walking distance, it's doubtful."
3,"This is a decent buffet for locals, I guess. I didn't have to pay because my partner gets comps; if I'd had to pay I think I'd be a little more critical, because this is just a mid-level buffet to pay over $50 for two people. \n\n We went on seafood Friday. Nothing there was a standout- most of the fare is the same as the kind offered at most mid-level Vegas buffets- average.  We had a nice server with a good sense of humor who was kept busy in our section. The hot crab legs were good. \n\nThe things that weren't so great: The sushi was cold and not so great, the cold shrimp was soft and floppy. The salmon looked moist but it wasn't. \n\nThe hush puppies were little balls of fried salt. The fried catfish tasted like \""chicken fried\"" catfish but the batter coating was soft due to sitting in the heat for a while. \n\nThe carrot cake was so dry that a piece of it weighed almost nothing. Same with the chocolate fudge piece with the icing. Sigh...\n\nSo the crab was good. The presentation of the shelled sea-food dishes was nice, and they were flavorful.  Everything else we tried and haven't mentioned was \""meh.\"" Not horrible or inedible. Kids would enjoy this place just fine, as would folks with a little extra money who are looking for a relaxing food-filled time."
3,"HUGEEEE pasta portion. Appetizers were definitely not needed with the heft of my spaghetti. When I can't find something thrilling on the menu at an Italian restaurant, I'll often opt for the spaghetti with meatballs. It's a classic dish that, if they can't get right, bodes unwell for anything else. Fortunately, the noodles were cooked al dente and the meatballs moist. Unfortunately, we started with a selection of cured meat and flatbread pizza so I was stuffed by the time my entree arrived :(\n\nCame back later after a night of drinking, though, to have some extremely satisfying post-drinking pizza. But so did everyone else."
3,"I reviewed this in 2009 to let people know that I got food poisoning here. I ate here again and am rating it more highly cause I ate the veg food and it was fine, but mostly because I highly approve of the quantity and quality of their rice.  Working class Asian Americans like myself love their rice and this place is super generous and the quality is very very good. Better than the entree itself in fact."
3,"They now have vegetarian fajitas, $10, not a bad price but you don't get much tofu at all and the ones at Jack Astor's are better in every way.\n\nOver all they're not bad, but I don't think I'd order them again."
3,"I am a whore for great burgers, but it is hard to impress me. Indulge flirts with this, but I can never get my burger cooked to the temperature I ask for. I hate that! Take the Outback strategy and undercook everything, I don't care. Oh, and buy some salt for the beef.\n\nGood deals, real good drink deals, for happy hour!"
3,"Awesome food and great service! Don't miss out on the 'sides'.. I got the hummus and lentils, which were both amazing. I ran out of pita bread but they were nice enough to give me more upon request. I would also highly recommend dessert.. I got some kind if strawberry bar (forgot what it was called) but it was delish.\n\nI also ordered the good earth sandwich which had really fresh ingredients, but the flavor profile of the sauce was kind of weird for me, I think I would order it without it if I was ever to go back again (I'm not from Nevada). I also ordered the guacamole sandwich, which I liked better.. But the I would have to say the red sauce on it was too sweet for me. I split these with a friend and we both felt the same about these entrees. \n\nThere was one other vegan sandwich option, tree of life, and I ordered all three for my boyfriend and his 2 other friends to split, and they liked the tree of life the best... So hopefully that helps!"
3,"I've been a member of Lifetime for a few months and their facilities are hands down the best. You can read the other reviews for how awesome tha facility is but I'm going to speak to some of the interesting events that take place in the men's locker room and I am not joking at all......\n\nApparently the men's locker room gets rather friendly after hours and when I say after hours I state that loosely as in 10-11pm.   On two occasions.....I repeat.....two occasions I had the same 55 year old man pull up to a sink next to me and blow dry his junk.  I'm not exagerrating and my friend was at the sink to his left.   He was sandwiched between us butt naked stretching his stick and blow drying his junk dry.   I ran out of the gym in fear.   A few weeks later the SAME MAN did it again except this time I was by myself.   \n\nAnother time, 2 young men in their 30's were slapping each other in behinds with towels NAKED and chasing each other around the gym.  They almost knocked me over.....Thankfully I am not homophobic but come on, there's a time and place for everything......and apparently Lifetime is where it's at.   CAUTION - BEWARE"
3,"My expectations may be too high...let's start off with the positives.  Big parking lot, modern decor and very spacious.  Great service for having only one person running the front of the house.   \n\nWe ordered chicken red curry, papaya salad, BBQ chicken, pad thai and a side order of sweet rice.\n\nSweet rice - soggy and over cooked.  It came in a plastic sandwich bag.\n\nBBQ chicken - it was served with a side of the sweet chili sauce...bottled chili sauce.  The chicken is a piece of chicken breast marinated in what seemed like dried curry rub.  It was not BBQ nor did it taste like BBQ. It tasted pan fried.  Overall, I did not like it.\n\nPapaya salad - a bit too salty without the lime flavor.  Tiny bits of dried peanuts mixed throughout the salad....wasn't authentic, very Americanized.\n\nChicken red curry - loved the bamboo shoots and normal curried vegetables in the dish however the curry sauce lacked flavor.  It was very bland and no taste...it could've used a dash of fish sauce.  Overall, it was ok.\n\nPad thai - I was over it prior to making my way towards this dish.  My kids absolutely LOVED it!  That says it all as my kids are very picky eaters with a sophisticated palette.\n\nWould I return? Likely not and still in search for authentic Thai cuisine in AZ!"
3,"Sooooo... I'm giving them 3 stars b/c the Manager took care of our bill. Ya see this is the second time my b/f and I had an issue with the service on two separate occasions. First time they didn't bring my water when I asked twice and didn't bring the bill. This time (tonight) they brought our food to the wrong people, took it back, brought it back out after 15 min., it was cold... I told them we didn't want it (no attitude) so the Manager comes and says its on him. That's great customer service! So why 3 stars???\n\nWell... It would be different if this happened every once in a while but two times in a row. And this is the only two times I've been there. I like that the seats are comfortable. I like the tables. I like the screen, the atmosphere, the bar and all that outside, but the dining experience screwed it up for me. I'd rather concentrate on the movie rather than what I'm missing or what's wrong... \n\nBottom line: Get ya girl or female homie with the big purse to stuff all the goodies and snacks in it and enjoy the movie!"
3,So..this place is cute!  Huge dance floor!  The whole place is huge! Geesh~  Fun decor and nice bartenders.  The guys there seem pretty lame though.  Cool place to get dressed up and dance.
3,"it's a party on the inside, very cool decor and volcano show\n\nbetter burgers than \""The Burger Joint\"" in the same location\n\naverage food but worth the price"
3,"It's a Roberto's. I used to be in love with the food here. Over the years that has faded. I also think the overall quality of food has as well. There are several locations all over Vegas. I do think Roberto's is better than a lot of spots you can eat. But after trips to mexico and a few out of this world food truck street tacos robertos is just average. It is average that I like to eat from time to time if I am craving it. I like it, I used to love it. It's still good just not great in my books."
3,"I have been here a couple of times. The service was great and the atmosphere is nice, casual and laid back.\n\nThe pizza is alright. I've tried a couple different pizzas here. I didn't love the sauces they used and didn't love the crust texture or taste. However, I really enjoyed the food items that were not pizza here. Their sides, salads, and soups were tasty. I'm interested in trying their other menu items. I would come back here, but not for the pizza."
3,"Nice place, nice atmosphere, and I've always had good service here but - for me - the bread is mediocre. I'm guessing they are intending to go for a very moist, 'heavy' bread, which I'm sure some people love. I've just discovered Wildflower Bread Company and their bread is 'perfect' for me - drier, lighter, but still with moisture and 'stretch' or 'bite'."
3,"I tried the lunch buffet here a few weeks ago, and the food was pretty good.  We discovered the buffet on our last day in Vegas, after some horrible Studio Cafe experiences.  The flat daily rate seems like an excellent deal when you consider what you pay for food in Vegas.  The seating area was freezing for some reason, but our waitress was great.  She noticed that we were shivering and suggested coffee/tea, and she kept them refilled."
3,"Situated in the heart of the shops at Palazzo, this unassuming wine bar offers decent selections at the bar and good to great selections in the shop located adjacent to the bar. \n\nBottle prices are a bit high, but that's what Vegas is all about. \n\nI was disappointed with the glassware, which ranging from either the O-Line series to small bowled glasses with short stems, reminiscent of bad hotel banquets. For a wine bar, I simply expected more in terms of glassware.\n\nOther than that, the staff was friendly and kept my glass filled!!!"
3,Good place to go play and burn energy but they need to get speed ball open again. Referees have gotten really lazy lately not wanting to ref a game. On the plus side they were able to fix gun free of charge and cleaned it out. I would go Lots more often of they fixed up there fields and got some better bunkers. Really focus on the fields and there refs and this place will be 5 stars.
3,"We had been wanting to go to the Block & Grinder since it opened and we heard some great things.  Overall the food was 4-5 stars, but the atmosphere and service was 2 stars.\n\nIn terms of service, we sat down in a cramped space next to a large table, and did not have a waiter assigned to us.  After 12 minutes, we finally had a waiter (who was very nice) notice that no one was assigned to us.  From there, he took over, but he also had other large tables, so the service was slow.\n\nOn to the positive aspects....for an appetizer, we got the jar of pimento cheese and crackers, which was delicious, and probably the best pimento cheese we have had in our short time being exposed to pimento cheese.  We decided to order the ribs for an entree, which was a great choice.  They were lean and tender, and rank up there as one of the best ribs we have ever had.\n\nI think we would come back here, but would attempt to go on a weeknight (or off-peak time), which would hopefully improve the service.  I would also love to try the cocktails."
3,"I live pretty close to Papago, so it's a place I regularly hike. But it's not because I love this park, it's really because of the convenience of living so close, and the fact that the trials are not challenging at all. Papago is one of the few places that I feel 100% safe about hiking on my own. Unless you take a wrong step while climbing one of the buttes, it's pretty hard to hurt yourself. \n\nThe park is clean and well kept, and you do get some good views of Phoenix, Tempe and Scottsdale on your hike. Once in a while I've even spotted some cool birds flying around. Because it's such an easy hike, Papago is a great spot for beginner/novice hikers, and a pretty good spot to take your kids or the dog. If you're looking to get outside and get some air, Papago is the place to hit up for an hour or two on a quiet afternoon or morning."
3,"All the locals recommended this place to me for burgers and I've tried them twice to just make sure the first time wasn't a goof. But both times, the food was so blah. It should take more then just a massive piece of meat to get good ratings. I've tried both a burger and a steak, and they were both so bland. There's no flavor what's so ever. I was highly disappointed."
3,"Bed Bath & Beyond -- totally overpriced and for this particular location, also bad parking!!  Ugh.  I don't usually shop at BB&B unless I have one of those coveted 20% off coupons in my hot little hand. \n\nI was here recently looking for that awesome linen spray, the Egyptian Cotton-scented version. They haven't had it either time I was here. I was also looking for a new \""everyday\"" type of pot, but they didn't have what I needed. Sure, they had Calphalon but I'm not paying THAT for a pot or pan. \n\nI did pick up a new shower curtain liner and a couple candles but I had to get the pot elsewhere."
3,"I was really excited to eat here, but was really let down.\n\nWe ate here right before we saw Ka.  For appetizers we got the frisee salad and the lobster bisque.  DELICIOUS.  The frisee had big chunks of bacon and the broken yolk  made the bacon taste 10x better.  We order a half bottle of red wine that was well worth the price too.  My like for Craftsteak ends here.   I got the flat iron steak and tried the surf and turf (ribeye and lobster tail), I can honestly say I've had better.  I'm from Texas and we've got plenty of good beef here. \n\nI was disappointed in the rolls since I heard so much rave about them, they were good but nothing special.  Have you ever had a yeast roll from Hartz Chicken?  If yes, then you've had a roll from Craftsteak.  I wish I could say more about this place."
3,"This is the only hotel I've stayed at downtown - I know, hard to believe a person from Hawaii never stayed at the California!!  But I'm really picky about what hotels I stay at and the California and every other hotel located downtown always made me feel itchy while walking through - like I said before: \""Happy Faye, happy stay!\""\n\nThe rooms were pretty average, but I only stayed in their standard rooms.\n\nI've had good experiences here and never felt unsafe (while in the hotel room and casino area).  All of the employees were always nice and helpful, which is always good to have!  Their 24 hour coffee shop serves good food at reasonable prices (they even have some \""Hawaii friendly\"" menu items!)."
3,"Realistically, I give this place 3.5 stars. The decor is nice and the menu is appealing. They list everything that comes on and with ur orders.... But I felt that it was a tad bit too show-ee for me... Maybe that's what u get in Vegas? Came in based on a recommendation for the oxtail chili fries. That did not disappoint. It was good. A lot of meat, and flavorful. I would say it's a must try if it's your first time. I also had their summer special, the Manga burger. That was OK. A bit too much sauce...couldn't really get too much of the burger flavor. I washed it down with the matcha green tea milk shake. Yum! Maybe I'm spoiled with the burger joints in LA. But Bachi Burger is opening a location on Sawtelle soon. I guess then we can see how they do head to head with the other burger joints out here. That will be fun!"
3,Want to stay on the strip but you're a cheapskate? Sahara is the place for you.\n\nOld + Falling Apart + Terrible Shows =  great character.\n\nOnly problem is it's a little too far away from the heart of the strip.
3,"When I worked at the Renaissance tower, I'd come here when I was too lazy to walk down the street for something better. Because, honestly, their pizza just isn't that great. Or good, really. But I've had the breakfast muffin twice and both times it was beyond awesome! Just the right amount of grease to let you know it's good. And super cheap!"
3,I'm not the hugest fan of Indian food but if I had to eat it this is where I would go. They also have a few other dishes besides Indian which is nice. The food tends to be spicey and pretty authentic!  A lot of what they offer is geared toward the vegetarian crowd.
3,"I got a hair cut and loved it, however, I was not crazy about the salon. A little too modern for me.\nSeems like a good place if you like trendy hair cuts and color."
3,"I haven't tried many items or the lunch buffet yet, but from whatever I've had here, I would say its a decent option for Indian food. Being a vegetarian, its a nice thing to know that there is no chance of meat ending up in my food."
3,"The sushi here is not bad, but not great. Service is also up to par. Sushi rock pails in comparison, however, to nearby restaurants, that have much better quality sushi, and hover around the same price. Though I may come here again for Korean food, I will not be returning for sushi."
3,"We like to come in here to shop for clothes and luggage.  You can find some great deals in here.  The selection of luggage is pretty good too.  I've found some great carry on bags.\n\nIt can get really busy here, especially on weekends.  The best time to shop is mid-week in the middle of the day.  The employees here are usually friendly and the store is kept clean.\n\nReturn Factor - 60%"
3,"These state employees don't necessarily like their job, but they did a great job of helping me out. \n\nI just moved to the state and required a change of residency. I have no car here yet so a drivers license wasn't a necessity, but it would have been nice to have already. Unfortunately, proof of insurance specifically for this state is necessary to do that. State ID it was then. The lady at the front (I didn't grab her name) was very  kind and accommodating for my noob questioning of changing state ID's. The line, although around the room, moved very quickly.It's a lot faster than what I'm used to from Chicago/Illinois DMV lines.\n\nOverall, if you have all your required paper work with you,  it is a fair experience got being a thing of necessity. Props to the kind lady in the beige cardigan up front!"
3,"we stayed here for 4 days in august last year and it was an OK stay.  probably the last time i will stay here unless there's some supersale on the hotel.\nthe hotel is a bit older but since our friends were getting married at Mandalay Bay, and since we couldnt afford staying there, we chose the closed hotel so the 23 of us didnt have to go too far to be there in time for the wedding.\nthere were construction going on all wknd.  so annoying as we were ok w/ it on Thursday but it seems be pounding w/ those machine all wknd.\n\nthe pool area was small and was not \""pretty\"" as the other hotels.\nclub LAX is there and we all got in for free as we were staying there - one of the best part of the stay as there were lots of us and went in without lines etc. \nlike the ability to go to Excalibur and Mandalay bay on the tram without walking too much but the wait is about 15minutes in the hot sun :(\nour room was not that big...good enough for 2ppl.  if more, it will be tight.\ntheir food court needs more variety.\n\noverall, you really dont get that much but then again, you dont pay that much for the room."
3,"After being seated at three different tables we decided to sit at the bar.  We then found out they were out of lager.  How the hell can a brewery be out of lager?  The food was decent, the service was below average, and the crowd was the usual here in Glendale, old white folks."
3,"Very up-to-date hotel. Pleasant atmosphere. Make sure if you want 3G/4G access in your room that you stay on the west side. Pool has horrible hours IMHO. If you want wifi access, be prepared to spend a fortune.  Drinks at the pool are outrageously priced!  $17 for one drink (includes mandatory tip)"
3,Food is great but service for food and even drinks takes FOREVER make sure you have No plans the rest if the night when coming here as you will spend most time waiting for service.
3,"Went to my first Panthers' game the other day; real good time, actually, even though I couldn't care less about the Panthers. It seems I'm the only one who doesn't: the place was, to my surprise, absolutely packed with Panther's fans. Pretty good for a team that's only been around for, what, ten years?\n\nOn game day, the stadium is absolutely surrounded and consumed by tailgating fans; during the rest of the week, it stands there, right outside of downtown, quiet and lonely looking. I guess that can be said of a lot of stadiums, though. \n\nAs for the place itself, really good facilities and pretty good crappy stadium food--hotdogs, pretzels, beers, that kinda stuff. But it actually wasn't as expensive as I'd feared. Pretty reasonable, in fact, which is a rarity. \n\nAnd the fans were well-behaved and fun. Definitely a nice, family-friendly atmosphere. And there are always tickets available, so check it out."
3,"I've only eaten there twice, but the food both times was very very average... not reflected in the prices. At this price point, the food should be out of this world. \n\nThe happy hour specials are decent and the atmosphere is outstanding, but I don't really see a reason to go here unless you want to impress someone with how much money you have. It's not like going to Ocean Club where the food is fucking rad.\n\nI won't be going here unless someone gives me a gift certificate. I put that it's Spendy, but if you get a drink it can easily get you over 60 bucks and into the splurge area. Not worth it."
3,"Not a fan of the decor or the ambience as another reviewer mentioned. The music was way too loud and crappy; no way we would ever, ever eat in there. Take-out is a must.\n\nThe food is quite good, but does take a long time to get to you; over 10 minutes usually, without a line in front of you. We waited over 25 minutes one time, but it was a lunch rush. Still that was a long time to stand. It is more of a grilled wrap, than a burrito, as another review mentions. Tasty though.\n\nNo debit though. Seriously? It's 2011, get with the times Boyz. And the parking sucks; angled parking which you have to drive over a sidewalk to get to. Pro Tip: don't run over any pedestrians when backing out."
3,"Murphy's greatest attribute is its location. The downtown Chandler area has so much potential and this is a good start. Murphy's is located in a nice plaza near the heart of the city. It's an Irish pub because we don't have enough of these in the Valley, right? \n\nIt's in a narrow suite but the bar runs almost the full length of the place. It's not very large so it gets crowded fast. The weird thing is that it dies down after 11pm. I don't know why, the people just leave. Perhaps they know something I don't. But when there are people it a mix of late 20's to young 40's crowd.\n\nThey have a lot of beers on tap, so you're sure to find something you like. The staff is friendly and they try their hardest to get to everyone. On certain nights they have live music playin in the corner. Not a lot of room, so it's usually a one or two piece band. \n\nI'm not worried, but I hope that this place sticks around. This area needs them."
3,"Drinks were great, but the bartender was rude! My party and I had already had a few drinks over at VBGBs, and we walked over to Willies. Once in, we went up to the counter to order some drinks. Having never been there before, my friend asked what drink tasted like chocolate, and the bartender snarked at her that \""Chocolate tasted like chocolate.\"" When we tried to order the Call-a-Cab, he asked if we liked Robatussen. While I do appreciate being warned about the flavor of the drink, his attitude was pretty annoying. I've also been to the Myrtle Beach location, where the bartender was very sweet, offered to get us samples, and kept checking back in on us since we were seated at the bar. \n\nAs everyone else has warned, don't order Call-a-Cab by itself - it's hard to drink. But everything I have tried (Shock Treatment, Chocolate Thunder, Sour Apple) was delicious."
3,"The buffet for Saturday night is 26.95 per person as of this writing. I would consider it a good deal at 20, but 27 is a bit too high. Some food was fantastic. The steak and salmon were very good, and the peanut butter chocolate cream pie was fantastic, rich but not heavy. One standout low was the so-called French onion soup, which was made with (I kid you not) reconstituted onions, almost identical to the grody ones McDonald's puts on its burgers. A cup of Lipton instant soup would have been better. I suppose that would be (barely) okay for a 7 dollar cheap ass buffet, but wholly unacceptable when dropping close to 30 dollars for a meal.  Fresh onions just aren't that expensive, and while a good French Onion soup takes a while to make, it's not labor intensive at all and an acceptable one should be easily in reach of any certificate holder from a culinary school. \n\nBasically, I'm reinforcing what others have said; what's good is very good, what's not good is downright bad."
3,"Pros:\nGood music on radio.They played Todd Rundgren during dinner\n\nLots of server attention\n\nDecent selection of draft beer\n\nPulled pork was good\n\nCorn side was good\n\nPortions were large\n\nCons,\n\nHush puppies were unbeatable.Awful\n\nBeef brisket was waaaay too salty\n\nMac and cheese was a fried puck with cheese sauce \n\nTiny serving of vinegar sauce\n\nExpensive$24 for two meat platter with one beer.NYC prices"
3,"here's the deal: if you come here expecting berthillon, you will be disappointed.  if you come here expecting very fine american style gelato, you'll probably leave very very happy.  \n\ni came somewhere in the middle---i recognize that i can't get a certain quality of gelato this side of the atlantic, but i was expecting a little bit more.  the choc was milk choc.  gelato ought to be made with dark choc.  i'm not sure i'd trust the fruity gelato, knowing it won't compare to france/italy.  but, i bet the nutella is great---i'll try that next time!"
3,"Stopped by here to get some early dim-sum. This place opened earlier than any other dim sum place in Vegas at 10:00am. All other places opened at 11am.\n\nThe quality of the dim sum was okay. For some reason, their har gow was small in comparison to what Im used to. The flavors were not bad. Prices were reasonable considering it was inside a casino, albeit the kinda run down Rio Casino.\n\nI think I'll wait until 11am next time I'm hankerin for dim sum in Vegas...."
3,"Had them cater an event - food was very good, 2 types of quiche - excellent reviews from all meeting participants.  They did forget to bring a fruit platter - luckily I had ordered enough other food that it wasn't that big of a deal, but still not the best way to make an impression.  The delivery was also quite early - about 15-20 minutes before scheduled deliver time - earlier is always better than late, however with hot food, it creates a challenge...food was nicely prepped though.  I would likely order from them again, but will certainly be double checking the order upon arrival and will stress delivery time."
3,"So, the good:  Plaintain and black bean mash, lump crab nachos, skinny margarita, chipolte ribs\n\nThe bad:  Service is hit or miss, enchiladas are meh, greens are very plain.\n\nNote: The grilled corn used to be fabulous when served on the cob.  Too many people complete complained about it being messy so they now strip it from the cob.  It has lost something.  Let's worry less about being \""clean\"" and more about good food!"
3,"So last night was a bit of a disappointment. In having frequented this joint a few times, last nights experience fell far short compared to the rest. \n\nThe patio is still great, plenty of heaters and some great music provided by a live DJ. \n\nFood and service however..... Food was alright. I think I will go with the meat and cheese platter next time, that might be better than the bland mozzarella and tomato panini I had. Service was pretty bad. I am not sure what the waitress' deal was but she acted strangely; too sarcastic, underhanded comments, spilled water on the table every time she refilled a glass AND flung the pitcher around and splashed it on me and just waled away, acted like she was doing us a huge favor everytime we asked for something, took nearly 15 minutes to get our bill, then another 30 minutes for her to come back to run the card, and I swear she was rolling her eyes every time she walked away from our table. It was weird. I know some people can have a bad day, but geez honey, rude much? \n\nBomberos is still a great place, but I would skip the panini and don't mess with the waitress, shell get'cha. haha"
3,"One of the things I love about this place is the outdoor seating in the cooler months.  I also love the Bellini, Toasted Ravioli, and Rosemary-Chicken Pizza.\n\nThere IS room for improvement, however.  The takeout \""system\"" they are using has caused me to go somewhere else more than once.  I don't think that having certain pickup \""windows\"" for loyal customers is a sufficient way to reward them, especially at that price point.\n\nOregano's, you have a LOT of good competition (especially in Central Phoenix) so you may want to rethink the way you are treating customers.  I'm going to try you out again soon so we'll see how things go from there."
3,I ordered the seafood trio over risotto. I wish I would have ordered something else because my plate was 1/3 of the size of everyone else's but was more expensive than anyone else's. The salmon and shrimp tasted good but the rest was just ok. For appetizers we got the calamari and spinach artichoke dip. Those were really good. And for dessert a peanut butter mousse thing that was awesome. Overall it was just an ok experience. Don't hate it. Don't love it. If someone wanted to go I wouldn't object but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there.
3,"Pizza is like sex.  Even if it's bad, it's still good.  That pretty much sums up how I feel about this place.  The pizza itself wasn't too bad.  I liked the garlic stuff they put on the crust.  I was disappointed that they screwed up my order and instead of pepperoni and garlic, I got pepperoni and olives.  They didn't even apologize or offer to give us a discount or anything.  We also tried their chicken fingers which were alright. Nothing special.  You could tell they were the cheaper ones.  For the price though, I'd go back again (2 med 2 topping pizzas, 5 fingers for $15)."
3,"As others have said, this is a cheap stay and that's what you should expect. The benefit is the location - right smack in the middle of the strip. Even the penthouse didn't impress me here. I have seen better. One really fun thing is the dealer-impersonators. That was a treat, until I noticed that they just repeat the same performers a couple times per night. Still cool, though."
3,"This was my first time here. \n\nI ordered online so i could take out my food. The online process was fast and easy. \nWhen I arrived the food was just being boxed up, right on time hot and fresh. Nice to know it was not sitting there for awhile getting cold and soggy. \n\nI ordered the Brisket burger. It is a cheese burger that comes with BBQ sauce, Brisket and bacon. There wasnt too much sauce which was nice, i hate having things smothered in sauce and making the bun soggy. The Brisket was okay, good flavor but could have been more tender. The burger itself was cooked well done. I prefer my burgers with some pink. I guess i should have indicated that online in the comment section while ordering. Overall the burger was just okay.\n\nI also ordered a cup of chiken tortilla soup as a side. This was very good! packed with flavor, had a little kick. It was filled with shredded chicken and corn it was very good! I liked it better than the burger. \n\nOver all meal was good. I would come back and try other items."
3,"I am somewhat of a self-proclaimed movie \""snob\"" since I was a projectionist in college and helped run the campus cinema (one theater, but we showed everything).  I'm pretty particular how and where I watch my movies.  Don't get me wrong, I will watch a movie anywhere, but how the movie is delivered definitely contributes to the overall movie-going experience.\n\nI know this place is fairly new (\""new\"" to me since I don't find myself on this side of town too often), but I felt like the theater had aged too quickly - almost like it was smoking 10 packs of cigs a day.  Something about it didn't feel right... the bathrooms (had nice finishes, but not too terribly clean).  Maybe I just caught them on an \""off\"" day, but an untidy theater is really off-putting to me.\n\nThe movie was over all was fine... the seats left something to be desired.  Stadium seating, but narrow rows so if you have some neighbors with small bladders like I did, your feet got a steping on.  I think I may just be spoiled with the trendy theaters around town that serve alcohol and food to you while you watch, but would I go out of my way to watch a movie here?  Probably not..."
3,"PROS:\n1. Burgers are big and juicy (although a bit overpriced.)\n2. Onion rings crispy and big\n3. Black Milk Tea boba ...delish!!\n4. Kimchi burger is the BOMB!\n5. Staff were nice\n\nCONS:\n1.  My Kiki burger tasted exactly like the Ronin burger and that means they were just ok.  Had a weird sweetness to it but both got better 1/2 way thru.\n\n2.  Ordered Oxtail Chili fries which were forgotten and then brought out long after we had finished our burgers.  And these we just - meh.\n\n3.  Bar counter and tables were wiped down with mildew-smelling rag.\n\n4.  Only 2 individual bathrooms, so line is long.  \n\n5.  Beer was overpriced.  \n\nI'd go back to try a different burger  or maybe just stick with the kimchi burger!!"
3,"I've been to Mimis a few times and I have to say that they are fairly inconsistent.  Sometimes they are good, sometimes they are bad.  It seems as though breakfast is usually pretty good, but dinner seems to be lacking most of the time.\n\nI went this past weekend for dinner.  I got the three course steak meal for $9.99.  I know, I should have known better, but I couldn't resist.  The salad was ok.  Then came the steak with mashed potatoes.  The steak was terrible.  It definitely had fake chargrilled marks on it.  Then came the \""sundae\"" to finish off the meal, which turned out to be a scoop of vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup on it.  \n\nAgain, I guess you get what you pay for."
3,"Came for lunch. This is definitely one of the biggest buffets of the Vegas hotel choices. As soon as I walked in I was very impressed with the size and the choices available. Unfortunately, the more times I went back, the less impressed I was. The quality of the food is just not top quality. The place itself is not 4-star, but more like a cheap buffet ambiance. The price tag on the buffet reflects the compromised quality, but hey if you're looking for something a little bit cheaper than say the Wynn or Bellagio, and still want a great variety, then this could very well be your spot."
3,"Picked up filled croissants for myself and the boys this morning.  \nThey were a little overbaked today but still tasty.\nI still miss the original place that was I'm the strip mall a couple suites down.\nPrice has increased twice, at least, for individual croissants since it changed ownership.  Quality of croissants has not improved and if anything it seems to have gone from alright to mediocre.  Sometimes lacking filling, sometimes looking especially small -c'mon, for the price you don't want something that's a tad bigger than a grocery store cinnamon fry.\nI rather they would get rid of all the new flavors they've added and simply offer a better quality product that was brought over from the original store/owner/baker(s).\n\nBecause the price of one croissant has gone up again I have opted to pick up treats to deliver to friends or a business (the staff at my vets office) from an excellent bakery that's across town.\nMore options and more for my money too."
3,"How should I rate and yelp this place without being judge?? Haha I don't care!!! \n\nAway from the kids once again.... Rent a car, drove to Vegas, got there in 3 1/2 hours at 80 mph. arrived at 12:35am. \n\nWe met with 2 other couples, drag them out from the Baccarat tables at Caesars Palace to go grab a drink with us at OG. \n\nThe best way is to call O.G. and make a reservation, they will sent out a limo to pick you up at your hotel. This way you don't pay a cover charge. You buy a greygoose bottle or any other liquor bottle and get only \"" Smirnoff \"" free. The bill came out to be 415.00 include tax & tips. And other entertainments would come out of each individual's pocket. hehehehe We had a nice booth with shear curtains. \n\nohhhhh,,, eeewwwwwwwwww,, ahhhhhhhhhh Us girls wondered upstairs to check out the men, It was very empty. Just a few girls with these hot hot men. Their bodies were tight, abs hanging, guns flexing,, yikes .. I was a little intimidated because they started to came at us like fresh meat. We turned and darted downstairs. \n\nMy husband said \""back so soon\"", LOl.... \n\nWell, we all had lap dances, some good, some horrible, some real, some fake ::)) Use your imagination. \n\nI recommend to go in groups of couples, you'll have the best time because it is just fun."
3,"Big slices, but not the most impressive place for pizza. Worth a try, but will not be our regular spot for pizza. Price doesn't match quality."
3,"I happened to be in the mall of all places while on vacation in Vegas.\n\nDecided to pop in and relax while I had a little lunch - seeing how shopping can really drain your energy as well as your wallet.  I know what you're thinking - Red Robin? There's a TON of great places to eat in Vegas - why the hell would you end up there?  Well- I was craving a great burger, and I needed one FAST.\n\nThis RR is probably just like all the other RRs you've ever walked into in your entire life.  I was seated in a small table near the window, looking into the busy Galleria mall.  After checking out the menu, I decided on a \""Keep it Simple\"" plain burger.   The server apologized for the longish wait and took my order.  It took what I thought was a long time for my food to finally arrive - but I was pleased with both the quality and how large my burger was.  I wasn't in a big hurry, so the wait didn't really bother me.\n\nIf you're in the mood for a gourmet burger, check out RR in the Galleria mall.  I'd like to explore the menu and try different burgers the next time I'm there.\n\n3 outta 5 stars from me - worth checking out if you're in the area."
3,Crepes station is top notch. Seafood was okay.  Kind of worn down in the last 5 years. A deep cleaning would be great for this whole seating area. Probibly backstage too.
3,"I have to rate this location 1 star on the whole parking situtation as well as the ease of getting in & out of the parking lot.   As Bill noted, whoever designed the layout and flow here was a total moron. \n\nThe location gets 5 stars - it is convienent to my work and home. \n\nI would give the service here about 3.5 stars, because the employees are normally pretty helpful here.  And if you go at 10 minutes 'til closing time when there is a big line, sometimes the employees are down-right entertaining! \n\nThere is almost always a line when I go here - so if you are planning a visit, just plan on having a wait if you need full service."
3,"We have passed by this place a million times on our way to Sushi Creek and finally this morning found some time to stop.  First impression was the place was very clean and after seating ourselves we ordered, Denver omlet and some kind of breakfast bowl.  Food was good, service was very good.  Waiter made sure drinks were refilled and food was to our liking."
3,I haven't been to old navy in awhile so I was okay with this store. First time it was pretty messy from all the Christmas shoppers but the second time was a little cleaner. They did have good sales for all ages.
3,"Normally I'd give this joint 5 stars bcuz almost EVERYTHING IS *AWSM*\nHowever- just went w/my moms & ewww what a disappointment :(\nShe had the fried chicken & me a basic burger - burger was ehh ok at best but the chicken was bad news bears!!! The corn bread muffin was delivered warm but turned to a rock shortly after, leading me to believe they nuked it ... The batter on the chicken was nasty & the chicken itself was ALLLL FAT! Even the mixed veggies were gross!\nAt $14 bucks this dish is NO BUENO!\nIf you find yourself @ BBD - try the Cali Benedict or the sweet cream waffle & finish w/a personal pie of your liking or the diners specialty - a  big bear bear claw ;) enjoy!"
3,"We choose this hotel based on the yelp reviews. The room was clean and welcoming. Comfy beds and and I liked the little balcony. However the free wi fi never worked. We didn't take advantage of the free snacks as this was to inconvenient to go down to the lobby every time we wanted something. It was loud at night with thin walls but it was understandable as there was a wedding going on.  The breakfast in the morning was nice quaint and busy. I didn't see much of the staff, so can't make a comment there. I don't know that I would stay again but it was a nice little get away."
3,"Agree with everyone about looks, place is beautiful!  Gym is sorta small and hot, but has a ton of cardio (treadmills and Xfit).  If you are coming, be SURE to ask what is still closed.  We came looking for poolside fun, and the pool is closed for at least another MONTH! I could see happy sunbathers at Bellagio from my room splashing around...Vdara you are a cruel Mistress!!  Service friendly, but rather inefficient...tried to get burned out bulb in bathroom fixed, no luck.  Coffee in room is Kcup, two free and more in mini bar, bring your own milk, only creamer.  Also found out that on-site restaurant (Silk Road) will no longer be open for dinner.  Call before you book for amenities...I think they are having some issues."
3,"By the time we reached here, we have so much liquid in us.  We stopped and rejuvenated ourselves with whatever soda and water we can find while walking on the strip, well u want to make sure u are amply hydrated with that 105 degree heat.\n\nBut I still wanted to taste at least 3 float samplers, but the line was too long and unruly, ppl were darting in and out like crazy, so that was enough for me.  C'mon, kids, move along...perambulating, to the M & M World."
3,"I came here with a group for drinks before a group dinner...didn't like that you couldn't seat yourself at the bar without the hostess helping you.  We tried some drinks and french fries...all were good, albeit overpriced, but nothing to rush back for!"
3,"It's ok, it needs more fresh produce somewhere in the market. there are nice vendors there, but it needs more market types."
3,"It's Burger King, there's not much to say, but this is a nice, clean location. Good service, 24 hours and they have my favorite drink of all time... VAULT soda on tap lol."
3,"So the name is like naming a place The Pizza or The Burger or The Taco. \n\nThat said, The Sushi wins big points for the taste, but not for the portions or the price.\n\nInside is nice and cozy, with a basketball-arena style four-screen TV in the middle.\n\nIf price and portions were no object, this would be a five-star sushi bar as the care and taste of the sushi and sashimi can't be beat. \n\nThe problem is the pricing is above many other sushi bars in the area. And the portions - especially when it comes to the teriyaki dishes - are more set for hamsters than people. \n\nThe staff was cordial and offered hot tea or water to this guest waiting for a to-go order. \n\nAll in all, a slight recommendation if price is no object and you're not THAT hungry."
3,"I love this wee place. Edinburgh has done well to preserve the old school pubs in the city centre so that they can be enjoyed by new generations. The Rose St Brewery is very quaint, the upstairs lounge is my favourite part of the pub. Carpeted floors and old pictures of the city line the walls. A plaque boasts it as being the Pub of The Year in 1985.\n\nI popped in for lunch here and ordered a goats cheese salad - very unlike me as I'm a huge carnivore, however it sounded light and refreshing on the menu, and light and refreshing it was. It came with two huge chunks of goats cheese on a bed of mix salad leaves and seasonal veg with a light dressing. With a nice Guinness this it hit the spot perfectly. Staff could have been a bit more attentive, though I doubt they get much training. Nevertheless it is a boozer, so expect nothing more! Kudos Rose St Brewery, and don't ever change!"
3,"Seems to want to be O. But it did have good effects, music and talented artists. However, the actual story is lacking coherency and things aren't as stemless as a Cirque show."
3,"It's hard to evaluate the merits of a coffee shop based on a french soda, but this place seems pretty good. It cost about $3 which is a bit pricey, but tasted good, and the syrups they use are good quality.\n\nI'd have to keep going here and grab a coffee to see how the place is on the whole."
3,"Small, quiet casino - check. Clean, spaced out machines - check. Drink options followed by food - check. Low traffic = little smoke - checkity check!"
3,Grabbed a couple of dozen bagels and took to work.  Man they don't last long.  Bagels are good and the service is friendly.  They were real busy but make time to chat will working.
3,"Cute little spot! Nice ambiance, ok food. The BF & I ate here for our birthday dinner over the summer. Honestly the only reason why I wanted to come here was because I was curious about the Matilda Wong.. it was even better than I imagined.. seriously drop what you're doing & get. it. NOW\n\nWe started off with the Sweet Potato Ravioli with the Gorgonzola Cream sauce. Four pieces of delicious ravioli, but I didn't really care for the creamy sauce- it was a little too rich & salty for my taste. LOVED the ravioli itself though. It was topped with walnuts & served with some bread. \n\nFor entrees, BF got the Hanger Steak & I tried the Muffuletta Pizza without meat. BF liked the steak, but my pizza, while it looked good, was so damn salty! Must be because of the olive spread but jeez.. Nothing that another Matilda Wong couldn't remedy though :)\n\nWe split a dessert, but I don't remember what it was.. it had been a few months since we ate here. Guess that means it wasn't horrible, but also wasn't memorable :(\n\nI would come here again & try a different entree.. perhaps the Farro Saute? I found the prices to be pretty reasonable: $12 for ravioli, $12 for the pizza, & I think around $20 for the steak, probably under $10 for the dessert .. & $11 for each mini pitcher of the Wong.. hell yeah"
3,"24/7 Local video poker sports bar, everything you'd expect. It seems like I'm always just stopping in for a cheap breakfast, the Pt's Platter is way better than its Ihop and Denny's counterparts and the waitresses are much friendlier. Unfortunately, I always get sucked into the video poker machines and end up leaving with a full tummy and an empty wallet."
3,"I went there to celebrate my wife's completion of second year dental school from UNLV. Interior design is nice and upscale and hostess was very friendly. We ordered Steak Special for two and we had to wait about 20 min to get our plate. It was ok. However, The waiter was really busy so he did not take care of us. He did not even refill my water so I had to take my wife's water and drank. compare to the price and atmosphere, service was not that great."
3,"A quick update after my first business trip in more than 8 months:\n\nAs a nursing mom, I now have more to worry about when going through security.  At 5am on a Friday (which is actually quite busy because of all the business travelers returning home to the East Coast).  TSA had to place each of my clear bags into the bomb-matter-detecting machine, but the agent was more than courteous, explaining the process and what would happen if the machine alarmed.  Luckily it didn't.  Even though I had over a dozen bags that had to be scanned, I was done in 5 minutes.\n\nThere's not much in the Delta portion of Terminal 3, but Starbucks and Wendy's are usually open for breakfast, though the lines are quite long.\n\nNow that the construction is done, it's much easier to find the rental car shuttle.  And I was pleasantly surprised at how short the wait was at 12:30am, despite the multitude of people who'd arrived late like me.   The rental car shuttles always smell quite strongly of soapy air freshener, almost to the point of making me sick.  I guess that's better than smelling dirty, but it is quite overpowering. \n\n#Yelp365 - 169/365"
3,"If you are drunk.... as in silly drunk, loud drunk, agitated drunk, confused drunk, mellow drunk, giggly drunk, lost drunk, or still-have-$5-in-your-pocket drunk... this is where you want to eat. \n\nYou're likely to have amusing memories here as you sort of sober up with other hungry drunk people who are all lured in by the aroma of pizza. Note: the pizza tastes like a slice-of-heart-attack during the daytime, however there is something oh so good about it when eaten at 1:45 am."
3,"Pros: Casual, fun ambiance. Good location at Cosmopolitan. Awesome decor--lucha libre meets Las Vegas--red lamps on the ceiling, video screens with pictures flashing of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo and Chinese leader Mao, etc.\n\nCons: The menu was extensive but underwhelming. A bit over-priced for such a casual setting that basically served fried rice and tacos. It's tapas style, so expect to order several dishes for sharing. I don't think it was a fusion, but rather a menu with average Chinese and Mexican dishes."
3,"What to do on Christmas Eve eve... oh, Carolina Place Mall is open 'til 11pm? Let's go wander around there and watch the masses scramble for gifts.\n\nWhen I need to make a mall trip, this is not at the top of the list for me. I rank Northlake, SouthPark and Concord all above it. One: anything that involves 485 does not make me pleasant. Two: The store selection here is just kind of meh. Three: it's a pain to get in and out of this place.\n\nNow I will say this, there is an H&M on the way which could be a game changer for this place. It will be great for people on the south side of town since currently there is just the one location up at Northlake. Until SouthPark gets one, this one will do for our side of town.\n\nTypical anchor stores here. I don't want to say that it feels outdated... I don't think that's the right description. Maybe old school vibe is more accurate.\n\nIf I'm near this area and need a mall, I'll venture here. But with so many better options in the Charlotte area, it's definitely not a must-go shopping destination on my list."
3,Came here for brunch before a Cardinals' game. Food was good and drinks very generous. Love that they have the bus to the games. Very nice that everyone could enjoy their time and nobody had to worry about driving.
3,"Food was absolutely delicious,  but pricey. We were dressed in comfortable clothing (jeans/shorts/sweatshirts) and clearly did not fit in; this is a dressy crowd. We were also the youngest people there... it was mostly older adults 65+. Great views and good service."
3,This club is the new hit in Vegas for being so big but I didn't see anything that great about it. There's so many stairs. For a girl in heels and having to go up and down stairs all night to go back and forth between rooms is a hassle. The main room at the very top of the stairs is where they have their big shows/djs. The set up there sucks because there is a row of tables lining the front area and everyone stands up at those tables so you can't even see the performer no matter where you are standing. Always fun staring at a bunch of people's backs when a top DJ is playing and you paid money to see them. Same for the balcony in this main room. Just a row of tables right in front of the balcony so you can't see anything. Club is definitely made to try and force people to get tables. On the other hand Lights was a really awesome club. I suggest going there for shows instead.
3,"I'd really wanted to like this place, but it just isn't happening. Family has eaten here several time and we've had excellent meals (burgers in particular), but not consistently. There is always something wrong: burger over cooked, cold food, orders not correct. If a restaurant is going to charge the higher prices, I expect consistently good food and service - not hit and miss."
3,"I love the location, it is very \""little main street\"" feeling. The food is good and priced very well. The service is slow, so i would not come here if you are in a rush."
3,I got great service and they totally set me up with the right bike after receiving wrong sizing from another Landis store. They definitely spent some time with me on my shoe choice. My sizing appointment went well and they answered a lot of my new road bike questions though I thought some of their techniques a bit questionable. \nHaven't used for repairs yet but have a mountain bike in rough shape to bring in so will review after that.
3,"Was a good show, funny guy, he only did about four stunts to prove his skill, talked the rest of the time.  The things he did made you wonder how he knew that.  At the end of the show he told the whole audience winning lottery numbers.  Well lets see who plays them in what state and wins.  Lol.  Don't think I would go back, but that's the kind of person I am, once something is done I do not repeat.  Time to move on."
3,"I absolutely love this place for breakfast.  I have never seen so many selections for breakfast.  I'm definitely coming here again when I'm out in Vegas.\n\nDinner:  its 108 for 2 people and I don't really think its all that.  Yes, they have crab and a seafood selection but I was disappointed.  I thought dinner was going to be better than breakfast.  For that amount of money you can get a nice meal at Mesa Grill located in Caesar Palace."
3,Not a huge fan. It was okay at best. I've been to a few of these types of places around town and this one was average.
3,"I was excited when this breakfast restaurant opened up in my neighborhood as I love to go out for breakfast almost everyday.\n\nI have eaten there 3 times now but I only order 1 thing on the menu which I do enjoy quite a bit because their other items are a little unusual for me.\n\nI went to eat there again yesterday and I was very sorry to see they have removed all side items off their menu. So I cannot order an omelet or 2 scrambles eggs with bacon, or a side of toast. Its one of the nine items or nothing. That does not work for me so that is why i have given this restaurant 3 stars. I hope they reconsider offering the basic breakfast items or I will probably not be back."
3,"This was my second tapas place to visit in Las Vegas. \n\nThe food was ok, nothing really stood out other than the paella. It was a 40 minute wait, but worth it to try at least once!\n\nThe service was top notch, from the moment you walk thru the entrance to the wait staff, manager, everyone made you feel welcome. \n\nThe price, OH THE PRICE!   Only complaint I would say.  The entire menu is seriously over priced, even by Las Vegas Strip standards. It's the reason it will not be coming back. There are far better places to go for tapas on the Vegas strip for a better price & value. And important a better selection.\n\nThe atmosphere is great!  Plenty of light, open, not stuff. It has a bar area as well. The noise level is on the average. And the place is clean, they did a pretty good job clearing the table as you was done.  \n\nAll in all, I thought this place was OK at best.  But there are much much better places to visit."
3,"This place is hit or miss. The service is usually subpar. Food as mentioned above is different each time. The chicken fried rice is either oily or dry. The orange chicken is very chewy which I do not enjoy. Prices are average I'd say. Overall not bad, but certainly not the best place for Chinese food in North Phoenix"
3,"A farewell lunch for a coworker landed me here.  I wasn't impressed with the popover bread they serve prior to the meal, it had a strong egg taste that almost spoiled my appetite which is hard to do.  Thankfully, my mushroom and gruyere panini was very tasty and larger than I expected, with lots of fries on the side.  Everyone enjoyed their food and they also offer a small discount for bank employees which is a plus."
3,"I was happy to find this restaurant in my hotel.  It was late and I didn't want to venture out.  The bar had more people than I expected for a Monday night.  I ordered the gnocchi, which I believe was misspelled on the menu (\""gnocci\"").  I planned on pointing this out to the waitress until I heard the way she pronounced gnocchi (\""knock-y\"").  (I wonder if she told people she worked at \""Bigelow Grill-e.\"")  Somehow this made my dining experience seem a little less upscale.  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised with the ambiance - aside from the thick cigarette smoke at the bar.  \n\nThis sentence had me scratching my head for a while, \""Bigelow is serving innovative and imaginative interpretations of ethnic Pittsburgh classics.\""  Maybe some Pittsburghers will fill me in sometime."
3,"The early bird doesn't catches the worm at Marche Atwater, especially on a cold winter Sunday morning....\n\nOnly handful of stores are opened... but luckily we able to get some pastries at Boulangerie Premi\u00e8re Moisson as breakfast, a great start for the morning.\n\nBy 8:30 am then some of the fresh products stands and stores starts opening up.\n\nMarche Atwater is a lot smaller than I expect, maybe it is winter so none of the outdoor vendors are open??\n\nNext time I will skip Atwater and go to Jean-Talon instead."
3,"Since I'm a lover for lobster rolls, I decided to come here for lunch.  My husband and I decided to split a combo.  The lobster roll was ok.  I didn't like that the meat was chopped in tiny pieces (reminds me of canned tuna).  I also didn't like how the slit of the bun was just barely half way through the bread.  It makes me feel like they're trying to save on lobster meat.  With each bite we made, the meat fell out of the bun.  The chowder fries were ok.  Nothing to rave about.  For over $20, I was pretty dissatisfied with the portions I was given."
3,"I chill at White Castle 'cause it's the best\nBut I'm fly at Fat Burger when I'm way out west!\n\nSo the lyrics led me to this place but I must say it didn't live up to the hype.  The burger wasn't terrible, but I've had better.  WHAT-A-BURGER beats the hell out of it.\n\nThe burger patty reminds me of the patty at Freddy's Frozen Custard, Culver's, and Steak and Shake.  I had mine built with the default config which includes sweet relish.  I knew that going into it and thought i would try it.  It was a mistake - just plain weird.  Hold the relish next time."
3,"Good & decent lunch specials! However, I had to knock a couple stars because waitress came to our table at least 3 times & did not bother to fill water glasses. And we had to remind her for our roll that comes with lunch entre\u00e8! Fish was ok, not that fresh!"
3,"One of the stops on the Light Rail Bar Crawl, I felt that the Gin Mill was the most \""dive-y\"" with a lot of dented chrome and scarred wood a bathroom that needed a flamethrower and some seriously loud music. I sat at the bar with my beer and watched the young-uns dancing to the DJ's tunes on the \""stage\"". This vantage point gave me a great opportunity to see the bartenders in operation. Fast, efficient and friendly. Picking up abandoned empties and serving out drinks quickly. Impressive.\n\nBouncer at the door checking ID's. Taxi stand outside ready to take the wobbly folks home, but I was good. It's a very short walk to the Light Rail station that gave me time to sober up (I only had four drinks over five hours) while riding back to my parked car."
3,"I have really enjoyed Dos Chandler for a few years now, I used to just drink their Negra Modelo and Dos X, but recently started eating the super ewey gooey chimi, which I would recommend to anyone.  Their quesadillas are awesome, they don't get much better than that.  (And I work in a New Mexican style kitchen). I feel they should offer more Mexican beers on tap, and definitely need more tequila options.  The frozen margaritas aren't anything to brag about, however.  The tables are usually sticky now whenever I sit down..and I haven't had a consistent server or bartender in a long time, there is always someone new, but they do a decent job taking care of me, but I can tell they don't have much support management-wise on the floor.  I give three stars due to dirty tables, poor beer selection on tap, and the usual generic tequila selection.  Being a Mexican restaurant they need to step up their game and clean the place up."
3,"Ok I guess...Ate there this morning about 8:45. Sat down, was acknowledged with a nod and be with you in a minute...but was closer to 7 or 8. Ordered \""the handful\"" which has 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, potatoes, and 2 bacon. Wanted to trade bacon for veggies but was told it would be $1 more even though on side items, the bacon cost more than the veggies...go figure.  Make the customer happy and he'll come back tomorrow, don't and he won't.\nIt was decent, can't complain too much, but can't give thumbs up either."
3,"August trip: Arrived here by taxi (cheaper than using a shuttle!) from the airport. The Bell-Man took our luggage so we did not need to wait in line for the luggage area. Check-in took about 30-45 minutes on a Sunday. We stayed in the newly renovated Grand Tower. Amenities included king bed, expensive mini fridge, awesome upgraded view for our anniversary. The spa was terrific except for the nude woman inside the women's hot tub. Germs - EW! Beware of the pool. I came back with an unwanted bacterial infection on my legs that took 4 weeks to clear up with antibiotics."
3,"This is the Grand Lux Cafe located inside the Venetian. There's another one in the Palazzo but supposedly this one is better. The only other Grand Lux Cafe I've been to is the one in the Beverly Center in Beverly Hills and in comparison, they're pretty similar in terms of ambience and food, but this one is open 24 hours!!\n\nWe had a huge group of about 15 and we were lucky enough to get seated right away even though it was peak dinner time and we didn't have reservations (you have to make them 2 hours in advance). \n\nMy friend and I shared a sausage, pepperoni, and mushroom pizza. It was super doughy (a little too soft for my taste). I couldn't even break the pieces apart cleanly without all the toppings and cheese falling off all over the place. But the CRUST was delicious! My friend and I found ourselves just eating the crust off of each slice towards the end. They have all kinds of food here--it's really similar to Cheesecake Factory because it's the sister restaurant. But I'd avoid the \""asian\"" food if I were you, especially if you're looking for something authentic because you're probably not going to find that here."
3,I was a bit dubious about a cafe that advertises coffee that doesn't taste like coffee but the espresso was decent. Not awesome but better than Starbucks.
3,"good food. consistently slow and lousy service.  I had forgotten that it was nearly exactly a year since I'd been here,  and had the exact same experience (and my companions remembered too).  Very attentive manager,  but indifferent servers ... unbelievably slow.   It took an hour and a half since we arrived to go from order to meal.   Twice I had to get up and ask the manager about the status (oh and we ordered sushi, which doesn't need to be cooked!). \n\nFood was very good though.  So if you want great food without caring about the wait,  or attitude of the staff then Kona Grill is the place for you!"
3,"My Partner and I flew into Phoenix last week for the Christmas Holiday and we stopped here for lunch before heading out to the family.    I was fairly impressed with the cuisine and the ambiance.\n\nI had a burger with all the trimmings and it was prepared perfectly.  I would have liked a few more fries with the burger, but I probably didn't need them.\n\nI have to say the 80's hair band music videos playing were a little weird though.\n\nIf I find myself back in Phoenix, I will eat here again."
3,"This is exactly what I was looking for in a hotel during my one night stay in Pittsburgh. Close to the city, but far enough out to get free parking and a reasonable rate (under $100).\n\nThe room was fairly small, but I was only planning on sleeping in it. It was clean so I couldn't ask for much more. The people at the front desk were very friendly too.\n\nIf I go back to Pittsburgh, I will absolutely stay here again."
3,"Went to Rigatonys tonight with my sister and niece. Niece and I shared manicotti. It was decent enough, not super fabulous but not the worst I've ever had. My sister had the Mahi special with asparagus and quinoa pasta. She loved it. There was a creamy dill sauce on the fish. The salad was also awesome- nice portion of salami, cheeses, olives, pepperocini etc.. We tried spumoni for dessert and that was legit and a nice portion as well. Bryce was our server and was very nice, knowledgeable and had everything out in a timely manner. He told us about the extra charge for split plate. The meal came with bread as well. It was an overall great experience and we will be back."
3,"I came here on a Saturday for lunch and it was packed so we took our food to go. By the time I was able to eat my torta ahogada, it had already soaked up all the spicy sauce it was swimming in and was soggy and quickly disintegrating. Normally I'm pretty tolerant to spicy foods but all I could taste was spicy. My friend got 3 fish tacos, which were super tiny. He was still hungry afterwards so he had san other full meal. Overall, it did not live up to all the good reviews I kept reading about on Yelp."
3,"Food good sometimes ,remodel nice. \n2 times there .  1 waitress had attitude over easy eggs runny did not eat nothing done.\n2 attitude waitress again we were a group after bowling  some women playing. Mah jong told us to be quiet it is a restaurant we were paying they were playing for free.\nMaybe we should start a poker group there and not pay then IHOP would listen to our complaints."
3,"I've made plenty of bad decisions here.\n\nHave you ever been somewhere where it means nothing, but somehow, means everything? I like coming to Maz. They don't have a good selection of beer. Or drinks. They don't have good pool tables. There are plenty of shady things that go on here. But still I find myself here every once in a while; generally I'm in a really crappy mood, or I'm feeling to good to go home and too mashed up to go anywhere else."
3,The service was a bit slow but the food made up for it. The sushi was delicious and the burger was unique and flavorful. We also got the mixed delux fries basket which was phenomenal. I would definitely come back.
3,"Moderate place to stay in a great location - so close to the conveniences of the mall, movie theatre, etc. and just 10-15 minutes from the main shopping and tourist bits. Also just a couple blocks from the cute and trendy but relatively calm and tourist-free cafes on Broughton Street. Within the hotel there's a nice lounge with a fireplace to spend time in with a beer, cocktail, or coffee. And a full restaurant if you're feeling lazy. \n\nAs for the room itself, the walls are quite thin so you can hear people coming and going quite easily, and the wifi, though free is slow as a snail, maybe slower. Not a place to spend much time, but a fine place to return to after a day of exploring."
3,Came in. Waiter was alright. Gave me a stair like I didn't know what I was doing. He gave mediocre service. I'm full
3,"Qdoba is ok. Same idea as Chipotle Grill, but, in my opinion, the food just doesn't taste as good. The burritos don't have that magic ingredient that makes me want to return. And I did not dig the decorating scheme - especially the concrete floors and metal tables. It feels cold and dark, even in the summer."
3,"I recently went to this restaurant to celebrate my coworkers birthday. I have never had any problems with Applebee's; however, this particular time, I ordered the shrimp and spinach salad and found some type of plastic in my salad. Both the manager and waitress apologized for the incident and were very quick to fix the problem. I was offered a new salad (which I took to go because my coworkers had finished their meal already) and when the food was brought out to me, the manager came back again to apologize. My meal was also free. I gave them a 3 because of how both the manager and waitress quickly fixed the problem. I don't think it was their fault but rather the fault of the cooks who were preparing the foods. My salad was also very good!"
3,"I normally come every Sunday during football season. Today was a spur of the moment decision. Sat down to my favorite Asian bartender in the US. She recommend the wings which were phenomenal. Also ordered the Kobe burger. Took it home, opened the box and found two ROTTEN tomatoes which smelled worse than organic fertilizer and just as mushy. Took it back to get a new one, where I was told it was normal for that kind of tomato to smell, look, and feel like a decomposed body. This asst manager clearly has no idea what food or customer service looks like. Luckily the GM was there to smooth things over. If it weren't for my bartender, I would never set foot back in this place again."
3,"Horchata is delish! Familiar faces is nice. Pretty good veggie burrito, bomb breakfast burrito, seriously good. Decent prices, but their guacamole could use some work."
3,"I go to this facility usually 3 nights per week at about 2am and love it. Its jot crowded at all, usually having about 3-5 people in it. I can have the basketball court to myself I wanted and move freely through workout stations."
3,"At first glance, this store looks like a tourist trap as it is in old town and they are selling Mexican trinkets. However, I can't say with absolute certainty, the prices seemed to be pretty decent.  I bought a colorful straw sombrero for 5 dollars.  I saw some other items that seemed to be priced right.\n\nYou can find all your Mexican things to make for a fantastic fiesta.  Or you can find pieces to decorate your home with in this store -- from the colorful Dia de Muertos Masks to the plates and cups to the garden pieces.  \n\nI did not find the ladies in the store to be friendly at all.  But the store is neat and you will be happy, I am sure, with the HUGE selection of trinkets."
3,"We have been going to PP for over 17 years. Dr Chiles and Dr Salek have been my children's doctors from the beginning. We have seen a lot of faces come and go. Now that PP has merged with  another very large group, it just isn't the same. I still love our doctors and that is why we stay as my children are older now and need less frequent visits. This office just doesn't have the same family friendly feel it once used to."
3,Patience is required as they take their sweet time and it isn't even busy. It's been 30 minutes and I don't know that they'll be done soon. I would come back because it's cheap but definitely not during 'rush' hour.
3,"What a monstrosity.  This place is huuuuuuge!  If you enter from the sidewalk on the strip and try walking all the way through the casino to try to find either the lobby or the monorail, you're bound to become lost.  The signs have arrows pointing this way or that way, but they are sometimes contradictory.  You can end right back up where you started at and not have a clue as to how you arrived back there.\n\nIt's a lovely hotel and pretty well maintained, but starting to show its age in some ways.  At one time it had a Wizard of Oz/Hollywood theme.  Now that's completely vanished, and I'm not sure if it even has a theme anymore.  If there is one, it's not apparent.  \n\nEverything is also green.........veeeeeerrryyyy green."
3,"Just wanted to update. Manager contacted us. Was willing to give full refund or have the top installed for free. Seems there was a communication issue. Issue was resolved, even kept the truck box cover. Did have an issue, but company did resolve in a timely manner and apologized for the miscommunication"
3,"I'd give Dolce 3.5 stars (if it were possible).  I really like the location and the atmosphere is cozy.  I've never eaten at this location other than some hummus and pita chips.  Based on other reviews, I might increase my rating once I sample the fare.  As a wine bar, I'm always happy to stop in to get a glass of red and talk with friends.  At times, I haven't found the servers to be friendly or warm; however, I haven't had any particular problems.  It's just a vibe.  I also wish they would extend their wine list.  As another reviewer commented, there just isn't a lot to choose from.  If you're in the area, I'd definitely stop in, although I wouldn't drive into NoDa just for this venue."
3,"We stopped here for happy hour as I was lazy and it is close to work. Turns out they have a decent happy hour with assorted drink specials, half off selected apps and a pick 2 food special that runs open to close for $6.99. I selected the Tortilla soup and cheese enchiladas. The soup was good and enchiladas was also good and came with rice and beans. Our server was great and I wish I remembered her name but after a couple of the happy hour Margaritas names escape me."
3,"I can here solely based off a recommendation from a friend who told me this was \""the best pizza in Vegas\"". I consider that something of a dubious distinction since Vegas, to my knowledge, is not known for any pizza places. And if CA can barely get pizza right, I had a hard time believing Vegas could do any better. \n\nFor the record, I live and die by NYC pizza. There is nothing on this planet that even compares. Yes, Chicago, that includes you. \n\nThey were having a special deal where all pies were half off, so we got a large topped with pepperoni, sausage, and black olives. The quality just wasn't there for me. The pizza wasn't crispy enough, for one thing. Every time I folded a slice in half the front would start to droop like it was going flaccid. The sausage and pepperoni didn't help things since both were so greasy the pie was getting soggy. I'm cool with pepperoni, but those little blobs of meat called sausage do nothing for me. I should have vetoed that topping suggestion when it came up. Pretty good crust, though. Nothing that saved the dish but it worked all the same. \n\nIs this the best Vegas can do? Decent doesn't cut it for me. I can't grade on a relative scale."
3,"I have sat in the dining room as well as the hibachi grill on several occasions at this restaurant. I've never had a bad experience while dining at the grill. The food has always been superb and the chefs are very entertaining!\n\nThe dining room experience is less than satisfactory, however. Each time I've been there for sushi, I've had to wait 30+ minutes for my meal (the wait has always been acknowledged by the staff...last time each waiting table was given complimentary edamame). Not enough sushi chefs (only 1 person was working on each occasion) and/or wait staff.\n\nI'd love to give this restaurant a higher rating, but until I see stellar service throughout the establishment, I have to go with ***."
3,Took my commuter in for an oil change and was very pleased with the cost and speed that it got done.  The location is perfect as well to just take a walk over to Costco to shop or snack while waiting.  \n\nFYI Check for coupons on their Yelp page before going it might save you some money like it did me :)
3,"This was supposed to be Las Vegas' latest and greatest club... I thoroughly enjoyed the sound and the vibe of the House floor, but it was so crowded that you couldn't dance let alone stand anywhere without it being shoulder to shoulder. We opt to say in the Hip Hop area that was equally as crowded, but luckily we found a small corner to dance in. After a while, we got even luckier as a girl invited us to dance in her table reserve area and Warren G performed. Being West Coast girls my group knew all the songs and had a great time watching his show. We left immediately after because it was just too packed for us.\n\nDon't buy bottled water b/c the small bottle costs $9 talk about rip off."
3,"I loved it the first time and intended to give this place 5 stars since it was good and I ate it two days in a row. This time I feel like there was a lack in quality for the sandwich. I ordered 4 Earl's club sandwiches, and none of them had lettuce -NADA! It also had too much bacon, so the sandwich was wayyy too salty. Eh I am officially sick of this place. I will not crave for it next time."
3,"A decent substitute for Pita Jungle. Prices are a bit high for what you get compared to Pita Jungle. I have only ever gotten Togo food. I imagine it can sometimes be unpleasant to eat there. They allow Hooka smoking on patio. Even picking up my Togo food I have to brave the Hooka smell. Food is pretty good, just might wanna tweak a couple things."
3,The tacos were greasy and unflavorful. I was quite disappointed with my order. There was also dirt on the floors and the people making the food didn't speak much English
3,"Kitty's cafe is located in the El Cortez Hotel and Casino....... \nand you get the friendly service in here that you can experience everywhere else in this hotel.\nIt is an old style vegas hotel diner, with booths and the traditional counter service.\nThe ladies working there call everyone \""honey\"" or they know most of them by name. \n\nThe menu is what you would expect from a downtown hotel diner.\nNothing fancy, but large portions.\nI tried the grilled sourdough melt - with turkey and ham.\nLarge, average.....\nOn this day there was a \""new cook\"" and the food was slow getting out.\n\nLate at night - it might be the place to get that bite you are needing - (it was for me) ....... otherwise - I am sure you can find better places to eat for the same amount of money.\nYes - all those \""old school $1.99 deals\"" are gone."
3,"This Starbucks is I guess owned by NY NY hotel so they don't use the App...sucky store!! No fare to the app users when you don't have cash on you! Good thing I had money this time and didn't loose to the slot machines here!  \n\nIt's always busy here but goes pretty fast and has a good selection of goods to eat. They open 24/7 which is a good thing. They make their coffee good. Of course, I will be back since this Starbucks is in our hotel but start using the app payment and have them work with Starbucks so we can get our points! Hahaha"
3,"Here we are at another DDD visited restaurant...\n\nMelissa, our server, offered a bubbly good morning and \n\nAfter the customary 10 minute wait. (No wait usually means not great)\n\nCoffee full bodied and rich, diet coke properly carbonated.\n\nOur eggs were delivered so fast I only got three sentences of this review completed before arrival.\n\nOur glasses were always kept full!\n\nNice breakfast place."
3,"It was a convenient walk over from the FireSky hotel across the street. We started with the green pork chili. It was tasty, but not hot. We also had the lamb fondue, which is lamb rack with a squash sauce to dip them in. The squash \""fondue\"" part was quite tasty. The lamb was cooked well.\n\nFor the main course I tried the braised short rib. It was really big. It didn't have a ton of flavour; a shame for such a tasty meat. It needed salt & pepper and the core seasoning just didn't stand out.\n\nThe food is good, but I feel it's all a bit under seasoned. Everything (except the lamb fondue) could have had some extra punch to it. Still, it wasn't so bad that you feel ripped off, so I'm going 3 stars on this."
3,"Tapas great, paella salty.  Never had it before thought it would be good here,  tapas were tasty especially the mushroom risotto ,  oxtail was tender ,  potatoes yummy,  garlic chicken was good but I ate a clove of garlic by mistake vampires beware.  However, the paella was way too salty.  And the service for a restaurant in the Aria was only so so.  Service was alot better in cafe in the Aria"
3,There were limited options for dinner before the show we were seeing at the Luxor. The 20 year old ticket agent suggested T&T. Said it was great. I should have known we would not have the same palate. We started our meal with a set of mojitos. Our waiter indicated they were very good. I order them whenever I can so I have had my share of mojitos. These were very very sweet. I ordered club soda twice to add to our drinks to reduce the sweetness. Nothing saved these drinks. We didn't even finish half of it. Horrible.\nThe chips and salsa were also not very good which is fairly unusual. Pretty easy to make good chips and salsa. I had tacos for dinner and my friend had a shrimp dish. Both were very average.\nOur server was friendly and even came around at the end and offered free tickets to the show. We already had purchased our tickets but the offer was very kind.\nI wouldn't go back to this restaurant because if I had known the Asian restaurant had a good menu I would have gone there.
3,"Easily the best meal I enjoyed in Vegas this past week. I was on a vacation with my sisters. Knowing we would be eating out for 6 days we tried to keep the budget in check. This restaurant was recommended by a friend of my sister did not disappoint as far as the food was concerned. It is tucked away in the back of the food court. Location isn't great...I suppose that is how they keep the prices down. \""Outdoor tables\"" are actually inside. Lighting in the interior of the restaurant is way too bright.\nService was very average...our waiter was a hyper-macho Italiano who kept himself busy fawning over the young girls eating next to us, and chatting with his buddies out in the food court plaza. At the end of our meal he was so carried away with his buddies that he had totally forgotten about us, and need to be retrieved by a bus boy. \nThe Caeser Salad that we shared was good. Filet mignon meatballs with spaghetti and red sauce were delicious, as was the wood-fired Quatro Stagioni pizza. I highly recommend the food...the service not so much."
3,"Loved spotting The Dog empire during my show long weekend trip to Edinburgh.  Awesome and funky design and great restaurant concepts (The Dog, UnderDog, SeaDog and Amore Dog).  Wished I had more time to try all of 'em!  \n\nMy flank steak salad was ok (2.5 stars), a bit tough but the sweet balsamic reduction was just the right tough for the bitter arugula.  Boyfriend's mushroom risotto (4.0 stars)  was decadent and cooked perfectly.  To ended the meal we had the tiramisu (3 stars), unfortunately, the dish lacked the punch of espresso, was chilled as I like the desert and the dark chocolate cocoa powder (when taken in a mouthful) overpowered the light dessert.  We ended up scrapping the top power off the dish."
3,Food was great and reasonably priced with restaurant.com coupon. I would've gave five stars if the waiter wasn't so cocky and direct.
3,"Great beer selection.  But if you are looking for more consistency, it is probably not the spot (they have a rotating tap selection).  The food was actually quite wonderful. I didn't expect much for bar food, but was pleasantly surprised.  I went with a large group and we had a great time drinking and answering trivia questions from one of their board games (there is a whole table full of games for customers to enjoy, yay!). \n\nI'd say the biggest downfall for this place is the atmosphere and service... there was pretty full crowd when I went in-and only 1 server for the whole place.  Ridiculous.  He was real nice and apologetic so we took it all in stride.  But there were _long_ stretches where we didn't see him or get helped.  He did his best to keep up, but it was a noticeable problem. Sure I'd go back, but never again when hungry.  As for the atmosphere--the bar is a few steps up from a dive.  Okay to hang out for locals, but not the place to impress.  Friendly staff, good food and beer are enough to make you overlook this."
3,"i've been going here for several years now, and i as long as i see dr. finch, i'm pretty happy. he's done one surgery on dozer (a minor laser procedure to remove a growth from her eyelid but did require anesthesia) and was very reassuring, informational and has a good dogside manner. just found out he'll probably be doing another surgery on her (much more major acl repair) and i'm totally comfortable having him do it.\n\ni only update and drop a couple stars bc 1. i was prob a little too gracious on my first review (i was a new yelper with out a system yet) and 2. other friends talk about how much they LOVE their vets, but i don't have that kind of passion for this place. i keep trying to shop around, but put it off until all of the sudden, dozer needs help NOW, so i want to go somewhere she's got some history on their files."
3,"So far, I've only had the breakfast here, and actually just the omelets (corned beef and the farmer's).  The food is good enough, nothing spectacular.  I do like the fact that you can have blueberry muffin instead of toast.  The server was polite, had no problem bringing out ranch dressing with my hash browns (weird combo I like).  It's also the only thing open past 10 pm not in a casino and reasonably priced in the area.  Not a bad place to sit down and have a casual meal with a buddy.  I do have to complain about the fact that they don't serve dark chicken meat (white is too dry for me)."
3,"Okay, I'm giving 3 stars because the food was pretty good and the service was great.  But $18 for enchiladas?? Whoaaa now.  $5 roach coach enchiladas could stand up to theirs.  $9 chips and guacamole?? It was good but not $9 good!  I think this place has a complex... You can put cloth napkins and fancy paper menus on the table but in the end you're still a mainstream Mexican restaurant with TONS of competition... CHEAP competition that's just as good.  I won't go back just because of the price unfortunately..."
3,"Mert's is one of those places you would see on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. The decor has a quintessential southern comfort feel and will make any out of towner feel welcome. \n\nI don't suggest eating lunch here though; if it happens, it's a wrap. You'll be knocked out like a newborn after boobie feeding. Service is good, food is decent and overall an okay spot to grab a meal."
3,"Harrah's has a smart business module when it comes to Carnaval Court. It is situation on a pathway that sucks tourist in. With all the kiosks around, it has useless souvenirs within drunken reach. Even though my friends and I were not inebriated, we still bought those shirts that light up to the music. Thinking they were the epitome of cheesy tourist, we all bought matching shirts to signify our unity. \n\nEntering the party scene with our newly acquired garments garnered so much attention and compliments. The dance floor is large and provides enough room to get down. Being outside helps alleviate the overheating that sometimes occurs when the dance floor gets too crowded. \n\nThe flare bartenders are fun to watch and make a decent cocktail. If you want to alternate between partying and gambling, this is the perfect venue because they have table games set aside as well. It has everything someone coming to Vegas is looking for."
3,It was nice to relax for dinner on night this week and if you want to relax this is the place to do it at.  The view is just amazing and the staff was very friendly.  I had the Rib eye steak and it was cook just perfect.  Blue cheese potatoes were really good but I think the Blue Cheese was a bit over powering for the potatoes.\n\nI also had some cake for desert but the ice cream  had started to melt and the cake was a bit dry.  For the price I expected a bit better on the details like that.  In the end it was worth the trip for the view.
3,"Recommended by a friend. He made it sound exclusive since dim sum was open twice a year, I felt that the dim sum style food could have been better if they focused on that and left the buffet of sea food out. It was tasty but some that came out was cold. They didn't have the chili oil like most Chinese restaurants I go to in San Diego, that was ok though since the items we had were a tad salty. The non dim sum items are  great though, fresh raw oysters, crab legs, lobster, nigiri, I actually asked the guy behind the sushi bar if I could have pieces with out rice, he said they usually don't give it out like that but he made an exception for me, to bad those pieces were so thick. I wanted to ask for a piece of the octopus but felt like I was going to inconvenience him so I walked down the buffet line, there was a yummy octopus and cucumber salad, probably the best thing on the buffet. They had a surplus of fresh fruit, mandarin oranges, cherries, rambutan, I didn't feel like working for my food though. Desert bar was pretty cool, decent, but not great. I really wish they more focused on dim sum though.. Next to sushi, dim sum is my favorite. Maybe I'll go this weekend when I get home to San Diego.."
3,"It's like gambling. Sometimes, you win big...and other times...not so much.\n\nThe show started off great. Our MC was engaging and very funny. He was very comfortable in his own skin and using his life as material for his comedy, but he was still socially aware to not go too far. The same cannot be said about the first two comedians that came after who were crude, swore way too much, and shoved their distasteful humor down your throat irregardless of people being notably disgusted. At one point, a lady stood up after the joke went too far and asked the comedian to move on. Instead, he used this as fodder to continue at it. I get using someone as the butt of all jokes, but when LITERALLY no one else is laughing with you...it is time to move on. Luckily, the MC was able to put a bandaid over each of these two flops.\n\nThe headliner Jay Reid did make up for the entire night though...otherwise it would have been a complete dud at $20/ticket. Jay Reid made excellent use of the stage going as far as using the stool and mic stand as props. He had jokes about current events as well as of normal controversial/taboo subjects. The jokes were tasteful and he even stuck around to meet the audience after. Very classy and cool."
3,"I came here for my 18th birthday with a few friends. They have a happy hour from 2-6 PM Monday-Friday (unfortunately, we came at 7.) I had the grilled chicken sandwich, and the chicken was kind of pink, but it took about 45 minutes to get and I was hungry so I didn't send it back. We also shared a frozen hot chocolate, which had potential, but I was literally chewing on ice the whole time. The service was pretty slow and it's a little pricier than Cheesecake Factory, but not by much. I'll give it another try soon and hope it's better!"
3,"This isn't your Grandpa's Flamingo anymore. I would even venture to say this isn't your overweight Chain smoking uncle Larry's Flamingo we all knew and didn't love from 5-10 years ago!\n\nBefore My recent trip to The Flamingo, the thought of staying there would immediately trigger thoughts of Depressing 1980's decor, overweight fanny pack wearing gamblers & The over exuberant expressions of Donnie & Marie as they stared longingly into each others eyes trying to forget about that one night back in 77' when things went a little to far. But to the contrary I must say the Flamingo has really cleaned up its act. The new decor is nice and the casino floor is clean and 80% fanny pack clear. \n\nNow saying that I have yet to stay in a room, but I will say that , where as before I would've only taken a side chick I was slightly ashamed of. Now I would be ok with taking a side chick I was not ashamed of, as well as possibly a girl that I have been dating awhile, all the while  insisting \""Why do we have to put labels on what we are\"" here without hesitation!\n\nAll in all The Flamingo is an OK place with a GREAT location that I would recommend anyone walking the strip to try out. Hey, who knows you may finally be the first person to see Donnie and Marie finally consummate 35 years of tension and frustration!"
3,"I've eaten here twice when I was staying at Treasure Island. The Pho is just okay but it'll do in a pinch. It probably smells better than it tastes.\n\nI've tried to veggie spring rolls which were decent, but the peanut sauce is just okay - kind of coco-nutty. \n\nI got the Pho Tai and my friend got the Veggie Pho.  My soup was not super tasty but had lots of pieces of beef but very little noodles.  My friend enjoyed her soup - had bak choy, mushrooms and corn.  Little pricey for pho as you can get an awesome tasting bowl in LA for like 7 dollars.\n\nWaitress was nice and the place was clean."
3,"Not a huge fan of this Target.  It's the closest one so I find myself going there but the store is so large and it feels like everyone inside is an ASU student at times.  Which basically means it is always crowded with people and I find myself waiting in line to check out.  Otherwise, it's has a lot of good things.  Lots of parking, great staff and like I said before it's super sized so you can find anything and everything you need in one location."
3,The employees spend too\nMuch time with there backs to the customers talking amongst themselves instead of focusing on providing better service!
3,"I just happened to be in Vegas this new year and since I saw this place in the past i decided to try it. Salad bar is ok, the meats a bit too salty and really raw (bloody) but I was surely disappointed with the service. Waitress show up only 3 times, when we first sat at the table, when she brought us the drinks and when she gave us the check!, I have to literally ask the servers to bring the meats to our table since the seem to just pas us by, I guess the just want you to eat from the salad bar :( \nIn other words, the price service/quality ratio is not good at all"
3,"We stumbled upon this place after failing to go to the Bacchanal because of the nasty line. By the time we found this place, we were starving! This is a cool little cafe place with pretty modern decorations throughout the restaurant. They blast top 20s hits here, so if you're looking for a nice quiet place to chat, this definitely isn't the place.\n\nPortions here are pretty large but we really didn't think anything of the food. Nothing stood out or was spectacular. I got a pastrami breakfast sandwich and I felt like it was missing something. If they had added some extra condiments or had a special sauce it would be much better. It felt like the pastrami, egg, and other ingredients didn't flow that well together. Nonetheless it filled us. I did enjoy the tator tots though, they were crispy, crunchy and delicious."
3,"This is a cool spot and very educational. I loved the way that everything is divided into 4 ecosystems, I would have liked the polar/arctic room to have more though. I think that the entry fee is way too much for what you get. The gift shop is nice. You can find cool things like bags made from recycled juice boxes, insect snacks (yes REAL insects to eat) and small crystals, etc.\n\nDon't waste your time and money to take the elevator to the top of the city. You can essentially get the same view for free from the top of Mount Royal."
3,"Again, this is one of those chains where you can't judge a book by its cover! If you have the time you can find some really great deals here! \n\nThey have pretty much everything here, clothes, paintings and plenty of home decor. When I visited they were changing over some departments it looks like they are going to have a larger selection of rugs and portraits and paintings which will be great or anyone who is looking to update their home.\n\nI enjoyed the visit and would return! Just remember when you go be prepared to search for your good deals!"
3,Well they no longer have the Chicken Strip Cheese sandwich and what they replaced it with pretty much sucks. Other than that its like a normal hooters with some new wing flavors and steak fries.
3,"This hotel is for folks on a budget looking for a room with the basics. It served its purpose for our trip and would recommend it to someone who isn't looking for all the bells and whistles. I saw pizza, subway and fatburger plus movie theater, bars and lots of slot machines. Didn't do much in the hotel besides sleep. Fatburger tasted horrible and took forever."
3,"I was motivated to go here because I saw it featured on the Food Network, and I was hoping it could hold a candle to the Boiling Crab.  While to seafood was pretty good, it wasn't as spicy & flavorful as I had hoped for.  Go early as it tends to get crowded.  We went at 11am on a weekend and by the time we finished our meal, there was a line for tables."
3,"Solid 3 star red curry tofu.\n\nNot 5 star, not 4 star...but hey!  They did great with the one classic dish I ordered..."
3,"The hubby and I stopped by around 8:30 at night. Upon pulling up, we seen that the line was almost out the door. Determined to get some ice cream, I insisted on going in and waiting in line. It took about 15 minutes to get our order, but the place was jam packed so the wait was to be expected.  All the employees were doing their best to keep the line down. I ordered the smallest size, \""like it\"", and the employee actually gave me the next size up at no charge because she said she grabbed too much ice cream. \n\nThere's very little seating at this location,  and the available tables were dirty. But to be fair,  if all hands were on deck making orders, whose left to clean up? We chose to get our order to-go. \n\nI'm a fan of Cold Stone's ice cream.  I'm accustomed to the long lines. But to me, it's worth waiting to get me some \""All lovin' no oven\""."
3,This place reminded me of Whiskey River without the shit kickers on the beach side and more of the laid back people. There were dance offs on the floor it seemed people were having fun. 99 cent Jaeger bombers and I heard 99 cent tacos or something. There was a wet t contest with only 3 contestants it was kinda sad but entertaining nonetheless. I'd probably go again.
3,"The Grandview Saloon has one of the best views of Pittsburgh from Mt. Washington from its patio. The views from the interior of the restaurant are not bad either.  To go with your view, you can choose from a good selection of drinks and more mediocre Pittsburghesque (i.e., comfort) food. The design of the patio is fine, but the interior of the restaurant is very plain. This is a shame, because with a little work on the interior design and menu, the view could make this one of the city's most interesting restaurants. \n\nIn short, I would not go here to celebrate an anniversary, but it's a good place to take first-time visitors to see the city while enjoying a tasty beverage."
3,"Great, friendly and attentive service. We had the Caesar salad, duck & scallops. Salad was great, duck was good & very rich. Scallops were so-so & not something I'd recommend ordering. Over all an okay meal, but not one I'd repeat."
3,"I've been going here during the week, and in bad weather it is hard to tell it is even open.  There are some things I really love here and some that I don't.  The flowers are a steal and beautifully arranged, though they do not last very long - maybe two or three days.  There are some really good deals on produce, and I have gotten some great tomatoes and peaches in season.  However, about half of the stuff is not local.  I had a hard time finding a local apple, and a lot of the produce has sku stickers on it telling you that it's from california or washington or whatever.  Still, there are some local farmers interspersed in there and they make it worth it.  I still will visit regularly."
3,"I usually love The Coffee Bean.\nSomething's wrong with this one, though....  something's wrong with all the coffee inside the Venetian!!?!?!\n\nI love a good, strong cup of coffee but it's either the water at the Venetian, or a plot to drive me insane, but all the coffee in the Venetian Hotel drives me nuts.  \n\nBut, it beats the room service coffee, and every morning. I had a cup of Joe from this place.\n\nFor the coffee -  1 star.\nThe way I had it brought to me every morning while in Vegas by a wonderfully  considerate hunk of a man  - - I throw in an additional 2 stars... hence, the 3-star rating.  :-)"
3,"Good store with a lot of products that I'd actually use.   It is a really good savings on groceries.  \n\nThe place is well laid out, but it can get messy because of the other shoppers.\n\nThe only issue I've experienced at the times I've gone is that there is a very long line to check out.  It's a small price to pay for the savings that can be had.  Be prepared to wait up to 15+ minutes to check out!"
3,"It is a clean place and they have good service. The Koi pond is pretty cool. The sandwich I ordered was pretty awful, don't get the turkey because it is like packaged meat you can buy at a supermarket. The prices were on par with other delis, but you can get a much better sandwich for the same price elsewhere."
3,"*sigh*  I really wanted to love this, but it was just ok.  After reading all the positive yelps and testimonials on Pop's website, I was expecting a fun and delicious experience.  I imagined myself giving my order to a gruff but charming grill master, who would ask me 'wit' onions? in an authentic Philly accent.  What I really got was a grill master who was just gruff and apparently couldn't hear my order, because when I got my cheese steak home, there were no onions on it at all!   \n\nOk, the cheese steak itself:  the meat was not fatty or greasy, but slightly bland.  I enjoyed the cheese whiz and the bread was very good.  I think if they had included the onions, things would have been tastier.  Also, in the hours since eating the steak, I have been a bit 'indisposed', but this in and of itself has never been an index of whether I would return to a place if the food tastes good.  (masochist!)\n\nSo all in all, I think I would try it again probably.  But I'll also try their competition in town and yelp the results.  :)"
3,"Cabo is a very busy place- even on a Tuesday night! Luckily we were a party of 2 and were seated pretty quick. The food tasted good and fresh, but I had very high expectations based on the reputation they have in Charlotte. I was hoping for a little more flavor.\n\nContrary to some of the other reviews, I didn't feel rushed even though they were jammin'. I went with a friend and we were catching up for quite a while, but our waitress was friendly and didn't rush us, which I appreciated. Parking can be difficult, like most places in NoDa, so plan to cruise around a little. \n\nOverall I think Cabo has a fun atmosphere for grabbing drinks and something to eat, but it isn't a \""go out of your way\"" establishment."
3,"We were on our way back from a trip to Mexico and Cuba* when we arrived here for a short layover. This airport is easy to navigate, especially when you are coming through immigration -- there are lots of signs telling you exactly where to go. \n\nThere was a long line at immigration but it moved fairly quickly. My honey and I had all of our research license paperwork in order for the Cuba portion of our travels in case we were asked for it** but the not-even-a-hello immigration officer guy just scanned our passports, looked at us with his best stern face, and stamped us on our way. We then picked up our checked suitcases, zoomed right through customs (after handing over our customs form) and rechecked our bags. \n\nThe part that ended up taking the longest amount of time was going back through security, thanks to long lines. I do have to say that the security personnel were working very hard to move everyone along and were really nice as well.\n\nIf we had more than 5 minutes to spare, I would have picked up some local BBQ to eat on our San Francisco bound flight. Thanks a lot, security line. \n\n*You won't hear much more about our trip to Mexico and Cuba since they don't have Yelp. (At least not yet.) I'll just summarize to say that almost everywhere we slept, ate, drank, visited, etc. were unquestionably five star. \n\n** Apparently Beyonce and Jay Z did as well. http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/09/entertainment-us-usa-cuba-beyonce-idUSBRE93600V20130409"
3,"This hotel exterior is a little worn down and in need of a refurbishing. Everything about it just looks dated and tired. The rooms had obviously been updated since other parts of the hotel and they were not that bad although the tile grout looked a little dingy in my room. I did not hear the people in the room next to me as others have complained about. However, I found the food to be very good especially for a hotel. They had a decent bar with a few local brews on tap and service was friendly. The hotel location is convenient but still a 6-8 block walk to the more popular attractions downtown. We took advantage of the free shuttle service and the friendly and knowledgeable driver, Christian. Its fairly easy to get to though off I-277. For the money, it wasn't bad."
3,The restaurant is cozy and somewhat dark with a separate bar area and dining area. Service was quick and attentive. They have some different beers to experiment with and even let you sample some you're not familiar with before you commit. \n\n\nFood was OK but not great. I had half a turkey sandwich and salad. My turkey sandwich was a bit dry and bland and the salad was forgettable. As bars go and as bar food goes you could do much worse.
3,"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile after hearing good things about it and reading the menu. I realize now why the website doesn't list prices-- the mission is hideously overpriced!\n\nWe ended up on the patio since they weren't seating in the main area yet (at 6:30pm? For reals?) Our waitress was nice and attentive. She noticed my water had something floating in it and replaced it quickly. My husband's water glass was dirty too. She brought us out two sample size frozen peach and strawberry margaritas which were awesome. Much better than the rocks margarita.\n\nNo complimentary chips and salsa which would be ok if they offered something else like Barrio. No happy hour either which was disappointing.\n\nThe street corn was good, but I've had much better. The butternut squash tacos were out of this world. My husband liked them better than his mahi tacos. I just can't believe they have the gall to charge $12 for 3 tiny (3 inches in diameter) tacos. They also charge $12 for guac made from 2 avocados. I'm not sure how they have survived in this economy. They must be very slow when the tourists leave for the summer."
3,"The good:\n- children get a magna doodle to draw on, \n- the wait staff is very nice, \n- the restaurant is very clean - it's brand new, so that's expected,\n- the pasta selection is basically \""create your own\"", with 5(?) types of pasta (incl. whole wheat) and at least 5 types of sauces (incl. rose), plus you can add toppings to your pasta\n- karaoke Fri+Sat night,\n- the food tastes decent,\n- prices are decent, if you don't add extra toppings,\n- unique desert menu\n\nThe bad:\n- the kids menu is on the back of the magna doodle, but they don't tell you that, and it's small\n- kids' drinks come in an adult sized to-go cup,\n- it took them almost 10mins to clean up (my daughter's) spilled milk\n- the menu consisted of pasta, pizza and paninis, not much more,\n- pasta toppings are $1.50 each,\n- my canneloni (desert) was pretty bland."
3,We were less than welcomed at the door. The security guard was extremely disrespectful. We would not have gone in if our birthday bud didn't insist.
3,"Fun store if you are looking for Korean. To the poster that identified this store as Japanese, was wrong. Korean and Japanese foods are similar but not the same."
3,"Red 8 is a pretty good americanized chinese food. I love the Oxtail soup along with their mongolian beef and rice.. The ambiance is really nice and the service is wonderful. The dessert menu can use a bit of work but still ok. The price is a bit expensive , i think your paying for the ambiance and the fact that you are dining at the Wynn.. I don't suggest this place for chinese food. I would only go back here if i was invited, but still glad i checked this restaurant off my list."
3,"It's getting harder to find awesome deals for meals in Vegas.  Gone are the days you can get buffets for $5 or prime rib dinners for $7.99.  Oh Sahara, how I miss you!  \n\nVisiting family in Henderson, we headed over to Sunset Station for some dinner. They had prime rib dinner for $9.99, so I had to get it.  For a Saturday night, it was packed and we had to wait 15 minutes for a table.  \n\nMy prime rib dinner was good, but I should've ordered it medium rare, because medium well wasn't as tasty.  \n\nService was good and food was decent.  I just wished the prime rib dinner was little bit cheaper and then I would've given them a higher rating.  Their t-bone steak dinner special was $12.99, which I thought was a bit high for Vegas.  \n\nGrand Cafe is way better than Denny's, so for a local 24 hour spot, I'd come back to eat."
3,"I really want to like this place, but it was extremely disappointing. Maybe it was overhyped. The food was just okay, nothing sets it apart from other buffets. \n\nBased on other reviews, I might give it another shot next time I'm in Vegas, but I'd rather go back to the seafood buffet at Rio before dining here again."
3,"The food is good which is the best part, I had the endless shrimp (shrimp alfredo x 2, breaded shrimp and shrimp scampi). The worst part is the wait to be seated and served. You have to wait 30 minutes to get seated and then another 15 minutes to be served. They need better service to get a higher rating from me. The food as I said above is very good and hot and once we were served, the service was decent. The cheddar biscuits that you receive after you are seated are excellent."
3,Good sashimi a bit high priced how ever all the fish I had was fresh and well served.  I have been three times and each time had a good experience.
3,"I don't have much to say about this hotel because I wouldn't stay here again.\n\nHotel rooms-I stayed in the back tower and the walk to the tower was horrible. Walking through an entire casino with your luggage is the biggest pain in the ass, not to mention walking the bridge across the pool to get to the tower. Big thumbs down. Room was really nice, decor was nice, beds comfy, but bathroom was a motel 6 bathroom. Very old looking. Not what I would expect if owned by a hilton chain.\n\nCasino-casino was actually nice and fresh. Because it was newly renovated it smelled clean and didn't smell like a shit hole like some of the older casinos. Lots of options.\n\nAccommodations-pool was awesome, staff is nice, house keeping staff nice, but check in was a nightmare. Checked in at 2pm and line stretched to the casino. I was in the hilton honors check in and that line was in the casino as well. If it takes 30 mins for checkin, then you have already lost me as a customer that will not stay there again."
3,There's just not a big selection. The parking lot was crowded but in the store it wasn't. Friendly staff. \nI found some cute juice glasses for $0.69 that's it!
3,I stopped by here a while ago while staying at the Aria on business.  We had walked past the patisserie when headed up to our rooms and the brightness of the area along with the cakes really caught my eye. So the next morning whenever i was craving some coffee I decided to head down and get my fianc\u00e9 and I each one.  Whenever I got down there I was able to see the multi tiered cakes up close and they were truly amazing!  It made me wonder how long it took to make them.  After a short wait I made it to the front of the line and ordered two Americanos only to watch them punch something into a machine and have it spot them out.  For the $10 it cost I was really hoping to have the barista take a minute and pull the shots.  The coffee itself was decent but not great.\n\nThe bottom line for me is that I would not head back here again in the future for coffee.  However I would definitely give it a try if I was looking for a baked good.
3,"The beer is average, but overpriced.  Save yourself $10 on a case and wait until Costco restocks.  ($30 a case at the brewery, $20 at Costco).   Perhaps I would return if they end up opening up an actual restaurant,  as the staff there were extremely friendly, but not too much of a draw at this point...."
3,"This is one of those places that you must try at least one time. It is a fun experience and the meat its regularly pretty good.\nDo not come on a holiday, they do not maintain the same level of service and food quality"
3,"$30+ for tiny, tapas-size plates of food, albeit delicious food. $50-$60 for \""entree' size portions that aren't much bigger. I'm giving it three stars because I knew what I was getting myself into and I wasn't suprised when I got the bill. The restaurant itself is nice...everything red and black. We sat at the bar and watched them cook, which is the whole idea of this place.  The food is good, but the value is horrendous. If thi is suppoed to be a more 'caual' dining experience, then they need to knock 25-30% off the prices at least."
3,"Is the best bagel place I've been to? No. I came here for a \""to go\"" breakfast with my man. As we were waiting for our food, he whispered to me \""this place is filthy\"". The vent above the bagel rack was so dusty! The counters, floors and tables looked like they hadn't been wiped down either. We had already paid so we just decided to get our food and go. The guy who helped us was very sweet but incredibly slow. We spent almost 20 minutes waiting for 2 bagel sandwiches and a chocolate chip muffin. The bagel sandwiches tasted good (I tried a tomato basil bagel) and liked it. I also thought the variety in bagels was nice. The muffin wasn't my favorite but was edible. Prices were reasonable but nothing great. Just like my review says, A-OK."
3,"Was quite disappointed with this restaurant! After reading some good reviews about this place, I decided to take my family for some Pho cause I was really craving for it. As we were getting ready to order...the waitress notified us that they had no pho at the moment. How can they not have any pho...when they specialize in \""Pho\"" and isn't that why their name is \""Pho Bosa\""? If the waitress would have told us as soon as we walked in, we could have gone else where for some pho. On top of that, the food that were ordered where not all that great. The only reason why I gave this store a 3 is because the staffs were very friendly! I don't think I'll be coming back again!"
3,"Though the smell of the place can really get to you, the instructors here are amazing.  Down side is the people at the front desk are extremely rude and not very friendly.  If customer service were good all around I would have continued to come to this studio. But since it's all the way on the other side of town I think I'll have to opt out for a more welcoming environment.  \n\nOther than the downsides, they have a clean changing area with 2 showers where they provide body wash, shampoo, and conditioner so you can wash off all the nasty sweat after your classes. \n\nTry catching Summer and Stacy. They're both awesome in their own way."
3,"Breakfast with Rob,  The food is good.  I had eggs, bacon and pancakes.  Not my favorite pancakes, but ok.  Love their sausage gravy however."
3,"This place wasn't as good as we were expecting.  My pizza (Classic Maggie) was good, but nothing outstanding.  My husband's burger was completely charred and basically inedible.  We didn't bother sending it back as our waitress was nowhere to be found.\n\nIt's your typical bar food with a decent beer selection...nothing more, nothing less."
3,"Been her a couple of times now. I LOVE their beer. They ONLY serve their OWN beer. Food items are okay but not anything to write home about, nothing special. I DID NOT like their wings at all and would not recommend them. Great atmosphere and a good place to go drink. Food's a lil overpriced but it does sit in Ahwatukee. I highly recommend their \""craft brews\"" that they brew there. Actually that's the ONLY beer you can get is \""Uncle Bears\"" brewed beer. I'll be back but I won't make it a POINT to come here again. Just an okay place to go with friends. TV'S EVERYWHERE! Which makes it a good place to go to watch football. THEY ALLOW DOGS (on the patio and ON a leash\"") If you take an 8 X 10\"" picture of your dog AND FRAME it, they'll hang his/her picture up in memoriam! That's REALLY cool"
3,"Turkish Kitchen was a thoroughly decent, inexpensive meal for a group of us who hadn't booked a table in the city centre on a Friday night.\n\nOn sitting we were brought some bread and the most amazingly tasty dip ever.  I need to know what's in that dip because it was the highlight of the meal.  \n\nNot very hungry, I opted for the Turkish ravioli which, despite not being listed on the menu, came with a side of salad and rice.  The sides were a bit awkward and somewhat wasteful, but were certainly tasty.  \nThe ravioli left a lot to be desired, primarily because it was so overcooked it came apart the minute it I tried to eat it.  The taste was fine though nothing compared with my other experience with Turkish ravioli, which was such a shame because I was expecting something really fantastic.  \n\nI probably should have ordered something kebab-ey like everyone else, but I just wasn't in the mood for a meat feast.  Everyone else seemed happy with their meals, though.  \n\nOne weird thing was that when we ordered beer we got glasses which appeared all different sizes and smaller than what you would expect of either a pint or a large bottle. \n\nIt was a really good option for a group looking for something cheap and cheerful but is, in my opinion, not Edinburgh's best Turkish by a long mile."
3,"Great place for a Friday happy hour! The chambord marg is top notch, achiote chopped chicken salad is to die for, and the trio appetizer is great ONLY when it's half price during happy hour.  Highly recommend but only hangup is the cocky manager, useless hostests, and unattentive servers.  After two margaritas you get over the staff :)"
3,"I have no idea why there was such a huge hype, it was just a typical thin crusted pizza. Seriously!!!!! The toppings were good, pepperoni, sausage, etc... but honestly you can get a better pizza elsewhere.\n\nHowever, if you are dying for a late  night snack after Marquee it's conveniently located."
3,"My experience here was just okay. I ordered Pho and the broth just didn't cut it for me as being good but it was just alright. My boyfriend ordered the cashew chicken for the first time and he loved it. My friend got chicken fried rice and that was good as well. The price is fairly cheap for the portions at this place which is great for college students. I would come back here for food but not for the pho. \n\nI'm only giving three stars because of two reasons. One of them is that I ordered the Thai iced tea for almost $3 and I expecting to have some refreshing authentic Thai iced tea, but instead it was a really small bottled one from the fridge which was pretty disappointing and not worth $3. The woman behind the cashier said \""I'm too lazy to make a real one,\"" as her excuse. My second reason is that the restaurant was way too humid and hot with the doors open on a humid rainy day. I was sweating uncomfortably while eating my hot pho and it was unpleasant. There were workers fixing the ceiling tiles or something nearby too, which I thought was unacceptable for when people are eating around them only a few feet away. \n\nThe food was good, the atmosphere not so much. I will still be coming back for a quick Thai fix because it's so accessible and conveniently located on Green st."
3,"went to kings on saturday for an early meal, while out doing the day after xmas shopping!  i have been here a few times for my seafood fix, and time after time the service is very slow, and this visit is the same (at least they are consistent!!)\nstarted the table with the chilled seafood platter for 24.95  comes with 4 dungeness crab legs, 4 oysters, 4 clams and 8 shrimps.  and i think this one of the best deals in vegas for a shellfish platter.\nentrees were grilled shrimp and scallop skewars, kids burger and a combo fried platter.   the fried platter was not to good,  over breaded and gummy shrimp and scallops, and 1 little peice of cod/haddock\ni usually get the sanddabs or something that is on special,  ill stick with that in the future.  but in all actuallity i just come for the shellfsih platter!!!"
3,"I live just north of the Burger Factory, its always busy.  The menu offers a little bit of everything, making it a great place to bring an office group with  different tastes.  \n\nThe food portions are large and if your looking for a greasy spoon the burger factory might be your place for a quick bite."
3,For years I have driven past Ping Pong Thai always thinking it was an adult themed Thai restaurant with ping pong shows. No shows here. They only have food. Not even one ping pong ball:(\n\nI've tried the Panang and found it to be watery and bland. The Pad Kee Maw is consistently delicious and packs enough spice I am satisfied ordering it at Medium heat. This dish is the only reason I come here. It's certainly not for the service. \n\nThe service is slow when dining in and good luck chasing down a refill. To Go orders are the exact opposite. Either way you choose you are still left feeling like a number. Boy do they pack the herd in at lunch.\n\nIf only they had a Ping pong table I would gladly raise the star level. Maybe the owner is a ping pong champion from Thailand. Now that would be something to get excited about.
3,"It's so close by and the happy hour menu is a great deal, and so we keep going back. But every single time we go I get annoyed with several things. First, they only offer three beers on tap. Second, the service is always spotty. A server will be uncomfortably over-attentive at the beginning of the meal, then we have to hunt him down to get the check. I never understand this. It always seems delaying the bill is a huge liability. I wonder how many people have walked away from a meal without paying. The food can be spotty too. At this meal we got two regularly priced items and two happy hour items. One of the cheaper items, the calamari, was our favorite dish. The most expensive item, the elk meatballs, were bland, dry, and a sure never-order-again."
4,"Wow, harsh reviews!\n\nI found the guy behind the counter helpful.  He steered me in the right direction and I got a meal I really enjoyed.   BBQ'd tilapia and Chicken Adobo were very tasty."
4,"Close to the strip in between harrahs and ballys area in the Linq. Cool new concept, supposely all their slushies have top shelf liquor but I felt it wasn't strong enough, I believe I've gotten more drunk at fat Tuesdays slushies. They have more flavors though and we chose the patron grand mariner because it was sour.The staff is very friendly and cutely dressed, just needs more signs on the cups of drinks. The saxophone cup is seriously amazing! I think its the sexiest and bangest cup there is. ;) Ha ha"
4,"Are you supposed to be drunk for this? On drugs?  Well I was neither and man, was it weird! \n\nThis was my 2nd Cirque show (I've been to 3 now) and my first on in Vegas.  As always, the acrobatics were great and the production set was beautiful.\n\nThis was by far, the trippy-est Cirque show I've been to though.  The baby giggles and head were so creepy and weird!  \n\nCirque is always beautiful but I get the impression this isn't the best they can do in Vegas either."
4,"We ordered it for delievery with http://www.youbuyandwefly.com.  It's resonably priced and very yummy.  We'll order again.  I can't comment on the actual location though because again we ordered delievery.  I had the hot and sour soup and it was delicous, we also ordered some sweet and sour pork, orange chicken, and chicken chow main it was all good!"
4,"This place is fun because there is always a live band playing in the evening. So if you are looking do get your dance on like you are at a wedding, then this is it. In fact, if I was getting married (too late), then I would bring the whole wedding party by here and tell them to enjoy the reception. The only problem is that it is a cash bar (and credit or room charge too)! I hate those kind of weddings (not the band part but the cash bar part). \n\nTables fill up fast but the room isn't closed off from the casino. You can always walk up with your own drink and enjoy the show. There are also slot machines within ear and eye shot.\n\nI love this place because it reminds me of Old Vegas. Every casino had musical acts playing in the bars and lounges. There was no cover all Vegas wanted was you to come in and spend money on your drinks. Now every casino has mega night clubs with Lines and VIP lists, Karaoke bars, and dueling pianos. So it is nice to see some original Vegas entertainment. I've seen this town change in the last 20 years, so I appreciate this lounge.\n\nBring the whole group and grab a table. Get a few drinks and put on those dancing shoes. This is Vegas at it's best!!!"
4,"I started going to Spice Island when it first opened. I was in my early 20s then, which means the place is officially a Pittsburgh institution. The menu has stayed pretty much the same over the years, with the exception of adding alcohol, but why change a good thing? My favorite items on the menu are vegetarian -- the fried tofu (either sauce is delicious) and the vegetable curry trio. Pay a little extra for the coconut rice and you'll be back for the same thing again and again."
4,"The Mecklenburg ABC store here is decent.\n\nSelections - They have all your spirits and liquids that you need.  They don't have my favorite cognac here, but that is okay. \n\nService - nice. I know you were eyeing at me, because of my age!! But rest assured, I am beyond old enough to drink. I will take that as a compliment.\n\nPrice - as any other ABC stores, just a tad bit pricier than I am used to. Just a 'tad' bit."
4,"Their scones are divine and it is a nice little place with fine coffee.  I only wish they would not let dogs in.  I am allergic to them and it rather spoils my meal.  If they had a sign on the door -- no dogs, except service dogs it would be fine.  The ones brought in are not service ones.  Their scones are delicious and made daily.  Go there!"
4,"On entering this revamped place and proceeding into the great hall...OMG the detail in the pictures and paintings are visually stunning and esoterically beautiful.\n\nA very contemporary place, quieter than museum's usually are, yes it's smaller than I'd expected from the outside but makes up for it in wow factor, well worth the \u00a380K spent on renovation fees.\n\nGo if you like places with a medieval feel to them, history of scotland, medicine the war and the people who recorded some of the most significant historic events.\n\nWith a very busy gift shop and full to the brim bums on seats in their eatery, this was just the place to spend a few bob and actually learn something as well. \n\nGo if you like Glasgow Gorbals, art of science and medicine Royal Navy, death masks of William Burke and associated criminals, migrated families to Scotland and art history. I last visited a few months ago now, but feel like going again?\n\nBut above all...just go for the cultural effect, or the cafe buzz either way you will be rewarded."
4,"I have been visiting this Cheesecake Factory long before I moved to Las Vegas. The multiple levels is a architectural design element not seen in other restaurants, but is necessary because they get so much traffic. It is located at the very end of The Forum Shops commected to Caesars Palace.\n\nHaving to wait to get in and the long journey it takes to get to this location from the casino, are the only two drawbacks. Everything else, including the staff and food have always been good.\n\nIt is near a large aquarium and an animatronic show with fire and water, so those help to pass the time. If you are walking around Las Vegas and want to enjoy a nice dinner from a restaurant you know, try this one out."
4,"Well hello Cafe Zupas, I'm glad to meet you! Welcome to the neighborhood, I hope you will stick around.  The bbq chicken salad you created was delicious, and I especially loved the fun drink bar, which let me make my own Italian soda.  My husband liked his summer chicken salad and turkey bacon panini. And that free chocolate covered strawberry at the end? Awesome! I was very satisfied after eating at Cafe Zupas. Not too full but just right. I appreciate new restaurants that are quick, healthy and not too expensive!"
4,"Siam Terrace is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Urbana. It's also memorably one of the few restaurants I have a favorite dish at just because they make a red curry so well. Don't let that detract you from choosing something else on the menu though. The rad nar, pad thai, and other options are all excellent choices. I'm just particular I guess.\n\nIt's not quite five stars just because sometimes it does feel a little cramped if you have four or more people (and the proximity of the tables feels a tad off), but I'd have to say it's more than four. Appetizers are alright, it's hard to go wrong with basic fare although the shrimp appetizer is quite good and I heartily recommend it.\n\nWhile I put it at $$ it's more like $ and a half. Prices are very reasonable, with my favorite red curry starting at $8.99 or so for the vegetarian, chicken, or tofu options, and a bit higher for meat entrees (usually no more than $12 in the case of seafood)."
4,I first was introduced to this restaurant when living in Fort Worth Texas for a year. I loved this place! It's a Brazilian churrascaria  which really means it's a Brazilian cowboy barbecue. Sounds simple enough but it's better!!! \nThis is an all you can eat monster meat bonanza like nothing you have experienced before unless you've eaten here.\nIt's an all you can eat buffet but here's the twist... servers walk around with sword like skewers full of the best cuts of meat cooked to perfection. You have a little disk you flip over from red for no I'm good to green which is load me up with meat. This is the highlight of this wonderful place to eat. That isn't to take away from the salad bar which has many great items itself such as the prosciutto or the awesome cheeses. Did I also mention that yes they also have a full service bar that is spot on!
4,This place is a trip to morocco! Try the tea and the date shake. The bread is awesome. The owner is a gracious host and gave us a bunch of stuff to try. I love the decorations in the place too! A fun trip out
4,"We tried a variety of tacos here (3 for $10). Tacos were all unique and tasty, but the \nSuadero Azteca (queen's special) was the standout. It was incredibly flavorful and tender and was topped with really yummy veggies. Definitely get your own of this if you are sharing. The fried fish and fried shrimp ones were tasty too. This is a great place to try inventive tacos, but can get a little pricey. I think you need to ask for chips and salsa here, as they didn't bring us any without us asking, but once brought, it was tasty :)"
4,"The name is as good as the food. You can go in and take out, you can sit down and get served, and if your close enough they will deliver. It a mom and pop Asian food place with all or your favorite taste liker teriyaki and orange chicken! worth a stop and food is always great!"
4,"Fine place for any-time beakfast (certainly a step up from Dennys or IHOP). Good omlettes and if you can take the heart-clogging properties, biscuits & gravy. Also serves sandwiches, salads and smoothies."
4,"After hearing wonderful things about Il Pizzaiolo for years - literally years - I finally had the opportunity to try this restaurant last week with a group of co-workers. I had a wonderful time! \n\nFirst, we ordered wine. The wine list was insanely long and confusing, so we asked the waitress for her recommendation. She told us that there were three house wines, conveniently called the #1, #2, and #3. I believe they were Pinot Grigio, Pinot Noir, and Merlot. I shared two carafes of the Pinot Noir with a co-worker and thought it was very tasty.\n\nThe team shared two appetizers, Panzarotti and Fiori de Zucca. The Fiori de Zucca was fried zucchini slices that were good but not my favorite thing ever. I loved the Panzarotti. It kind of tasted like a fried risotto and mozzarella ball. So yummy. Even at the risk of potentially embarrassing myself for taking too much food, I snagged the last one. For my entree, I ordered the Ravioli alla Caprese. The entree was very simple but superbly executed.\n\nI hope to come back to Il Pizzaiolo very soon!"
4,"DH was getting pizza at #1 Brothers so I originally tried to order from the Japanese restaurant in the same plaza, but they failed to answer the phone after we called FOUR times!  Thank goodness.  Went to Ari and got the usual excellent service and good sushi.  What made me feel good---I was explaining to the girl who answered the phone that I had ordered the spicy tuna handroll before and had been disappointed in its consistency and our server had suggested a order it more coarsely chopped.  The young lady on the phone said: \""Oh, yes, that was me---I was your server and I remember.  I know exactly what you want!\""  And she did.  My spicy tuna handroll was exactly what I wanted and I felt good that she had remembered such a trivial incident when she deals with hundreds of customers.  Also, when I explained to her what my favorite specialty roll had been back at my old sushi joint, she was able to suggest a roll that very nearly the same and very good.  Actually, wait.  This was a Four star rather than a three star experience---let me go change my rating.  I feel like I have found my forever sushi place!  Thank you, Ari, for making me feel like a valued customer and not a faceless diner."
4,"I hesitate to write a review on here since I don't want this place getting too busy.  I really like it here.  I go on a regular basis for pedicures and I have had Julie and Tammy work on me.  They always give great service.  I only remember one instance where the pedicure got a bit rough for my taste but I just let Julie know and she backed off a bit.  They are attentive, friendly and the salon is always clean.  I usually pay $20 for a pedicure with a $5 tip but now that Summer is here I think the price for a pedicure is $22.  Still very reasonable."
4,I had great service when I went in to buy paint for my house. The employee working the paint section helped me out a lot. I have never really bought paint for a house before so I needed a little guidance. She helped me get the right type and mixed it for me. I had all my questions answered and was out of there pretty quickly. I had great service and was happy with the price I paid.
4,"I love having this place so close to home.  You can depend on them for all the basics when you're feeling a little Asian inspiration in the kitchen.\n\nI especially like the people who work there.  They're always friendly and will help you out if you can't find what you need.\n\nThe fresh produce/meat/fish components of this shop are a little . . . well, kinda dicey, but otherwise, thumbs up all the way."
4,"Friendly, casual atmosphere with very tasty pizza.  Huge variety of toppings and an excellent olive oil base.  I find the pizzas with tomato sauce to be a little bland, but all of the rest have been fantastic.  Salads are huge and fresh."
4,"My family and I have eaten here for years, as it is close to our house.  Restaurant has a nice local following, and many of their diners are Take Out diners.  Their menu is limited but the items served is hot, fresh and flavorful.  My husband loves their sushi.\n\nWhen you arrive, you are immediately greeted and seated.  Be sure to check the specials listed on the chalk board near the entrance.  I like the decor, and facility, dining plates, utensils and glasses are clean.\n\nStaff is efficient and accommodating.  The menu is concise but has enough available for almost anyone.  Prices are reasonable and portions are above average.  Definitely will return."
4,"Cool place...burgers are fresh and good...don't taste like a grease bomb like 5 guys!!!  Only thing is, it is a little spendy for a burger...can't beat in-n-out for overall quality and price!!!"
4,"Dairy Queen really does not need a review.  Only place better for icecream is your mom and pop stores.  Place was clean, service was quick (oh yeah, we were the only ones in there).  $7.80 seems a little high for 1 wafflecone and 1 icecream in a cup."
4,"I liked this place a lot. Cool atmosphere and the food was excellent.  Not your typical diner.  I suggest you make reservation because it was very busy when we went.  Good place for kids ( we had six kids/teens with us), something which is not always obvious downtown.  I think the food was a hit with everyone, great beer, and the desert menu did most of in big time.  Excellent service!  It was a great pick to introduce our friends from Cleveland to the Montreal vibes (kid friendly vibes of course...)"
4,"Just as good the one in Scottsdale, AZ. Great bartenders, lots of TV and lots of great beer on tap."
4,"This is my local Salisbury's and where every Monday I do my weekly shop. \n\nIt is a large store, but what bothers me as half the store is not food. This in my eyes defeats the purpose of a supermarket as surely they are food first and TVs second? Clearly it works for them but it does get annoying as choices are limited. The freezer section is very small which for a poor student means I have limited choices in frozen chips. I also find there is a lack of alternatives to brand names i.e. supermarket own brand. On some occasions I would much prefer to just buy the supermarket brand but because this shop has a limited selection of food I can't do this all the time. \n\nI do enjoy the \""Oops!'' section though. As a first year and an Asda shopper, the Oops section was like finding gold. For those who aren't in the know, this is the reduced section. They always have reduced meat which is handy for throwing in the freezer. \n\nThe staff here are very friendly and chatty which is a novelty for supermarket staff."
4,"The selection is pretty vast -- European, upscale specialty brands (up to $24 for a 3 oz bar!), bulk malt balls in 3 flavors that are wonderful, house-brand hot chocolate mix, and lots more. It's fun just to browse around and know all these choices exist."
4,"I've had pets my whole life and my observation has been that when the 's front desk staff is nice and proffesional , the doctors are not and when the doctors are great, the front desk leaves much to be desired.  This was not the case at Alta Vista.  First off, there hours are great.  Secondly. the front desk people (Sam), the techs and the doctor (Dr. Sean Penn), very friendly and courteous.  And finally, the price was reasonable. That, along with the place being clean and not smelling like wet dog when you walk in made having to take my dog in on a Sunday afternoon as pleasant as could be.  So far so good."
4,"The view here is amazing. Can't comment on the food but I'm sure it's good. Just sat down at the bar and conversed with our man, Harold?, who served up a few dirty martinis with a twist. Amazing service even after one in our party lost a bit of balance and drink in the process.\n\nJust be nice to the doorman at the elevator and you'll get upstairs to enjoy the view and drinks."
4,My husband and I loved this place. The staff was very helpful with ordering and allowed us to sample six of their most popular items. We had enough food for leftovers the next day for under $25. It was great to see everything from ties to tatoos having a good time. My only complaint is that the restaurant could be a little cleaner.
4,Great atmosphere! I love to sit at the bar and order nachos or enchiladas and hang out with my husband. The service and food are good.
4,"3 stars for their Bun Bo Hue.\n\nSo I decided to change things up a bit this time in Vegas.  Instead of the usual Pho after a long night of alcohol abuse, I opted for the Bun Bo Hue (NOTE: NO Pho Here).  Sad to say..it was a disappointment IMO.  The soup base was kind of bland, it didn't have the spicy kick.  There was a total of 1.5 pieces of pork blood?!? I guess that's ok in this case because it was quite dry and tasted like chalk.  \n\nHowever, the BF got a rice dish and it was pretty decent.  But, the reason they get 4 stars is for their Coffee!! It has a hint of coconut flavor, it's freakin YUMM!! \n\nCheck-in through Yelp and get their coffee for $2!!"
4,"Great restaurant located inside the Golden Nugget hotel. Service was excellent- and we had a party of 14 people. The food was pretty good all around. I ordered a \""caprese\"" salad to start and it was delicious. My main course was the Scallops, Brussel sprouts with grits. Fantastic. Hubby ordered the Maine lobster which he thoroughly enjoyed and finished. The king crab legs were amazing.. My nephew had six legs to himself. That 3 year old is one expensive date! \n\nAs for desserts, not amazing but good. We tried the pecan ball, which was a huge ball of vanilla ice cream with pecan nuts on the outside. Nothing special. The bread pudding was better, it came with caramel ice cream on top. I think there's slight rum in the pudding, it was good but nothing blow your mind.\n\nMinus one star because my pineapple juice cup had lipstick stains all over the cup... That's extremely unappetizing and unsanitary. overall, for such a large party- I think the waiters did a fantastic job serving and our food was great overall. Recommend!"
4,Pretty decent location for a nice target store.\nWhen I lived in the area I would frequent this target location and was happy with the service and product selection.\nLocated in the surprise town center shopping district alongside many great shops.
4,Love the location on 7th st. I passed by it after 5pm and saw that it was closed so I went to this one instead. Ordered an XL bean and cheese burrito America's way! So good. Don't know why this spot only has a 2 star review.
4,"Mama-Mia-American-Pizzeria is alrighty for Jungleboy.\n\nThe place is a jolly, colourful, multilevel building with alcoves and indoor window gaps. They have personally painted the walls with a  surrealistic piece depicting flying mushrooms, chili-pepper butterflies and a Pepperoni-Man saving the day. Funny!\n\nWe sat down on a table for two and we ordered our pizza - 9\"" with 3 toppings - I got pepperoni, mushrooms and chili-peppers (was I subliminally influenced by the painting? Yes I was..) It was a very well filled pizza and very tasty.\n\nI enjoyed the pizza crust, which I normally don't(!) and appreciated the laid back, but precise way of serving. They enquired if we were OK, we got our drinks served in time and we got to take the left over slices with us. \n\nI did find it a bit cold near the doors and I had a good view of all the people on the outside who peered in to see what this place is like. I made an effort to smile and wave to many of them to show how  good it was - but somehow the peepers backed away from the windows very quick when I did that. \n\nRecommend for a quick visit or even a nice afternoon late snack / meal with a bunch of friends or family, they had a cartwheel of a pizza available to serve to a big table of 8 - it was huge!"
4,Nice little place with a wide variety of food on the menu. Sitting on the patio was awesome. The sliders were amazing and I would defiantly come back again.
4,"Stopped in here to meet up with an old friend and of course down some beers.  Their selection of beers isn't too vast, but what they have is perfect.  It takes away from me reading the menu for an hour and randomly selecting a beer.  Now for the venue.  The inside is dark and pubby, but the outside is what shines.  It feels like you are at a backyard cookout.  Giant jenga blocks ( seriously 2x4's), giant chess, cornhole all over the place, and three ping pong tables. At first I was like they just took someone's back yard and put a bar with a window next to it.  After playing a few games, I realized this wasn't such a bad thing.  Its a great place to go especially during the afternoon."
4,"Had a great afternoon lunch on a Saturday. The food was great, the beer was bar none the best and the staff knows their beer. We did a tasting and had a lot of fun talking \""beer\"". The place overall is a little down on its heels. The waitress said they do a beer dinner and I can betcha it would be great!"
4,"So happy about this addition to my 'hood!   Beautiful renovation of a long-neglected architecturally unique (odd?) building on Central.   Things are a 'happenin' Uptown! \n\nHad such a nice experience with our table of 7 - which turned into 8 - wait - now we have 9 - on First Friday no less!    Staff was completely accommodating to us, friendly, upbeat, fun.  The owner Dana stopped by and chatted, making sure we were having a good time. Food was great, we shared everything.   Weather was perfect for the patio.\n\nAhh... these are the times, this is why we live here."
4,"bit of a wait (~40 min) even though it was 9 pm on a Tues; a bit pricy, but it's vegas\n\nwe did a late lighter dinner for 5 with about 2 tapas plates per person\n\nreally loved the gin and tonic - if you like G&Ts, order one: super smooth, delightful presentation and super nerdy-cool ice (yes, ice). \n\nmarinated mussels (they come in a little tin!) and steamed mussels (yum! order with bread to sop up the juice for both of these dishes next time), meat platter (really liked the house cured meat the best), Brussels sprout salad (delish!!), sauteed shrimp (good), skirt steak with grilled bell pepper (tasty!!), asparagus (good but 10 very young - read tiny - asparagus for $12+...? really good sauce to also pair with bread) quail (tiny yummy bird), tomato bread (oh yummy!)\n\ngreat service, nice relaxing atmosphere. \n\nlovely evening!"
4,"I came to this Lenscrafters after not being able to find what I wanted at the Chandler Mall location. As soon as I came in, i was greeted by Donna, who was very helpful. I tried on many pairs, taking a break in between to give my baby a bottle. Donna called to verify my insurance and noticed there was a proble. Due to the optometrust where  got my eye exam, my insurance indicated I wasn't eligible fir frames. donna called to rectify the situation, but wasn't able to because the optometrist was closed. Donna let me know that I would have to wait until the next day so my insurance could void the issue at the optometrist. We went back the next day, and Donna had already taken care of the situation. I got my glasses, and am happy with the service I received. Donna and Heather were the wo shinih stars at this location!"
4,"This is my go to spot for lunch appointments and even dinner with my wife. It has a great local feel. Friendly staff, clean, and great tasting food. I can't get enough of the green tomatillo salsa. I recommend the salmon and shrimp tacos. The service isn't the best because all of the servers are young local kids with probably their first server job so they are learning. But that's part of what makes it a cool local place."
4,"Great food! Friendly environment! Modern decor! Gay! All of these things describe Switch to a tee! I had been telling my wife for months that I had heard great things about this restaurant, especially their brunch menu. Unfortunately for me, she is not a big fan of Sunday Brunch, so when we did finally make it there last Sunday, I had already missed out on the brunch menu and the $3 carafes of Bloody Marys. \n\nWe ordered a carafe anyways... only $6 for approximately 4 good sized Bloodys! They were made well, but for the most part tasted pretty generic, yet still exactly what I expected for only $6!! I ordered one of the tastiest burgers I've ever eaten, topped with guacamole, salsa and jalapenos! Each plate was also served with a small house made ceasar salad, which I thought was a nice touch! Our service was very prompt and friendly!\n\nI will definitely be coming back to Switch for my favorite meal of the week: BRUNCH :)"
4,"I like MadHouse, but this actually isn't a review at all--I just wanted to say that when I try to access MadHouse's website, I ALWAYS get a trojan warning from my browser. I think the site is infected. I hope the owners see this!"
4,"Star Nursery is the cream of the crop when it comes to plant nurseries in Vegas.  They have everything you'd want for your home or business landscaping needs.\n\nIt usually surprises people that I'm a fan of plant nurseries.  My first real job was at a plant nursery when I was 15.  It made such an impact that I majored in landscape architecture and ran my own landscape company back home.  Walking around Star Nursery really makes me miss my old line of work!\n\nThe stock of plants and materials here is really top notch.  Everything from bedding plants to shrubs to trees is here, and all of it is well taken care of.  And all the soils, mulches, fertilizers, and pesticides you could need are here too.  And the staff is both very knowledgeable and friendly.\n\nIf you're doing any landscape work at your house, do yourself a favor and skip the sub-par Walmart and Lowes stock and come to Star!"
4,"When in Vegas,\n\n1) buy a delicious \""adult slurpee\"" in a delicious flavor right outside the Imperial Palace\n2) bring said special, yard-long beverage into the Imperial Palace Karaoke Club\n3) sing or mock karaoke\n4) enjoy!\n5) your pre-game is complete... time to go out!"
4,"Love this place but giving it a 4 star as it can be somewhat slow and few healthier options to select from. Yeah I know, penalizing them for not \""healthy\"" is probably silly as you know when going to let's say a fast food joint you are not eating so good. That being said the food at Defalco's is very high quality - almost as if you are in Italy and am not comparing it to fast food.\n\nI suggest you wait to try out Defalco's when not in a rush as its worth the wait. There order system is very similar to local places back east (basically avoiding technology) and that probably ties into part of the slower process of ordering and getting your food. I am from back east (NY area) and finding a good Italian deli / grocery store in the Phoenix area is not an easy task. A friend introduced me to Defalco's and anytime I am headed south on Scottsdale road (which is often) and after passing Thomas my stomach seems to pick up we are near Defalco's as it starts giving me the rumble noise.\n\nI have tried many things on the menu such as Eggplant Parmigiana, Chicken Parmigiana, and Cheese steak and three of those are worth a shot. I recommend to bring a friend and each get a different large sandwich and share."
4,We had the Travel Zoo coupon which gives you the app/entree/dessert. Ordered the combo app of course. Alligator was tough and so were the frog's legs. Crabcake was great. Gumbo is good. jambayala was great...Not quite New Orleans but pretty tasty. Atmosphere was nice and New Orleans looking. Large portions for the money.
4,"Classy, quiet restaurant. You'll see some white haired Montreal politicians every time. The place you'd go for a special birthday or anniversary. The waiters are polite, pleasant, and funny if you get them going. The food is downright perfect, french cuisine. Be sure to get the Escargot."
4,"Usually come here on Friday nights with my friends who are regulars.\n\nFood is pretty solid the lamb meatballs and Johnny's nachos are very popular with our group. Even their ranch dressing is really good and I am not a big ranch fan. I also like the Guinness stew.\n\nThe only thing keeping this place from being a full 5 stars is that it's probably a bit on the pricy side for what it is. Beers start at $6 (i think I haven't had one cheaper) and pretty much any food item is $10+ with sandwiches at $12. Shave a couple bucks off and they would be in solid 5 star contention.\n\nThe service here is also good as all the servers are friendly, keep up well with groups and splitting checks (always hard since our group can be anywhere from 4-12), and they are willing to joke around with us and not throw us out (always a possibility with our non-pc humor and discussions)."
4,"A bowl of rice and a very nice price and and alot of spice is what makes me come here.\n\nI can get a Salmon bowl with brown rice and and a ton of hot spice for less than $7. \n\nWalk in there is a line leading up to the some registers and meny board on the wall, the usual Jap fair chiken teriaki bowls etc, options for all while meat and the like.\n\nI got for the salmon bowl $5.99, a great way to have fish that is not fried at a decent lunch price. I find the teriaki sauce a bit much so I order light on the sauce. for $.25 more you can upgrade to the health factor of brown rice.\n\nGet your bowl and head to the condiment area, there is hot chilli powder, sauce and sliced green onion. I really appreciate the onions.\n\nI think some of the low scores come from the fact japanese food just does not have the flavor punch that Chinese and Thai do."
4,"Since this place is popular, the line for this buffet is long, but I guess there's nothing that can be done about that.\n\nThe servers were attentive and removed our plates. One minor nitpick I have is that even though I'm glad they leave the utensils behind, they tend to place the utensils on the table, which I personally like to avoid since I usually put them on napkins. It would be nice if they offered replacement utensils other than just the ones on the table, although I guess maybe it's like that so that too much water isn't wasted.\n\nThere were a large variety of food dishes to choose from. They make the price of $40/person a good deal by offering a lot of expensive dishes. There were crab legs, lobster ravioli, prime rib, and creme brulee. They also offered complimentary drinks like raspberry iced tea and sodas."
4,This place is a wonderfull place to go to... inexpensive and very friendly bartenders and some sexy ones at that... woo hoo!!! Love the screens in there and the food is excellent!!!
4,"This place is wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fat free - new, clean place, plenty of parking - nice staff - and did I say fat free?  Great spot!"
4,"Marquee is a hot mess, but a glamorous one =)\n\nThe lines to get into the club are ridiculous and look completely unorganized but the bouncers/ door guys know exactly what lines are for what. They make a chaotic scene look under controlled! \n\nThere isn't really a dress code. And that is sort of a disappointment. Some girls are in flats and leggings and guys are in tennis shoes and tee. \n\nNavigating through the club can be a challenge, I admit. The stairs are killers- yes. The dance floor gets too crowed and you feel like your in a can of sardines, yes. But those are things that can be overlooked. Haah. \n\nThe DJ and entertainers are great. The sound system is crazy. And the bartenders are good looking and nice."
4,I think this is one and only Indo-chinese restaurant in Phoenix area. Nice and clean place. Food was really good. We went on a Thu with reservation and was not crowded. \n\nTry the Manchurian Chicken ... Tasty
4,"I will tell you before you attend to take caution to what they tell you at the box office - this is pretty much like a roast of the audience and most of what he says is going to be based on racial, gender, sexual, age or physical attributes so if you offend easily, you'll want to pass on this one.  Most of the material is new, but there were some things I had heard before like his joke about thinking about your moms lips going down on your dad next time she kisses you. In his defense I watch A LOT of comedy shows so if it's been said in a standup show on Comic View, Comedy Central, HBO or Showtime, there's a really good chance I've heard it!  Otherwise, it's a hoot! Definitely NOT for kids (rated NC-17/R).\n\nThe venue is small so it's almost like being back in high school/college, there's not really anywhere to hide just as a pre-warning.  If you attend, you are NOT off limits, so be prepared to be part of the show."
4,"The crab cake is the best in town. If you order the Caesar salad with salmon, request it to be blackened. Game changer. If you are into beef, go for the marinated flank steak. Heaven on a fork. \n\nThe bar is very good sized and has full service for food and lots of TV's. \n\nBon apatite."
4,"Decent mocha. Hipster heaven. Loud and angry music. Brought me back to my youth.\nThe food looked pretty good, and the drinks were cheap. Want to go back for the \""remedy\"" which has ginger and whiskey."
4,"The best thing about the Excalibur is that it's more economical than other hotels on the strip. The cost of the hotel room was $27 (booked through Expedia). Of course, with all the vegas hotels these days, resort fee of $15 which gets you amenities, including wired internet in your room. The deal also included $20 food and beverage credit, which can be used at mostly bars, and the one restaurant I saw on there, which was the steakhouse (which is on the pricier side. Look up my review of the steak house at camelot for more info on the coupon there). Also included was a free play at the Dungeon, aka the midway arcade. The coupon book didn't include any match plays, unfortunately.\n\nThe room itself was nice. Spacious enough. The tv is large. There is an ethernet cable for you to plug into your computer for wired internet service. The internet was a bit slow. \n\nThe beds were fine. They give you 3 pillows, so you get some extra fluff. \n\nThe elevators were separated floors 1-18 and 18 and up. So if you want a fast elevator service and a high floor, book Floor 18 or so. \n\nAs for the casino, it was stingy. Many of the blackjack tables use continuous shuffler machines, which I am not a fan of. Most minimums were around $10 for most table games."
4,First time going to this restaurant.  The service was great. The staff is very friendly.  Will definitely come back. I would recommend this place to anyone.
4,"I had a reservation at another noted steakhouse near the strip and wasn't in the mood to follow through. So I started at the south end of the strip and thought I'd walk until I found something to suit my mood. Stepped into a few spots and kept walking. I swung through Cosmopolitan and an irresistible steakhouse aroma clutched me. I asked a hotel concierge to tell me the source and in a short walk I was sliding on to a stool at the STK bar- fine for a solo. I liked the atmosphere which was lively and busy with a great DJ mix as a backdrop. The volume issues that I've read from others was not an issue for me because I wasn't engaged in any challenging conversations. \n\nI had the foie gras french toast, bone-in rib and a moscow mule. I enjoyed everything about them. \n\nI will say that I can't appreciate the rest room format. Get in line outside? Wait your turn? Follow the attendant's commands? Sir, may I use the bathroom? NO! What? Fix that.\n\nI'll be visiting Vegas again soon to celebrate my son's birthday and I'm pretty sure he'd like it as much as I, so I'll be back."
4,"I have not been to Nello's in ages.  A friend suggested for lunch.  The three of us show up and the place was getting busy.  We were sat immediately.  Got to have pizza here, right?  We ordered a large pizza:  thick crust, bacon, basil, mushroom, and 1/2 with sausage.  OMG... It was good but they forgot the basil.  =(  The garlic bread was very good too....  \n\nThe waiter was eye candy and he provided great service!  =)"
4,"WOW!! What a hidden gem in Vegas! \nWe went to the Rio to go see a show, and decided to grab a bite before.\nWe foolishly did not make reservations (I suggest that you do!) but the hostess offered us a cozy spot at the bar. Which we took.\n\nHad a meatball appetizer, which was recommended by another patron. YES! SO delicious!! I would go back just for that! Then had the specials. One scallop dis and my partner had a sea bass dish. Both were full of flavor, tasted super fresh, and over all great dishes!\n\nI would go back in a second!\n\np.s.- Locals with a T.Rewards card and NV ID get 25% off! If you are seeing a show, you get 20% with ticket stubs! What a deal for an amazing dinner!"
4,"I was going to downtown Las Vegas last night for a show, so I decided to stop for dinner at the Bar + Bistro.  I made one error in that it was First Friday in the Arts District and the restaurant has an abbreviated menu for that evening.\n\nI went with two of their tapas plates and a dessert.  I started with their roasted tomate soup.  It was excellent.  The second dish was their 5 cheese mac and cheese a combination of smoked gouda, sharp cheddar, fontina, Manchego, roasted tomato, piquillo peppers, and parmesan crisp.  The pasta was gigli.  The mac and cheese was very tasty, too!\n\nI rounded out my dinner with a warm chocolate ganache cake.  It, too, was excellent.  It was served with a small scoop of sorbet and it was a perfect ending.\n\nAll things considered, I'd rather have come here on a night when I could have ordered from the full menu, but I had the chance to taste some of their good cuisine.  I think it's a bit pricey for what you get.  I enjoyed the decor a lot.  The tables shaped like artists' palettes with a metal well in many.  One thing that got me several times was the thought that I had dripped something onto the table.  When I looked, it was merely some spattered paint when they were decorating the tables.  Every time I looked down, it was a \""gotcha.\"""
4,"Its been said before, but they deliver until 3 AM.  We were not in the state of mind to drive and have been getting a little sick of hungry howies.  It took a solid hour for our food to arrive, but that seems pretty normal for late night Tempe. Everyone raved about the food.  It was very good for late night delivery.  The chicken bruchetta pita was excellent although a little small.  I recommend 2 pitas for anyone with any kind of appetite.  You might not get through both, but the one was just a little too small to satisfy.  My only complaint, and the reason for 4 starts instead of 5 was the traditional hummus.  I didnt not think it was very good at all.  Many places in Tempe have much better."
4,"Lovely looking place with gorgeous high ceilings. Really nice coffee to be had here and every member of the staff is friendly and warm. I come here for lunch now and then as it is close to my office. The little toasts are always super good and come with all sorts of toppings: Russian egg salad, tuna, smoked salmon, various types of meat, etc. The desserts are all quite gorgeous looking as well, but usually I am too full to go there! I will say that it is kinda pricey, but at least the food is good, so that helps to take the sting out of the lunch bill.\n\nThey lose a star for saying that the soup was vegetarian...it had chunks of bacon and the guy shrugged when he saw me picking them out."
4,"We went for a friends birthday party. I like the intimate setting. I'm usually not a comedy fan, but I laughed quite a bit at 3 out of the 4 comedians. There was a Fetish Ball going on next door, which confused me at first b/c I didn't understand why leather masks and nipple clamps were the dress code for a comedy club, but once I saw the little neon \""Comedy Spot\"" sign, I figured it out. Overall its a great place to go on a  weekend. Assless chaps optional."
4,"Absolutely delicious Thai food offered by a pleasant server.  Ordered green curry with extra veggies and tofu and it was so yummy I ate the rest for dinner. My friend had the broccoli chicken and spring roll and she was really impressed. Ambiance is very hole-in-the-wall and kitschy, but that's not why you go. You go for the delicious food and good service, and you won't be disappointed."
4,"I have been very happy with the care my dog has received at Squaw Peak, they take good care of my pug. The staff is very kind, I can always get a last minute appointment, and I never have to wait. They treat my dog as if he is their own, as others have said.\n\nA puppy was found at work, and when I brought him in to Squaw Peak, he was diagnosed with distemper, and the best course of action was to put him down. When I asked about the cost, the vet was kind enough to take care of it at no cost. \n\nThey have also been willing to bill me for needed vet care and allow me to make payments when I was having financial difficulties, however, I was not pleased about receiving a collections notice from the office after making a payment that covered the majority of the amount owed. The person in charge of billing told me I could make another payment for the remaining amount ($70) this month, and I just needed to call in and make arrangements. Given my positive experiences, I can only assume this was an oversight."
4,"Finally got here for dinner, heard about this restaurant from my friends many times! The food quality is good, environment is not bad, doesn't feel like those typical Japanese restaurants, I definitely will come back again!! Had a great dinner here!! Love it..!!!"
4,Excellent!\nI love the ambiance of this restaurant. We were seated next to window with a peek of the fountain show. Foie grois was great and hamachi was good. I ordered medium duck. Unfortunately it was not seasoned well & was too chewy. Server was in tuned & offered to exchange dish for a sea bass. It was delicious!
4,"Came in with a large group on June 22nd during the evening. We sat at a large table that offered the option of playing checkers and scrabble while we waited, which we enjoyed. My husband ordered the miso salmon and I had a burger and fries. Food was good and service was good until the bill came. The bill was sorted for all the parties which I appreciated. However when looking more closely I realized that gratuity was added. I don't have a problem with auto grat but I had a problem with not being told it had been added. Some people didn't notice and double tipped which was not their intention. I mentioned it to the people on my side who appreciated the heads-up. I realize this may not be the restaurant's intention but the server's but I do find it a shady practice when this happens."
4,"Probably one of the best steaks in Las Vegas. Comfortable seating and busy. Very busy. Lobster appetizer was a bit pricey for the little, but delicious amount you got. For a new restuarant the staff was very well trained. Looking forward to next visit, minus lobster app."
4,"3.75 stars\n\nOther than the outlet LV store in Japan, this is probably the first lv store i went into.  The security guards were a little bit intimidating, staring at you and looking bored out of their minds.  In other nice stores at caesars, they at least smile or say have a good nite.  Anyway, like Fern mentioned, the purse bar was kind of interesting and fun.  Once the associate found out my aunt might get something, she pulled out 7-10 bags for us to see and took off the protection tape on each.  I forgot her name, but she was very patient and very helpful.  She disappeared for a long while after we decided, but I would still recommend it if you are seriously looking, and even though they would probably ignore me if I was by myself!"
4,They have a good selection for their lunch buffet (have both veggie and meat options). Always love their dessert options and garlic naan. Staff is friendly.
4,"Great atmosphere, good food, a nice choice of lunch sandwiches, not too many so it won't take forever to choose. Raspberry Soda is delicious."
4,I've always been a happy camper leaving this place. \nThey have a very cool looking bar with their bottles lit up and colorful. I like sitting at the tables around it even though the lighting is bad. It's like the flashlight under your face effect. Not cute!\nI prefer the Sesame Crusted Ahi Tuna for the appetizer. The tuna comes out on a slaw that tastes amazing with a soy dressing and a side of wasabi you can mix in. This isn't a fish restaurant but I get on a fish-kick and LOVE their Blacked Fish Sandwich. It's always cooked perfectly and really like the sauce. The steamed broccoli are big pieces and always fresh. I wouldn't recommend the honey roasted carrots - they are soaked in whatever they are calling honey roasted and just tastes like carrots coated in sugar. Yuck. \nI like dessert and like chocolate but don't like anything from here. Maybe too much white chocolate for me.
4,"I would say that this is easily the best place to go in in Sun Prairie.  We have been here about 6 times and it has consistently been good.  I have ordered steak, fried fish, entrees... it's all pretty good.  The kids meals are well portioned and the kids eat it.  They rotate their menu and the beer on tap - that makes repeat business worth while.  It can be pretty busy on a Friday night.  They have filled a need in town."
4,"The Filet Mignon was absolutely delicious and I couldn't get enough of the sauce. I did not even need steak sauce to enhance the taste. The service was wonderful, my boyfriend and I had a nice conversation with the waiter. Our waters were constantly refilled, which is always a plus for me because I drink my water like a whale. The price wasn't to shabby either, especially for a good steak. The only complaint  that I have are the frites (i think that is what they are called). It is way too salty. All in all, its a great place to have lunch on a beautiful day."
4,"Great place to stay. Rooms are spacious and clean. The price is fair. It's at the end of the strip so there's less foot traffic which is a blessing. The air is cleaner vs other hotels. Lots of things to do in the hotel: beach, mall, bars, clubs, spa, many others."
4,"Although we had to wait 30 minutes for a table, it was well worth it. We sat outside, which is beautiful and great for people watching. I ordered a caesar salad and within what seemed like five minutes it was on the table. It was delicious, I loved the cheese and dressing. I also ordered the classic quiche lorraine. I'm a big sucker for quiche, my grandmother made it countless times for me when I was little and I have to say eating this quiche sent me back to my childhood. It was AMAZING..and incredibly filling. I couldn't even finish all of it!\n\nOur waiter was very friendly and attentive. Not only that but the food comes out so quickly that I barely had time to finish my caesar salad before my lunch was served. My boyfriend got the warm chicken and brie sandwich. It had thin slices of apple and caramelized onions on top. Absolutely delicious.  All in all a great experience, great food and an elegant yet not pretentious atmosphere. When we go back to Vegas we will definitely be dining here again."
4,"This is a pretty cool store to shop in! They have a ton of interesting, high end kitchen appliances available. It seems like everything is chrome, very high end, and awesome looking. Plus, they will give you a coffee while you're shopping when they are demonstrating their high end coffee maker. It's a fun experience for sure."
4,"Maybe I prefer my clothes a little more urban than the average white guy but, I liked this spot and love the idea of being able to look fly on a budget.\n\nIts HUGE!  Lots of variety.  Urban wear to suits and everything in between.  Accessories too.  My only complaint is that there wasn't much service outside of the fitting rooms.  But at these prices, that was expected."
4,"Union Pig & Chicken has some of the best BBQ that I've found in Pittsburgh. The brisket is soft and falls apart with a fork, although some of the pieces can be overly fatty. Every time I've been the service has been decent, but slow. Union is also a surprsingly good place to go for lunch, The sandwiches they serve are delicious. One last note, definitely get the mac & cheese. It's that good."
4,"Went here with the husband and our 2 teens and we all get something different so we could share. Everyone enjoyed their smoothie and the employees here were very friendly. \n\nI just wish these dang things were a little less pricey...and i would eat em more often, they are like having a meal."
4,"Walnut Grill is one of my favorite spots for an afterwork drink or a quick, fresh meal. Their menu is American fare with a twist, their wine list is excellent, and the atmosphere is always fun. They recently expanded the bar area to have more seating and comfy booths. The servers remember you if you're a frequent flyer and are always efficient. They have great live music some nights, too! I'll pretty much always be a regular here!"
4,"After the manager read my review he contact me and apologized. I have yet to return to the place, but the manager assured me my experience will be different. Since then the server that served me was terminated. Looking forward to going again."
4,"It's about time that Steak N Shake came to the valley. I LOVE the frisco melt, it's crazy greasy deliciousness. The place is clean and the service is friendly, which to be honest, feels weird when I'm used to a surly waitress giving me the stink eye when I order my food at this chain.  \n\nI wish they'd stay open 24 hours like standard Steak N Shakes, but ah well. I don't mind the smaller menu, but I do mind that they do not have the peppers. They are missing some key elements that dispite the smaller menu they could do better.  I agree with a fellow reviewer that the milkshakes are not Steak N Shake quality. However, I'm willing to overlook all of that for my Frisco melt with fries and a side of cheese sauce."
4,"I know it is a McDonald's. I get it. But as far as a fast food chain goes, this particualr McDonald's has my loyalty. \n\nTalk about your fast friendly service. Whether I am ordering just coffee or a couple hash browns for my boy and I on the way into school I know I will be through the drive-thru in 5 minutes tops!"
4,"This is a great late night spot located in the California Hotel. If you're a fan of ox tail soup, you'll love this place. The oxtail soup is only served late night and the entire menu has Hawaiian/Filipino influence. This place is so well known for their ox tail soup that if you check-in on Facebook, it will say it's the HOME OF THE OXTAIL SOUP. \n\nTips: 1. Be prepared to wait in line. 2. Get your oxtail soup without peanuts. 3. Don't forget to get your parking ticket validated."
4,"The location is nice and the food is delicious! I got the market fish, which was very good. The meat was so tender. Other yummy dishes were duck and pork."
4,"Great hotel. The rooms are super clean, there's water in the fridge, and the gym is decent. My only critique is that you have to refresh the Internet connection every 24 hours (and must pay $10 bucks per device - iPhone included), the breakfast is not very good (unless you get it made to order), and they left my previous nights room service tray outside my door until the next afternoon. Besides that, everything else was fantastic. The location is convenient, service attentive, and overall experience pleasant."
4,"A guy from a liquor store recommended this place to me a couple of years ago. Since then, I've been to this place every time I'm in Vegas. I've only tried the pizza & wings. Both are GREAT for those late night drunken munchies! Right down the street from the Stratosphere.\n\nYou can easily tell that this is where the locals go for pizza."
4,"I liked their crab legs. I was second in a huge forming line. They are cracked, so no work has to be done. Sushi was very fresh. They have really cute bite sized desserts, so you can sample a lot of things. The dessert section is hidden away from everything else, so I think there is a good chance a lot of people forget about it. They have gellato in many different flavors like sour cherry. Very cute desserts. I don't know what kind of dessert I was eating. White chocolate with edible silver balls and soft center. Good what ever it was. I am very picky, and I found a lot of stuff I could eat. However for the price, I think I like the Bellagio better. Their is also a buffet on the stip with circular aquariums at the buffet with tropical desserts that are out of this world. Just can't remember the name of it :( I just remember you take an esculator down to get to the buffet. If you love Sushi Todai is a great fish and sushi buffet for reasonable prices. They have chicken and beef too!"
4,"Quality 24/7 food in vegas. Pit stop, fill up, drink up, back at the strip!\n\nIf you want good portion sizes, a meal thatll keep you full, and want to pass up on mickey Ds and Dennys, hit this place up."
4,So we end up at XS after being unable to get in to Hakkansan and trust me we were not disappointed! This place is incredible the inside was gorgeous and the outside was a great spot to enjoy the music and get some fresh air.\n\nWe end up seeing Rusko  and dancing the night which was a blast.  I would defiantly recommend checking it out here!
4,"Yep, this is one of the best buffet place among a thousand other Vegas casino buffet.   It was cheap as well.  I would come back again :) good food, cheap price, I can't expect more from Vegas buffets :)"
4,"I thought that I could only get some good noodles here on the East Coast but boy was I wrong! I cant stop thinking about how good it was. Next time I am in town, Im heading straight there!"
4,I love the food here omg and 12.45 for 3 well vodka coke drinks!?!? Yummy!  We had a blonde servee...marcia...merc....something... but she was nice :)
4,"Not bad, service was on the slower side, but then again it was lunch time 12-1pm but very friendly and quick cashier"
4,"I have read some of the Yelp reviews and at my first visit at the Ingleside Grooming I was not too impressed with curt response to some of my questions as she seemed initially annoyed with my presence, however, I continued to request their services to groom my pet.  When I returned the next day with my pet, I was significantly late at dropping her off for her appointment.  I also told her that my pet is a nervous pet and has always pooped whenever I took her to Petsmart or to the vet.\nThe person who was there (the same person whom I spoke to the day before), I apologize and she was very understanding and did not seem upset at all for my tardiness.  I felt really comfortable at that point.  When I returned to pick up my pet the same person who I have been dealing with was so nice and told me how my dog behaved and how sweet she was and, best of all, didn't poop!  And my dog's new look (she's 3 years old and never had a hair cut, so she was pretty bushy) is fantastic!  and the cost is very reasonable with what comes included!  I highly recommend her!"
4,"Found this place b/c of Yelp and glad I did.\n\nGreat Sonoran hot dogs.  I got two and was uber full.  The first time I went I recall less than optimal communication.  I asked how many types of dogs they had, and the answer was \""how many?\"".  \n\nToday was the 2nd time and things went much better.  Very helpful and once again a great meal.  I also feel like it was a bit cleaner this time, maybe they straightened up or repainted.\n\nIt is in a below average neighborhood but worth the adventure.  Go for the food, not the ambiance."
4,We weren't planning on visiting here but saw a billboard (they work!) saying Jerry Seinfeld was on that night and we just couldn't miss out that opportunity!\n\nSo we ended up with seats towards the back but the view was still great along with the acoustics. Would make for a great venue to see some live acts in as well.
4,"I really liked this show.  There were a couple of cheesy parts but overall I thought it was excellent.  There is something for everyone and it's all quite tastefully and artistically done. \n\nThe twins are hilarious and it's awesome to see a couple of big girls out there strutting their stuff.  The rest of the bodies are lean dancer bodies, for the most part, featuring real breasts.  Hooray for real breasts!\n\nThe choreographies are beautiful and tasteful, overall... and some are quite poignant. It's not all about the shock value ...  it's about love,  lust,  joy,  pain,  pleasure,  desire,  distress,  giving,  taking,  the physical, the emotional, the silly and fun ...   The total human animal...    Watch closely. \n\nStandouts for me were the African dancer, the suspended bondage act, the water gymnasts, the transvestite torch singer ... and that amazing red cape that covers the entire stage is fucking *spectacular*.  \n\nA must see, IMO... and I would definitely go back.  I enjoyed every minute."
4,"Time: 10am. Place: Poppy's. Impulse purchase: Bagels, doz. Intent: I get to play Bagel Fairy all day with a dozen of the best bagels in Charlotte.\n\nI distributed my cache of carb thoughtfully, but thoroughly. And not before eating two in one sitting. Bagelbloat, yeesh.\n\nCoffee was just OK but I honestly don't think they care much about anything except the bagatorial arts up in Poppy's and in that distinguished category, they get an A+. Sad to me that Bore's Head is what they have for slices and cheeses since that stuff is just nasty, but hey.\n\nNo more Bruegger's for me. No more terrorizing Owen. I get Poppy bagels, I eat Poppy bagels, I love Poppy bagels.\n\nnote - these suckers are such globs of gluten that they don't age very well - freeze 'em, if you must, instead of sitting 'em in the breadbox."
4,"Super cool bar, friendly staff and very comfortable environment. Drinks and food are both very affordable and delish. Great happy hour specials too. It's s small establishment so it can get busy. But it's always fun no matter what."
4,"I did something here that I don't normally do, let alone when visiting Las Vegas. Because I have, like, friends and family:\n\nI ate dinner out by myself.\n\nSolo diner. Party of one. The Japanese call this \""ohitori-sama\"" - the honored single guest.\n\nAnd it was great!\n\n* Booking was easy - 7pm weekday reservation arranged a couple of days in advance.\n* Warmly welcomed by the hostess.\n* Incredibly friendly, low-key service. Somewhere in between an American bar and a French bistro.\n* Outstanding food, which needs no further discussion here. For this Californian, though, foie gras (illegal back home, gah) was a standout with crispy seared surface.\n* Surprisingly reasonably priced, considering Las Vegas. 4-course + amuse menu was $78; before 6:30pm there's also the quick pre-theatre menu for $48.\n* Got half-bottles of Champagne & Chateauneuf du Pape for $88, which turned out better than ordering by the (relatively pricey) glasses. The fellow next to me ordered a whole Sancerre bottle for $40, well done.\n\nWhich reminds me about this fellow seated next to me -- French-speaking Jason Statham assassin-looking guy also eating solo. I was about to happily drown in the French bistro atmospheric cool, until he turned out to be from Ottawa, hockey talk and all, and that rather killed the romanticism."
4,"Every time I go to Whataburger, I get chicken strips. It is the only place I can think of that gives you a piece of toast with your meal."
4,"Service is great, dining room is clean. Our order included the alloush and June's special (mushroom melt). Both are super delicious and were served promptly however a couple of flaws gave the overall rating 4 stars. First, the bread was soggy/ chewy instead of crunchy like the toasted marks implied. Secondly, I like fresh crispy greens on sandwiches (the spinach was limp and soggy. But that might be just my opinion. Anyway, I totally recommend this place but keep this in mind so you can adjust if necessary and have a happier experience!"
4,"We've been twice in the past couple years and enjoyed both performances (Simon Boccanegra and Madame Butterfly) immensely. Unfortunately, by the time we fly in and find a hotel (even at Jerry's) we only feel like we can afford the cheap seats. The chairs are a little narrow up there in opera glass country. Might have to open the wallet a little next time. Check if there is a pre-show lecture - worth the time and you might get closer parking in the garage. Parking is a good deal for AZ."
4,"This location is a very good example for what a Starbucks should be.  Usually, the service is good and timely, even if you go during a rush in the afternoon.  The wifi can be hit or miss depending on how many people are using it.\n\nThe reason for the four star rating is the problem that is common to most State St/Campus open areas - the transient/homeless population.  It's not unusual for one table to be taken up by someone's plastic bags or someone to be sitting out panhandling.  It's not Starbuck's fault - you see that at most coffee shops in the area.  There's really not much they can do to control the problem, short of kicking them out.  That's an issue for the city of Madison to deal with."
4,"fun joint, right on the strip you can people watch, get hammered, DJ booth coming soon right on the patio \""I heard\"" this is a deff go to place during the summer!"
4,"Love this place! First came here in 1996. It's vegan friendly and oh so good. Last night I had the amazing papaya salad and fresh spring rolls. The rolls were mintier than I've had before, but still delicious. I had dinner #3 which came with a tasty fried roll, coconut soup with mushrooms and a garlicky oil on top (forgot the Thai name) and pad thai. Delicious except that the pad thai was too spicy even though I requested mild. It's the first time I've ever had spicy pad thai. The service was fast and friendly. I will go back for one of their awesome lunch specials."
4,"Ikea for President.\n\nSeriously, could you imagine if our government was as efficient, affordable and useful as Ikea? Between the faux wood and the real wood, Ikea offers so many options for your home in all price ranges. The help is 7 out of 10 times helpful, and Ikea provides you with almost everything you need (string to tie something to the roof of your car, big bags/cart/dollys, measuring tape, pencils and notepads).\n\nI'm a big fan personally of the Hemnes line (real wood!) and have purchased it for my master bedroom and living room, so far with excellent results. In the past I've done Malm (haven't we all?) and was pleased with the small investment and the years I got out of that set. \n\nOnly downside to Ikea is the directions they give you to assemble stuff. No words! Just pictures, so make sure that you're well rested and have the patience of a saint when building the larger pieces (personally, I look to my gentleman friend to assemble everything - I throw things within 5 minutes)."
4,"I live nearby  and have driven past this place many times. Today my wife called me and asked that I bring her lunch. Needless to say, we were not disappointed by these gyros. Savory meat piled high with the right amount of sauce atop a a fresh pita was a great lunch."
4,We don't do things just once in my house. It's our anniversary weekend and  I suggest to my husband DW Bistro. I had come two weeks ago on my B-Day weekend with my girls friend and it was amazing. When we walked in the smell alone made my husband jump. He used to own a restaurant so it's hard for me to impress him. \nWe split a house salad....what a great salad...mixed greens a little fruit cheese and nuts....it is a must have.\nI had the short rib sandwich and he had the salmon....everything was perfectly cooked and the flavor was great.\nOur waiter was amazing and very personable....I can't wait to try their brunch!
4,"The acts were great...the type of stuff that you would find making it onto the further rounds of America's Got Talent altogether in one show...with a good variety...good character cast and some stuff I've never seen before. \n\nPaid $23 (tip included) for a mojito in a thin glass. It was a good mojito and if I wasn't a local but just here on vacation I wouldn't mind, but being a local, I think of all the food that could buy. =p\n\nOverall the entertainment exceeded my expectations, I wasn't sure what to expect."
4,"Capprioti's \""Bobby\"" took steroids, bulked up here at Eddie D's, and now calls himself sir \""Robert.\"" His exterior is tougher, but deep down inside, he's still the soft, cranberry sweet , lovable stuffing we all have known to love. Robert takes gravy baths now so the chicks will love that.  Most girls will dig the 6 in Robert, but for the heftier gals, Robert transforms into 12 in also.  So don't hesitate, when you're lonely for lunch, hit up Eddie D's and find Robert waiting for your company."
4,"I really like Paradise Bakery, I was at this location every morning for about 2 years. The staff was always friendly but sometimes the line can get long if a lot of people come in at once. It can be a long wait to get served. Being a big muffin fan I always loved the apple cinnamon and blueberry muffins and they are consistently good.\n\nThe Paradise rewards are a nice perk, compared to other coffee shops it is easy to earn free drinks and food if you are a regular and would spend the money anyway.\n\nThe only reason this location looses one star is the sometimes pushy home business folk that take over every available booth and camp with their laptops. This is during the week. On weekends you get whole families with screaming kids. This does not seem to happen at the other locations in the area, could be the proximity to the hotel next door."
4,"it's already been said in every other review, but the Mattress Factory is pretty amazing.  They have installations that are extremely unique and orginal.  You won't find art like this anywhere else in the city."
4,"I was a huge fan of the Avalon in Oakland a couple years so when I passed this in Mt Lebo I had to stop! \n\nDesign: Eye catching, funky clothes in the windows, neon sign\n\nOrganization: Typical layout of most buy trade sell shops. Pants. Shirts. Dresses...yada yada.  Nice area upfront with bags and jewelry. There is also a higher end selection( Prada, Gucci, Jimmy Cho) for the desperate housewives of Mt. Lebo. \n\nSelection: Pretty good. Buffalo Exchange has a more stylish/funky selection though. Wide Shoe Selection. \n\nPrice: Affordable \n\nService: Cashier was nice. We briefly chatted about our favorite stores. \n\n\nPros: Doesn't smell like cat pee which most resell shops tend to. Very Organized and great design. Very Affordable ( Tank $8.00 and Dress $8.00) \n\nCons: Could use to clear out some inventory ( old Hollister tanks, plaid short short from '98). Whiney mid-aged women shop here. \n\nOverall: Great place to stop when you have no money but still have the itch to spend and need a break from the Urban Outfitters circuit. Definitely plan on making this a constant in my shopping rounds.  \n\nCheck it out!"
4,Very upset this place has closed. Please come back! One of the few places in town where you can get healthy take-out.
4,"Very nice hotel - new, modern and non-smoking! It was nice to not have a casino here. We liked being up on the 29th floor - could see a lot. Loved the automatic shades in the room, the large shower, the quick and quietly flushing toilet, and especially the tub!!!\nPrices in the market cafe were a little steep, but that's LasVegas. I appreciated being able to get a latte there in the morning.\nWe took advantage of the free valet parking. The valets were very nice and efficient. We also got to check in early - wasn't expecting that we could but a nice surprise."
4,"Food was pretty good. My smash fries didn't have much on them, tasted almost like reg fries. And the girl who brought us our food was rude when my girlfriend asked for more mayo."
4,"This is probably my favorite hotel I've stayed at in Vegas. I've stayed at at more than 10 different hotels in Vegas and I always enjoy my stay here. I have the M Life card so I've gotten comps and discounted rooms from here and other MGM owned hotels. (If you stay At any of these hotels I highly recommend getting this card.) The rooms here are huge and the staff is very nice. The beach setting at the pool and wave pool are awesome, especially when it's 104 degrees outside. My favorite restaurant here is the Burger Bar! The Kobe burger is great! \n\nThere are 2 minor things I don't like about this hotel, which knocks it down to 4 stars. 1) This hotel has become more of a family oriented hotel over the past 2 years. That's not a bad thing but it's not what I'm looking for in Vegas. 2)The TVs are old and not HD, at least in the rooms I've stayed in."
4,"I've been to Vanguard quite a few times. It is definitely a great spot if your looking for a speciality cocktail or want to try something different. The bar area is nice and clean, and I've never had a problem getting a drink or sitting at the bar on a busy night. \n\nI tend to drink a lot of different drinks, and will spend time pondering what i am going to have indulge in at other places. Not here though. The Jack Rose. Every time I go, that is immediately what I order. Apple Brandy. Maple Syrup. Black Cherry. Damn I want one just thinking about it. Who doesn't love maple syrup. Believe me, all the drinks are good and after 2 or 3, you'll may need to take a break. \n\nAll in all, great place. A little loud at night on the weekends with the DJ, and the crackheads from Fremont who come in too look around or do the crackhead shuffle for a minute or two until they leave."
4,"We came here for dinner and the food was excellent!  All of our steaks and fish were cooked perfectly!  BUT the service was very slow...we waited a little over an hour for our food.  Since we were celebrating my grandpa's birthday, they gave him a box of truffles and a $25 gift card.  \n\nFood rating= 4.5 \nService rating=3"
4,"The Bamboo Club was a great evening out with wonderful food, great seating and crappy service.  Seriously our waiter was a total douche bag.  But looking back now, he couldn't have ruined the evening even though he tried.\n\nWe got there late (about 9:00 P.M.) and sat outside.  Love the d\u00e9cor, nice overall theme.  If I lived in Scottsdale, I would definitely be hitting up the bar from time to time- dark wood, good lighting, and a little lively!  The food was good, had the Pad Thai and some appetizers.  Good stuff, well, except one...  \n\nI don't know what kind of crack I was smoking that night but I wanted some tuna, since I hadn't had sushi in a couple of days.  What the hell made me order fish in the desert?  I have no effin' idea.  Of course the seared ahi tuna was frozen and it was horrible.  Not their fault, my bad.  Well maybe their fault, I hear (maybe a tall tale) that you can get some flown in, fresh, not frozen fish in Arizona...  \n\nSo in recap- great place, cool ambiance, good food, awesome orange chicken, stay away from the seafood and that waiter needs a swift kick in the nuts."
4,"The bad: the bar closes at 10pm.  It seems like the western, country, wagon-wheel themed bar that you'd like to close down one night while playing some good tunes on the juke box and eating peanuts.  And also the french fries, file those under bad.\n\nThe good: the hamburgers are pretty much delicious.  Definitely go for guacamole, and add whatever you want from the topping wagon.\n\nI didn't try one myself, but I hear the cookies are good."
4,"ShooGoo was sort of a template 4-star place: good food, American menu, big ole portions, and nice service. It lacked the special zsa zsa zsu needed for 5 starrs.\n\nMy filet with B\u00e9arnaise sauce was excellent. The highlight of our meal, however, was our mushroom with Gorgonzola appetizer. Mmm.\nAnd, of course, they have the nice view, though that was pretty pervasive throughout Sedona.\nsunny az... yow, bill"
4,"Well, not that anyone can properly place doughnuts in the food pyramid, let alone work them into any meal with justification, but Krispy Kreme is a gift from the sweet tooth heavens. If you're passing by and happen to catch that beauteous glowing Hot & Now sign illuminated in your peripheral, it might has well be your birthday. \n\nI've experienced many a doughnut endeavor and never once have I been let down by this little shop of warm, melty, glazed dreams. The staff is always fast and can pull a dozen melt-in-your-mouth glazed in no time. \n\nThe inside is great, too. Fun for little kids to watch the conveyor belt churning out doughnuts. This is a place of happiness. Not just breakfast or snacktime, but pure happiness. \n\nMy only gripe is the accessibility. Located on Independence, it is hard to pull in and then come in through the back, pull in to the drive thru or find a spot  in the adjacent parking lot. All of Charlotte knows how 74 is the bane of motor vehicle existence, so just be prepared. \n\nAbsolutely love Krispy Kreme and all they stand for. Except for maybe their odd choice of spelling, of course! Now, onward for Hot & Now doughnuts!"
4,"This place is another great dive bar on the strip in Pittsburgh.\nThe Penn Pumpkin Roll is Amazing, but Make sure you ask for the cinnamon and sugar around the rim.\nAlso they have a beer called Sprecher, Hard root beer, And it tastes  just like Root Beer, awesome.\nThere is also an Upstairs for extra room and a great View."
4,"What a great way to spend an evening.  This was our first time at this location.  The seats are 360 around the stage so the acting caters to all directions.  \n\nThe singing was better than I expected, the wigs in the actors were a little cheesy, but it was a fun night.  The only negative thing I have to say is that with it being Arizona, the majority of the crowd was geriatric so they would try and whisper but it was really loud.  It was a bit distracting but they were having fun so it was easier to overlook.\n\nOne tip, come early bc parking fills up quickly. There are several restaurants nearby so dinner and then the show is a good idea."
4,Okay Kelly's is a great place to meet friends hand have a drink and maybe a bit to eat.  I like it here.  There is lots of places to just hang out and get to know people or catch up with friends!   \nIs it load -  yes\nIs it a little expensive - yes\nIs the service a little slow- yes \nIs there a velvet rope - yes\nBut really this is old town what else would you expect!  \n\nOooo and if you do decide to have dinner here.... I give the short ribs a 5!
4,"I have always passed my this place and had never stopped in until and ex was wanted to try them and boy was i glad we did. As you walk in you are taken away from the hustle and bustle of being on South Blvd, and is kinda taken to a different place. The decor is very nice and upscale. I must admit they were a little pricey but in my opinion they were will worth it, The portions are huge and they are enough to feed two people. The staff is amazing and are willing to go the extra mile to make sure your happy and that everything is going great. The night we went the owner was there and offered free drinks and I'm down for a free drink anytime.. lol but over all i would rate this a 4 out of 5"
4,"I like this place a lot more now that I've been inside.  Ladies free admission w/ free drinks 10-12pm!!!  There's no line, you're in and you're able to get out.  No problems with any of the staff - they're all very nice (even the go-go dancers).  The drinks are also strong  :]  The place is small, but bigger than I had imagined & you're able to sit for free!  The lounge is inside, but there is also a bar people can chill at just behind the REVOLUTION letters.  I wasn't too keen on the DJ... he messed up a couple times or maybe the music just wasn't to my liking?  Definitely a good spot to come to for free drinks & lounging around w/ friends.  My friends and I were dressed up, but I saw some people who were dressed VERY CASUAL... I'm talking guys wearing just a t-shirt w/ a beanie, converse & girls in denim w/ a dressy-cas top.  I would say the crowd is a little on the older side."
4,"The food is great the portions are perfect and the sevice is outstanding...the only problem is they have a 20.00 min to use debt, this is a problem for me Because I usually go by myself and don't carry cash so I probably won't come back because I can get the same great food service and portions two minutes down the street and use debit anytime I want."
4,"Breaking it down:  the Samosas were a 2.5 stars (Potatoes and cilantro???) , good wrap though.  The Naan was naan.  Well baked but about average at 3 stars.  The Kashmiri Dum Aloo was a pleasant suprise and i would give it five stars.  It was well spiced (about perfect 6 out of 10), creamy, and the potatoes were well cooked (not mushy and not to hard).  Last was the Vegetable Jalfrezi, a well made dish that gets one star knocked off for being a bit too heavy on the cooking oil.  \n\nThe rice was perfect.  The service kept my water glass full.  I enjoyed the Bollywood videos on the tv's as well.  I will be back to sample more of thier menu."
4,I really like this restaurant... for the west island. In town it's nothing special. But thank god someone has opened a proper byow in this area. It's my official go to place when my dad wants to eat dinner now. \n\nThe pizzas are great and I've enjoyed the various pasta dishes I've tried. \n\nWord to the wise... This place is actually busy so RSVP.
4,"Guys must wear shirts with sleeves, even when the weather is ridiculously hot in Vegas.  Pricy, but the food and interior make up for it.  Lots and different choices of things to be put on the your plate. Their desserts are actually good compared to other buffets. Their corn on the cob is super delicious!!!"
4,"Spinach artichoke dip is the bomb, used to be bigger but hey whatever. Drinks are strong, always a good thing. The waiter, Matt, is the bomb. He helped us make decisions and have good time before going out for the night. \n\nMy friend likes the menu since it has weight watchers options, I like it for the two for $20."
4,"JD and I wanted a super casual place for lunch on Saturday after a workout and he suggested here and it was the perfect spot. The chips and salsa were exceptionally good, or I had just worked up a voracious appetite at the gym, probably some of both. \n\nJD ordered a cheese crisp and I made fun of him by asking if he was on a diet. Then I ate my words when the behemoth greasy cheesy large pizza sized crisp actually came to the table. It was HUGE! A thin crispy tortilla topped with tons of melty fantastic-ness! It was cut in squares like some pizza's too which made it easy to eat. I had the Mexican Flag enchiladas and they were fine, but lackluster in comparison to the giant wheel of melted cheese across the table. \n\nAll in all it was a great meal and definitely reversed any good I had just done at the gym, but that's life and I'm fine with it!"
4,"Rito's easily has the best red chile and beans in the world, maybe even universe- now that Pluto is not a planet. \n\nDon't be scared by the wussies that say the area is scary- I guess when you live in Sun City- the big city can be scary. On any given day the place will be packed with city workers, CPAs, medical staff from Good Sam, teachers and the occasional sketchy dude. \n\nThis family owned spot puts out amazingly good food. The menu is limited-but it's all about quality not quantity. I do not feel that the food is overpriced at all. You are buying fresh made food with soul-if you want heartless crap hit Taco Hell on McDowell. \n\nIf you live a charmed life and they're selling tacos when you are there- for the love of heysoos- buy three. The guacamole tacos are amazing. If they were to become illegal- I would rob old people so I could support my habit.\n\nIf only they would step up their game and offer fountain drinks- that would be great. Cans of soda do not help during hot summer months."
4,"This gym is MAJOR!!! When I entered Gold's Gym Elite I felt as if I was checking into a hip hotel like The W. Very modern, stylish and CLEAN!! I am beyond happy about joining! It is extremely clean, which a gym should be. The staff is friendly and helpful. The cardio machines are way cool. Each one has a personal tv to use and a cord to connect your i-POD. How cool is that? It doesn't have a pool which is a bit of a downer. The views from the gym are excellent. I did my cardio workout the other day and watched all of the planes flying into Sky Harbor. It was fantastic! Gold's Gym Elite in Phoenix is not overly crowded which makes working out there so much more enjoyable. I was a member for a long time to a very popular gym in this part of the valley. It was way too crowded, and the bathrooms were filthy. I gladly ended my membership and joined Gold's Gym Elite."
4,"As much as I want to love buffets, my stomach tends to disagree. Mass produced food sitting under heating lamps doesn't hold much appeal for me. Fortunately, Studio B is one of the few buffets where quality trumps quantity and is worth the trip.\n\nDinner runs about $25 Monday - Thursday, weekend seafood ups the price by about $10. Considering that an entree and a beer at restaurants like Cheesecake Factory runs about the same price, its really not a bad deal. What makes the price worth is the unlimited beer and wine available at buffet. I was surprised to see craft draft beer along with ciders, and a couple wines to pick from.\n\nIn terms of food there is something for everyone. Sushi, multiple carving stations along with plenty of vegetarian and healthier options. The desert station features enough to satisfy even the most discerning sweet tooth and gets extra points for having gelato and milkshakes. The buffet itself looks great. Modern design, comfortable seating, unobstructed views of the Vegas strip and a open kitchen ensures cleanliness. \n\nThe lines can get long on busier days so come prepared. Also check out the M Players Club as they offer free buffets for players."
4,I recently signed up at this gym an really love it. All the staff at front counter have been nice an you get friendly greetings each time. I've been at various times during the day an there are always machines to use. There are numerous different machines for working same muscles.  You can always find a machine to use. Juice bar is great an friendly staffed.  Brent signed me up an did great job explaining everything. Never have problems finding parking. Its really nice an well maintained. I would recommend it!
4,"Three of us ate here last night and I'll definitely go back.  The service was great (Emily was fantastic and SO helpful - even when I called to get directions) and the owner, Daryl stopped by our table after the meal to make sure everything was alright.  What a nice guy! \nI guess if I had a critique to make, it would be that the appetizers should be larger.  They're very inexpensive, so in retrospect we should have ordered two or three of the avacado spring rolls and empanadas - but, I would have preferred them to be priced as two or three instead of one.\nOther than that, the food was great.  I ordered the curried tofu (excellent choice) and cleaned the plate.  Martha ordered the Jerk Chicken (HOT HOT HOT) and Binnie ordered the Chicken and Dumplings, which was unique and really tasty.  \nAll three of us said that we'd definitely go back again."
4,"One of the classic hotels of Las Vegas...due to the BUFFETS :p\n\n  It's a great, simple hotel nothing too over the top but definitely worth the stay here. Despite the age of the Rio they did a great job updating the furniture, making it contemporary and very comfortable.\n\n  There was a long line at check in but what do you expect? It's the weekend, everyone goes to Vegas on the weekends. But once we got to the front of the line the staff was very helpful and cordial.\n\n  Personally if I had to deal with all those people, I would lose my mind haha, so kudos to the staff of the Rio for keeping their cool. Obviously it's a little far from the strip so bring extra money for cabs.\n\nStill a great place to stay after all these years, keep it going Rio :D"
4,"Incredible pizza, great ambiance and terrific service. \n\nWe really enjoyed this Old Town spot next to the Poisoned Pen Bookstore. We split an Emiliana salad at the recommendation of the owner followed by an Italian Sausage and mushroom pizza. Both were excellent as was the selection of wines. \n\nI thought I'd order a Sangiovese as it was lunch, and I wanted something light. They brought out 3 wines to try and we ended up going with a Tuscan Cabernet blend which was terrific. \n\nThis place makes the list of \""spots to go back to\"" in Scottsdale! Great service, great food and really nice ambiance!"
4,"I really only got 2 things, the green chili burro and beef taco. I had takeout too, so it wasn't as good as eating there I'm sure. The green chili is a must. Not too hot not too bland. Good tortillas. The taco was good but next time, Ill eat in. Pretty good neighborhood place."
4,This was a great venue for my first concert at the Joint. We saw Prince on Friday night and would see him from the floor and from the suite. What a show!
4,"We usually stay at the LaQuinta in Scottsdale when we're in town. Since we had to be at the courthouse early in the morn I booked a room for mom and I at the LaQuinta on Thomas. Bad Idea. When I pulled up, felt like I was bringing my mom along with me on an early evening drug score at the local dingey motel. But it was LaQuinta! We were outta there with the quickness!\n\nDrove up the 17 a couple exits and saw the Residence Inn and my mom practically turned the steering wheel herself and yelled, \""GET OFF HERE!!\"" Just kidding. We were anxious for a comfortable room, safe place.. and we were starving!\n\nOur AAA rate dropped us down 40 bucks. LaQuinta only knocked off 10.. which still would've costed about $99. For that dive?!?!\n\nThere were white picket fences around the AC boxed outside the room which added a comfy-cozy touch to the place. The room was a cute studio with a kitchen. They even go grocery shopping for you! Breakfast was the works. Sausage, waffles, scrambles, fruit... none of that continental carbo breakfast crap. \n\nComfortable atmosphere, cozy rooms, great night sleep before a stressful day. Thank you, Residence Inn! To top it all off, our court-case concluded victorious! Yippeeee!"
4,"This caf\u00e9, conveniently situated opposite McGill, is a very good addition to the downtown scene. The coffee is excellent, and the owner Jason and his colleagues provide friendly service. The pastries, which come from a small bakery in the east end, are delicious (think muffins like mother used to make). I drop in as often as I can."
4,I am a huge fan of Re Salon & Med Spa! \n\nEveryone that works at the salon is amazing - all the special attention you receive definitely makes for a great experience. I have been going to the salon for 6 months now and have had multiple visits - everything from cut & color to mani/pedi. \n\nIf you are looking for someone who is magic with color & cut you have to see Bethany - she is definitely one of the best!
4,"The experience was great, smooth ride, great views and info, and tasty sandwich plus champagne - just as promised in the tour brochure. However there were 6 passengers in our helicopter, and  I felt crushed with hardly an inch to move.  I must add that we were all of average size. Otherwise I would have given this  5 stars."
4,"***Dinner buffet review***\nReasonable price for nice variety including crabs and prime rib\n\nSo my husband and I are very much buffet fanatics when visiting Vegas.  We usually end up going to buffet at least once a day.  \n\nWe always loved Bellagio buffet and have been here several times.  It has a great mix of pretty much what you expect in a buffet.  Considering price, food choices (seafood included), ambiance, it is a solid 4 stars.\n\n* Food:  \n- Snow and King crabs = cut in half and COLD.  The best thing about the crabs here is that they have plenty of them out so you won't have to stand in line for so long.  (HINT:  Snow crabs are actually more tasty than the King crabs...I know, it's werid)\n\n- Prime Rib = very yummy, very fast line.\n\n* Price: $29.95/person (Thursday night)\n\n* Ambiance = typical casino buffet.  Very nice but not so nice that you feel awkward carrying a plate full of crab legs and melted butter.  \n\n* Service = Very attentive.  No need to ask for refills or taking away dirty dishes."
4,"I would have probably given this 3 stars if not for the awesome green chili stew and the variety of dessert frybreads that rock my world.\n\nThe various frybread tacos are solid, but nothing that exceptional. I like the chorizo one with lots of hot sauce. \n\nIt's a good neighborhood spot when you're in the mood for something a little different, or especially if you've got a sweet tooth! :)"
4,This bbq is actually pretty darn good. We ordered their massive samplers and and pleased to say we liked it all. The meat just falls right off the ribs and the pulled pork was super tasty. The atmosphere and food options kinda made it feel like we were at grandparents or something. We will go again
4,"After Planet Dailies and Trader Vic's, I was soooooo happy to land at P F Chang's.  Good food, pretty good service, resonable prices.  Only a few minor negatives, but I much preferred P F Chang's."
4,"Buzzberry may not be the best coffee joint out there but it does the trick and it never hurts to support local. The staff is generally friendly and pretty quick. If you like a large drink make sure you get the \""secret menu\"" large."
4,"Well I've stayed at a few hotels since I've been in Vegas for a couple of months and the Downtown Grand isn't bad at all. It has a very retro feel to it with the ocean scenic colors. It also has some very modern furniture that I would not expect for the cost of the room. Flat screen tv, full size closet/cabinet and dresser draws. Basically everything you need except for a refrigerator...\n\nThe biggest dislikes I have is all those hidden fees. They say free internet but I believe that's part of the hidden $12 daily hotel fee that they failed to mention. Also there's a $50 a day hold for damages if need be. Also if you opt to park across the street at the self parking, be prepared to look over your shoulder in that spooky garage.  \n\nAll in all not bad for it to be downtown Vegas. The restaurants in the lobby are what I consider on par with the rest of the Grand experience."
4,"I don't know where everyone was but this is a rad little place. Pretty good food, cheap beers and quite delicious. Very personable staff as well. I enjoyed my visit."
4,"The food is always solid here, it may as well be called the cheesecake factory because everything tastes the same.  I laugh because my friends always go lets go to Grand Lux because it's cheap there, then we never really get out paying less than $20 a person for just the meal no drinks, lol.  Yeah it's cheap for Vegas, but when you eat here for late dinner everynight (3am or so) it adds up for just drunkie food, lol.  If you've only got a half hour to dine, call ahead to order because the service isn't that quick."
4,"Our dinner was delicious and our waiter, Christopher, was the BEST! He made us feel special and took GREAT care of us! We definitely want to go back."
4,"Not gonna lie, I never eat the food here because I know it's just okay. I don't really crave hot dogs! (But sometimes the funnel cake when I have a sweet tooth!!) \n\nThe ONLY thing I buy from here is LEMONADE. Ohhhh..lemonade. It makes me thirsty just thinking about it! It comes in three flavors: regular, lime, and cherry. I don't get frozen because it doesn't give me a full blast of the flavor! Every. Single. Time. I get food from another restaurant in the mall, I will never order a drink. I always buy lemonade from Hot Dog on a Stick, because it's so tasty and sweet! It just makes you feel good and satisfied on the inside :) \n\nMy favorite flavors are lime and cherry! The taste can be a bit sweet if you're not really into sugary drinks. And it is a bit expensive, but I feel like its worth it when you're washing down whatever food you ordered in the mall!\n\nAlso, I suggest not to sit near Hot Dog on a Stick while you're eating because when the workers are smashing lemons from time to time, it's a really off-putting sound! It actually scared me at first haha!"
4,This in my opinion is the best gourmet food in all of Vegas!  The menu is ever changing and the drinks outta of this world.. Hidden gem. I had the short rib  gorgonzola polenta it was amazing.
4,"On our first visit, we tried the different tapas' on their happy hour menu and were not really impressed.\n\nWe came back last Sunday since I was craving for Paellla and it was a wonderful surprise that the food quality was totally different. We ordered Paella, Camarones Al Ajillo and Brochettas De Pollo and they were all good. The Camarones Al Ajillo I say is a must try. My bf almost licked the plate!\n\nWe will be back!"
4,"As a foodie I was super excited to go eat at Gordon Ramsey's restaurant. We were in Las Vegas for the weekend and decided to spoil ourselves. \n\nI ordered the Lamb it was just AMAZING, every bit of it melted in my mouth. I also ordered a side of the mash potatoes which were also amazing. \n\nMy husband and a friend we were with did not enjoy themselves like I did though. My husband ordered the shepherds pie, it was his dream to taste Ramsey's twist on it.  Unfortunately he was extremely disappointed, his meal came out (we ordered two at our table) more like a soup. It was extremely watery at the bottom, embarrassed to complain at Gordon Ramsays restaurant my husband just stared at his food. I finically built up the courage to tell the waiter we were unhappy with his meal... It was returned and made again (which was better then the first). We also received a dessert on the house which was nice. \n\nWish I could afford to go to his restaurants all the time! =)"
4,Great deal for breakfast/lunch. The food was amazing and there were lots of lighter delicious options so you weren't eating straight heavy fat. GO HERE!
4,"Ambience is lacking inside and out  ... I pulled up in a cab to a deserted looking mall and wondered whether I wanted to keep my lunch reservation ... I'm glad I did.\n\nI had the black pepper garlic chicken wings.  They were not greasy, yet crispy and flavorful.  I loved the salty, slightly sweet garlic spice rub they put on the wings prior to frying.\n\nThe pork fried rice was initially just okay -- but after doctoring it up, it was great.  They initiallly got my order wrong, but even on the second try it was lacking in flavor so I asked for some of the spice rub for the wings and I mixed it in along with some of the thai bird chili and fish sauce (from the chili cart you need to ask for).  Pork is cut into  larger, thinish squares ... I prefer thicker and longer slices (typically a bit moister).\n\nService was prompt and friendly."
4,"Mulligan's Border is one of a boat load of taverns around Las Vegas and while it has your standard bar and video poker it also has really good food and great service. They take their bar food to the next level by understanding how to prepare and serve it.\n\nIt is fair to say that I have had just about everything on the menu there and I have not found anything that disappointed me. My personal standard is just a simple burger cooked medium rare. The burger comes to me juicy and tasty and the bun is toasted correctly so it does not fall apart. There is something to be said for a good burger and that alone has kept me and my wife coming back for more. We call this place our \""Cheers\"" because everyone seems to know our names.\n\nThey do not have a huge menu, but the menu they have they do well and I like that. You can tweak your meal here and their and they do not put up a fuss and if the server does not know if it can be done he talks to the chef and they get it done. Like I said, service is top notch. They may not \""Crumb the Table\"" but they do make your experience there as good as possible and that too is commendable.\n\nYeah, me and my wife are fans and we go there several times a week. Give it a try."
4,This place is totally funky and really convenient for the ASU crowd.  I recommend it as a cheap place for beer and lots of vegetarian options.  They have great art on the walls and the best flier selection this side of the Mississippi.  I also went to a craft fair by local independent crafters this weekend - this will apparently be a reglar event - the second saturday of every month.
4,"The park is probably better known for its 6.5 miles of single track mountain biking trails.  It has a little something for all skill levels, but it's very rooty."
4,"We've been to Biaggio's twice this week already! Once on Monday and the second time on Thursday, but it's always been to go.  The fianc\u00e9 ordered pizza and wings on Monday. THE WINGS ARE TO DIE FOR! I'm pretty much addicted to their wings and could eat them all the time. The wings are crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside dipped in ranch and hot sauce, its just irresistible. The pizza I thought was good, but nothing like out of this world. We just got the plain pepperoni on one half and mushrooms and sausage on the other half. \nLast night we decided to try a stromboli. It was actually bigger than I had thought it was going to be. We went with the Chicken with artichokes and red pepper. I loved the artichokes in it, but other than that I think I would stick with the 6.99 stromboli's vs our specialty stromboli which was 12.99. Both meals ended up around 30 bucks, which seems a lil pricey for some pie and wings. I definitely will be back for the wings though."
4,"Since my last review, Devil's Diner has undergone a change in ownership and a change in cook.  Preparation of the food is much, much better.  Tasty and at a good price.  The atmosphere is far friendlier as well.  :)"
4,"I make it an objective to visit Serendipity when I'm in vegas.. for the Frrrrozen hot chocolate and the nachos. That's what I order, every single time I come to vegas and I'm probably going to continue to do that =)\n\nThe wait is always super long though, that's the only down side. But, if you're only looking to get the frozen hot chocolate or anything else, they have a to-go window on the side!"
4,Cozy atmosphere in the inside and lovely patio. Food and service was great both at lunch and dinner. I highly recommend saving room for dessert. I would have given it 5 stars but I just wasn't a fan of their cocktails.
4,"Re: Grooming Salon. Specifically, Katie, the cat handler.\n\nIt is near to impossible to find cat groomers in this town. Some vets offer the service but after today's visit to Petsmart I won't go anywhere else. So the deal is I have a demon cat. Well, she's lovely and adorable with me, but for some reason fears all pet workers. No clue why, nothing bad has ever happened to her. \n\nKatie works Tuesday through Friday and starts at 7am, which I can appreciate because no one else should have to witness the dramatics my cat puts on. I arrived after calling ahead to see if Katie could shave Josie's haunches, so as to avoid bits clinging to her backside (gross.)  Katie got an E-collar on Josie and told me she was going to have to scruff her while she worked, which was just fine with me because the cat was screaming like a murder victim and otherwise being embarrassing. In less than ten minutes the job was done (for only $6!) and Josie was back in her carrier like nothing happened. \n\nLook, I had a veterinarian tell me that if I brought Josie in for any grooming they would SEDATE her, and she also recommended I get her declawed, which I believe is inhumane. Maybe Katie considers what she does completely normal and reasonable, but she's the first professional who has worked with Josie...professionally. \n\nI know my cat is a total freak but I can't shave her ass myself, so thank god Katie is at Petsmart. Seriously."
4,"I've come here on and off a bunch of times over the years and never had a less than solid meal.  The food is \""b+\"" Asian cuisine and the service is always rock solid.  For a quick, tasty and convenient meal if you are nearby, this a very good choice."
4,I was pleasantly surprised by poutine. They have a nice variety of choices. The House Special poutine was my favorite. The service was good and plenty of room for our party of six.
4,This place has reasonable prices. They have a large selection of food here. The Satay Chicken is very dry. It was difficult to eat. I liked the Pineapple Fried rice . I had 3 helpings of it. Their Thai Tea is pretty sweet. The Phat Thai was good too. Their Green Curry Paste Fried Rice was really spicy.
4,"Okay, so maybe the styrofoam coming off the building sometimes was weird or the tapping from the construction, but this place is great.\n\nI've stayed at timeshares before, so it wasn't a surprise that we didn't have someone picking up our crap every morning.  The unit was big, comfortable, and a welcome home for our 6 day trip.  I agree with Lorraine that the washer/dryer was rude though, making us wait until it felt ready to open up.  The trick with the towels is the pool.  While they give you only enough for what seems like 2 people when you check-in, there is a never ending supply for pool guests.  A few here, a few there, and before you know it, we had about 100 towels left for housekeeping when we checked out.\n\nEveryone who worked there was helpful and accommodating, especially our new friend Gauge, the valet guy, who was always around at 4am to say hi; except for the head of security who wouldn't give my sick friend a key to our room even after talking to me on the phone.\n\nThe pool left a bit to be desired in terms of size, but with the hot tub and bar right there, we quickly got over it (damn you Vegas and you're law against deep pools).\n\nAll-in-all the location was awesome, the rooms were clean and new, and having a kitchen for your group when you get home late is a whole new experience.  I'd definitely stay again."
4,"Cross this one off the bucket list! I can die a happy camper after going to the Mustard Museum!\n\nThe basement is the \""museum\"" kind of small but really how big is a museum about mustard going to be.  Grant it I was hoping that they had mustard artifacts from say ancient Egypt, Rome, Greece but not so much... what they did have was a lot of mustard from around the world. Which is really fun!  \n\nThe upstairs is the sample area and where you can then buy the mustard.   Needless to say I didn't get out of the place without dropping $25.00.  Also the staff was just Great! \n\nOh a side note:  if you don't like Mustard then don't go to the Mustard Museum."
4,"Considering it's located at the Hard Rock Hotel, the atmosphere was not as loud as the floor and the lighting was perfect with a modern decor.\n\nNow to the food, since it was my first time there the server recommended I try their specialty dishes. Which I did and was floored by the flavors, started with the yellow tail sashimi with Jalape\u00f1o, to the black cod miso. Now I did stray from the servers recommendation and ordered the Chef's sashimi which was ehh. Next time I will certainly follow the servers recommendation and would recommend to stick to their signature dishes. What made up for the ok sashimi was dessert and there are many to choose from, I ended up going with the Vanilla Tapioca. Sake was a bit pricier than usual but well worth the money. Service was slow but perfect to enjoy a nice dinner and discuss the evening's events with your companion.\n\nAll in all, I would definitely return and try their Beef Wagyu Beef or other signature dishes. Note this is not a cheap dinner by any stretch and expect to spend at least 150 per person but well worth it for the atmosphere and the experience."
4,"I'm a regular here for their Thursday night trivia and we always have a great time. Their menu is more than the typical bar food you might expect. Lots of salad choices, some wraps, and the pizza is decent. It's a great place to see a game since there's a TV in every direction but it can get pretty packed given that its one of the few sports bar in SoMo. \n\nI did see a drunkard punch out one of the huge windows out front one Sunday night. That was exciting!"
4,"First to review? \n\nLocated next to Metro Pizza, this store has been around for years. Since there is no Fresh & Easy in my immediate area, I've had to find a replacement for my fresh produce. This location is super convenient to my workplace. It's hardly every busy (a few other customers, maybe a handful) so parking is easy, as well as checkout. Yesterday, I got packs of kiwi, peaches, a pkg. of celery, 3 pound bag of apples, a bunch of bananas for $12.05. I've been coming here more lately since F & E is closed and sometimes it's hit or miss with the 99 cents only store. \n\nClean, fully stocked, and doesn't disappoint. I noticed two people working last night, one cashier, and one stocking."
4,"This review is for their sushi bar only. I have been going to AJ's sushi bar since 2006. At that time, the sushi chefs were awesome and I'd totally rate it four stars. Since that time they've had a lot of turn over, the hours have been cut, and generally their value for the price and the quality of the fish has gone downhill. Sadly, I will have to find a new place for my sushi take-out, as it is no longer worth the drive or the $$.\n\n2013 update: They've re-hired some of the old sushi chefs and this has returned to one of my favorite take-out sushi bars. The quality is back up with the old chefs working, and I'm happy they're back on my good side!"
4,"Great locals casino.  I think this is where they filmed 21.  Anyway, craps tables here are really good.  The circle bar is ok, you get a lot of cougars that come through.  It's about 15 mins off the strip and you get your money's worth.  Rooms are great, very modernized which is always a plus.  Pool area is very nice, my ex-roommate used to be a bartender here.  The good thing about it is that at times, it's a great place to come and chill when you're not in the mood to run on the strip since it's very laid back.  Everyone comes here for their massive Bingo Room or if they want to go bowling.  The theatre here is also really good but stay away on weekends as it overpopulates with a mass amount of local teenie boppers and high school kids loitering, but security does a good job to kick them out past 10.\n\nIt's right across the street from a small shopping center (Best Buy, Marshalls, Gas stations, COSTCO, etc) which is convenient.  If you like Green Valley casino, you'll definitely love this place as it's under the same ownership/design."
4,"yum!!!  i actually ordered cran-slam club... it was good, but i did find the turkey a bit dry...  but my cousins ordered capastrami and the bobbie... so of course i had to take a bite of their sandwiches... the bobbie was soooo yummy!!!!  having tasted my sandwich, i have to say that it's the stuffing that makes the bobbie so yummy and not so dry!!!!  and capastrami was also very good!!!\n\njust found out there's a capriottis in beverly hills...i can't wait to go there and order the bobbie!!!"
4,"I liked the ramen here at Ramen Sora, but it didn't blow me away like the ramen at Monta did. The flavors were distinctive and the ingredients seemed fresh and properly prepared. The flavors didn't seem to have some of the delicacy that I got at Monta.\nI got the spicy miso ramen and it actually wasn't that spicy. But I could get it again and if I lived in Las Vegas I could see myself eating here regularly."
4,"This place is really quirky, but awesome if you get to know it. It's Beatles themed, and the menu is goofy, but the fried cheese curds are fantastic, as is the jalapeno popper burger. The turkey swiss and slaw sandwich is also a winner.\n\nIf you really want a great experience, go on a Tuesday night and play trivia. Kim, the trivia reader, is hilarious, and the waitstaff are super sweet and really friendly. They have a decent beer selection"
4,"As someone who frequents the B concourse at this airport I can vouch for the the quality of the pizza they put out. Is it the best I've ever had? Far from it, but compared to the sky high ( no pun intended) prices at all airport vendors, this place is a breath of fresh air! Totally reasonable and good.  I guarantee this is where most of the crews go ;) that says a lot."
4,"Had the  Dynamite Sandwich, which is described as so on the website:  \n\n\""An explosive blend of sliced brisket, peppers, chilis, onions and jalape\u00f1os, sauteed with Red Diamond sauce, and piled on a jalape\u00f1o roll with melted pepperjack.\""\n\nIt was very good, very spicy, and I'm definitely getting more of them.\n\nOur favorite item was the Fried Onion Strings, however.  You know the problems with ordering onion rings at a restaurant:  too much breading, or the onion is nasty, or you take a bite and all the onion pulls out of the breading and you have nothing left to eat except empty breading, or they are too greasy?\n\nThese don't have any of those problems.\n\nVery light crust, super-light, and the onions can be tasted and they are good onions, not too strong or too sweet.  No grease at all.  We loved them for $1.95 and next time I'm ordering more of them, since the plate is a little on the small side.\n\nThat's my only complaint - the portions were a little on the small side.\n\nBut you can remedy that by going back on the FIRST WEDNESDAY of every month, when they have a $12.95 AYCE lunch buffet.\n\nOne last problem - they are only open for lunch, and weekdays only.  Hours: 10:30am - 3:00pm Monday - Friday.\n\nIf they'd expand hours and make their portions a smidgeon larger, I could give them 5 stars."
4,"This (and Smith's) is my family's go-to grocery store. We come here every weekend whenever my mom feels like making Asian food at home. It has a nice variety of Asian products ranging from Chinese to Filipino and everything in between, which is nice since we won't have to go to multiple locations. We used to go to 99 Ranch but ever since we moved farther out west, this place is very convenient. \n\nI love going from aisle to aisle just to discover new items to try. From hair products to junk food, even new tea to drink. When I was making pho from scratch, I was able to buy every detailed ingredients in one place. They are complete with lots of herbs and spices, sauces, powders, you name it! Their facility is also very clean. If you end up having a language problem with an employee, it won't be hard to find someone who can speak English. I'm pretty sure majority of them can speak English anyway. \n\nAnd I love their bakery/deli selections. I buy the pastries to bring for lunch, and I like to order their dim sum whenever I'm craving them but wouldn't want to go to Orchid's Garden or Chang's by myself. Their deli items are pretty good for the price. Instead of going to Panda Express, I'd advice you to go here instead. It's authentic and very affordable (roughly $5 for 2 combo), and their servings are HUGE.\n\nPlus, they have a FREE fish-frying service!"
4,The burgers are very good. I've had the BBQ before & just had the I Love Bacon burger (brisket & bacon yum!) tater tots are a must & love the beer specials. 32 oz. Sam Adams for $10 & you get to keep the cup :) all I have to say is I love I Love Burgers!
4,"I really like the convenience of drive thru Starbucks, but this one has a traditional vibe that makes me want to get out of my car. They are friendly and always get my drink right."
4,"$7.77 Steak n Scrimps?\n\nNo better deal than this, I mean c'mon guys.....$7.77 for a decent slab a meat n skewered shrimp, mashed spuds and a salad (good green mix) but go for the Caesar salad, tasty greens they are....\n\nJust get in, order, eat n shut up, don't ruin the special with \""service\"" or \""ambiance\"" or \""tablecloths\"", this is a 24/7 grubb joint.\n\nSo I finished off a night of Craps here after hitting the hard eight twice, one with $100 on it, you Crappers know the odds....yeahhhhhhh boyyyyy! Did I say you Crappers?\n\ntil next time, Steak ya later....."
4,"I give this a 4.5 star as I was pleased all the restaurants or fast food places to choose from to eat right in the hotel, lots of new & old slot machines, a few bars, lovely pool area, great kids zone upstairs, simi friendly servers, we had the deluxe room & although it had plenty of space I have taken the half star off due to it being a little dirty, table seats had food stains & there is no wi-fi & the internet wire in room we were to use for internet did not work... besides those 3 flaws everything else was great & for sure will stay again!"
4,"Great restaurant...not a fan of the sushi tho. I'm a huge sushi eater and could try every sushi place in the city if I could. With the number of sushi places around Vegas, this is good, but not my number 1 choice for sushi. \n\nGarlic Chicken and Hamburger Steak is definitely what I go there for! And their Hawaii breakfasts for Portuguese Sausage, Eggs, & Rice...yummm! haha!\n\nNot a Sushi place for big sushi eaters..other than that...it's a taste of 808 in the 702."
4,"Oh Grand Lux.  When will you move to the Bay Area?  Yes, it is very Cheesecake Factory-ish.  I love the variety here and the food is actually pretty darn good.  We came here for lunch after a very long crazy night.  Amongst five girls, we ordered a bunch of different items:\n\n1. Stacked chicken quesadilla\n2. Seared rare ahi\n3. Asian Noodle bowl (I can't remember the exact name)\n4. Tomato bisque\n\nDo not go for the noodle!   It's a very very poor attempt at rice noodles.  I think I'm gonna give up eating noodles at non-Asian places.  I am always hugely disappointed.  The ahi and the quesadilla were good tho.  Tomato soup was a nice large bowl and tasty too.  Portions are very big so always a good idea to share because it's very unlikely you can finish it.  Prices are great.  Service is down to earth and quick.  You will definitely leave full and happy spending about $20!"
4,"I went here with my out of town guests to redeem a match play deal advertised on the bar's Web site. It's a typical neighborhood poker bar with a tropical theme (love the small waterfall) and tiki decor. Any place that offers a match play is a winner in my book, though we didn't try the food.\nThe bartender offered to serve the Blue Moon with orange juice, which is also a winner. \nThis is a Steelers bar, and as such, promos and prizes are offered during all games."
4,"I went there with some friends and we all liked it. My wife and i had a vegetarian sandwich called a Caprese, my daughter had an italian and my friend had the Montagu. They were very inexpensive for the strip but i was hungry after my sandwich."
4,We travel to Mexico a lot.  Just got back from the tip of Baja.  These tacos taste like Baja tacos.  Great stuff!  Very clean and staff is nice.  Went 2 nights in a row.
4,"The wash and interior cleaning was great! I was very happy to see my older car sparkle :) The guys got the job done in reasonable time and I was very happy to see all the windows cleaned, floors vacuumed. \nI was however bugged by the girl that first approaches you to take your car wash request. She spoke way to fast and with lots of attitude. She didn't like having to repeat herself (I could tell by the way she rolled her eyes). \n\nBut the guys and girl that actually detailed the vehicles were all pleasant and service with a smile!"
4,This place is great for a big group! We stayed here for a friends birthday a couple of weeks ago and it was pretty nice. It is located behind the MGM hotel and right by Hooters hotel. We rented a two bedroom villa and our room was very spacious. It also came with a fully equipped kitchen and it had everything you need to cook food. There were two full bathrooms and they had extra pillows and blankets. It said it sleeps 6 people but it could probably sleep around 10 people comfortably. It was reasonably priced and it was very quiet. The continental breakfast is probably the best breakfast I have had. They had a lot of variety and options for people. Overall a good place to stay if you don't mind staying a little bit away from the strip.
4,"Vegan pizza in Vegas? YES!\n\nThough they don't advertise the vegan menu out front, but if you ask, they'll show you their vegan menu. The list is pretty extensive. I want to try the tofu parmesan sub, but my dinner mate wanted pizza to share. \n\nWe got a meal deal which included a side and salad and 12\"" pizza for 24.95 plus drinks for 3.75 (refillable thankfully). Not cheap but a good deal for the Wynn, and pizza in general. Some people swear by Daiya, but they use Follow Your Heart here. I think Follow Your Heart is quite good, though not sure if I prefer it to Daiya. It has a good texture and taste. Our veggie pizza was topped with kalamata olives, onions and roasted red peppers. It was an interesting combination, but not necessarily one I would go with again. The main negative I found with the pizza was that the outer crust was a bit hard. The salad was okay. Nothing spectacular but good. The fries were super crispy and really good.  \n\nI am planning my next trip, and will definitely come here again."
4,"Great place to go on a Monday afternoon. There were probably less than 20 cars in the parking lot. I was kind of leery at first because the mall here is sketchy at best, but this was a nice clean theater with friendly staff."
4,"What kind of mystery meat do they put in these wrinkly giant hot dogs? Actually, I don't want to know, but it filled me up for $2.\n\nAnd you (blackjack) people who constantly double down when the dealer is showing 10 and you have 10...I'm going to choke you."
4,"I would definitely recommend this place.  Great place to get your breakfast, especially if you're tired of eating on the Stripe.  When I went on Sunday for brunch (arrived around 10:30), the wait was 40 minutes. Server was nice. \n\nRecommendation: Chorizo Hash, Andy's Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles, Tractor Driver Combo."
4,"I think my favorite part about this place is the hidden entrance.  I felt like I was entering a secret speakeasy.  Inside I liked the fireplace and the dark lighting and the nice old bar.  To me it felt a little too open and big for a wine bar, not super intimate.  But I'm used to smaller bars in LA or NYC.  They had a huge wine list and were very helpful with recommendations.  There was a mix of ages , lots of dates and groups of girls, and everyone at the bar seemed mellow.  A nice change from the other bars in Old Town.  I am definitely adding this to my regular Scottsdale hang out spots."
4,Every time I visit Pittsburgh I have to stop here. I've ordered a few sandwiches but just like everyone says... Everything is good! Only down side is that service is a little slow.
4,"Best Airports to be drunk in\n1) Narita/Tokyo- Come on, it's made of glass and you can ride the monorail for about 3 hours and everyone's too polite to tell you to get off.\n2) Chicago O'Hare- There's a mother f.ing neon tunnel (put on some The Dark Side of the Moon in that and you'd be bumped up a spot)\n3) McCarran- Las Vegas. You just spent 12 hours in Vegas. It's inevitable, how can you not be drunk? The stone Lizard and Snake make great props and the mesmerizing slot machines make you forget you're waiting for a flight back home while the rest of your friends are still tanning at the pool. Bitches.\n\nLook a quarter! Deposit. Pull. \nCherry, Cherry! Cherry!!!.....Lemon  =(\n Oh fuck. Well at least it's time to board."
4,"I got $0.99 problems but the Tuesday deal from Popeyes ain't one. 99 cents for two pieces of chicken hits the spot once in a while and Popeyes always come through. I don't come here often but it's hard not to take advantage of this deal. I always add some biscuits, they are delicious. Their chicken seems to be consistent  and  service is average for a drive thru place."
4,"Overall, good food, noble mission... It's a place that you feel good about eating a meal at :) \n\nI absolutely love the concept behind King's Kitchen. They are a not-for-profit restaurant that donates 100% of it's profits from sales to feed the community. Not only do they have a noble mission and vision, but they have tasty food! \n\nI had a group interview in Uptown and a few of us were looking for a lunch spot close by. It was the one rainy, cold, windy day that week and we were on foot. Someone suggested Jimmy John's but I refused to walk too far.  Luckily, The King's Kitchen was at the corner of the block. We walked in and we took a peak at the menu. Everyone was satisfied with the selection so we asked to be seated. I got the chicken salad croissant sandwich which came with a side. I opted for a mixed greens salad with balsamic. The sandwich was excellent! The side salad was good, a simple mixed green salad with fresh ingredients. No complaints. The other selections at the table looked tasty as well! The prices were fair, $9-13 for the lunch menu.  The service was attentive and everyone was very polite. I would like to return to try their dinner selections."
4,"I enjoyed a lovely brunch on the patio here with some GREAT companions for great conversation.  The eggs were great.  All the pastries I tried were divine.  The bacon was merely satisfactory.  The jelly with the \nmini donuts was AMAZING.  But, they need to stop calling those things beignets.   They were donuts, and by misnaming them I expected something different in terms of fluffiness of the pastry.  The Bellinis were awesome.  Wish they served coffee in bigger cups."
4,"Tacos were good and simple.  They were small and cheap, you'll want to order a few. Horchata was good and homemade.  Beans were plain.  Certainly not the best I've tried but I would come back."
4,"Funk yeah! This place is the sheet for chilling downtown without the frown. Where else are you going to swamp yourself in artisan suds as well as the classic Shlitz? Rhetorical question--no where.\n\nJust the Tips:\n- Roast beef sandwich is mostly awesome.\n- They have AZ wines if your man-meter doesn't sink to skunky beers.\n- If you want to talk to your pretty lady and retain your voice, sit outside.\n- For you veggies and squirrels, the mixed nuts and olives are well portioned."
4,"This place has amazing french fries. They were the perfice size, shape and were perfectly crispy! Seems like all the restaurants in Mandalay Bay serve the same fries. I can barely remember what else I ate there because the fries were so amazing. Cute place for a quick lunch but if you're lookin for some fancy vegas place this ain't it. Get the fries!"
4,"Needs to turn on their fans for lunch dining area because its super hot in Tempe area. Overall, i like the music atmosphere is amazing. Customer service was okay but lunch rush hour was busy. Love the burgers! :)"
4,"Make a reservation. We eat here almost every time we are in Vegas. Food is consistently good. Service is good most of the time. I like the sesame chicken, mongolian beef, and the fried rice. Dessert, the bananas, are very good. \n\nWatch your bar tab here, as most drinks add up pretty quickly, $9 margarita. Very good though...."
4,"Went here for my 3rd time. This place is great specially if you're wondering the fashion show mall and you suddenly realize you starving, and you just know the food court isn't what you had in mind...\n\nToday I got both of the specials- swordfish and the lamb (both awesome) I say,...always order the specials at a tapa place- rarely will they let you down!\n\nFYI if you want the happy hour half off tapas you have to be sitting at the bar in order to do so. Which is kind of stupid, but that's just how it goes.... the menu is smaller but hey if you want to save some that's an idea."
4,The Manager went out of his way to make us feel welcome and make our bike trip to the restaurant one that we won't forget.  Really friendly staff.  I think this new little restaurant has a lot of potential and room to grow into a great place to have breakfast and lunch.
4,"Vietnamese food made by (lovely!) Vietnamese family. They value fresh ingredients and snappy service.\n\nEstablished in 2011, this restaurant serves many traditional Vietnamese dishes as well as a few popular 'East Asian' dishes. Plates are heartily-sized and reasonably priced.\n\nMy Tom Xao Ca Ri ($12.50) was full of fresh vegetables (not overcooked -- a rarity for this neighborhood's Asian restaurants!) and jumbo shrimp. The original house specialties include Banh Tom Ho Tay (lightly friend shrimp and sweet potato cake, $13) and Ca Kho To (caramelized fish, $10). Their curries pack a welcomed spicy punch. The Canh Chua ($8) are all made with a homemade broth (cooked daily).  \n\nThe chef is forthright in sharing his values. MSG disgusts him and so does the 'watery salty stock' that other restaurants use. He also said too many cooks substitute natural ingredient flavor with copious amounts of oil. \n\nPetite Tonkinoise's only downfall? The decor isn't much to write about. It looks like a confused zen kitsch mini banquet hall."
4,"Went to Puck's, last minute, for dinner with family. Located in Crystals Mall on the Strip near Aria, it has a bright semi open space, with a nice small bar area. Only had to wait 10 minutes for a Friday night walk-in around 9PM. Staff was adequately attentive.\n\nOverall, food was good. I tried the grilled ribeye steak, which was probably the priciest entree on the menu at $40. But it was cooked perfectly to my order (medium rare) with an unctuous reduction sauce which I wish I had more off. Topped off, it had a nice stem of mushrooms and blackened green chiles. (which was a nice touch of heat) to the dish. A perfectly acceptable opening meal night in Vegas. Nothing too fancy or spend, but good food still.\n\nSampled the tiramisu dessert at the end. Tasted really good. It had these nice chocolate beads in the creamy layer that added a surprising little crunch to the dish.\n\nEven though it's a mainly pasta/pizza & some seafood place, I can safely recommend the ribeye here. Enjoy the good eats."
4,"In search of authentic chicken and waffles I stumble upon LoLo's. The waffles were outstanding, the chicken was amazing and my two friends and I hardly spoke a word as we devoured each bite. The place was clean and the service was warm and friendly. Do yourself a favor and check it out. I know I will again."
4,The family went last night after visiting North Lake Mall. You order at the counter and they bring you the food. Service was quick. Place was very busy.  I had the half-chicken plate and wife had the pulled pork plate. The plates come with two sides and garlic bread  Children had pork sandwich and chicken fingers. The chicken fingers can be ordered grilled which is healthier than fried  Everyone enjoyed their meals. Portions are good sized.  The BBQ sauces came in three varieties and were tasty. The sweet tea was also good.  Drinks are self-service.  The place was clean and staff was very friendly and helpful  I gave it four stars because the place was much better than average in all aspects and we will return when we are in the area.
4,"I had the fish tacos, hubby had a bacon cheeseburger, and the kids had corn dogs. The fish tacos were very tasty!"
4,Update: french fries and hash browns recipes changed. They were better when they first opened. I can't seem to get an answer on the change. Not as good. \n\nGreat place. Great atmosphere. With open indoor and patio dining. Just had their grand opening and the service is getting to match the good good they serve. A must try if you live in the PV/Scottsdale area. Love the San tan hefe!
4,"Get extra bowls or a to-go container you wil need them. \n\nHUGE portions which scores points for me always. The food is great too. No, it's not authentic, but if you're just looking for some feel-good food come here. Portions are huge which is why it costs a bit (up to nine bucks after tax) but their best item is actuallt their cheapest the plain udon at under seven bucks after tax. \n\nTheir udon noodles are super thick you won't miss the meat. I have very Americanized tase buds I'll admit, but to me the broth is super tasty. I put in a cup of chili oil and it's bliss in a bowl. \n\nAlso gets points for atmosphere very clean, for just a few dollarsmore than fast food it's actually a place you can enjoy sitting in and spending time."
4,"No complaints about the quality of the haircut, but during my fourth visit, the barber (Bob) cutting my hair started negotiating price about halfway through the haircut.  Their standard price for a haircut is $15, and on my previous visits I've given him a $5 tip.  He said that haircuts \""like mine\"" are extra work (I have thick hair, which requires using thinning shears), and he feels that I should pay $25 (!) for all the \""extra work\"".  In over 40 years, I have *never* had a barber complain about my hair being hard to cut.  If he had said this up front, I would have walked out, but I couldn't really leave in the middle of a haircut.  Needless to say, I will be exploring other options in the future.\n\nUPDATE - I complained to the owner (Ernie), and he was very eager to make things right.  He said to come back next time and ask for him, and the haircut would be on the house.  I did, and was quite pleased with the result.  After a number of repeat visits over a period of a couple years (until I moved away), I would not hesitate to recommend this place - just avoid Bob (the old guy in the far back)."
4,"Awesome place to stay.  We arrived late due to a flight delay and they had already given our room away.  The woman at reception apologized and then proceeded to upgrade us with a bigger room with the best view of the strip (in my opinion). \n\nThe pools were why we decided to stay here and we weren't disappointed.  Two small pools, a lazy river, and a large wave pool (only one wave every five or ten minutes though). The pool vibe was much tamer than I expected.  Daylight (day pool party) was going strong, but steep cover charge.  \n\nGreat food options around the casino. The bars inside were pricey, but to be expected.  Overall, this was a great place to stay and would come back."
4,"Pros: Super sweet and delicious cakes, ice cream, and truffles.  \n\nCons: It can be a tad bit too sweet for me, after a couple bites I'm done.\n\nRed Velvet cake is definitely my favorite and so is their washroom - mirrors everywhere and very clean."
4,"I really like this restaurant.  The food is always good.  The salsa is nice and spicy and the service is fast and attentive.  It's a great place to take my entire family.\n\nI usually order the chicken fajitas, which are amazing.  I also love that they serve a complimentary bowl of soup with the standard chips and salsa.  Nice touch! The kids love it."
4,"I think this might be one of the better wing places in the valley honestly.  The wings here are large and in charge, and I like that they don't over-batter them.  They always seem to come out crispy, and not drowned in sauce, which is a plus for me.  I don't care that they don't have like 20 flavors like BWs, because their sauces are tasty and they run the spice gamut.  Service is friendly, and fast, and I like that they have rolls of paper towels on the tables, and give you wet naps to clean up when you're done eating.  Also a big fan of their boneless \""wings\"", which are gigantic."
4,"I started off my visit to Quaker Steak with the Atomic Wing Challenge, which is just eating six of their atomic wings.  Six wings obviously isn't much, but the atomic wings are quite spicy and they require that you sign a liability waiver before eating them (this is more for show than anything).  Yes, they're pretty damn hot, but they're bearable as long as you have a good tolerance for spicy food.  If you're comfortable eating foods with habaneros in them, then you'll have no problem with the atomic wings.  Here's a pro-tip though: if you're getting the atomic wings, ask them for a pair of food-handling gloves.  This way you can avoid getting wing sauce all over your hands, allowing you to actually touch your eyes or use the restroom later that day without torturing yourself.\n\nAnyway, after I finished that off, I went back and got some more wings - Louisiana Lickers, Arizona Ranch, and Golden Garlic.  I was impressed with the flavors, as everything was quite good.  The wings were nice and meaty too, which is good because a lot of wing places manage to hunt down wings with almost no meat on them, which kind of defeats the purpose of eating them in the first place.\n\nMy one complaint is that I think the wings are a bit overpriced.  A half dozen wings is $5, and 83 cents per wing seems rather high to me.  Still though, these wings are much better than most, so it's probably worth it."
4,I really like this place. We used to come here often and then didn't for a long time just because we weren't in the hood when they were open. The las two weeks I've been by and had a late lunch. The people that t=run this place are so genuinely nice. The ensalada drink is refreshing in this heat. I usually get a veg papusa and fried plantain. My husband had the chicken soup and loved it and then the chicken special and loved it. I'm so glad we went back.
4,"This was our last use of the LALALA ramen pass and it was totally awesome to be able to conclude our two week Los Angeles ramen extravaganza with an awesome ramen dish in Las Vegas. \n\nSmokey and sultry with a slight hint of wood fired bbq char was the flavor of the pork that was included in our soup bowl. It was very bold and distinct and the subtleties of the smokiness withstood the nuanced flavors of the ramen broth. The waitress hovered over us, she wanted to make sure we had a good time and enjoyed our food. She almost followed us out the door when she said goodbye. \n\nThey try to do things a little different here at Ramen Misoya Tomi. The traditional, meticulous care is still put into the recipes and ingredients but added are the non-traditional, traditional recipes that we aren't familiar with. Did you follow that? \n\nThe decor could use a little improvement, I'm not a fan of the huge posters hanging about that tout the benefits of miso. Ambiance could be a little less perfunctory and a bit more fun, but what's great about this spot is that it's not too crowded so I'd recommend it for groups. It's hard to find a ramen spot to take big groups to because they are normally tiny places and packed to the brim. A group would fare fine here."
4,Food are little bit salty but the service is great. If you prefer something more special to try than buffet. Stratta would be a not bad to try. I highly recommended the tata beef appetizer.
4,"I love Songbird. I work close by, and it's so nice to have a great coffee house so close. The pastries, which the buy fresh from local makers, are divine. Go for the brioche cinnamon roll and thank me later. The coffee is stellar. I can't even put a finger on what's different, but I'm guessing it's the utmost attention to quality and detail of their product. \n\nSeating is a little sparse, and prices are a little high, but the goods received are worth it."
4,"Tried the lamb kubideh. It was very reasonable pricing, for $7.99 I got a healthy serving of kubideh with rice, and bread. They make the bread at the location! Everything tasted wonderful. And we ended our meal with a Baklava. Do try it!"
4,"SanTan is one of my favorite local beers to purchase at the store, so of course I'm going to be a fan of their restaurant!  My biggest issue is that there are not the greatest number of vegetarian options on the menu.  I had fish tacos the most recent time we visited, which were okay.  Nothing too special.  The veggie burger is also pretty standard.  What I love most about SanTan is their appetizers (the pretzel!) and beer.  I've heard great things about some of their burgers, but I cannot vouch for them!  Great local place - wish it were closer to home!"
4,"I stumbled on this place a few months ago when I wanted to treat myself. LOVE IT. I get a mani/pedi for $30! Pedicure includes hot stone massage, warm lotion and a great leg massage. I've gone here a few times, never with an appointment and they always take me and get me to a massage chair to start my pedicure. \n\nThe only thing that surprised me was when my boyfriend asked for the paraffin on his hands, the girl brought out 2 plastic bags with warm wax in them and told him to slip his hands in while she tied them around his wrists. Seemed a little tacky but the result was smoother skin. \n\nI'm going back there this Friday again to prepare for sandal season."
4,"I love Villa Deli and have been going for years.   I went for lunch today and they now sell Pizza and are under new ownership.  The sandwiches are still the best and of the highest quality.  The pizza was pretty good as well, I wish they would sell one slice but you have to buy two.  The one thing that is missing is the friendly service the old owners used to provide.  The service was not bad but there was no conversation or anything more than taking your order and thanking you while paying.  I think the charm of this place was how the old owner used to come out and talk to everyone and just made you feel good about being there.    Keep up the good work, but engage with your customers more and I promise they will keep coming back!   Good Luck"
4,excellent food and the waiter was outstanding.\nwas my wife's birthday July 4th and he had a great dessert with a sparkler candle in it\n\nrecommend to anyone
4,"We ended up here purely by accident and loved it! We were looking for a place to go dance and as we were walking by Caesar's a guy was outside handing out passes for no cover before midnight. We took the passes and headed into the Casino. Right in front of Pure was another guy handing out the same passes and he told us to get into the Guest List line which was shorter,even though we weren't on the guest list. We were inside the club within 5 minutes of entering the hotel. \n\nPure is pretty much a rooftop club overlooking the strip. I danced for hours just looking at the Eiffel Tower. Can't complain about that, now can you? The DJ was awesome and I wish I can remember his name because I loved pretty much everything he played. The drinks were pretty pricey but I guess you can expect that in Vegas. I'd definitely come back!"
4,"This place was excellent! The pizza was a tiny bit oily, but full of flavor. The side salad was great and we were able to enjoy a large pizza and side salad for three meals. This place delivered promptly to our hotel as well. Definitely worth ordering if you're tired and want a nice easy meal delivered to your doorstep."
4,"This is the 3rd  version of the Springs Cafe that I know of, and its still about the same.  To be honest, the location and the view get the 4 stars, the food probably warrants about 3.5.\n\nThe dining choices are good, and I've never had bad food or bad service, but there is nothing terribly special about the offerings. A solid burger, good wraps, good pizzas, some interesting specials. Again, the food takes second place to the location.\n\nI would definitely recommend coming here if you're in the area, the views of the valley are great. Sit out on the balcony on a warm day an just take it all it."
4,"Great addition to Shadyside! I love the massive beer list, big menu, and bottomless mimosa and Bloody Mary option with the brunch. I had the chicken and waffles today and it was the perfect balance of southern diner meets gourmet gravy with bacon maple syrup. I live around the corner... looking forward to going back."
4,"This might the sushi sleeper in Henderson.  I met a coworker for lunch here since it is near work, at her suggestion.  They have lunch specials, plenty of cooked options, and sushi.\n\nFor my first time here, I figured the lunch special is a pretty good deal. $12.50 for 6 pieces of sushi or sashimi, 1 roll from a list, and miso soup plus salad.  There were also lunch bentos (pick 2 from a list) but all were cooked options.\n\nI opted for sushi, so I could try the rice.  After the soup and salad, I was presented with a very simple but beautiful plate...with generous cuts of nigiri and the roll.  I received 2 pieces each of maguro (very deep red, beautiful), nama sake, and hamachi.  They were arranged in a colorful pattern.  I also got the spicy yellowtail roll as my roll choice.\n\nI was surprised honestly - the quality was definitely decent for our landlocked region and the rice was good.  I also got a green iced tea, which was served in a large glass, limiting any need for a refill.  Our server was very nice and quick.  We were in and out in under 35 minutes!  It is quiet inside and there is a cherry blossom painted on the back wall.  The ambiance is nice.  This is a definitely a good lunch spot on this side of town."
4,"GREAT food! you know its a good vegan place when your non-veg friends like it enough to go back. everything looked and tasted delicious, packed with flavor! prices are extremely good for the quality and portions of the food. cant complain if you can leave feeling completely stuffed (i eat alot) for about $10.\n\nadvice: might want to avoid friday night dinner rush...it was pretty slammed, and my girlfriend didnt even get her drink until AFTER the meal, about 20 mins after ordering said drink."
4,"Craving a slice of NY pizza and you live in Vegas? I think we all agree, this place is IT!  Some may complain it's too far from the strip or from Summerlin. Trust me, it's worth the drive. Why didn't I give it a 5 star? Because, I've had NY pizza and nothing comes close to that. Go get yourself a slice.\n\nAnd if you don't care what your thighs will say after you've devoured a pint of creamy ice cream then head on over next door...(I don't remember the name). They have great lucious creamy ice cream. yum!"
4,"Thus place is very clean! Good seating, and very friendly and efficient staff! Have to say thus subway should be an example on how they should be ran! Definitely will go back again!"
4,"How have I never reviewed this place before? It's close by so I do come here. Like once a month I show up. \n\nIt has that great dimly lit dive bar feel. You know you could get laid if you wanted to.  The drinks are cheap and the bartenders are cool. \n\nI like the people most.... you get such a fun variety the normal alcoholics, people in their work clothes, people hoping not to run into anyone they know, and plenty of stoners. Being a semi attractive girl the mostly male patrons treat you like you are family.... the creepy kind they want to kiss... but still family.   You can be relaxed and grab a few beers or get good and drunk either way you will fit  fit in just fine. \n\nIt's worth a trip and when the drunk people get kicked out of Santisi Brothers they walk to the other side if the parking lot and come here.  If nothing else grab a beer and watch the people that come here. \n\nAlso I might note that they only have 1 stall for women but there is often no line and MOST the time it does not smell like farts and coochie."
4,"Such a cool space! The outdoor patio is absolutely beautiful & would be the perfect spot for a group dinner. We sat inside for lunch & started with chips and guac. For my entree I ordered the special of the day, the blackened mahi spinach salad. Huge portion - essentially there was an entire piece of fish on top of a bed of spinach. Definitely couldn't eat the entire thing.\n\nTheir happy hour deals look amazing - I'm sure I'll be back!"
4,"It is my firm belief that Small hole in the Wall BBQ/ Southern places should be given their own set of common customer service rules...I have noticed the small places seem to go at their own pace, forget and change orders midstream and frequently end up treating you like you are visiting at their home not their restaurant. \nMemphis has this type of feel. We got there right at opening and that created \""speedbumps\"" , still counting change,  putting chairs down , food not made yet...but the good news is this place is delicious in my book. \nAfter finally getting our order straightened out ...I had yummy Beef ribs with a lovely pink ring that scream I have been smoked.  the coleslaw was unususua and I loved it ...guess what it was mustard based..loved the taste and the sweet sour effect of sugar in the dressing with the mustard.  husband had the Pulled pork but it wasn't quite as yummy as my ribs, he didn't adore the sugary bbq sauce that had a peppery back kick. Oh well  guess he should have gotten the ribs.  \nSo the  next  time you are in Buckeye stop  bye  and give it a try ."
4,"Sometimes good things really do come in small packages!  Considering that this is Vegas' first casino and that it was built in 1906, this boutique hotel/casino is classy but simplistic and very nice inside!  I love the row of old style slot machines - very neat touch.  The casino floor and bathrooms are spotless.  The dealers are dressed as flappers at night, which I think is really fun.  \n\nWe haven't stayed here but signed up for Club 1906 and it didn't take much gambling (playing joker poker at the bar while enjoying \""free\"" drinks) before we received free room offers in the mail.  Maybe we'll take advantage of this later on if we want to do a downtown staycation.  \n\nIf you're downtown and haven't checked out the first Las Vegas casino, stop in for a drink or some craps!  This place is totally fun!"
4,"I'm not in the business of enjoying many buffets these days. My girlfriend doesn't appreciate my ever expanding waste line and my new found squishy qualities as much as I do. So where's the first place I go on a weekend away with the dudes? Buffet.\n\nNope, the food isn't spectacular, the service isn't worth raving about, and the atmosphere is pretty reminiscent of a fancy high school cafeteria. But, it's a buffet. You pay a small, small price for an endless supply of food. Best part? I had steak, New Orleans chicken, gobs of rice, heaps of ice cream, and some other stuff I can't remember because of the food coma, AND all of it was either respectably OK or even fairly enjoyable. \n\nGolden Corral will forever have a spot in my heart and a gaping hole in my stomach to fill."
4,"I love this place and their selections! They always have red velvet unlike the places that switch out their flavors (ahem, ahem MoJo, yogurtology, etc)!!!!! their newest featured flavors are the bananalicious and hawaiin something and their BOTH delish!\n\nThe ONLY reason they didnt get 5 stars from me is because......THEY DONT FREAKING HAVE JUICE POPPERS!!!! how do you not have juice poppers!?  EVERYONE LOVES JUICE POPPERS!!!"
4,"Went for brunch but ended up ordering from the grilled cheese list. I had the wake and bake which was amazing. Cheddar, egg, maple bacon, and maple mayo. Seriously it was over the top delicious. My boyfriend had the blarney stoner. This was open faced with mashed potatoes, beer cheese, stout gravy, fries, and hash. So really it was potatoes on bread. Not really grilled, but so yummy.\n\nAll of the grilled cheeses come with tomato soup and fries. The fries were thick and almost breaded, soft in the middle. You can get them in a few different flavors including old bay- can't go wrong there. The tomato soup was interesting. Not bad per se but really really thick. I can't imagine eating a bowl of it but it did serve the obvious purpose of being vessel for dipping. \n\nOur service was great. She was quick and efficient. Absolutely no complaints. Also the beer list here is amazing. We will be back!"
4,"Just to the left of Atria's on the Roberto Clemente Bridge side of PNC Park is where you'll find The Diamond Pizza. \n\nNot only do they have really good pizza, the cheese is especially good, but you can enter the park there as well. Never a line.  Friendly ticket taker and bag search person greet you at the door, scan your ticket and provide a program along with any promotional items for the game.\n\nOnce inside, order by the slice, grab a beer if that's your pleasure and watch the game on either of the TVs before going to your seats. Another bonus, restrooms are just outside the restaurant as you enter the left field corridor. \n\nLike most pizza/sandwich shops, this one can be hopping. No frills in the service, mustard working folks trying to make good food for the money. And they do."
4,"Well I went in here looking for gifts for others, but only came out with stuff for myself....hummmm something is wrong with this picture! \nI love Ross stores, I shouldn't have even started looking for stuff for me, it get's me every time!"
4,Old school friendly atmosphere and great specials.  The steak abd lobster comes with veggies and a big ass baked potato
4,"Holly's review is right on!  This was my second year doing this event.  Last year, I did the bicycle ride.  That was such a cluster, it wasn't offered this year.\n\nI don't run, but I walk the 5K.  I always have my beard with me so that's never a problem.  I also park in the north lot and make a quick exit on Sunset.\n\nI really dislike the growth in the numbers of dogs that are here every year.  At least they had the good sense to crap at home before they came here, because I saw no doggy do anywhere.\n\nIt's fun doing the walk because the entertainment beforehand--Jabbawockeez from the Monte Carlo, some dancers from the topless show Fantasy at the Luxor, and five flying Santas that parachuted to the parking lot from a helicopter high above the boulevard, and others--make this a fun event. Also, the chance to walk over the freeway on Sunset, something you don't do everyday is worth the walking.\n\nIt's also the main fundraiser for Opportunity Village, a very needy charity in Southern nevada.  I'll be back next year for another go, suit and all!"
4,"Another successful transplant from NYC, this place is great.  Spendy, trendy, and a little confusing menu wise if you have a big group like we did.  we had a great waiter that helped us with our order and nobody left disappointed or un-full.  The place is loud and full of energy and beautiful people.\n\nAsk for help with the menu if theres a group.  If youre a couple youre golden.  So many things to try, you could eat here 100 times.\n\nNo complaints at all."
4,"Hidden away it is!  I forgot where it was located (some friends drove me here and I was not paying attention as to how we arrived).\n\nThe interior is funky, dark, and small (cool copper counter tops) but that just adds to the character.  I ordered pork enchiladas(?) and shared the sauteed garlic dish (i think that's what it was)?  It was very yummy and left me wanting more.  The only downfall was that the garlic must have gotten into my pores b/c I felt like I smelled of garlic for days!  It was well worth it though and a spot you should certainly check out."
4,"I went get a few months ago and I'm sure glad I did.  It is so yummy.  I had the spicy meat taco and it was good.  Came back a few weeks later and got a burrito, it was so good and much better than Chipolte.  \nMy only complaint is that they need to explain what the meat it. Majority of it I have never heard of and maybe get a wider range of soda or add tea to drink.  \nOverall a great and inexpensive place to eat yummy tacos or burritos and street corn. Open late"
4,i really want to give it 5 stars but my carne adovada sometimes is kinda fatty. i love this dish but hate sometimes picking through fat. they do have the best chipotle ranch ever!!!
4,"Best Chai Latte in town. We had a chocolate twist and a quiche lorraine. Both very light and delicious. Brought home a ciabatta boule, which was much more moist than we are used to but very good."
4,"Delicious, good service, one of our favorites places to eat.\n\nHighly recommend the sesame tofu - it is some of the best tofu I've ever had at a restaurant."
4,"I had to take a star away.  I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken rice bowl and was very disappointed, it tasted really strange and really soggy.  My co-worker said it best, he said it tasted like a frozen meal heated. \n\nI'll stick with the 5 star wraps and salads and leave the 2.5 star bowls for them to keep."
4,"Great performances and acts! The main guy was hilarious and the space was intimate. I only wish Angel had a larger part, but it was fun seeing her doing something out of her element. \n\nP.S. The absinthe is a great gimmick but nothing like what you find overseas. I appreciate that they had it though."
4,I went back a second time and they have changed the way they make the Wellington.  It now only comes one way you cannot order it medium well or any other way.  Just thought it was funny after my initial review.  Still very good though!
4,"The review by Jennifer C. is spot on. I had a very similar experience. I'm from Pittsburgh and taking a 'tour' of my hometown seemed odd at first, but this was definitely a unique way to get around town. \n\nThe only reason I didn't give this more stars though was that I have to say this adventure was more Segway, less tour. Riding the Segway was a ton of fun (especially after they turned off the speed limiter) but there wasn't much to the tour itself. The guide pointed out a few interesting facts here and there, but I was hoping for more."
4,Make sure you're ready to eat if you come here. The proportions are ginormous and will definitely leave you with a food coma. The fries that come with the sandwiches are also great.
4,What is up with the host's lately in restaurants. They have zero personality and really don't set a great first impression. Anyhow lets get to food and service. Carol is great and really overcomes the original impression left by the podium guards. We ordered a tomatoe caprisi appetizer and it was excellent!  A new variation on a classic. Tomatoes are spread out on the plate and has chopped tomaroes spread around. The new addition to this classic is fresh red onion and then a balsamic reduction and fresh basil. I could eat this dish as an main course but I don't have that much restraint. I orderes pasta franco and it was very food. The combination of olives artichoke hearts and sundried tomatoe makes this dish a little salt towards the end but it wasn't unexpected. I would order it again.  Carol Is very attentive but never pushy and you should definitely ask for her. We don't dine here often enough but we will remedy that.
4,"Come for the coffee, stay (or come back) for the excellent fresh soup, sandwiches and smoothies!  Would be 5 stars if the service was more consistent."
4,"Fast, polite and the food was good.  The Thai Tacos and fried Mac&Cheese was yummy.  Great burgers as well. This is no culinary stop but good fast food."
4,"Great place!  Pretty slow, as you might expect on a Monday night.  Had nice Malbec, great marinaded olives and a perfect-sized sausage and mushroom pizza.  \n\nDecor is very spiffy.  Rather hard to find the place if you're not a local.  Little strip mall right behind the tire store.  Look Arden, as it's worth searching for.\n\nGet in here!!"
4,"Eines vorweg: In diesem Chinarestaurant habe ich bislang nur das Mittagsbuffet kennengelernt. Die Bewertung bezieht sich ausschliesslich darauf.\n\n\n Mittlerweile gehen wir einmal w\u00f6chentlich zu diesem chinesischen Restaurant. Das Buffet wird st\u00e4ndig aufgef\u00fcllt, so dass es fast immer genug von allem hat. Meine Lieblingsgerichte hier sind die acht Kostbarkeiten und das H\u00fchnchen in Curry. Fazit: Solide Kost zu einem vern\u00fcnftigen Preis ohne Wartezeiten."
4,"Dickey's saved my Thanksgiving!\n\nMy brother & I decided to do Thanksgiving w/ friends super last minute. Hash House a Go Go ran out of turkeys. WTF. So did Mimi's Cafe, Lucilles, and Famous Daves. Double WTF. I needed Thanksgiving to-go and only 2 days to do it! Dickey's had 2 turkey options for $49.99--Cajun Fried Turkey or Smoked Turkey. Of course, they were sold out of the fried turkey but they had 1 smoked turkey left. I called dibs!!!\n\nThe pick-up process was easy. Zipped in and out within 5 minutes. They're closed on Thanksgiving so pick-up needs to be the day before. They're open late so I picked up around 7pm. The turkey is wrapped in foil and comes in an oven-safe aluminum pan ready-to-heat. It takes about 2 hours for the turkey to reach eating temperature. Excellent packaging since my friend just moved to Vegas and has minimal bake/cookware available. I needed low maintenance food and Dickey's definitely made the holidays a bit easier for me.\n \nThe turkey itself was pretty tasty. I was a little concerned that the smoked turkey wouldn't have the Thanksgiving flavor I was looking for but it was delicious. Not the best I've ever had but very good. As much as I love cooking and being able to put all the flavors I want into things. It was a relief to not have to deal with cooking a large bird and focus on the epic games of Settlers of Catan and Wii Tennis."
4,"We randomly walked into the restaurant, after a long day.  We couldn't find something that used to be on the menu, but the waiter still placed our order.  Ended up ordering our own version of \""Surf and Turf\"" - an 8 oz filet mignon and a lobster tail, with mashed potatoes and a salad.  Was incredible disappointed with the salad.  It looked like someone just opened a bag of iceburg lettuce and dropped it in a bowl.  The lobster tail was a bit over cooked and super chewy.  But the filet mignon and mashed potatoes were amazing, but I'm also and meat and potato person. :-)  I still like the intimacy and classiness of the restaurant.  It might have been because we came in so close to closing time.  Been there before with better food, so will definitely give them another chance."
4,Great old fashioned ice cream parlor!\n\nThey have a ton of toppings to create your own or special unique creations. It's a fun place and we had good service. Ice cream was great too. \n\nIt will definitely be a stop of mine next year during spring training.
4,"This place is a whole lot better than you would think. Although it is a chain restaurant the stewed meat they use seems homemade and they give you a giant amount on their tacos. If you want some great cheap Mexican food in a hurry you could do a lot worse. The burritos are beyond huge and everything is very tasty. Very friendly and accommodating staff. Also, choice of a free cookie or small ice cream for dessert."
4,Short wait.  Television available in news or sport channel. Bring reading material or tablet to pass the time. Mammography technicians were good. Office personnel really nice but a little disorganized. They really try to accommodate patients in.
4,Very good Asian Fusion cuisine. I've been there three times and never had anything that wasn't very good. The garlic crab is wonderful and the salt and pepper calamari is good but be ready for SALT and PEPPER. The atmosphere is very nice with a live jazz group playing background music. It's a great place for a romantic dinner or to hang out with friends. Not terrific for kids and I have no idea about parking - I usually take a cab.
4,"Cheese Ravioli with Alfredo sauce was amazing. For $7 you get about 6 ravioli covered in their amazing sauce and a warm, soft breadstick. VERY filling and perfect portion size. I have a thing for alfredo sauce and this is by far one of the best I've had, not watery and has a ton of flavor! Their pizza is way too pricey for me but I'm def going back for more pasta soon!"
4,"You can really taste the inspiration that Dogfish Head and Founders had on NoDa Brewing Company.  \n\nThe Hop, Drop 'n Roll is a sharp and citrusy IPA while the  Woody & Wilcox IPA has a bit more gentle earthiness to it.  The Coco Loco was the first NoDa beer I ever tried.  Bold and subtle at the same time, this beer would be a great campfire replacement for smores.  Many of the other beers I've tried are strongly built and carry their own weight while mingling with the others.\n\nThe inside of NoDa BC is a typical taproom.  There are tables and a bar.  The patrons are an ensemble of culture as you'll find many types of people here.  Mostly people that take beer seriously, though.\n\nI can't say there is anything that puts NoDa over the top.  It feels like a work in progress...or maybe that's because the beer hasn't really knocked my socks off yet. \n\nI do know that I like this place and will come back again.\n\nTry:  The Coco Loco (I know...you don't like the gimmicky porters...but try it anyhow)\n\nAvoid:  Being one of the smokers huddled under the awning when it rains outside"
4,"Love my pizza Naked! Let's start by saying that I'm just excited to get SOMETHING in the neighborhood that isn't the same ole' same ole' that is on every street corner in Phoenix. So I awaited Naked Pizza with anticipation. \n\nI expected it to be busy Friday night when I pulled in. I found a parking spot right up front. I was surprised that there was no seating and it is take out/delivery only. But that's ok if it is tasty! We asked for suggestions and we were given a couple of recommendations. We ordered a 10\"" Superbiotic and a 10\"" BBQ chicken both on original crust. \n\nThere were a few people in the lobby and ordering. It was clear that they were buzzing around like bees in the back keeping up with orders and the warming oven was full to the brim with boxes of pizzza so they were clearly very busy. I waited about 7 minutes for the pizza and we were on our way. We were very happy with the in-store service. \n\nWhen we got the pizza home I was even more impressed. I found the crust to be absolutely delicious. The Superbiotic was as yummy as any $19 smaller pizza in any wood-fired joint. The crust was tasy and good...Now I'm not a huge pizza eater. My favorite is a White pizza....but this I ate every single solitary morsel of. None left for the dogs or anyone else! \n\nI was back Sunday and Wednesday. \n\nWelcome to the neighborhood Naked Pizza!!"
4,"I have been twice since it opened, the first time we went they made a couple mistakes on our order, but they were quickly rectified and it was understandable since everyone there is new. The food has been excellent with good pricing. It's clean with a fun atmosphere. If you simply compare to Baja Fresh and their pricing it's easy to see how much more you get for your money at Wahoos."
4,I went here with a party of 6 on Saturday night.  Our table was ready and waiting when we got there which was nice.  It is an older place with tons of charm.  The place was pretty busy and you could tell that the waiters/servers/busers were clearly over worked.\n\nAfter sitting for about 10 minutes we had to flag someone down to get bread and place our appetizer order.  After that we only saw our waiter every 20 minutes or so so it was difficult to order additional items or to get soda refills.\n\nThe service was pretty blah but the food was excellent.  Everything I tried was top notch.  Everything was freshly made and delicious  Probably some of the best Italian cuisine around.  Definitely some of the best gnocchi I've ever had.\n\nI would definitely return but hope the service is better.
4,"The search is over, I have found taco heaven. I sampled a chicken, asada, and pork street taco. The pork was a little sweet and smokey, the asada was well seasoned and smoky and the chicken too was a winner, just not as a flavorful. My husband let me taste the Bombero burrito, OMG, was that Mexican barbecue sauce on the burrito? The dining experience was well worth the 30 minute drive. I would sample everything on the menu. Thanks for the suggestion Bill B."
4,"My sister and I ate here, after we saw an ad about the restaurant which made the place seem like it was a hot spot for celebrites. There were pictures of Rachel Bilson and even Paris Hilton celebrating parties there, so we felt that it must be good. FIX was described as having gourmet \""college food\"". It definitely had those bad things we all loved in college when we had no time to cook. We ordered the Mini Kobe Burger sliders, and the famed Buffalo Chicken wings. We even ordered some fries, which came in a cute little swirl like container. All of the food we ate was good. The price can be on the upper side, but it's still a nice trendy place to eat at in the Bellagio. I might suggest eating the steak, since it is also advertised as having one of the best steak in Vegas (as do many restaurants by many different critics!)"
4,If had breakfast at this Ahwatukee spot three days in a row. Weekends are busy but the hostess offered seating at the bar. We waited for a table. The chiliquilas were better than expected. The El Jefe was as advertised.  When I ordered the huevos rancheros I got a pancake on the side. The pancake was fantastic and the ranchero is salsa was great. Service was mentioned in previous posts it was good. Busy restaurants have longer ticket times for your meals on way a busy Saturday morning.
4,"I am a huge fan of the Penn Brewery and if you don't know me I am a bit of a booze hound. I love beer! All types, all colors, all ABV's. So I ran in here today for lunch but I  am not allowed to imbibe during work hours. Woe is me....the world is not fair! My point is if you enjoy a beer, just about any type...this is the place to start. I have been here 10+ times and this was my only non-drinking visit. \n\nI enjoyed the Braumeister Steak Sandwich with fries. The food, service and atmosphere were great. Try to find the time to visit this place. Well worth the stop."
4,"Fantastic food! Had drinks & apps at the bar with a friend. A couple great IPA offerings. I am not a big calamari person, but the stewed calamari was outstanding, definitely recommend! Also had a mozzarella caprese which was good. It's a quiet bar, the Sunday night NFL game was playing on the TVs so wouldn't recommend it for game watching, but great place for a date."
4,"My best friend and I visited Zinburger on a week night and found it to be fairly busy.  Although we could have gotten a table (with no wait) we opted to sit at the bar facing into the restaurant.  Wonderful design element.  We had an excellent view of what was going on and both agreed that the layout and design was excellent.\n\nThe food was expensive but it was very good.  We split a kobe burger, double truffle fries, zucchini fries and a bottle of wine.  I was definitely just the right amount of full and left feeling wonderful (maybe that was due to the wine?).  \n\nI'll be back to splurge.  This place was splendid."
4,"Benihana is best enjoyed when you: \nHave money\nA large group of people\nand a lot of time to spare. \n\nProbably something to do once or twice a year. I go when my friends from Iowa decide to come visit me and we have time and money to spare. Everyone there is friendly, and I love the cook in front of you style. (Although sometimes the fire tricks make my eyes hurt). \n\nPlease note this place is not known for their sushi. I would recommend anything hibachi and if you look like you're a kid, it's a good idea to get some sort of kids meal  (if they have one, unfortunately I look like I'm 30 something and my babies are too young and wild to bring anywhere nice)  I want to note too, that I personally feel like they have the best  fried rice."
4,"I've read both ends of the reviews on this boarding facility and I have to err on the side of positive rather than negative.\n\nI dropped off my jack russell terrier there for one night and have no complaints.  They are more pricey than I would like to see, but the facility (in a large business park warehouse) was large and was comparable to Pet Smart's hotel.  You make up the price difference when you consider that the dogs are constantly socializing and playing with each other for most of the day.  You don't have to pay extra for the socialization and it gets your dog out of its pen.\n\nFor my small dog, I did have a small pen, which had its own cot.  There are tvs scattered around showing dog related cartoons and programming.  There are small, medium, and large sized play areas, depending on your size dog.  You can see some of the areas from the front desk at check in.  Both at check in and at check out, I did see an \""accident\"" or two on the floor in the play area, but given the amount of dogs that were running around, I'd say that's probably only natural.\n\nThe staff members were very friendly, and I will book space there again next time I'm in town.  Is it a perfect location?  No, but I have yet to find one that is.  It's getting there, however, and I would have no problem endorsing it."
4,"Great atmosphere, good food and good service. If you are in the Belmont area, a must stop. I had a burger which was great in this little hometown Irish pub."
4,"This cool spot is conveniently located at the MGM Grand if you need a quick break from some slots.  The food was way better than I expected.  I tried the pork belly sandwich and caesar salad and was really impressed.  Both of these dishes are really, really awesome.  I tried the pizza with all the meat lover's fixings and it was extremely tasty but not as crispy as I would have expected (as a native Bronxite, I'm understandably biased).  Overall, I highly recommend this joint!"
4,"The tortillas alone could make this place. \n\nI went at 12:30pm - got food and a table right away. I got the bean and cheese burrito with a side of guacamole. Everything was excellent and fresh. But the highlight, as mentioned, were the tortillas. They appeared to be homemade. And they were incredible.\n\nThe menu is limited, but also cheap. So I don't really see room for complaints there. The house the restaurant lives in is cute and cozy feeling.\n\nI liked this place even more when I learned that America was the name of the owner and not some cheesy restaurant title."
4,"WOW, times must be truly hard if they aren't able to fill a Cirque du Soleil stadium on a Saturday night in the prime section. We went last minute because the young man wanted to watch it again and boy I must say, I thoroughly enjoyed it even the 2nd time round. We had prime front center seats and this time I noticed things I hadn't noticed the first time around."
4,One of the few choices that you have at the Waverley Train Station  for food before you board the train your destination.\n\nThere are always plenty of sandwiches and salad bowls but later on at night a lot of the shelves are empty with not many staff to fill them.\n\nThe store is rather on the small side and makes it feel cramped.
4,"Uh oh, what do we have here?  Another contender in the commercial center district looking to claim the prize of best Thai food in Vegas.  Everyone knows about the other contender.  What I was not aware of, prior to this visit for a mid day impromptu lunch redemption, was that Komol lays out some seriously good Thai food.  \n\nSo here I was, far from my comfort zone again trying new and exciting entrees that I would have never even thought of trying before. My arm was twisted twice this day...once to go here in the first place (glad I did) and the second was to try a dish with tofu.  What?!!? No meat!  I now know what the big to do is all about.  The meal went like this...Fresh spring rolls that were delicious and unlike others I've had, not greasy.  Pad kee mow with tofu, spicy level 3 since I'm a baby.  This dish was quite tasty...at first I skirted around the tofu; then I believe I compromised it all and refused to share it.  The final dish was Panang curry with chicken; finally the meat makes its presence known...level 3 again.  \n\nSorry to all experienced Thai foodies, my pallet cannot yet handle the crazy spiciness; with time I will slowly increase this to a 10 and just know that over the next few visits I will be updating this review to a 5.  Thanks for a great meal."
4,"Ive been hear twice now. Once on 4/20 2013 and 1/10/14 both good times. Its Downtown so what do you expect, its not the strip so nice jeans and shirt works. Now on 4/20 day this place was so packed, there was a line to get to the roof top and the place was just to packed. All of Vegas was packed so we got used to it. Dancing was a minimum just to packed. Now on 1/10/14 the place was busy but at least we were able to dance and enjoy the night on top of the roof with a beer in my hand. Drinks a little pricey with a beer and cosmo for 17 bucks. Bartenders drinks, my GF liked, so they knew how to make drinks. Both times we were there we had no issues, good atmosphere so we will be back."
4,This is my second time here. I like the way they team up on my car if they have extra hands available and get it done fast. And they do a good job. I just got my car painted so I don't want the high pressure hoses used on it. They gladly accommodate by using the regular hose. They offered to bundle and save me money when I asked for a detail on the inside.
4,"The beau and I stopped by on a whim whilest exploring our new city and it's probably the best find so far. \n\nWalking in for a late dinner we were happily greeted and easily seated. Service was prompt and pleasant. We ordered some garlic naan, chicken tikka masala and chicken vidaloo. All came out within 10 minutes and boy was it amazing! The tikka masala was creamy and fresh. My beau ordered his vidaloo spicy, and it was the perfect amount of spicy.  We've been back at least 8x since and always end up happily full. (ITIS!)\n\nI can't wait to try the lunch buffet!"
4,"Food is excellent!  Go here for the food and not the location.  I am not a fan of the small quarters or the regular crowd here.  I just want to be clear the atmosphere is not what I go here for.  I only go here for the excellent, Scottsdale culinary chefs and great prices.  If I need a Scottsdale dish without the commute I go here.\nI would give it 5 stars, but the location and size are a distraction."
4,"If you are serious about looking like a pimp, this is absolutely your destination.  There are a mix of consignment items and new pimp-gear.  I drooled over the three ties painted with Vargas girls ($100 each).  Oddly, almost everything I looked at was priced at $85.  The woman working there did not get off the phone or offer to help me the entire time I was there."
4,"I like perusing this place! They have many colorful decor items, including furniture, sculptures, furniture, fabric, bobbing turtles...the list continues. I bought some decorative tiles on here for $1 each. These are unique and cheap gifts, a good place to go if you want to give someone an \""Arizona\"" present."
4,"Came on a Saturday morning at 9:30am and we were seated immediately, service was very nice.  I greatly enjoyed my Brunch Des Cantons, perfectly cooked beans and various pork.  My fiance liked her Brunch Sucre, but wasn't blown away by it.  Solid Coffee and OJ included with brunch.  All in all a very pleasant experience."
4,"Stayed here September of 07'.  Twice.  WTH?!?\n\nYeah some allergic reaction mixed with something viral; made my throat close up and could barely breathe; nearly passed out.\n\nLong story short; the nurses are zero supreme (Number 1) and my private room was bangin'!\n\nThey actually listened to me when I told them I have \""hidden veins\"" and a butterfly needle would suit me.\n\nMy beau, parents and daughter all came to visit and also were pleased at my accommodations.  \n\nGod forbid something else unfortunate should happen to me, but if it does, Meriter is my hospital.\n\nThanks!"
4,"Nice to see that Panera is the same here in Madison WI. Good quality food, very nice employees. This is a fairly busy location but they move people through rather quickly."
4,"Well for gourmet burgers it was ok. The server Dominic was pretty awesome. The establishment is clean, friendly, and family oriented. I know this review is coming a few months late but I honestly have nothing memorable about the food except for the bottomless fries and I do remember the burger I ordered was a bit dry and thinking if I come back here I'm never ordering THAT again. Wish I could remember what it was called...That was a plus. I will come by again if I'm in the area...have to give the place a second try. :)"
4,"The first time i had Burrito Boyz, I was at a meeting where the food was catered. I had no idea where my mystery burrito fell from. \n\nMy first impression? It was the best burrito I've ever had. Brain: \""Wow there like avocado in here too\"". What else can i say? They put everything you could possible want (and things you didn't know you wanted) in your burrito. \n\nI've been to the Toronto location a few times the food tastes the same. The quality, service, and price at this location however is not up to par.\n\nBut whatever, you came for the burrito."
4,Hubby and I went here on a date night. Sushi was yummy and so were the drinks. We went on a busy Sat. evening and there was a DJ so it was a little loud not overbearing though. Makes for good people watching. Our waitress was sweet and knowledgeable about the menu. We'll definately revisit this one.
4,"I went here for lunch with my bf. If you bike here or walk, they give a 20% discount or something. Check in on foursquare and use your amex card for 5$ off.\n\n It was a casual afternoon. I had the trout and he had the happy hour fish and chips. Our food was delicious. I think the only thing I had a bit of complaint was I felt a bit rushed. However, the food and drinks are amazing. The fish and chips were fresh and so crispy. The trout dish had green beans and peanuts. I ordered mash as a side too. Fish was seasoned perfectly and green beans were crunchy not soggy. \n\n Overall,  I had a great experience and will return!"
4,What a lovely experience we had. I'm kind of picky with my taste on wine by that was no challenge for this place. When I wasn't fully satisfied I had a new suggestion and it was perfect!! The lobster was to die for and the crab legs are always and always will be my favorite. They even let me custom my own fav dessert. What's yours? Ask them I'm sure they will assist you! \n\nOh ya.. Be sure to request siting outside when you make your reservation. The lake and light show is a trip! :)
4,"Toast is an excellent place for a weekend breakfast out. The service is very efficient and all the wait staff seems to work as a team (anyone will refill your coffee or fill any immediate need you may have). Prices are very reasonable and the food is above average, By that I mean their eggs, coffee, corn bread, fruit, etc. are all better than what you would expect from a popular price restaurant - most breakfast entries were $8 and under- but the fruit salad was as good as you have at home, if you had a well stocked kitchen. The place is perfect for young families as service is fast and prices are very moderate. Not only will your children like it but you can bring the grandparents as they will be the only ones who will recognize the music playing. \nIf you find their food is not up to your very high standards then breakfast at The Gallery or Cafe Monte or Zebras and pay two times Toast's prices; for me Toast hits the sweet spot between quality and price,"
4,"Pleasantly surprised...thought this was just another delicatessen, but this place had a really extensive menu offering something for everyone.  I just stopped in for a snack, but would like to go back and eat a full meal."
4,"If you strictly  Love Hip Hop and R/B this is you place\n\nGreat place to eat and party, I ate there once on my second time in Vegas I had the fire pit. which is $50 which is steep but worth it. Little that I know Rum Jungle turn into a club after the restaurant shuts down  so my  party stayed instead of going to another venue  and It was live this was in 2005. As I revisit there last November of 2009 It did not let me down Hip Hop and R/B all night Best spot If you like those Genres drink price's was Vegas but I must of been tipping the Bartender good because I got Bay Area  prices for two consecutive nights with the same bartender. So my verdict great atmosphere ,strong drinks,All different type's of rum Hip hop and R/B strictly man I have a hard time going to other club's while in Vegas after experiencing the Rum Jungle."
4,Prices are good and portions are great. I almost couldn't finish all my food. I've been here for breakfast and dinner and was satisfied with both my visits! The staff was very friendly and you don't have to wait very long for your food. Will most likely return in the future.
4,"Looks can be deceiving!  \n\nWe have passed by this place dozens of times and never thought it was much more than what it looked like from the outside, just another bar in a strip mall.  How wrong we were!  Last night we wanted to go out and have some good Wisconsin 'pub' food, but wanted to try someplace different.  After looking through reviews of numerous places on this site and others, I decided to give this place a try.  My family was a little skeptical at first, but once we entered fears began to ease.  The size, layout, decor and most importantly the food were all top notch for a pub.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was picayune, but important to me.  Last night was Friday which means Fish Fry in Wisconsin.  Of course this meant I had to partake in the all you can eat version of it!  While the initial plate was plentiful and reasonably prepared, it took FOREVER to arrive and no one ever asked if I wanted more.  I'm sure this was probably due to them being packed, but even so it did detract a little for me from my overall take on the place.  That being said, we are eagerly awaiting our next visit there!"
4,"The parking and long wait, mentioned by many, is worth your time if you love Texas style BBQ. The resemblance to Franklin BBQ in Austin is uncanny in quality and concept. Only suckers show up at the longest line at 11:00am, come after the rush at 1:30pm to wait in a shorter line."
4,"I wish we would have spent more time on fremont street when we came to Vegas.  I felt a lot more comfortable here then on the strip.  Its an interesting mix of street performers, historical sites, and new technology.  Its a little seedy, but the strip has a little seedy too.  We took public transportation there and while cheaper, it took forever.  We took a cab back and it was a much more enjoyable experience.  \n\nI liked the vibe of the restaurants and bars here.  Everything is more affordable.  Things are less opulent and less clean, but a lot more comfortable.  I like the throw back vibe to everything, it felt like stepping back in time.  Nobody here takes themselves too seriously as it is Vegas after all.  I really liked the restaurants and bar here, there are some very nice restaurants, but again cheaper then the strip and with a more historical ambiance.  The video screen is very cool too!"
4,"Very clean. Fair price for the quality food and ingredients. Simple menu. Good cheesesteaks and fries. Be aware of the cheese fries as they use real thick cheese :). It may be a little overwhelming. Overall, very good restaurant. We will return."
4,"I love the furniture here! We went in looking for a coffee table and a large ottoman.  Pricey but all of the pieces are unique. Place was not busy and sales people did not circle you like road kill. They also didnt say hello, so I took a star. We were able to browse through and didnt have any questions so it didn't bother me that they didnt greet us. Large and small pieces to go in any room. Looked like they had a design center. Didn't find the perfect piece today."
4,"Came here with an Australian friend I ran into, we wanted to do the whole American diner thing, and boy was it fun.\n\nVery warm welcome for us, as a Brit & an Aussie we instantly hit it off with the staff and had a laugh.\n\nFood was superb, I LOVED the chilli cheese fries, very hard to find over here and actually enjoy. Had the Chicken Philly cheese steak and it was great, really well prepared and quickly delivered. Prices were fantastic and service efficient and friendly. I'd love to come again for lunch."
4,"A small legit Irish bar, with wood paneling throughout the interior makes for an intimate neighborhood feel. Monterey pub is a great place to spend a late weekend afternoon or wolf down comfort food with friends. A perfect place to stop by after a visit to the museums in the North End, as well.  The pints are well-poured and the drinks are good and cheap. The food is super-hearty. All of the beef seems to be marinated in Guinness (which is excellent). Try the boxty's if you're feeling adventurous.\n\nThis may be obvious, but if you're looking for the pub, it's on Monterey street (look for the YMCA at the end)."
4,"Best cheese curds of my life. Same goes for beer cheese soup. Basically, if you're into cheese, run don't walk to this restaurant.\n\nThings to note:\n-Fairly large portion sizes, so keep that in mind when you order. \n-Cheese curds\n-They have gluten-free bread, and 3 choices of it at that!\n-Prices are amazing. We had a FILLING meal for 4 people for under 70 bucks.\n-Did I mention cheese curds?"
4,"Even though they have one at the Beverly Center in California, I've eaten here the last two times i've been to Vegas. I think if you're looking for a nice, decent, comfortable, affordable place to eat after you've spent a good amount of money gambling, this is the place. The portions are huge and we all couldnt finish all our food! I had the salmon thats prepared three different ways and I LOVED IT! We also ordered the beignets(sp?) for dessert and it was waay better than the ones at Disneyland. I highly recommend this place if you dont feel like eating at any of the other high end restaurants in Vegas. The only thing is that our server messed up on our bill by charging us twice for gratuity or something (my friend figured it out, I wasnt paying attention) and he barely came back to check on us or refill our drinks. We also ate here on a Sunday night around 10 so it wasnt too busy."
4,"I wanted to give their coffee a shout out.  I received two cups of coffee today from a student of mine unexpectedly.  Once was Creme Brulee and the other was Sugar N Spice.  He said to try one or both and spread the love about them.  I gave the other cup to my co-worker and they enjoyed it!  I don't live in that part of town, but thought this was the least I could do.  I'm a big supporter of buying local and spending local.  Tasty coffee with a twist! Hopefully one day I will be in that part of town and will drop by!"
4,"I LOVE this place!!!  Discovered it by accident, but I'm no stranger now,.  My husband nevery tried anything like this before, but he took advantage of their special last Valentines Day for a couple, and now he goes with me every time.  We both feel so great after our session,.  The cost is really teriffic at $30 for an hour, and their massages are wonderful.  We didn't have anything like this in my former home of Yakima, WA!    Kathy"
4,"I have been wanting to try this place for a while now and recenlty had the opportunity. A few of my coworkers and I were at a training in Phoenix and desiring a spot for lunch.  A quick click of my GPS for local restaurants and Chino Bandino populated my screen. I shared the philosophy with my coworkers, my desire to try this place and they were game.\n\nIt was lunch time and busy when we arrived. We were a little confused as the place was crowded with people. One of the employees came over and inquired if he could help us and we explained that we were first timers. He took us to a side bar and gave all four of us samples of the Jade Chicken, the Carnitas, black beans, fried rice and a few others all of which were delicious. We excitedly ordered and sat down for our feast. Suffice to say we were stuffed when we returned to our training. Around 3pm the Snickerdoodle came in handy for our late day snack. Each of us enjoyed this outing and we shall return."
4,"Viv B. is a fun boutique with a sophisticated but youthful aesthetic. I'm a real fan of their jewelry and art pieces, as well as their scent items, and though their clothing selection is small, it's very sharply curated. The owner named the shop after her grandmother, whose portrait presides over the shop like some kind of stylish saint."
4,"(New patient)Got here at 545, waited til 6 when they opened. Got put into a room right away, waited 20ish mins to see the vet. Told her the issue, she took her back for a full exam. Exam costs $42 (she's a chihuahua so it might vary by size). Clipped her nails (I'm a horrible parent, they were very long, $10).\nShe ended up needing a ton more done (xrays, blood tests, went home w/2 meds) bill was $700 and no diagnosis.. no broken paw or anything abnormal in tests, she's just in horrible pain and can barely use her left front paw/leg.Sent home with pain meds and anti inflammatory. Back a month later for same thing. Super nice doctors, staff can seem a bit in a hurry/rushed/not concerned. but all in all good =] we're back a few times a month for nail clipping"
4,"This place is fun and the food is delicious, great service and location! Try it before or after catching a movie!"
4,"Wow this is a really nice place. I've never visited this cinema before, but I was surprised. The restrooms are clean and modern, the theatre is a great size and they have a great selection at the snack bar. I will go back to this theatre for sure."
4,"First, let me say that this is a very good restaurant! Food was tasty and flavorful. However, our only concern is the price you pay for what you get. Let me offer a comparison with the Harvest Moon Grille. Appetizers at Halcyon were excellent in flavor, but $14??? THAT is an expensive app. I had the Ribeye Spackle, which was the outer rim of the Ribeye, folded and stuffed with veggies and cheese. Very good, but waiter asked how I wanted it cooked, and I said \""however the chef recommends.\"" I wasn't expecting medium well/well done! I don't know, maybe it was an abberation. Again, flavors were there but execution was not quite what I expected. Desserts were good, but awfully expensive for what you got. Over $20? \n\nFor those who love this place, I highly suggest you compare this against Harvest Moon Grille, which I believe is a better restaurant and a place where you get more for your money. And it's virtually right across from the Blumenthal Theatre."
4,"After hearing several people Rave about Pho Kim Long, I decided to check it out; and I can say I was not disappointed.\n\nThe place is fairly big and we were seated immediatley (there can be a wait but they burn and turn pretty fast). The staff was attentive and we had several people swing by the table to make sure we were doing OK.\n\nThe menu is impressive, I was just expecting your average Pho place, but they menu covers much more, apps, Pho, entrees, smoothies, and much much more.\n\nI decided on the #11 Rare Steak and Brisket Pho. I also got an order of the Chinese Doughnuts to start.\n\nMy only complaint is that the doughnuts were plain, when I usually order them they're covered in sugar, but a little quick thinking and I was using the remaining Peanut Sauce from my companion's spring rolls for a great dish.\n\nThe Food came out insanely fast, the apps were good, but the Pho stole the show. The Steak and Brisket were both tender and delicious. The noodles were plentiful, and the broth was rich.\n\nI will be going back without a doubt!"
4,"True to the City of Sin ... this airport is dirty and seedy ... Love it!\n\nGot through security pretty quick ... nothing out of the ordinary.  I don't know what people expect from airport security personnel ... they hear people bitch & moan all day long ... so it's expected that they'd be pissed off all the time, too.  Grab your crap and move on ... cause it just doesn't matter in the grand scheme of life!!!"
4,"Been here twice now. Excellent service each time.\nAlso this is a great hotel for a convention since\nthat is what I came for. Very spacious convention\narea. The room I had was very luxurious and very\nrelaxing after a day of training, schmoozing, and\ncocktails. It's the type of room you can always\ncompletely relax in - so much space. Can't really\ncomment on the price as I wasn't paying - but a\nbig thank you to my employer for footing the bill.\nWould definitely do it all over again. Love the \nwhole Venice theme. I like the casino here and the\nrestaurants as well. This is also just the right\npart of the Strip to be in. Viva Las Vegas!"
4,"very solid. great cocktails, especially if you like tequila (i do). tasty nuevo latino treats. duck empenadas (if i remember right) were ridiculously good. casual but upscale, with attentive bar service. fun."
4,Overall i thought that this buffet was one of the best buffets that i have ever been to. They had many different variety of meats such as lamb and primb rib (which were cooked really well). I am usually very picky with slider but the one at this buffet was amazing. The ramen was decent and so were the crab legs. This buffet had a giant variety of many different types of food and they all hit a good level of satisfaction. Not a big fan of buffets but this one is an exception for me.
4,Great work day gym to hit during lunch.  Just wish they would stop playing teeny bopper estrogen music in the men's locker room. ... Damn!!!
4,"My go to cheap Chinese lunch spot on Harris Blvd.  The price is right.\n\nIts a great cheap lunch special($5-6 with eggroll) but sometimes the free tea tastes a little funky, so I don't drink it a lot of the time.  The chicken is real meat, the sauces aren't too salty and, there plenty of veggies with every dish.\n\nThat said, don't expect to be wowed by some 100% traditional Cantonese or Szechuan food.  This is Americanized Chinese and it gets the 4 stars because of food per $."
4,"This is a cool bar. It's relatively small inside, but it's a cool environment and there's a variety of places to sit - high top tables, bar seating, cushy chairs and couches, etc. \n\nI can only speak for the beverage selection, and it's pretty solid. Typical impressive beer selection evident in most Madison bars and decent drinks. I've heard great things about the food, especially the sandwiches and wraps... looking forward to eating here sometime soon!"
4,"Came here for the first time and loved it! For a lunch price of around $9, it was definitely worth it. Downsides include the semi-long wait and the crowded walkways with kids frantically running around. But hey, it adds to the buffet environment! With a chocolate fountain bar and a cotton candy machine, I would recommend anyone with a sweet tooth to stop by. Not to mention, there was a variety of food. Nothing fancy but nothing nasty either. For the price, why not give it a try?"
4,"Good find in the North! \n\nFried Chicken - best tasting fried chicken I've ever had! Nice size portion for 2.\n\nCatfish - very good, just wish they gave a little more.\n\nBurgers - ok. tasted like a regular ol' hamburger to me. Which brings me to my next question, why is it called Hamburger Hut when they're burgers are mediocre as hell? Haha\n\nIt's a convenient store/restaurant. But more of a restaurant. It seems busy all the time and I hear people always ordering the fried chicken.  That's all imma get here too. \n\nParking is limited. Like, only 7 spaces limited."
4,"Darren it cracked me up to see you reviewed this Eat'n Park, but then I wasn't surprised a bit. I used to live blocks away from this place, and the location was ideal, for my favorite bar ever (Wilkie's Inn, now closed) was diagonally across the street from it. I actually have mostly bad memories of drunken friends fighting and/or confrontations here, but still this place beats all after a night at the bar. I can close my eyes and picture scrambled eggs and french toast, not to mention their delicious burgers with a side of pickles. And of course the obligatory Eat'n Park smiley face cookies, ah how I love them! Message to non-Pittsburghers, go to this (or any) Eat'n Park at least once! You'll be back!"
4,"Fun hotel that has a great theme park on the top of the building! LOVED IT!\n\nMy family got a room for a great deal (under $100) It was fairly family-friendly with all the amenities it offered. It wasn't a five star hotel by any means, but its was nice! There were places to eat and also a topless pool at the top! (well, when I was there) \n\nThe swimming pool was nice because you could play water volleyball and it was so high up. Seeing the amusement park ride on the top of the building is pretty neat.  As a guest at the hotel, you get to go up to that area for FREE!  The location is great because you're close to the Las Vegas Strip."
4,"This is a nice clean place. I always look for places I can take both family and friends and this once fits the bill. Surprisingly the pizza is really good! Not spinatos or grimaldi's quality but best of the bar food I've had. Thin crust and they have ground hamburger as a topping, yummy! They also have a lot of games, pools tables, shuffle board and TONS of tvs.  Besides the pizza, I'm a fan of the focaccias. Good place to come during a weekend for sports games."
4,"Took a ipad 2 from work here for repair, ipad was repaired in the same day about 6hrs. Needed a new glass and cost about $129 plus tax. Overall happy w the service and repair they do give a 90 day warranty which is nice. Wish it was a little more professional but overall they did the job i needed. The shop is right off Mill ave so you can park in the meter and run in and drop off and pick up"
4,"If you have been to some of the Asian buffets in AZ, and you've liked them, I'd say you must try Jasmine Tokyo. \n\nI'm 6'4\"" and I get \""Do you play for the Cardinals?\"" a lot, so I'm sure that when the proprietors see me darken the door of their establishment they're all like \""ohsh*t.\"" Fear not, lil Asian lady, for I am not a glutton. I'm here for the seafood and the sushi and some green tea.\n\nAs far as the sushi selection goes, it beats anything AYCE in the Valley that I've seen. There were at least 20 types of rolls and it wasn't just surimi crab and tempura, either. The tuna and salmon and snapper nigiri were really good, too.\n\nIf you have room for some fried rice, this one is delicious and so are the Chinese sausages and grilled chicken. Even the raw oysters were good, and that has never happened to me in AZ before.\n\nService was pleasant, and from the way it's decorated, I'm guessing this was once a Claim Jumper. Anyhow, it's a huge restaurant with a huge selection of items and if you're a vegetarian, you will be in heaven here with more vegetarian offerings than I've ever seen at a buffet. \n\nSeaweed is a vegetable, isn't it?"
4,"ah, Bouchon.  So many people talk about this place but I had never been.  First, it's in a ridiculous location as others have noted.  Everyone else's reviews are very poor in their direction.  I think someone said that it's in the southwest area of the Venetian.  Ok. Who the F**k  has a compass in the F**king casino???    It's by the registration lobby.  That simple.  Take the elevators up and you are there.\n\nThere was a small wait for the brunch.  The brunch menu is basically the same as the breakfast (with a few additions).  So. . . .\n\nChicken and Waffles.  - Glorious.  The waffles have bits of bacon in them and they are amazing.  The Chicken is roasted and not fried.  I have to think that it is better this way because I can't imagine this dish being beat by any restaurant.  You must get this.\n\nFrench Toast - Looks great but it's not that impressive.  You should try something else.  \n\nAmbiance - I think the restaurant loses a star here.  The decor is dated and the tables too crowded.  There were a couple of single old men sitting by themselves on the small tables and whenever they coughed, I cringed.  Who knows what germs they caught from their respective escorts last night?  \n\nI still highly recommend, even just for the chicken and waffles."
4,"Best coffee in the area! I had their red velvet latte today and nothing else even compares. Friendly employees and cozy atmosphere inside too! My only complaint is it's a little pricey. I'm also a little surprised they don't have any high chairs, but overall I'm happy to give them my business and I will definitely be back!"
4,"Organized a business breakfast here and was impressed by how attentive and efficient the service was. We were seated at a great table facing the windows. I really liked the little chair they offered for purses, too cute.\n\nI had the duck hash & eggs which was delicious, although the pancakes looked great too. Tableau is perfectly classy and elegant, yet casual at the same time."
4,"Was staying at NY NY while in Vegas and what can I say about the hotel but that it looks like they built a mini city inside the hotel.  \n\nIt's one of the bigger casino's in vegas with plenty of tables and slot machines.  Probably one of the advantages of NYNY is the food options.  You can get something reasonably price here (like under $10) or you can go to one of their high end restaurants for a night out.\n\nI stayed in the Century Tower and I believe it was like the 32nd floor.  Of all the places I've been to in Las Vegas, this room had the best view.  We had a great view of the strip and the mountains and the strip looked great all lit up at night.\n\nBesides the view, the room was nice.  Had plenty of room for 3 guys without being in each others way.  Things are a little dated in the room so no flat screen TV and some of the stuff here while in good condition was old.  The sinks were in a separate room from the toilet and shower which is always nice.  The shower was definitely high end and hot water was there quickly.\n\nOverall, was impressed with my stay here at NYNY especially with the view in the upper levels of the Century Tower and would recommend it to anyone."
4,"Never had a bad eating experience at Cheba Hut! The food is Delicious, and the subs are TOASTED... Yummm!!! a must-try if you are new to Mesa or if you've just never been to Cheba Hut before!"
4,"first spot me and my gf decided to go when we arrived in vegas.  i was really dressed down, as a matter of fact the only person in the place dressed down.  But still, did the hostess have to look at me like i was a scrub?  cmon, you're a hostess in vegas, probably hoping some rich guy knocks you up.  anyways, the place was crackin, like most spots in vegas.  very nice, upscale place.  the food was great, the best salmon sashimi ive ever had.  i couldnt stop thinking about it 2 days later.  they set a new standard for myself when it comes to salmon.  id also reccomend the baked lobster.  prices are really steep, so if your taking someone here, i hope you get some action afterwards.  minus the snobby hostess, and i would have gave this place 5 stars."
4,"Strictly speaking of the food in the cafe....  The blueplate specials for $8 bucks are great!!!  They come with the soup and salad bar too, and it is a great salad bar (remember this is not the Wynn, but a locals' hole in the wall casino with old carpet).  I make a meal from the soup (2 types daily) and salad bar (with fresh fruit for dessert), and then take the entree home for a later snack.  Do not expect trendy, expect a great value for price paid and a friendly staff.   Dessert specials every month for $2."
4,"Food was great but service was a little strange. You don't order your food from the sushi chef you have to order from the waitress. Also we ordered 3 rolls and some sushi, you would think the sushi comes out first? But they brought out all the rolls and forgot about the sushi until we mentioned we never got it. Overall they're fish quality was great, everything tasted fresh and not fishy :) will be back and they're AYCE is a great deal with a lot of selection :)"
4,"When it's free, everything seems that much better. We got in on one of the LMFAO nights and it was awesome. What a way to end your vegas trip. I like the unique feel of each room, especially the library where you're not bumping elbows to get a drink. I still prefer the layout of XS, but it's always cool to see the designers of these super clubs push the boundaries of creativity and above all else, giving people a great party atmosphere."
4,"If you need a seafood fix then you need to check out Boardwalk Billy's. My favorite menu item is the steampot; the broth is delicious and I get extra shrimp instead of oysters. The meal is HUGE and comes with potatoes and corn. I also tried the clam chowder and it is wonderful! We go on Thursday nights when there is trivia and 2 dollar drinks. Even the best, local drafts are only 2 bucks! We frequent the Galleria location and the service is prompt and friendly. I knocked off 1 star because their burgers are AWFUL. Stick with the seafood and wings and you will not be disappointed!"
4,"Tasty food and friendly staff. Been coming here a few years. The prices have risen lately, but still within my budget for Indian food."
4,"We found this little hole in the wall by accident. We were in the area looking for something to eat and saw the sign Chicago Gyros. It is a small restaurant that is family run. I had my standard order of a Gyro and fries. The gyro was delicious. It was overstuffed with meat and fillings. They generally don't fill me up but this one did. The fries were your standard fast food type of fries, they were hot and they were crispy. I don't go for gyros worrying about the fries. The owner and I believe his daughter were very friendly and helpful with the orders. The food was served quickly and was the right temperature. I enjoy dealing with locally owned places and this is one I will be returning to."
4,"I was surprised by the generous portions of lettuce with that came with my order of spring rolls.  Attentive and quick service.  Never had a problem flagging down one of the 4 servers on duty.  An all around good experience.  The first pho I've had in Vegas.  While not the best broth I've ever tasted, it wasn't disappointing."
4,"I use to be a regular at this place when it was a Starbucks. To see it reopened as a bakery had my curiousity running wild. I tried to visit this place numerous times, but they have strange hours. They are closed certain days, and then open at noon on certain days. I'd call first, regardless of what yelp says before taking a drive here. \nWe went in on my nieces birthday. As soon as I seen \""stuffed cookies\"" I was SOLD! \nThen to find out they are stuffed with things like oreos and cheesecake, snickers, and butterscotch. OMG HEAVEN!! \nThey also had a huge selection of cake pops. Cool unique flavors like Nerds Rainbow, orange cream, cheesecake, and red velvet. \nThere were a few carmel and candy apples, as well as HUGE chocolate dipped marshmallows.  The service was good and so were the prices. \nMy only complaint was their odd schedule. Can't wait to return!"
4,"I know this is a chain, and I normally abhor and avoid chains, but I really liked this place.  The beer was excellent, the servers were very polite and attentive (Everybody speaks English) and the food was way above average.  First time we went I had a flammekuchen with Gruyere and smoked meat with a slice of dill pickle on every quarter.  Excellent!  My wife had the vegetable version which was great as well.  Second visit I had a meat dish with ham, pork knuckle, sausage and an excellent sauerkraut.  Very, very good.  We had a great time watching the Canadiens at the bar after the meal.  Overall I would highly recommend this place, at least one visit to sample their beers which are a cut above your average brew pub."
4,"Low key atmosphere, on Mondays they have $5 burgers when you buy a $3 beer, great deal and great food."
4,"I'm not really masterfully adept at recognising a good Indian: my weak British mouth can't handle the chilli and often leaves an unshakeable burning sensation for the rest my meal, ultimately ensuring I can't make head or foot of what I'm eating.\n\nDeciding to man up and re-kindle my Indian food knowledge I opted for the BBC's kashmiri curry with a liberal dose of Cobra beer.  Much to my surprise I found I could recognise each flavour rather than  sweating the spices away and subsequently had an enjoyable meal.\n\nReasonably priced and with a cool name, I'll be back again."
4,Good sashimi and plenty of rolls with spice.  I've a big fan of rolls with heat and Sushi Fever has a solid selection that feature some sort of tuna/salmon combo.\n\nSat in the room to the left after you enter which featured a massive HD TV.  Comes in handy if you are like me and enjoy a distraction besides porcelain cats and other Japanese decor.
4,Aaron you have awesome customer service skills and also to the brunette bar tender!  You guys are awesome although the nacho's was a feat that crushed my confidence because of the large portion i will be sure to bring backup next time. Made a few friends too gregg and mariam from cali and mark from nm! Hope you see this hit this place up with a good review!
4,"Yummo!\n\nVery good authentic Cuban sandwiches and pastries.  Fantastic breakfast and really liked that the omelet was not greasy.  It was so tasty, filling, and budget friendly as well.  \n\nIt's hard to find Ironbeer and Materva unless you're at a Cuban place and it was so exciting to get some. Om nom nom.\n\nSince we were driving back to LA we picked up some great pastries for the ride home.  \n\nThey do compare themselves to Portos (they even have a sign out front that says it), however they are not Portos.  Don't expect the crazy lines (yay).  The selection of pastries is not as large but they are just as good!"
4,"I've lived here for 3 years and continue to call this my home.  Yes, there are noise issues, a less than ideal parking situation on some nights, and higher rent ...BUT, the reason I continue to call this place home is because it is so inspiring, rich and pleasing to the eyes to view and is straight up BEAUTIFUL!  I have met many good friends from this complex and expanded my contact list and network by living here.  I gave this review 4 stars because even though Optima is a beautiful place to live, there are a few things that make it just under 5 STAR.  Having said that, if you are looking to rent or purchase a condo or APT then this is the first place you better check out.  Everyone must live here for at least a year to understand the true beauty of the Optima.  I'm very excited and looking forward to the new Optima Sonoran Village to be completed, it's a similar complex that will be on the other side of Fashion Sqr mall."
4,"I attended a meeting at Caesars in May.  I had been to Caesars many, many times, but have never stayed at the hotel.  They put us up in the Octavius Tower...very nice!  Big rooms, comfy beds, nice bathrooms and great views!"
4,"Only been one time, but it's safe to say I had an above average experience! I ordered the half pound Jalape\u00f1o Jack burger with a side of onion rings. The burger entailed a perfect spice, high quality meat (from Midwestern meats), and flavorful cheese. The onion rings were really great too! Decent portions here, I was definitely full. \nMy only problem is that my bill was $11 and change. A bit pricey for a no frills in and out styled place that caters to those who need a quick bite to eat after work or another event. I didn't even order a drink, mind you. Regardless it's but a minor set back in what was a really solid burger! I'd recommend it to others."
4,"This place reminds me a little like the Italian restaurant, Pompeii, in Chicago where my roommate and I ordered food from there quite a bit. We ordered carry out from here. I wonder since I was visiting her here in Phoenix, she thought about getting us food from this place. I did deviate from what we typically order and got the Salami, Turkey, Ham and Mozzarella panini. It had a red wine vinaigrette that made it taste really good. The ingredients appear to be fresh and well packaged. The prices seemed average to me from Chicago standards, but unsure if it's pricey for the area here. I wouldn't mind trying out some other items here."
4,"Great build your own burgers, crazy servings of fries. Always hot and fresh and cooked and topped to your order."
4,"I won't lie, I've been here once or twice.  Not on par with Canadian clubs but much better than the other clubs in the valley."
4,"This place has one of my all-time FAVORITE Asian dishes - the Thai Spicy Noodles. Yeah, generic sounding as heck but it's really thin noodles with woked chicken & shrimp, scallions, egg, cabbage and I can't remember what else, with Thai spice. Squeeze a huge wedge of lemon over it and I'm in heaven. One order is enough to feed me, my hubby and our teen daughter, but we usually get two... it's sooo tasty when it's cold. Breakfast of champions. Their honey chicken is really good, in fact I can't think of any dish that we have not liked. Their appetizers are yummy, and they do both spring and egg rolls. That's handy for a family of mixed disciples. :) \n\nThe service is always very smiley and friendly, and there's never been a wait. Totally good Asian food for a very decent price, in a clean restaurant. What more could you want??"
4,"Hyde lives up by its name, nice Hyde out if you want to be intimate \nwith your date, but be careful you might get distracted with gorgeous \nmodel looking wait stuff. Food or should say appetizers were really \ndelicious, one of the best calamari in Vegas, so crispy that it almost \nexplode in your mouth and well seasoned, Wines are on the high side\nbut of good quality. Soda warning price $6 per order, no free refill highest\nsoda price, I ever paid in Vegas."
4,Wow... Huge... I don't even think i've seen every corner of this place... \n\nSeveral stages...\n\nUpstairs rooms...\n\nGirls are super nice... but... maybe cuz i'm a girl... actually... no... it's cuz they're strippers...\n\nStrippers are nice... and they smell nice...
4,"I just stayed two nights at Aria. It is a great hotel...my company paid for it, which is great because I would never spend that kind of money...and the rooms aren't even the worse of it!! ONE drink at the pool will set you back a hefty sum...which I can't repeat here...just know, it's probably the most expensive on the strip.\nWe didn't get the chocolates or a turn down service that some other reviewers have mentioned, that's ok..most everything was wonderful.  I was dismayed a bit  at the bath products...a lower end brand, and of definitely lower end quality. \nThe restaurants were all really good that we ate at...the Thai place was as good, if not better, than any I've been to in the US.  The casino was nice, not too smokey, and the servers were pretty quick. \nThe pool was nice, a few good choices...one that was more adult orientated, so not a bunch of kids having a great time...not something I look for in a relaxing pool day. As usual...I always wish there was more shade and/or umbrellas..but all in all..a great pool experience. \nAll in all, a great place, although pricey..that's expected."
4,"This being one of the new hotels on the strip of Las Vegas, it has a modern theme to it. \n\nPROS -\n+ a chill, classy, relaxing resort.\n+ clean pool, clean rooms, clean hallways, clean everything.\n+ The rooms are extremely modern, with an electric mini-stove, refridgerator, microwave, dinner table, super soft bed, etc.\n+Extremly friendly staffs\n\n\nCONS -\n- This wasn't the ideal place to stay when you're in Vegas celebrating your 21st with your girls. (IE - little black dresses + alcohol + stumbling to the room = hard stares)"
4,"food wise it would be a 2.5 - 3 at the most, but the place and the coffee made it up for the 4th star.\n\nLet me start with the food. If you've never eaten authentic Spanish dishes, you'll be pleased. Otherwise you'll be disappointed. \n\nThe olives were good. \n\nThe shrimp dish (gambas al pil pil) was also decent.\n\nThe traditional paella was good but more a risotto than a paella. Too creamy, different kind of rice (at least the texture is different) but the saffron hint and the chorizo were tasteful.\n\nThe tortilla was ok. A little burn and dry but pretty decent.\n\nThe wine selection is limited and most of the wines are NOT Spanish, AYFKM? They had one Rivera del Duero and one Rioja. Come on, you have a Spanish themed place and no Spanish wine?\n\nNow the coffee. I tried the cold brew and the kopi luwak. Both pretty good. The coffee paraphernalia is also worth the visit! If you are caffeine sensitive, this might not be for you.\n\nI didn't check if in the menu they include \""cafe bombon\"", a Spanish classic. I'll go back to verify that and if not, at least to get good coffee!\n\nCheers"
4,"When I think of Richardson's, I feel warm and cozy inside.  I've been on several occasions and I love the atmosphere... I always have a good time at this hidden little gem of the city.\n\nThe 'Cuisine of New Mexico' is unique... they are known for their green chile potato as well as several other pork dishes.  I usually go for the fish or seafood specials... they have a standard menu and then specials posted on chalk boards around the restaurant.\n\nMost recently I enjoyed the blackened scallop appetizer as my entree along with a huge house salad.  The scallops were a little bit salty but cooked just right.  They were served on a tortilla with rice, beans, and a yummy spicy sauce.  Their salads are really tasty, and many of the entree specials come with a starter salad.  I went with a group of 4 and we had a couple of bottles of wine and a plain pizza as an appetizer to share.  Needless to say, none of us had room for dessert!\n\nBe prepared for a crowd whenever you go, but enjoy your company and the people around you.  Call ahead and make a reservation if you can...  if you do have to wait, sit at the bar or by the fireplace; you can't complain once you have a drink in hand and the scent of the fire mixed with hot food and good energy.  I'll be back again soon, Richardson's!"
4,"If you're not looking for this place, you just might miss it. It's tucked away in a strip mall and worth the hunt. I went with Elite Emily as we explored Henderson more, and we were practically the only people in the spot. The orders were HUGE. It takes a lot for me to wave the white flag, but I had to ask for a box. All the food is fresh and pretty dern tasty. There's really nothing you can go wrong with here, so I'm looking forward to my next trip to try something else!"
4,"Normally the boy does not enjoy museums, but he had a lot of fun in this one.\n\nLots of historic sex toys and insane sex toys. Video clips, films, demonstrations. Lots and lots of sexually intense items here!\n\nBondage and pictures, and a relatively in depth visual view of sexual evolution. Incredibly interesting. I would actually come again. Everyone that works there is also sweet and unobtrusive."
4,"I came here on a Sunday so I didn't need a reservation. And I must say, this place is the bee's knees.\n\nAwesome aromas, lovely decor and atmosphere, and incredibly helpful waitstaff.\n\nOnce I mentioned I was vegan, the chef pointed out what was readily vegan and what could be altered. Way more sauces have fish/oyster sauce in them than I had originally thought! \n\nDefinitely check this place out. I look forward to the next time I come back. Green curry with tofu... mmmmmm."
4,"I have visited on a couple occasions and really enjoyed it each time. Our last visit was with some family and friends in town visiting and everyone left more than satisfied. \n\nIf you're looking for unique, well-made cocktails then this is a must visit. They have broken down the various drinks by historical time period and the menu provides a little description of how the drink got its name. \n\nAlmost everyone took advantage of the happy hour, half price steaks. One of the filets was a bit under-cooked, but for the most part they were spot on. All the sides we ordered were great, but the truffle mac and cheese was a table favorite. I can't say enough about the \""Farmer\"" flat bread pizza - bacon, spinach, and a cracked egg. This is something you just have to try in order to understand how delicious it really is. \n\nDessert was almost certainly out of the question until the server started to describe them. We ordered their version of the pizooki as well as the homemade doughnuts. The entire table thought they had died and gone to heaven after finishing these desserts. Save room!\n\nAnother satisfying and enjoyable experience. Great food, solid drinks and a unique atmosphere away from the hustle and bustle of the touristy Strip."
4,"Nice, big patio to enjoy a conversation and catch up with friends. The inside was clean and service was nice. All the pastries looked especially tasty at this location. Nice job."
4,"During one hot spring day in Chinatown I was STARVING (as always, my metabolism  is ridiculous). Tired of my usual Thai Food fix and wanting to seek something new I find HSP on Yelp. \n\nInitial reaction: HOLYSH!T did this just open!? \n\nTurns out its located towards the end of the Chinatown Plaza extension on Wynn Rd and Spring Mountain. The lady working told me they've actually been opened for 5 years! I seriously felt like I have been living in a pineapple on the bottom of the sea. I bear crawl my hunger self to there and in front of me was a small shop with smallish quantities of various poke! it must be a good sign that there are small quantities of the poke to maintain the fish freshness. No old poke, yay! I'm not from Hawaii, an islander, or have lived anywhere with fresh off the coast fish, BUT usually I can taste fish funk. In my Shoyu Limu Tuna bowl I had no funk, only delicious fresh poke and warm rice sprinkled with black sesame seeds and only $8ish!\n\nExcited to come back and try more."
4,"My 10 year old boys had fun.  A little pricey but it is clean, well lit and not too loud.  For the adults....the wifi blows, the food is not very good and expensive.  A small iced latte was just under $5.  Can't bring anything in either....(and Pepsi products..ick).\n\nAll attractions/games were in good working condition."
4,"I have been coming to this place since the mid-80s and it is definitely consistent. At face value this is a local curry house, no pretensions of fine dining but good, reasonably priced food with attentive service. There is little better on a winter's night with the freezing wind howling up Bruntsfield Place, than to battle through the double doors into a warm and inviting aroma of indian spices.  Beware when ordering the naan: they only do these in \""feed the 5,000\"" size!"
4,"I have to knock off a star bc of the wait time for the patio.  We have been here numerous times, and I know the patio doesn't take reservations. But a 1 & 1/2 hour wait at 5:30 is a little crazy.\nThat being said, the food is always amazing! I usually get some sort of steak, and hubby gets either the skate or some sort of braised short ribs.  Never had a bad waiter or bad food here. \nBottom line, if you want the patio (and the people watching is second to none), expect a wait. It would be better if they could text you when your table was ready, as the sensors only work a short distance in the casino. But the food is worth the wait"
4,"I have never seen a Cirque de Soleil Show before, nor any show in Vegas, for that matter. I really enjoyed it. The musicians were top-notch, the dancers were enegetic and exciting, the acrobats were breathtaking. We had a wonderful time. Of course, our tickets were free, so that makes it all that much better!"
4,We ordered the lobster and shrimp dip. We had to send it back twice because it was too cheeseeeee.. yes!! The chips kept breaking whenever we dipped it in the sauce because the cheese made it to heavy. They ended up taking it off the bill. We then tried the parmesan chicken and bake potato. It was gooood!!! It was enough for two to share.
4,Great find!  Visiting from DC and loved the unique take on menu!  Witty and original.  The food was excellent! Can't say enough about the pierogi sliders and the eggplant lasagna!!
4,"This is  a great little deli with a large menu.  Breakfast is available, fried eggs, potatoes etc. that is unusual for a place like this.  Not sure it is all that authentic but they have hot pastrami and corned beef.  Product seems to be above average but what really made me decide to make a return trip was the service.  Very friendly and helpful.   Seems to be a popular place."
4,"My husband and I went on date night and had a blast! Our instructor was Melissa and she was friendly and full of energy. However, Melissa was a little fast and slightly vague in her instructions, but gave us plenty of time to paint each step. A finished painting was hanging that we could refer back too. Drinks are average price, $5 for beer and $7 for wine. Last call drinks are half price! We ate before going so I did not have a chance to try any of the food, but there is a 20 minute dinner break half way through for everyone to eat. There were a lot of people munching on appetizers throughout the painting class. This is something I will absolutely do again, and highly recommend it for anyone looking for something fun and different."
4,If u come here on grave until 7am ask for Joy...great server....having saimin and Portuguese Sausage and scramble eggs....of course with rice... ono after a night out.
4,Very good food. Authentic. Spicy as indicated by name. We went there for dinner twice during our short visit to Vegas and we were happy both times.
4,"It's about time Summerlin had a decent pub/bar/hang-out/tavern, whatever the hell you want to call it, it's good they have one. \nSuper friendly staff, not overbearingly so, but attentive. Food was quite tasty, chicken sandwich is da bomb! The waitress said you can get it as a wrap (off the menu) , nice tip, thanks.\nFew things:\n1) For yelpers, if you check in you get a free shot of their house whisky. Bad thing is, it's horrible. Cinnamon / orange infused. Pretty much tasted like Triaminic cold and cough. Pass on it, trust me.\n2) The bathroom sinks...I can't stand these things. Whoever thought a slightly tilted slab of tile would work as a sink...dude, you were waaaay wrong. Give me a basin and save my clothing from the splash back and the whopping 2 inches of space to place my hands under, please. \n\nBottom line: Great place to hang, plenty of room to move, cool staff, great food. Just beware of the bathroom sinks...."
4,"Been here three times now and will keep coming back. One of the best buffet values for locals and with coupons a good value for visitors.\nThe prime rib is perfect every time, ask for a thicker cut and they are happy to give it to you. The crab legs are fresh every time I have been there and they have several types of shrimp. Something for every seafood lover.\nThe Mexican food could use a little work, the enchiladas have been hard but they have lots of Asian choices and the American part of the buffet has always been delicious.\nAnd the deserts? Oh yeah! lots of choices with plenty of no sugar added ones for those who need it.\nThe servers are not only professional but personal."
4,This is a wonderful family owned restaurant with amazing service. Bagels are the best! Both the breakfast and lunch menus are extensive and the kitchen is very willing to make any dietary exceptions you have.
4,"With moving to the other side of town, it was nice to find a new sushi spot near by. Service and rolls are great. Plus, they have a great happy hour that has options of 4-8 pieces. It gives you the option to try a lot of different rolls. All in all, it's a nice little spot and I've loved everything I've tried. Nice place as my last one was I Love Sushi."
4,"Great wine and bruschetta, especially the apple one. Good live music when I went. They need a fire pit outside though! There is not much out there and they need to liven it up some. But great wine bar"
4,They always take the time with my kids and are very good.  Sometimes they have a waiting list and often are booked up....so I recommend calling ahead to make an appointment.  But it is very worth it as the results speak for themselves.
4,"I'm impressed with this Pizza - Mozzeralla, Provolone blend, just enough provolone to make it enhanced - The Service was Excellent!  In the past I have been unimpressed with this place... Yesterday they were ON!!!"
4,"Great place to go for family horseback rides. I  really liked the set up and the ease with which they do paperwork, riding prep etc. They desert in north Scottsdale is beautiful this time aof year and the grounds are lovely for a spring ride. The staff was very helpful , courteous and knowledgeable.  I would go there again in a heart beat."
4,"I was sooooo excited to have the opportunity to ride a roller coaster in and around a casino/hotel. Yes, I realize that I may be getting a little old to ride roller coasters and hate to admit that it makes me sick as hell, but who the hell cares? You are only \""young\"" once. The lines to pay were weirdly inefficient but maybe it was because everyone, including us, made a mad dash to get in 10 minutes before they closed (midnight on the weekend). \n\nThe ride was scary and hilarious at the same time (I didn't plan my shirt choice very well and I will leave it at that). My girlfriend and I laughed hysterically at our pictures. They were $15 a piece but $22 if you bought two. We decided to do that and split it. The employee gave me the most exasperated look when I asked him to charge two separate cards...really dude????? Be happy you got us to buy two and get over it. Besides that, this was a blast!"
4,"Whiskey Dicks is in a bad location, but it isn't a bad pub at all!  The service is great, the beer is pretty good, and the food is pretty good too.  \n\nWe were greeting by a friendly short shorts wearing gal at the door, and were promptly seated.  I ordered a Ranger IPA, which is pretty good for a tap choice if you ask me.  They have a decent range of beers for an everyday bar.  I had the philly cheese with mesquite seasoned fries.  The fries were great!  The seasoning was awesome.  The philly wasn't the best, but it was good.  I thought the steak was a little dry, and there was too much bread on the thing.  The onions and peppers were nice and fresh though.  \n\nOverall, with the beer selection and the friendly service, I decided to bump WD up a star.  Most pubs aren't carrying any decent beer, and yes there are a few better pubs for good beer, but there are actually drinkable craft beers here. They carry a few New Belgian beers, along with Sam Adams seasonal beers.  since I work so close, I definitely plan on returning!"
4,"Have eaten here many a time.  I used to get it delivered at my old job, and then recently was lucky enough to work only 1 block away.  Would visit once a week or so and get the Chicken Pita.  A great flavored grilled chicken, I ordered it with the whole wheat pita.  Topped with some cucumber sauce and hot garlic chili sauce makes it perfect.\n\nWould highly recommend it!  Reasonably priced at $8 for a whole pita."
4,Been here a few times and I must say I like this place!\n\n\nStaff: A+ (Very Friendly and prompt) \n\nVibe: B+ (Like a Toby Keith's JR.)\n\nEntertainment: A+ (Awesome live music)\n\nBar :A ( Its got everything except Norm)\n\nPrices: Average\n\nFood: B ( Pass on the steak) go for the burgers and fries.\n\nOverall I give this place a SOLID A!\n\nCheck this place out your gonna love the people and the atmosphere. We will be back for sure!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nburgers.
4,"I came here first time with an educated shooter that already had guns i could use. This was my second time ever shooting but first at a range. They sold us the bullets and targets gave us protective geer and off we went to an enclosed room to shoot very simple short breefing. Place is nicely set up central location, staff was nice. The other two people went to get certified not the paper test but shooting test i decided i needed more time to practice. The only thing i really did not like was how many tourist were there. I really hope they open another location more for locals. The prices are to high because its geared toward tourism. I like the fact classes are free though. I went on a monday around 9am not to busy but as the day progressed the place got packed so go during the week early otherwise you will be waiting. I will be back to practice more and test taking but i think im going to save some money and look for a cheaper place for bullets and targets."
4,"The food is amazing.  If you've eaten at another Bianco restaurant, imagine that.... only better, with more options.\n\nThe service is not great.  Slow, they forget things, etc.\n\nThe portions are SMALL.\n\nWe went on a Saturday night and had our choice of inside or outside table with no waiting... so I think that issue is sort of hit or miss."
4,"Vietnamese Sandwiches: The only thing I go here for, To be honest this is the best Vietnamese sandwiches in Las Vegas, trust me. Not like Lee's Sandwiches. Hue Thai bakes their bread fresh so when you get your sandwiches the breads soft and a little bit crunchy but still a little warm. I've tried a couple places and this place has to be the best. \n\nOther foods: They have a variety of Vietnamese dishes, Chinese, and even Thai. But nothing taste super Authentic. So that's why I never order anything there except the Vietnamese sandwiches and their boba (which is decent). Not a fan of their Pho\n\nPrice: Vietnamese Sandwiches here are dirt cheap, $3.50 a sandwich I believe. Only sucky thing is they require a minimum of $20 to charge a debit card. Which you should know by now, I'm a yelper who doesn't like to carry cash.\n\ntake out/eat there: To be honest dining there isn't so bad, other than the odd smell of cleaning products and food mixed together and the eye sore hallway to the bathroom the place is pretty alright. The design I guess is some kind of under the sea theme? I have no idea why its under the sea that has nothing to do with Vietnamese food. \n\n4/5 Stars for Price/Vietnamese Sandwiches/ Decent Boba"
4,"The barbecue was good but not great. They do have a nice selection of barbecue sauces. The complimentary kettle chips were a nice touch. On the plus side, the food came lightning fast."
4,Fantastic!  The Farm burger was fabulous and the sweet potato fries with powder sugar were great. Huge fan of food.  Service on the hand was slow. They forgot our fries and we had to ask for them and did not get them until we were 3/4 done with our burgers.
4,"I have been coming here for over 10 yrs.  I try other places and always come back to Nancy's place.  They are friendly, I like my nails and pedi's."
4,"This place is great! I received SO much stuff for my son when he was born (mostly barely worn hand-me downs from my husband's huge family and some of my close friends) that he couldn't possibly wear them all even if I changed his outfit 5 times a day! So I went on the hunt for a great consignment place I could utilize to get him \""new\"" clothes as he grew. \nLuckily for me, there are quite a few places like this in my area (central phoenix). I checked out 2 others before I came to Smarty Pants (do NOT go to Urban Baby! Ugh!). \nThe mother-daughter owner team at SP were very welcoming and friendly. They took almost all of the items I brought in and although I planned to just drop stuff off, I couldn't resist shopping for myself and ended up with three great tops for $15 total!! Incredible inventory, clean shop and friendly service... who wouldn't love it??\n\nThey informed me that they are expanding to the space right next to Bertha's (my favorite restaurant in town) to have a separate place for furniture and will be offering more adult clothing in the current space (I could have that backwards.... the new space is for clothes, perhaps?). \n\nSo I will be heading back soon to spend my consignment money! Thank you Smarty Pants!"
4,After seeing Paul put his review up...I had to join in! This venue is almost perfect in design and the acoustics are amazing. I love outdoor concerts and yet the amphitheater gives you a club feel while being outside.\n\nThat being said...like my review of the Fillmore...you will see that catching a buzz will require a credit card or a well hidden flask (leave your bongs at home). The whole Music Factory complex begs for a keg party straight out of high school to explode in the parking lot. Wait...what? Oh...that's right...we DO tailgate before shows. Ten dollars can get you a 12 pack of PBR and a sammy...or one 24 ounce beer inside...and that's without a tip. My tip? Lower your freakin drink prices!\n\nLike others have said though...this place is great and they're attracting better and more obscure acts all the time. I'm just happy to have some reputable venues around.
4,"This place had such high reviews on Yelp that we drove all the way from Scottsdale on our vacation to Tempe to visit this place. And it was worth it! From the front doorman asking me for my ID (knowing I'm well over 30) to saying my name right and telling us to have a great time, to the bartenders asking every few minutes if we were OK, to the delicious blue cheese burger, we were happy campers the entire time. I'm not a beer drinker, but my boyfriend tried all 3 beers and loved all of them. It's a fun, casual, sports bar environment and a great place for bar food."
4,"I drove by and there was a blank storefront with no signage or notice. Turns out it moved across the street and is now near the other furniture stores (At Home, Creative Leather, Spencer's Appliance) at 2711 S. San Tan Village Pkwy, Gilbert. The new store is brighter and has floor-to-ceiling windows on 2 sides."
4,Like I said before in my first post about Princess Nails. Its definitely dingy and and as hole in the wall as you can get. But Michelle oh my is this woman amazing. Second visit to get my eyebrows waxed was just as worthwhile as the first. ASK FOR MICHELLE. I'm not going to rate this 5 stars simply because of the lack of cleaniness BUT what would they do without Michelle.\n\n*NOTE* My rating is based on Eyebrow Waxing. Unfortunately I do not get my nails done. EVER. So please keep in mind when reading my review for this location that it is solely based on my experience with waxing and waxing ONLY.
4,It is a older hotel so you don't think of going there for the buffet right of the bat.  We somehow ended up here and the buffet was pretty good.  Not the largest selection but of what they offered everything was good quality (that's what really matters).  I was pleasantly surprised.  Would definitely go back.
4,After spending a few summers in Phoenix you learn to locate and love certain watering holes.  One of the best treats to cool off the perspiration of a long Phoenix afternoon is the date shake at Sphinx.  This place has a long history with Scottsdale and its shakes have been hydrating sweaty residents for several decades now.
4,"We have been anxiously awaiting the opening of this  new restaurant.  We went on the second night it was open and we were very pleased!  Service, chips and salsa, food, and drinks were very good!  They have done a wonderful job with the remodel of the interior.  Nice to have another choice in  this area to enjoy - a nice complement to our other excellent Mexican restaurants!"
4,"We finally got a Jimmy John's and I had heard so much about it being great.  We tried two different sandwiches (the No 9 Italian Night Club on their great french roll and the No 12 Beach Club on  thick sliced 7 grain bread).  Great quality product, great bread, very competitive pricing.  It is a little noisy with the music and hard surfaces in this location thou.  They are a brand new location so that will probably change (hope) over time."
4,"Funny thing is, we went to a burger place at Mandalay first. But they didn't come to our table for 5 minutes to even say hello. And 5 minutes is longer than you think when you just spent 90 minutes at the MJ One show and you're ready to eat off your hand with hunger. So we left. And came here. A bit different, to put it mildly. Service was impeccable, but not snooty. The Missus and I both got different tasting menus. Mine was the Alain Ducasse 4 course one sans wine. From the cold broccoli soup amuse to the amazing lobster curry to the foie gras topped filet to the Armagnac dessert, almost everything was very well presented and tasted amazing. First time with foie gras. Would definitely have been beyond the pale if served solo, but topping the perfectly cooked medium rare filet balanced it's richness. All I know is the junk was tasty. The only misstep was the mashed potatoes that accompanied  the filet. They were served in a bowl separate from the plate, and surprisingly...basic.  \n\nAtmosphere was romantic, view was stunning, of course, and definitely an experience to remember. Not cheap. But actually worth it."
4,"Un super bon petit caf\u00e9, super bien situ\u00e9 pour un boost en plein milieu d'une bonne session de magasinage. Il est un peu difficile \u00e0 trouver, mais si vous prenez le passage entre le Centre Eaton et Place Ville-Marie, vous y serez. C'est plut\u00f4t un comptoir qu'un caf\u00e9 car il n'y a pas de place pour s'asseoir et siroter son latte tranquillement. Par contre, m\u00eame si votre commande ne prendra pas plus que 5-10 minutes, et donne l'impression que c'est de style \""fast food\"" vu l'emplacement, vous aurez quand m\u00eame un service \u00e0 la client\u00e8le assez exceptionnel!"
4,"HUGE PORTIONS! \n\nCame here for lunch with my employers while I was attending a Seminar at the Hilton which is close-by. We came in and was seated promptly. Our waitress always had a smile and was quite the busy bee going from table to table. Impressive. \n\nI ordered a cheeseburger with fries. Markus and Miyoko ordered salads. When the salads came.. it really looked like 3 salads combined into one serving. Miyoko ordered the steak and mushroom salad that looked tasty.. Markus's salad was the same size but had an array of fruit on it. All of us were shocked of how big the portions were. I ordered my cheeseburger well done.. but it came back a bit burnt. I still ate it, but was a bit sad that it had been charred. \n\nAll in all a good place to grab food. Especially since I heard the Riviera had crappy food joints to eat at. Would I eat here again? Only if I were in the general vicinity of the area. Its good to be back home in SF."
4,So after our hell of a boring time at PURE we walked our drunk asses over to Poetry. The sound of hip hop was like a breath of fresh air. Our first appearance was Thursday night around 1:30 am (or should I say Friday morning?) No cover (worked some magic) I think ladies were $20?? Anyways...we had sssooo much fun here....we danced all night....I had the best time here. Drinks came fast...everyone had a blast! If you like hip hop music this is the spot to be. \n\nWe actually came back for round two the next night and it was just as fun! I will mos def be stopping by every time I'm in Vegas....
4,"Fish and Chips anyone? Had that and the quesadilla last night, both were delicious, but i'll admit I feel a little sluggish today. Place was clean, well kept, nice waitress. We went on a quiz or trivia night, so the mood was pretty mello. Tap beers seemed pretty standard for a pub. I will definitely go back for a nightcap as it is an easy walk from my house."
4,"I had the smoked salmon on a egg white omelet.  Staff nice, ambiance fantastic, easy parking, prices comparable to downtown Scottsdale.  My drink was kinda week, but I would return for sure."
4,"My review will strictly be on what I ordered:\n\nWhite Pizza - Fantastic and straight to the point.  Cheesy without being overwhelming and heavy.  1 slice is all you really need to reach contentment unless you're someone with an over-sized appetite.  Pizza is always coming out fresh.  Huge globs of ricotta, total score.  I prefer my white pizzas a little on the creamier side, but this was good enough.  Can't complaint about a $5 slice if you're in Vegas.  Great for late night eats especially if you're staying at the hotel.\n\nOVERALL:  Great people, love the man behind the counter.  Quick service as well.\n\nLike I always say, YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!"
4,"Such a great experience. I'm always hesitant on someone cutting my hair. Summer was great she did everything I wanted, was very professional. Will definitely be going back to them again."
4,"This is my second visit to Victoria and was for a Yelp event so obviously the atmosphere was great, but you could tell from the attitude of the bar staff that this is a great place to visit when there isn't a nice organised event (Thanks Jody B)\n\nThe mulled cider is really something you should try with options of either Lingonberry or Pear - the former is my favourite and reminds me of visits to a certain Swedish furniture store where they serve meatballs. Victoria's is, of course, part of the group of Swedish themed bars around Edinburgh including Hemma, Sofi's and Joseph Pearce which is where the link becomes pertinent.\n\nWill definitely use this bar in the future as a meeting place when I'm around Leith Walk."
4,"Day two of the restaurant being open so all the staff were on their toes.  Tried the Buddy's Salumi & Cheese Board (olives, pickled vegetables, grilled Italian bread, genoa salami, spicy capicola, proscuitto di parma, grana padano, tuscan pecorino, and gorgonzola).  The capicola and proscuitto were the best I've ever had and the gorgonzola was epic - bleu cheese flavor with the texture of brie.  Cheeseburger at an Italian restaurant?  You bet because the Pat Lafrieda Burger (brioche bun, tomato aioli, provolone cheese, tuscan fries) was really tasty.  The tiramisu was the best I've had anywhere.\n\nAsk for a table bordering the outside perimeter windows for great views of The Strip.  Bring your camera to take pictures of the incredible entree cakes Buddy and his team made."
4,"I love independent/art/documentary/not-mainstream movies, so consequently, Camelview is one of my favorite spots as they are one of the few theaters here in the valley that gets these films.\n\nPositive things about the theater: \n*Great movies! \n*Friendly employees\n*Reasonably sized drinks (movie theater \""bucket-o-cola\"" drinks are a pet peeve of mine and their small is equivalent to a medium soda from a fast food restaurant, which is just perfect) \n*Yummy cinnamon almonds for sale at the concession stand\n*A retro-y feel \n\nNegatives\n*Older theater that feels a bit rundown\n*No stadium seating\n*Seats that are not particularly comfortable\n\nPoint of note (not positive or negative)\n*because of the type of movies they show, it seems like it is often popular with an older crowd of moviegoers. This can make for a sortof unique moviegoing experience if you come from a different demographic.\n\nIt is a fun spot that we manage to visit every couple of months. I wish that there were more options for Art films here in the Valley, but for the moment I do love Camelview, because I don't really have a choice in the matter ;)"
4,Thanks to Yelp reviews I found these guys.  I live alone and was nervous about hiring a moving company.  The first thing they did was send me a picture and biography of the estimator who would be contacting me which made me feel secure.  They arrived exactly on time and worked quickly.  I would have given them 5 stars except they re-assembled my trundle bed incorrectly and I am still trying to get it fixed.  Otherwise the move was perfect and I would totally recommend these guys.
4,"I don't have a whole lot of experience with liquor stores, but have always been pleased here.  The staff are always nice, helpful, and non-intrusive.\n\nI once went with my boyfriend, who expressed a desire for a certain beer that they didn't have.  The dude behind the counter immediately said that they would order it.  Lo and behold, the next time we went, there it was.  We proceeded to buy lots of it.  Everything after that is kind of a blur."
4,"The show was good! But not a spectacular show as what you'd expect from their ABCD competition. However, I did put into consideration that they perform two shows in one night that is 90 minutes long each. Putting that into consideration, it would make sense of the JBWKZ to not push themselves to the limit. SO, it wasn't a mind  blowing show, but they did add sparks to the show with the electrifying technology to make it look fun. Nice spin offs of different variation of music from... 40s, Disney's, Hip Hop, Punk, even some disco music haha. Fun."
4,Good bar for the location and size. This would be a good place to get started for the night. I ended up standing by the bar and getting carded when I asked for water. Blech. Drinks were yummy and there was a little room to dance. \n\nThe stage above the bar was AWESOME. It was especially nice that there was a hot chick on mic. Fun stuff when you've been drinking.
4,I loved the ice coffee and everything I've ordered here has been fantastic!\nIs my go to breakfast joint while in this area.
4,"I was surprised to see that DSW is now carrying a bunch of running shoes!  Before it used to be just casual and formal shoes (for men) but I went here the other day and was pleasantly surprised.   Now it's not going to be a specialized as say a Run for your Life or TrySports store, but it was nice to find a store that carried Mizunos or Asics.\n\nNormally I just stick to the right hand side (2 aisles) where the men's shoes are at and the back clearance section.  My sister often goes here... sometimes for hours on end and I can see why since their selection is vastly greater on the women's side."
4,"Instead of a long wait next door, I decided to try Waffallonia for the first time.  I ordered the waffle with Nutella, bananas, and strawberries.  At first the serving size of one waffle looked a bit small for my appetite.  However, joke was on me as I started digging more and more into this brunch.  The waffle was very filling and so good.  There were sugary bites that reminded me of a funnel cake.  The fruit was fresh and everything tasted great mixed together.  I am happy there was a wait next door which prompted me to try this as it was very worth it.  The atmosphere was cozy as well as the few seats inside were pressed up against a tiny counter.  Waffallonia was a cool place with fantastic waffles."
4,"Great experience!!! I hadn't tried the Mesa location yet and I went in for a yummy bowl of pasta and left not only satisfied, but incredibly grateful for my wonderful bartender/server! If you make it into this location make sure you ask for Ashley! She is fun and spunky and fast on her feet. She knew all the regulars and her smile was contagious! Best experience at  Oregano's by far. I will be back for the Big Rig and Ashley."
4,I stopped in here with the owner's girlfriend after she cut my hair. She kindly treated me to anything I wanted to eat and drink. wooo hoo! I ordered a Grey Goose and cranberry and a Las Vegas roll (my all time favorite sushi- even if it is fried). Both were delicious. Thank you!!
4,"Last week, on the way from the Airport to the Convention Center, me and my buddies decided it was time for some breakfast.   Fortunately, we came across this IHOP.   The place was pretty empty, I believe there were only two other parties there besides us.   The service was fast and friendly.   Our hostess / waitress (Shee was her name) was awesome.   The food was average for an IHOP.   You know what you will get.   As a bonus, this IHOP is close to the Pinball Hall of Fame.   \nThis is a good place for breakfast.   \nWill I be back?   Yeah, maybe."
4,"This review is only for the Chippery, not the daiquiris. (Though I bet they are delicious!) \n\nI was wandering around the Forum Shops and I wanted just a little snack before heading home. My friends were getting daiquiris and I saw they have food in the back so I shoved my way through all those wanting frozen drinks and went back. I was pleasantly surprised at the chip selection. They had 6-8 flavored of homemade chips for really reasonable prices, $3 or $5 per bag depending on size. \n\nThe only reason that it gets less than 5 stars is that the service wasn't great. Not cheery people this afternoon at Caesars! It is definitely a hidden gem for a cheap little snack."
4,"It's a maze of toys that you won't find at most department stores. \n\nI like the organization. It makes it easy to go the the area you want. All toys in their proper spot, divided into Toddler toys, board games, stuffed animals, learning toys, dolls, sports toys, action figured, cars, etc. \n\nI was serious about the maze thing, lol. There is 1 entrance and 1 exit and they are not interchangeable :) When you first walk in, because they know children so well and their ability to walk in a door and then break out into an all out sprint in all directions, you are guided through a few isles that curve around (they are chalk full of toys, of course) and THEN you get to the main isle. \n\nMy check out experience was awesome. The lady actually noticed that I was hiding something my nieces view and she made sure to scan it when she wasn't looking and to double bag it :D I love her. \n\nPrices range, but the toys here do seem to be pricier in general compared to most department stores, but like it said, they have a much wider variety."
4,The restaurant is small but the atmosphere delivers a good vibe. The decorations are tasteful and the service was outstanding.\n\nThe Pad See Ew was rich in flavor and spices. My only quarrel was the portion size. Perhaps the dish was slightly less than generous because I ordered it off the lunch menu but I would have expected more nonetheless.\n\nThe Pad Thai was something to rave about. The chicken was tender and the noodles were cooked to perfection with an excellent flavor and aftertaste. The portion was ample.\n\nI happen to live near the restaurant so they'll definitely be seeing me more often.
4,"This place is very very tasty. The drive thru is still there so you can enjoy that, it was fast and the person who took my order was very peppy and helpful which was awesome!\n\nThe wings were perfectly cooked and very large. The only draw-back is the sides. We got french-fries and potato salad. The fries were great (according to my girlfriend) the potato salad although good the portion was incredibly small. It came in a 2 oz little plastic cup and was definitely not what I expected for $1.89 worth of potato salad which is why only 4 stars.\n\nOther than that this place is a smash hit, avoid the sides get the wings you can mix and match the flavors as well and you won't be disappointed at all.\n\nWatch out other wing places this is a serious contender in my opinion!"
4,"This bar is now one of my favorite places in Las Vegas. 2 shots & a beer for $9?? Yes please! The crowd was so diverse and the karaoke was fabulous! We went there on a Saturday night and it was crowded, smokey and fun. If you can't handle smoke, then this is not the place for you! The bartenders have a stiff pour and the rest of the staff is very friendly. Please be advised that true to Dive Bar standards, there is only one toilet in the bathroom, so you WILL be waiting to take a pee, so don't break the seal ladies!"
4,"Leith Links is north Edinburgh's answer to the Meadows, a beautiful and extensive green oasis criss-crossed with paths, dotted with playgrounds, and the perfect place for a stroll, a run, or to walk your dog.  It's actually much quieter than the Meadows and doesn't get overrun with picnicking students, making it a much more tranquil place to spend time (although the north east corner can get a bit whiffy due to the nearby sewage works).\n\nAt the same time, the Links still have a lot going on, from allotments and a Children's Orchard located in their midst to visiting circuses.  The park also plays host to regular festivals such as the Leith Festival in June and the Edinburgh Mela in August.\n\nAnother claim to fame is that, although no longer used as a golf course, it is the place where the rules were first laid down, making it officially the home of golf - take that St Andrews!"
4,"It's a everywhere and it's nothing unique but it's mostly fresh and they have mostly healthy options for mostly reasonable prices.\n\nThe half/half combos available for all their soups, salads, and sandwiches make this place a constant lunchtime stop for me.  The Fontana grilled cheese.  The tortellini  Alfredo pasta.  The Cesar.  All classics and all done fairly well here.\n\nThe negative: the sweeping.  Nearly every time I've been here someone has come by my table and started sweeping the carpet with a brush broom... Over and over and over.  Besides the dust that I'm sure it's putting into the air (and my food) it also makes a whole lot of noise and takes away from the meal.\n\nCertainly not a completely unique adventure.  But fairly solid food for a quick eat place."
4,"Great food, clean establishment. Chef came out and talks to everyone and wants to make sure everything is going well. I eat VEGAN, but I'm not one. The  \""gardein beef\"", gardein fish, gardein chicken dishes were AMAZING!. The Sweet Sour \""SCALLOPS\"", (king oyster mushrooms sliced, breaded then fried) a VEGAN take on SWEET SOUR PORK, creative and DELICIOUS. You have to try this place because I plan on going back."
4,"Soi loved this place.\n\nSo I went to Purple Zebra and got a giant frozen drink that Vegas is known for. However my mom was hungry. After a nice host outside said it was cool to bring in my extra alcohol we were seated. \n\nI have to say the margarita, for being at a Mexican restaurant, was a major fail. It was just bad. Even though the waiter was really nice about taking it back and replacing it with a different margarita. The second margarita was bad too. So just avoid margaritas.\n\nBut everything else was amazing.\n\nYou know how you can eat something and taste love? Well the carnitas tacos I had tasted like love. Just ooey gooey flavorful love. And the guacamole with pomegranate seeds.. #idied So. Freaking. Good. I also had rice. Green rice. That kinda looked like throw up. But if you close your eyes and open your mouth you'll be taken on a journey. A journey into epic rice land full of love and yumminess.\n\nJust yeah... Go there."
4,"I quite enjoyed the dinner I had here and would definitely return. Friendly service, excellent food... Seems on a par quality wise with Bankok Balcony in Squirrel Hill. Fairly small inside."
4,Great food. Kind of pricy for the portions but it is great food!! Makes you feel good about what you are eating!!
4,"This is a restaurant inside of the Fiesta Resort Conference Center. It deserves it's own entry here on yelp. Now we didn't get to have the complete restaurant experience here due to it being late, and our only reason for being here is a flight missed connection. \nI have to give 2 thumbs up for the service in the lounge area with a smiling face by Jenn the waitress. She had to work late with the rush of hungry travelers, but she didn't seem to mind. \nI had a soup and salad. On the menu it said \""Chef's Famous Chicken Tortilla Soup.\"" I had to try it and wow...it's the best I've ever had anywhere. So, here in our situation tired, hungry, and stuck...I discovered the best Tortilla soup ever. I wish I had the recipe. If anyone ever gets graced with it, please let me know. Delicious!"
4,"If you've never been to Wildflower before, it's a cute, nice soup, sandwich, salad, bread, pastry place. This is a big, bright location. \n\nLovely, savory food that always seems to be made with nice ingredients, and great bread - we often come in for a meal and treat ourselves to a loaf of something delicious to go - today, sourdough with rosemary and sea salt.  It's pretty reasonably priced, and the food is interesting. \n\nTry the spinach salad (I get it with no bacon), or the egg, tomato & feta breakfast sandwich on ciabatta."
4,"I give this place a 4 because while they have a great (and tasty) selection of soups, sandwiches and wraps, they miss the mark on  the smoothies.  They put orange juice in almost everyone, so while I expect a raspberry flavored \""Raspberry Rage\"" it usually takes like orange juice.  I have tried about 5-6 different flavors and most of them just taste like orange juice or whatever juice they use as their base.  I still get them, but Im always dissappointed.  \n\nBtw, IMO, the best smoothie is the Blue at Franktuary"
4,"great place, very clean and service was great.\nthe food, a ok. devil's egg. you can actually skip that, no flavor.\nthe short ribs was way too much salt for my taste, I wish they ease up a bit, because you can always add if you want it saltier.\nAndouille sausage, shrimp, and grits. you have to ask them extra spicy, otherwise it would be too bland. we asked for extra spicy, now it taste just right. bold.\nthe grits, hm. I don't think it goes well with the dish. anyway,\nthen we order the donut as our appetizer. that was nice too.\ngreat place for dinner."
4,"$40 was steep for our lunch as we awaited our suite to be ready. Killed some time here and was rather surprised by how good the chopped salad was!!!!! So, so good, with uber fresh ingredients, like celery, fresh peas, lettuce, bright and flavorful!!! There was chicken, and some fresh herbs, and at least 4 other ingredients. loved the light dressing as well. Fresh taco-like shell that has the texture of Chinese shrimp chips, with sesame seeds embedded in it. Salad was about $16\n\nDisappointing was a $4 cup of nasty, non crispy, flabby fries that accompanied a French size grilled Mahi Mahi sandwich in chipotle sauce. Good, but def not worth $17.\n\nHey, it's Vegas, y'know?\n\nGet that salad. AMAZING AMAZING\nSet along the side of the Wynn pool."
4,"The pizza is good, but the pasta is outstanding. Nice quaint family outing place, or a great place to take a date for a private dinner. They, also, offer some good salads."
4,I really enjoy this place. It's low-key and upscale. Drinks are expensive but they're made on the strong side. The food is really go too. I've never had a dish I didn't enjoy. \n\nIt's a great place to sit down and enjoy a cocktail and have a conversation. The crowd looks like 26 and up.  I consistently have a positive experience here.
4,"We did a reservation on opentable for breakfast and good thing we did otherwise we would've had to wait for 30 minutes in line. When we went in, there were a lot of tables still empty so I don't really understand why their line was so long. Since we came in at 10:30, we got to experience both breakfast and lunch dishes.\n\nWe came here because my mom desperately wanted to try their AYCE macarons. She said they were a disappointment because good macarons are supposed to melt in your mouth and their's didn't. That failure aside, many of their dessert dishes were pretty good, like the creme brulee and fruit tart. Their crepe was a bummer. The batter was tasteless and the berries were sour. The candied nuts they use are not fresh and have that refrigerated taste. All the meat dishes I tried were delicious. The prime rib was cooked just right and the pork apple dish was yummy, much better than the dry chewy crap at The Bacchanal. Their hot cherries were good. I think it's hilarious how they have sushi.\n\nService was average as far as buffets go. Our server came to our table so infrequently that we had to place our finished dishes on a nearby table. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed the food and would probably go again. Lots of quality desserts and meats to choose from is always a bonus for me."
4,I went out to Outback for a light snack. I was seated promptly without any delays. My server was very attentive and helpful with the menu. I ordered the side salad along with the soup for the day. The salad was fresh and crisp and I promise they have the best garlic croutons. The soup was better than I expected it was a creamy onion and cheese soup. And of course they brought out their famous bread and butter!
4,"Great place for a quick, healthy bite, featuring flatbreads, wraps, panninis, salads, soups...even quesadillas!  No matter what you choose, you know exactly how many calories are in each (the calorie count is next to each menu item). \n\nI devoured the chipotle chicken wrap (380 calories). The veggies were plentiful and fresh, and the flatbread was the perfect thickness--soft but not flimsy. The chipotle sauce was flavorful, with just the right amount of heat.  My only complaint is the smaller portion of chicken--more is always better.  Try the peppadew hot sauce on your meal!  Wayyyyy better than Tabasco. \n\nIt would be PERFECT if there was one located closer to Scottsdale...So many tasty options, all at very reasonable prices--$5 got me the wrap, a drink and my choice of chips, a cookie or a brownie.  Beat that, Subway!"
4,"They have an amazingly primo location, right next to ASU and all those local businesses.  They actually have a good amount of seating and easily accessible parking!  This alone practically makes the place 4 star worthy.  What nails it is the staff.  Everyone has been professional, friendly and super helpful.  I've seen folks who forgot to take all their cream cheeses, and they'll remind them they are entitled to them in the deal.  So many places would just let you leave.  \n\nNotice I haven't mentioned their food yet?  Well, there is a reason. It is 100% ok.  I've never gotten anything bad - ever.  But nothing has been great either.  Average menu options, with some nice choices.  Bagels are ok, but nothing to write home about.  One of my favorite things is that for a sandwich you can upgrade your bagel to a wrap, artisan bread or a \""softwich\"" which is like a bagel but softer and square.  \n\nIt's never going to be a bad choice, and the super service will have you leaving with a smile on your face."
4,"A good locals bar.\n\nYou can tell it's a good bar when bartenders from other bars come to gamble and hang out.  The food is good, gambling is good and the bartenders are good.  My second time there I hit $400 on Keno and the third time $200 in video poker.  One of the few bars I'm still up on!\n\nThe bar area has a dozen or so spots without a machine so you can belly up without gambling and they have a few booths on one side and a few high-top tables on the other."
4,"I haven't eaten here yet, but would give five stars for the view alone!  My dad and I went to the Duquesne Incline and then had some time to burn before his flight home, so we stopped next door at the Grandview Saloon for a beer and to hang out for a bit.\n\nThe patio is fantastic with a wonderful view of the rivers, and you can watch the incline go up and down.  They had a decent selection of beer (although we were uncreative and went with Yuengling) that was nice and cold and reasonably priced given the location.  Our server was prompt and friendly.\n\nI'm guessing there's more interesting food options in downtown Pittsburgh, but I'd definitely stop here for the view again, especially with visitors."
4,"I love this place, great food and atmosphere, but on my last visit wasn't impress with new addition to menu"
4,This place is so mix fun. The food is great and the people here are a blast. The only negative is they don't have deserts. This place screams s'mores and twinkee's but all they have is fruit. Regardless... Amaze balls!
4,"Very impress of this new restaurant inside SLS Las Vegas; Contemporary and quite chic Tapas style.  Decor is tasty and elegantly put together; Service was pretty good as well. The dishes are perfectly proportioned and delicious...  Watermelon & Feta Avocado, Spiced Nuts, Cucumber salad is a must; don't forget their assorted Hummus and their oyster too. Their pita bread was freshly baked and it was perfect.\n\nCant wait to go back; someday.  Definitely will recommend to anyone planning to visit Vegas.  Glad that we got to try this during our visit."
4,"Ryan J brought me out here and, yes, I brought my A game--went ahead and ordered the Bear: peanut butter, cracker jacks, bacon, gouda and BBQ sauce. It was state-fair-what-did-I-Just-Do? awesome. So good. \n\nThe carneys selling overpriced knitting nearby were odd--but we liked the lamps the guys recreating Mad Men were pimping out there.\n\nI don't know anything about these Short Leash Dogs people--but they clearly have something dialed in. The Bear dog was part of some contest put on by the Arizona Diamondbacks. They won, so now it's become a big deal for them.\n\nRyan J got a different dog. And as he reviewed nearly two years ago: you gotta \""unleash your hot dog inhibitions\"" to get into this place.\n\nWho has hot dog inhibitions? Dumb people, that's who."
4,"Been here twice.  $27 for dinner all you can eat.  Sushi is good - not fantastic, but not bad - comparable to almost anywhere else.  What is fun - the fact you can order and order and order - since you can get half roll (maki) you can really eat a lot of sushi and try everything.  Pay attention to the black board to the right of the sushi bar - with specials.  Salmon Belly was available one night - super fantastic.  Super White Tuna - fantastic. Salmon and Hamachi really good.  Scallop - good. Conch, Halibut and Sweet Shrimp - were just OK.  Lots of desserts included. Sea Weed Salad, things other than sushi are included but you order with your waiter and not the sushi chefs.  Sit at the sushi counter - fun and they just wait on you attentively - asking you what you like and giving you whatever you want.   Spicy Tuna crackers everyone raves about - didn't seem that special. Everyone raves about the Pork Belly - was OK.  But hey - its included so try it.  Service is good.  Sitting at the Sushi Bar - much better because you have the sushi guy right there asking you what you want all the time. Fun to take a friend and just go thru all the sushi you can possibly go thru."
4,"Love this place! Friendly staff. Good prices. Lots of \""locals\"" constantly in here. Great desserts and cakes that are never frozen. Red Velvet Cake was incredible! And now they have DONUTS?!"
4,"My husband and I have stayed at Harrahs a few times. This time we brought our kids and booked a \""classic\"" 2 queen bed room. This room is actually much quieter and bigger then their \""high roller\"" or \""premium\"" rooms, which is weird. There is no desk but there is a little table with 2 chairs. It's not fully updated but honestly it's not bad at all. I would book this room again if we had a choice of the other rooms. I didn't give 5 stars because the bathroom tub kept dripping water. It wasn't loud or anything but it was a minus."
4,"Fianlly a happy hour that made me happy.\n\nIf you want some great food and drinks on a current economy budget the daily 5-7 happy hr may be a good choice for you.\n\n$5 specialty drinks including a pomitini poured at the table. This drink was quite good and yes girly.\n\n$5 appetizers including a great seared Ahi with a Jicama carrot salad. The Ahi has well spiced and of decent quality.\n\nThere are other $5 options as well.\n\n$6 burger that looked huge and induced 2 onion rings and a challa roll for a bun. \n\nThere also is a $12 ahi burger that is more of a croquet style with 2 onion rings or a portobello burger too.\n\nThis happy hr is available at the bar era, or in the more relaxed patio. There are heaters on the patio for the cooler nights.\n\nWith thees prices we kept eating, and eating and yes eating. We left stuffed on great food.\n\nI recommended a side of the saluted mushrooms of the menu as they really enhance any meal."
4,"Having La Cerise just down the road from work is both a blessing and a curse... a curse in the sense that I want to lunch from here far too often than is good for the budget!\n\nThe service is always friendly, the food is always fantastic, the coffee is pretty good and they make their own ice cream on site.. what's not to like??!!\n\nI think their prices are quite reasonable as well for the quality of food you get. All their sandwich options you can have in your choice of panini, croissant, wrap or bun.  There's usually a soup of the day, pasta of the day (often lasagne or mac & cheese) as well as a vege option of the day.\n\nIf you're in the area, don't hesitate to pop in for a bite!"
4,"Who knew it covered 122 acres?! Huge park with lots to do for any outdoor activity. There's a lake as well and some drainage system or something, but I like to think it's a submarine top. \n\nGreat looking basketball courts! They have tennis courts across Park Road. The children's play area looks good too. I'm sure they have some great softball games on their 4 fields. I was seriously impressed with all the different areas (you can tell from the road that all of this exists!)!!\n\nThe one thing that I think others have mentioned, is the upkeep. Perhaps due to funding, it could have more maintenance. \n\nAlso, there is a recycling drop off in one of the corners off of the softball fields. Cool.\n\nYelp has this location in Ballyntyne, but it's in the South Park area on Park Road, just south of Tyvola/Fairview."
4,"My first venture in here, I wasn't sure what to think.  It felt difficult to get attention for service.  But then it warmed up.  The staff turned out to be very friendly and helpful.  The whisky list is monstrous and the food is pretty good.  I ended up coming back a few times during my visit and standing around the bar and listening to music was a most enjoyable way to kill a few hours (and brain cells).  \n\nWhen someone says \""Whiski\"", there's Whiski Bar and Restaurant and then their sister establishment, Whiski rooms.  While related, don't confuse the two."
4,"Corey is the man!!!!!!\n\nIt was first time in Snots-dale or some even call it Snobs-dale, AZ for the SF Giants spring training and my girlfriends and I really had an Amazing time at Majerle's Sports Grill.....\n\nWe walked in based on the fact that we were hungry, the music and vibe of the place was what we wanted to start the night with. I especially loved the fact that this spot had about 25 huge Samsung flat screens on every wall ( a real sports grill better have a tv on every wall)!!!!! \n\nThe food, the service, and especially the manager/DJ ( Corey) really made it that much more of a hot spot throughout the night for my gf's and I that we could NOT seem to leave. We celebrated  Stephanie G's 29th b-day like a bunch of classy GIRLS GONE WILD that night! \n\nI can't wait to visit the staff and dance the night away while watching the BEST hip hop and r&b videos on all those awesome TV's!!! \n\nUntil next year Majerle's =)"
4,"I've only been here for work dinners.  If I were paying my own check, I'd probably choose a different restaurant, as I feel it's a bit overpriced for the quality of the food.  (It is Vegas, however, and everything is expensive, so...).   The restaurant entrance and lobby are quite nice - the wine tower makes for an eye-catching centerpiece to the main dining room.  Service has been attentive, though a bit slow paced.  We had no difficulty getting the attention of our server when I've dined here.  I suspect some people may interpret a leisurely pace as \""poor service.\""  Each time I've dined here, my server frequently came through to fill water and wine glasses, see if anything was needed, and to ensure we were enjoying our dinners.  I also found them to be very accommodating, for example, making some substitutions even though I had ordered from a prix fixe menu.   All in all, I have had good experiences here."
4,"I'm not a whisky drinker and in fact, even the smell of it makes me feel sick. I worked for a catering company when I was at school and I remember having to walk around with trays of various different whiskies for people to take. Every single person asked me which was which and even though I should have arranged them in a manner that made it easy to remember - I didn't. So ended up just making whiskies up... I wasn't fooling anyone. After my whisky experience I still really am none the wiser about any of them but I've bought a few bottles in my time for retirement presents and such.\n\nThis store is jam packed and looks very traditional, with all kind of whiskies, they also have other spirits too including a good selection of gins (my favourite), I guess whisky is their speciality though and I'm sure whatever whisky you're looking for you'll find it in here. Great for a souvenir from Scotland, a gift for a whisky drinker or great if you just fancy treating yourself to  fancy new bottle of your favourite whisky."
4,"The breakfast food here is so good! The scrambled eggs were nice and fluffy, the bacon was crispy, the hash browns were also crispy and had a nice crunch on the edges but fluffy \""inside,\"" and both types of sausages were yummy. I also had a bowl of wonton soup which had a tasty broth and good wontons but I could do without all the bean sprouts. They also had shrimp noodle soup, pho, and miso soup. I had a bite of one of the sandwiches, which was pretty tasty. I didn't try any of the sushi, other  Asian food, BBQ, or salads, but they looked pretty good as well. For dessert, I would recommend the chocolate covered strawberries and cannolis! Super yummy!\n\nThis was the only buffet that I went to while in Vegas so I can't compare to any others. But I would say that it's a pretty good option if you're staying at TI and don't want to walk to another buffet and pay $30-40+. This one was only $25 I believe and you can get a coupon for two for one, which is a great deal!"
4,I really enjoy going to this place!!  It looks like a little hole in the wall but the food is great!  As well as the service!  It's close to my boyfriends work and that's how I found out about it!  Everyone he works with raves about their salsa!  And it is de-lish!  Every day they have lunch specials and it's very affordable.  They also have outside seating which is nice.
4,sometime i'm in the mood for some hard packed ice cream. not this frozen yogurt or frozen custard stuff. just good old fashioned ice cream. this place has very good quality ice cream. chocolate dipped waffle cone was a decent enough to hold my delicious ice cream. they have a bunch off different flavors so i order whatever i feel like.
4,"I introduced this joint to my five companions on my most recent trip to Sin City and they immediately made it their dining choice every night (i should say morning..) for the remainder of the trip.\n\nYou can't go wrong coming to this place, unless you try to eat at around 7pm. In that case, expect a 75min wait for the best value restaurant in the county."
4,Went back for a second time to get the Irish coffee on a cold late afternoon.  The place was empty and there for the service was great.   The bartender was engaging and extremely knowledgeable about whiskey and even gave us some pointers about how to have a better experience and enjoy the whiskey properly.   The place itself is small  but let's not forget that it is inside a sea container but the patio during the afternoon is delightful and make a great perch to watch the playground.   The Boozery is the ONLY BAR IN LAS VEGAS that serves products from our very own Las Vegas Distillery!!!      So go enjoy this unique bar in the very unique setting of container park....
4,"I looove sammiches and Jersey Mike's does a great job of making some good ones.\n\nLocated right next to Firefly, JM serves up some great sandwiches in their own way. Jersey has either cold or hot subs, and everything is cut and sliced fresh in front you like like Port of Subs. They don't have baked subs but they do have a grill for their phillys.\n\nI came in and ordered the Club supreme or whatever they call it... The sandwich was great, they sliced a ton of meat on to it, the toppings were perfect and the bacon was suuuuper crispy. On top of that, the service was great! People who work here were real nice. The friends I came with had a the Chicken Parm hot sandwich, though it sounded good, it came out to a hot mess literally.\n\nThey def get points for offering a UNLV discount, but beware showing up at lunch time! They can get packed."
4,"As the name suggests, this little-known Greek restaurant in Tollcross prides itself on serving up authentic, tasty, homemade Greek food - and plenty of it.\n\nRun by a Scottish couple who have just returned from living in Kefalonia, this restaurant is definitely worth a visit.\n\nMy partner and I went on a whim one evening and nearly all the tables were booked, which is always a reassuring sign. Instead of attempting to choose from the extensive a la carte menu, we opted for a selection of mezzes from the starter menu instead: home-made humus, taramasalata, tzatziki, huge juicy olives and a portion of deliciously crispy whitebait. \n\nWith an unlimited supply of crusty bread and a great value house wine, it was a gorgeous meal."
4,"Myriad of slice options during the week here, with fewer on the weekends but still good.  Pizza is a general NY style, nothing spectacular or memorable, but still solidly good.  Crust at the end is deliciously chewy inside with crispness on the outside.  Sicilian crust isn't as good here, in my opinion.  Prices good for lunch specials, but ordering a few pizzas with various toppings can get quite expensive."
4,"My husband and I visit Viva Mercado's often.  The wait staff is attentive and very friendly.  Our drinks are never empty! The complimentary soup they serve is very good! And I also love the chips and salsa/bean dip.  The chips are always fresh and crispy.  I love their chimichanga's and my husband is partial to the fajitas that come to the table still sizzling.  If you haven't tried this place yet, you're missing out!"
4,"Wow, what a great Mexican place! The most amazing collection of sauces I've ever seen. Their homemade sauce was enough though, the food is very tasty, and the price is certainly right. Fish tacos FTW!"
4,Just had dinner last night here.  The Pinot Grigio just ok BUT THE FOOD was really good.  I would receomend this resturant to anyone.
4,"Great steak fajitas!!! I was super hungry after a night of cocktails & craps..I like the liveband and the decor, we'll def be back next time."
4,"I loooooveeeee the Prime Rib here is very tender and tasty. \n\nI made reservations through OpenTable to avoid waiting in line since I could get very impatient standing in a long line. So yes, my friend and I have avoided the long line and we went through the \""VIP\"" door where we checked in, paid, and got seated right away. \n\nOur server came up to our table right away to take our drink order and we've proceeded to getting our food. The moment I saw Prime Rib... I've patiently waited for the people in front of me to get their cut and make up their minds about which sauce to put. Next, I went to their seafood area and there was a horde of people taking all the crab legs which I find very annoying... because hello people you're not the only ones at the buffet to take all of those crab legs. I left but I had an intention to go back for my second round of plate. \n\nI saw the dessert selections and I love their french macaroons the most... the same person taking all the crab legs was behind me so I took all the chocolate french macaroons.. I mean seriously there was only 5 left lol payback I guess?\n\nIn the end... I got my crab legs and left a happy camper. Our server was very quick and attentive filling up our waters and other drinks. NOMNOMS"
4,I think i have yelped their other location on Mill.\n\nThis one is exponentially better because there are no crazies or drunk college students here. YAY!\n\nI normally get pretty standard flavors here. Nothing fancy. I got the naranja and my wife the coconut (don't know the name of that one). They were good as we knew they would be and expected them to be.\n\nThey have stickers all over their wall that you can slap one up there. mine is the upside down one on the speaker.
4,"This place kind of just fell into my lap while walking around our office building. This place has REALLY good food if you are into heavy, flavorful meals. My favorite to get here is the Jambalaya. SO GOOD. This location is a very small location, but worth standing in line for if you wanted to try it. It's constantly packed, so make sure you are okay with waiting for a spot."
4,"The pho here is not the best that I've had, but it's most likely one of the best pho restaurants on Spring Mountain. I was born and raised in San Jose which is home to the largest Vietnamese population in the country so I have a good idea on what good pho is. The single most important factor is the broth which gives it the flavor, and I'm happy to say that Kinh Do has a great pho broth.\n\nI don't care for beef too much, so I order chicken pho like I normally do and it has been great every time. The bean sprouts + basil leaves are fresh and those go well with the meal. Like I mentioned already, the broth here is awesome. The service could be better though...sometimes I have to flag down a waiter to get my water refilled."
4,"I have been to St Francis several times and really love it but I had one dish that simply blew me away. The forbidden rice bowl-wow-flavors just explode in your mouth.\nI had chicken added for protein-the dish came to the table so fresh-with perfectly cooked veggies in season, the rice was beyond tasty and the shredded chicken the perfect compliment. The real star is the sauce-delicate,aromatic, light.\nI ate most of it for lunch then took home the leftover and and had a light dinner.\nI never eat the same thing twice in a day but this is the type f dish I could eat weekly.\nThinking about going back soon..."
4,"So this place re-opens under new management as the all-new Wet'n'Wild water park in a week or two.  Sounds awesome if you look at their website and interactive map and a preview of all the thrill rides.  The landscaping looks to be much better too.  It's about time the hottest, fastest-growing and fifth largest city in the nation had an A-List theme park when SoCal has about ten alone!  When I see the Travel Chanel's \""Top Ten U.S. Water Parks\"" they blow all of ours away.  I hope they re-engineer the wave pool with rolling waves, so that you can ride them like at Big Surf, instead of the intermittent \""undulation\"" it had here before and at Golfland Sunsplash in Mesa.\n\nAlthough it wasn't opened its first year by June, it will run all the way until the end of October and season passes are discounted at $59.99 before opening day.  They can be purchased at their website address: http://phoenix.mywetnwild.com/\n\nFor the latest info regarding their grand opening and a chance to win free season passes you can also follow them through Twitter at http://twitter.com/wetnwildphx and become a friend on Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/pages/Phoenix-AZ/Wet-n-Wild-Waterpark/84174876135."
4,"fancy fancy. i love fancy food i love fancy restaurants. we made reservations here on a friday night and decided to order the tasting menu and added foie gras cause who doesnt love that?! add in a bottle of wine and your dinner is now expensive but delicious. \n\nthe annoying part was that valet was not complimentary but was $13! once you enter, they have a closet for your jackets so that's nice. \n\nthe food itself was delicious and the presentation fantastic. but it just wasn't one of the best that i've been to. the service was good. we had a few. one was very descriptive and answered all our questions. some were just hard to understand :( and when youre at a fancy restaurant i like to know what im eating\n\nmenu degustation - $92 each \nfoie gras degustation - addt'l $12 each \nbaron louis bottle of red wine - $80"
4,Always a great meal. The food is out of this world. One of my fave places in the East End.
4,Great affordable place and all the food is very fresh. I visit a lot as it is close to my house. Tried quite a few menu items but my favourites are the rare beef and brisket soup and their mixed dumplings and imperial rolls. Yum :)
4,"This food here is pretty good. I give it 4 stars because I have had better Chinese food in other cities, but for Phoenix (which lacks quality Chinese food in general) it is actually quite good. The fried rice is OK, could be better (more fried)....it tends to be a bit more on the steamed side. The Mongolian beef is good but it's not seared/crispy the way I like it. The flavor is still very good though. The Lo Mein is quite good as well. The fried spring rolls that come with the lunch specials leave a little bit to be desired. Overall I do enjoy the food here very much. For Phoenix, it is quite good. Prices are reasonable as well. I recommend it."
4,I had the BBQ chicken pizza which was very good.  I think the extra topping prices are a little high and it would be nice if they had some more options but overall pretty good.
4,"This is definitely a unique vegas spot, something everyone should try at least once. Took my brother and my girlfriend here on our last vegas trip and was able to handle about 2 hours inside the cold. Girls- dress warm, not cute. You will freeze if you come in a black dress. Guys- drink some beforehand. The drinks are good and strong, but you don't feel them as much because you're freezing your ass off. Fun place with a great staff"
4,"Levant just opened in the uptown Mint Museum building. In the side of the building, actually, directly across from the Knight Theater's massive outdoor screen. It's owned by the same folks that own and run Kabob Grill. I've only been once, and it was for take-out, but it was delicious. Everyone was really eager to help. My wrap was hot and fresh. And when I brought it back to the office, it smelled so good that people from all over the office came by to see check things out. \n\nI ordered the Kafta wrap. The hummus tasted really fresh, and the beef was tender and flavorful. The fries were nice, too. Crispy on the outside and seasoned just right. \n\nI'll definitely try it again, next time for eat-in. This end of downtown Charlotte has really become energized with all sorts of new places to eat. I wish them plenty of success."
4,"We tried this place after remembering that this new sandwich shop had opened.  We are glad that a Vietnamese sandwich shop is now closer to home.  The other reviews said they had a long wait so I was expecting it,  but there was no wait at all.  Maybe 2 minutes at the most.  That was a pleasant surprise.  We were the only ones there also. \n\nI had the sliced pork sandwich. #7.  I liked the way the meat was seasoned.  The veggies tasted fresh.\n\nWife had the Mekong special.  #11. We tried each other's sandwich. She liked hers better and I like mine better.  The difference between us is I like to taste the meat in the sandwich I eat.  She is happy with tasting veggies. \n\nI would definitely come here again and recommend it."
4,"A great Starbucks in a great community. The staff is friendly, the music is amazing, and the energy there is just great. My only complaint? Finding parking is kind of a pain."
4,"Was really pleased with the little hotel.  Great location directly across from Hard Rock, rooms were nice, staff was fantastic.  Pool was nice.  My only complaint is they didn't have a pack n play.  Granted they are not really a kid hotel.  We had a baby with us So we went and bought a pack n play for the night.  Really liked that they welcomed our dog.  Food and waitstaff was great."
4,What an eclectic menu for a diner!  The ambiance is just what you would expect from a classic 60's diner.  I had a ruben and some fries and it was really good!  Most places use processed corned beef.  Theirs was real sliced beef...very tender and very flavorful.  Probably the best ruben I have ever had.  I had to try the pie too since they tease you with a great display right when you walk in.  The French silk was really rich and chocolaty.  Definately worth the stop if you are in the area or passing through.
4,"These can't be sandwiches!! It's preposterous how delicious they are. And when you're in need of something to munch on at 4am, Earl's got your back. For my three day stay in Vegas, I've eaten here three times (all these times, sober). I tried the club sandwich, the carribean jerk, and the tomato soup. I can't deny bacon in anything, so the club sandwich was definitely a win. The carribean jerk sandwich had an amazing spread to it, packed a powerful kick with some tender loving. I've named the carribean jerk sandwich my favorite of all time. The tomato soup is topped with freshly baked croutons and is the right amount of creamy. I'd say the soup itself is filling for a light lunch. \n\nCheap, fresh, delicious."
4,"Yummy! So this is what 'real corn beef hash' should look like and taste? I've only been here for breakfast, now I have to try their lunch & dinner. If you go there for breakfast, get their early or expect to wait. It's a small and popular place."
4,Took my buddy here the other day to nurse a hangover. Great food. Reasonably priced. Definitely did the job for us. They are open til 2pm serving breakfast. Friendly staff. They brought us pitchers of our drinks so we didn't have to chase a waitress down everytime we wanted a refill. I like that.
4,"Never stayed in the rooms I eat there and the Grand Cafe is fab, the price is okay, the portions suits the price. However the food tastes great. \n  I don't do the buffet often but when I do I have never had any complaints. Nice selection. and if you have a Players Card you can get a good deal. \n  Yes its a casino so its smokey and there is no real non smoking place. The smoke is everywhere, its Vegas Baby.  The machines are pretty good, run when you win is my advice. Lol. \n   As for the service Its not easy to find someone to help, the cutbacks seem to still be in effect. Little tip, those guys in suits with badges, grab one. lol.\n   The Station Casinos love Locals!!!"
4,"Our group of six Shared the following items; Duck fat fries, meatballs, pork belly, mussles, pappardelle, lamb carpaccio, dates, octopus, beets, porchetta, guinea fowl.  Dessert we had Cheese cake custard bread pudding and port tawny.\n\nTop choices for the group were duck fat fries, pork belly, and the dates.  These were all outstanding.\n\nThe rest of the items were very good except the lamb.  I don't recommend ordering the lamb.  It was slimy, tasteless, and way over priced.\n\nThe service was good.  Our server did a great job recommending a wine that I really enjoyed.  Bill was close to 300.00 for all of the food and several drinks plus dessert.  I thought this was reasonable.\n\nI would definitely come here again."
4,"Two Reviews in One!\n\nThe Mill is REAL Cool!  Should get 5 yelp stars for being Cool!  Still it could be better and hopefully will eventually actualize its potential!\n\nHere are my favorite parts of the Mill :\n\nBig Ben British Pub\nZucca Pizza\nSavory Spice the Spice Shop!\nHas Had a GREAT Gallery Space (thanks to Mr. Elder)\n\n\nMarket? My Favorite places at the Mill are NOT the Market, though the Market is still worth a visit, it will not take long to see it...  Market has Potential, Great looking Spot!  Though I have not been on the Weekend, During the Week lots of Vendors are not \""maning\"" their booths and\n\nThese were my Favorites (in Order): :\n\n1).  Pickleville \n\n2).  Cloister Honey\n\n3).  Simply Local had:  Uncle Scott Root Beer!\n                                         Chocolate Bars from:  \""French Broad\""(Asheville), Black Mountain Chocolate (Black Mountain,NC) and Escazu (Raleigh)!\n\n                                          Muscadine Juices... the one I bought was about 2.75 stars, better than a few, though no where near the best!  Not enough flavor!"
4,Great atmosphere with the French maitre d'. The food is nothing special but the atmosphere always makes us go back. Fixed menu is good value. Mostly have to book as it gets very busy.
4,My wife and I had breakfast here while staying at the Wigwam. The coffee was great. We both ordered omelets which were good sized and packed with ingredients. Very tasty and a good atmosphere.
4,this is a great place for those who enjoy looking at art and an alright place for a student like me to learn about art as a requirement for class. \n\nThis gallery was by far... the most attention grabbing because of its electric show... although I didn't understand the concept of it all... I really enjoyed my time there... I got some great photos from the trip... so it was a worth that much :)
4,"Had brunch here today and my breakfast food was as good as ever. Brady was our server and he was great: always checking on us but never bothering our conversation. Good job, Brady!"
4,"I've only eaten here once so far but I like it.  I had the Thai Peanut sandwich and the tomato basil soup.  I thought the sandwich was very good and unlike the other review regarding the tomato basil soup, I really enjoyed it.  The food is good and I enjoy the colorful appearance from the outside.  In fact, that's what drew me to the place.  I'm usually on my way to Paradise Bakery or Firehouse Subs when I'm in this parking lot but the flashy and colorful lights drew us in and we liked what we found inside."
4,Ambiance: Excellent\nRoom: Excellent\nService/Concierge: Excellent\nParking: Reasonable\nLocation: Excellent\nOne can get a good price for this place if planning properly. The location is good but could be better its a short  walk to the main shopping area and restaurants area. There is plenty of parking and the service is great as always with the Delta Chain of hotels. You can park on the street if you want but I would be wary considering what I have seen in Montreal Downtown. We were upgraded to the Signature Club room which allows you access to the Signature Lounge.Continental breakfast and complimentary hors d'oeuvre are served in the Lounge. Great for someone like me who wants a quick coffee fix. Being a Delta Hotel fan I would recommend it any day. This hotel can get busy and sometimes you have a rowdy crowd so I would recommend a higher floor if you can manage it.
4,"This place is great if you have a big appetite and love meat. There's whole salad bar with artichokes, caprese salad, calamari salad, etc, which is a tasty accompaniment to the meal. I got the seafood plate with shrimp, scallops, grilled salmon, and \""tempura\"" cod. The salmon was a little dry and the cod too oily, but the shrimp and bacon wrapped scallops were good. I wouldn't recommend the seafood plate.\n\nMy boyfriend got the all you can eat meat instead. This was clearly the better choice. There was an assortment of lamb, sirloin, chicken etc. My favorite was the lamb with balsamic reduction, very tender and flavorful. My boyfriend loved the spicy chicken. Succulent, delicious meat.\n\nWe saved by using the Tix4tonite ($24)."
4,"Gorgeous hotel and the room are HUGE.  We came xmas eve/xmas day on a special.  My partner got a letter with a great offer. 299.00 for 2 nights, 2 tickets to Le Reve( premium seating), and 2 buffets( breakfast or lunch).  When I booked, I asked if the special was available during xmas and was told Yes.  I was happy to see a 96.00 food credit because we were charged 50.00 for xmas eve dinner.  \n\nI don't agree with the resort fee since we didn't partake in anything else except for the internet.  I would have just rather paid the internet fee.  \n\nI had a small issue with not having our room cleaned, but everything else was good..   My partner was thrilled that her name showed up on the tv screen. We did have an issue with the a/c.  we turned it to 65, but it barely cooled the bedroom party of the suite.  We both slept nakey, because we were so hot."
4,Large cake portions. Good selection of macaroons. But I thought the almond croissant was way too sweet. I love my sweets but that was just unbearably sweet and I couldn't even finish the small portion. The almond croissant from La Belle Terre was much much better.
4,Was here for breakfast the other day. Food was good and the service was excellent and quick!\n\nFood: 4\nService: 5\n\nOverall: 4.5 rounds down
4,"This was a great discovery in the South Side. It is not your typical South Side bar (which is a very good thing in my mind), and it has surprisingly good food! I think it is smoke free too, which makes it all the more appealing. I highly recommend stopping by for some sliders the next time you are in the area!"
4,"I must give it up for Wolfman. As a former resident of California, their pizza is no more \""California\"" than is Taco Bell, but I imagine they're going for the comparison to California Pizza Kitchen.\n\nWe love the White Wolf. I also enjoy the pizza with the chicken, spinach and fine herbs. The crusts walk that line between thick and thin very well. I know that folks have crust preferences (NY style, Chicago style, etc), but this might be a crust which embraces all pizza eaters.\n\nThe appetizers are great for handling a very hungry table anxiously waiting for the pizza, though not really all that memorable. \n\nThe individual-sized salads are really enough for two to split, and the large size could serve three or more. If it is just the two of you, ask for the individual size and an extra plate, along with the dressing on the side (they often have a pretty heavy hand with the dressing).\n\nNIce folks serving, though the speed of delivery of the food can vary with no discernible reason (e.g., restaurant not really busy, off-peak time, etc). Good selection of beers, and some nightly specials (check their website for details of that night's deal). Seating available outside, which can be a nice touch on a good evening."
4,"This place has a great patio PLUS a great selection of microbrews.  I loved the setup of this place- great front and back patio-dog friendly too.  The back patio setup is awesome.  Great view of Camelback Mountain and the bicycle wall with the tires that are fans is super cool!  We came on Father's Day and for their BBQ Sunday special and we were not disappointed.  The special was great, huge portions.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  Our waitress gave great recommendations and did not steer us wrong. Can't wait to go back!"
4,"Great venue for a wedding - I attended a couple of weddings here and the chapel is very quaint.  If you like historic little places with lots of character and don't want to get married in an actual church, this is a great option. It is also centrally located between midtown & uptown districts, which is nice if you have people coming from out of town or simply from different sides of town. There is a beautiful garden outdoors with lots of trees and a sweet little gazebo which is perfect for those wedding photos."
4,"This show is different from every other Cirque du Soleil show I've ever seen.  Be prepared - this is an adult show with nudity and very adult themes.  There were a few uncomfortable moments with the performances, but on the whole, it's still a very visually stunning show.  As always, the costumes are incredible.  The music is perfect.  The acts are all very inventive and the performers are amazing.  \nSimple words of warning - Don't bring your parents or grandparents."
4,"Great little (and only) Cambodian restaurant in phoenix. Great variety of food and friendly service. Very clean and inviting interior full of Cambodian decor, there are even some Cambodian books on each of the tables to look at while you dine.\n\nIf you like Thai and Vietnamese food this place is basically a fusion of the two. I tried the Loat Cha noodles and they were excellent, with beef and eggs . Only downside was the small portion, would have expected a bit more for the price. For desert I tried the corn. Although to most people corn would be part of the main course this treat was essentially a roasted corn on the cob smothered in a sugary, and fish sauce type glaze. It was excellent and a great alternative to a typical desert item.\n\n\nPlace was a bit hard to find the restaurant name was on the side of a building and not facing the street, and the entrance to park is off to the side of a mechanic shop which is not very apparent."
4,"We used a groupon for my wife and I and enjoyed the massage/detox. They didn't short us any time and the only comment I would make is to communicate if the masseuse is too strong. They will happily cater to your needs and we left feeling relaxed and refreshed. They massaged our heads, necks, shoulders, arms, feet, and legs. Overall we were very happy."
4,"My roommate and I broke our strict diets today for a Thai craving and we were happy we did!\nThe restaurant was really quiet tonight, as most downtown places usually are on Monday nights, so we got quick, friendly service. I ordered the swimming rama, which was beef in peanut sauce over steamed veggies. Yum! Very tasty, and would definitely order again. Roomie got pad pik sod, which was mixed vegetables and jalepenos with chicken. Watch out this one was spicy but sooo flavorful! He loves spicy food and his eyes were a little glassy through the meal, but by the end we were both members of the clean plate club. Our dining partners got yellow chicken curry and tom yum soup, which looked amazing as well. \nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is open and clean, if a bit sterile. Prices were reasonable about $10-15 for most plates. My entree was definitely enough for me to return, but everyone else's food looked so good too, I might have to try something new next time!..... but for now back to our diets :|"
4,This place is the bomb!  Food portions are huge and the quality is consistent... Recommend the mixed plate or Katsu/Teri beef combo with Mac salad!  I wonder sometimes if the owner is a local or just bought the franchise... But so far food is good representation of what you get in Hawaii.
4,"I have had their Brisket on several occasions, pretty good stuff, I am a BBQ fanatic, if I like it, you may love it, I have tried BBQ from some of the best cooks in the world... that being said, this stuff is pretty damn good... try it for yourself"
4,"Tr\u00e8s bien pour passer prendre un caf\u00e9 croissant et lire! Avec les smorrebread au menu il pourrait remplacer notre regrett\u00e9 Ellefsen! Situ\u00e9 dans Ahuntsic, les jours de semaines ne semblent pas hyper achaland\u00e9s, mais le weekend c'est apparemment tr\u00e8s courru pour le brunch, le pain et les viennoiseries!"
4,this is an update on the last review...again great service from the drive thru. I didnt have to ask for any extra stuff with my meal. Drive thru worker (host) Guillermo was on point and did a good job expediting my order...just want to give him proper recognition for insuring i had a good meal. my order was a dinner order and it took place on Nov 15th 2013 at 642pm. Once again del taco goes the job right and puts most drive thru fast food resturants to shame!
4,The Kona coffee is a personal favorite for my coffee for my hubby.  We love the banana crepes and Monte Cristo.  I also love the Chicken strip salad!
4,"Whenever we go to a Coyotes game or a concert @ Jobing.com Arena, we stop by this location to grab some grub and pre-game Brewskies.  If you plan to come here pre-game, be prepared for a long wait.  We average 30-45 min every time we come here before a game.\n\nWhat can I say about Yard House that hasn't already been said?  I love their Beer selection and food.\n\nMy favorite dish is of course the Sliders ($10.85).  When they have it, I get the Green Flash IPA ($7) to wash it down.\n\nOverall, it's a great place to be just before a Coyotes game.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%"
4,Would have a had a 5-star if the wait and service was better.\n\nFood is amazing. They deliver on the twisted farm food promise.  \n\nThe fried sage fried chicken and the chicken and waffles were very impressive.
4,I'm here a few times a week with my dog (the large dog side). Considering the craziness that takes place at most dog parks this one is pretty relaxed. Most of the dog owners here are pretty responsible here handling their dogs and cleaning up after them. It's super convenient and has a lot of space for all the large dogs.
4,"There are lots of great restaurants near Phoenix area, as a Chinese student, I would like to say the Szechwan palace can represent the authentic Chinese food.  I ordered Mopo Tofu, Chongqing Hotpot and Boiled beef and fish today. All dishes are really spicy and I really love it."
4,"After a day traveling around Edinburgh, Wings was the perfect snack to fill my American wing-loving desires. Good atmosphere. They had a movie marathon going on downstairs. Service was pretty good too. I had a magner's and dancing in the bleu flame (hot bleu cheese)! I'll be coming back sooner rather than later! :)"
4,"The people working at this store are awesome- they remembered me the both times I went in.  I will drive to this Autozone over the others because they are so friendly.  There was a line both times, but with the summer heat in AZ, a lot of people needed new batteries.  Bottom line- great Autozone!"
4,"Now that I have slept on the floor here, I feel intimately connected.\n\nPluses:\n1. Free wireless!  I'm using it now.\n2. It's now smoke-free!\n\nMinuses:\n1. It's an airport, which means it was designed to be uncomfortable.\n2. I can't find one place where I'm not hearing the Wheel of Fortune slot machine.  Why do you follow me, O Wheel of Fortune slot machine??\n\nAnyway, I've been here for 12 hours, and all I have to say is that I'm desperate for a potted plant.  Any potted plant would do.  I think I'd even cozy up to poison oak.  For now, I'm happy with smoke-free airports, but someday someone is going to get wise and airports will have botanic gardens.  Then we won't feel the need to scream while the airlines screw us over and throw our bags into dumpsters."
4,"If it weren't for Yelptern Izzy D and a Monroe-ish Street meeting we had scheduled, I probably would have never come across this place. Glad I did though... glad I did. \n\nI have yet to chow down so I can't speak to their eats... I'll surely nab some nosh and let you know. What I CAN tell you is that the interior is awesome. Super chill, super quirky, but super quaint, so not the place to meet 10 of your besties for coffee. There are two sides, I like the side you enter on because I think it's a bit more active and I dig the furniture sitch. Staff is so welcoming, informative, and isn't quick to rush you out if you're working for a while. Java is solid. \n\nBonus points for having live music every night 5-6. This is what their sign says, this is what their staff says, though I haven't been for tunes yet. \n\nFood and tunes anyone? Let's go!"
4,Recently renovated. Very effective and well-flowing floor plan. The section for well behaved children and brats is located on the complete other side of the building from the rest of the library. Genius!
4,"I like Firebirds.  It is was it is.  Nice environment, reasonable food.  Servers are usually pretty good.  Bartenders are always dead on.\nOnly complaint.... PLEASE take your thumb out of my food when delivering it!!!  Use a tray if you have to.\nNew location is beautiful too."
4,The food here is very unique yummy fusion between Mexican & Chinese. Have to try it to believe it! very laid back & I got to have a glass of wine with my dinner. Im def a fan
4,"Not as good as Persian Room, yet they have really good meat and great service.\n\nHookah is well packed, hookah guys are nice and change out charcoal and maintain regularly. Lots of options.\n\nThey also have live music sometimes. Drinks are pretty good too."
4,"Call it in a head of time. There's always a line and its not fast service by any means. Inside is kind of cramped and outside seating is very limited. Customer service is not where they excel, but I've gotten over it. Getting in and out of the parking lot is always entertaining but well worth all the hassle. \n\nThey have a lot of different pasta salads in their deli case that you can get by the pound, perfect to go along with your sandwich and so far all that I've tried have been delicious."
4,Pasand is under new ownership and the changes already seem good. I went there today expecting the same old stuff. What I got was some truely excellent tasting food. The food was leaps and bounds above the previous food. The spices were much more distinct and flavorful and especially fresh. In talking with the owners they were going to rennovate the run downinside and add some more buffet places. Overall I approve of what has been down to the place especially the food.
4,"I stopped in today for lunch. The staff were nice, service was fast. The food would be what I'd consider a restaurant style bbq. The ribs tasted like they were smoked and dry rubbed, pretty good even though im more a fan of a more vinegary and fatty rib. The cornbread was ok. The hot sauce was a little over powering, not from heat..it just didn't leave any room for the flavor of the meat. Overall good experience but the place was empty...so if you want a bbq place in the South Side..you should probably stop in so they keep their lunch hours."
4,"I dined here on Monday 04/29. I ordered the Korean steak tacos, they were ok but nothing special. The vanilla bean cheesecake however was good. The waitress young lady long blond hair, was very good and attentive."
4,"Freed's Bakery made ordering a custom cake a breeze! It was a week before my friends and I would be going to vegas to celebrate a birthday. They made a delicious red velvet cake and delivered it to the restaurant w/ no hiccups!\n\nWe ordered a red velvet cake w/ irish bailey filling and butter cream frosting. The cake was so moist, the girls and I devoured it.\n\nthanks for everything!"
4,"Best Wishes is another of those alternative, independent gift shops which are very popular in Edinburgh. It sells all sorts, including artsy cards, funky wrapping paper, jewellery, trinkets, make up, and toys which are all excellent stocking filler gifts or something small to give as a birthday present. The gifts are not the cheapest around but they are good quality and the cards are very original, think Clinton's but actually good. \n\nThe store is well laid out, making it easy to find what you are looking for which for me is a huge help, seeing as I often get lost in these type of shops, and end up buried under hundreds of little accessories or being attacked by care bears. The owner was exceptionally helpful as well, offering to wrap everything, and was a cheerful person to have a chat to."
4,"I SO want to give this place 5 stars.  Friendly, delicious and great prices.  \n\nBut...I just can't do 5 stars for a vegan restaurant where the employees hang out outside smoking.  Because now when I order buffalo hummus or yummy grape leave dolmas, I can't help but wonder if the employee just lit up on her break, and grabbed my tahini with nicotine-stained-smokey fingers.  Yuk.  Smoking + cooking?  It's a deal-breaker. Smoking + cooking at a vegan restaurant? Seems like an SNL skit."
4,"Relatively new nail salon in Villeray. Big location, very clean and comfortable. Nice collection of colors to choose from (OPI, Essie, Shellac). They offer 15%  student and elder discount on Mondays and Tuesday. Prices are very competive even without the discount."
4,"I adore this place! It is always packed and the service is wonderful. This is my 3rd visit in 2 months; the portions are huge, the options are endless and the waitstaff is knowledgeable. My only advice is not to order any of the steak menu items. The sirloin was fatty and just bad (one star subtraction). Everything else I have had from sushi to chicken to shrimp has been off the charts delicious and fresh. Grab a few friends, get the sushi boat and prepared to be blown away. A hidden gem that is in our regular rotation. CHECK IT OUT!!!"
4,"This place was surprisingly way better than I thought. Came at 10:40 ish. Paid for breakfast, but got breakfast and lunch. Came in during the transition. Their beef sausage ( different from the breakfast sausage) was very tasty. Also really like their flank steak. The Mexican rice was also very good. You seriously cannot beat the price"
4,The breakfast menu is excellent.  Our group of nine was seated quickly and the service was great.  It's definitely a place I would return to for a brunch date or a special occasion.
4,"Second time I stayed at the Aria was for NYE this year. The table minimums have gone up quite a bit. On the plus side, it keeps the crowds out. But on the down side, I don't want to play $5 chips at Roulette at noon. Despite it being a holiday weekend, I could still find tables at MGM going down to $10, even at night.\n\nThe hotel is nice, but again, my room at MGM Grand is nicer. The Aria room had a bunch of issues. The minibar fridge was broken all weekend so all drinks were hot. We left our room for 7 hours during the day and returned to a dirty room - room service hadn't been picked up and it hadn't been serviced at all. They send someone to clean up finally, but they never refilled the water bottles. Later that night, we call and say, hey we need those waters. They say, that's a separate dept. that fills the minibar and they also didn't do their job. And as a result, to get a bottle of water, we had to pay $30 at room service instead of $10 in the minibar. It was annoying.\n\nThe beds are very comfortable. The casino itself is nice and attracts a nice crowd.\n\nBut I still prefer MGM Grand. I never encounter weird problems like those described above and my room is actually nicer at MGM Grand."
4,"Ok im not going to say that i dont love coming here. The service is great, the ambience phenomenal, the manager is actually italian, etc. I love coming here for dinners or just a bite at the bar, but like with the rest of cuisine in Charlotte, its just not awesome. I believe its because the water in CLT sucks. \n\nGrilled octopus is the best thing on the menu. Hands down"
4,"Great service. The food was awesome we order a royal Hawaiian pizza, cheese bread (looks like and is the same size as their pizzas), roasted chicken w/pesto dish. All the food had great flavors, the only thing I would change was the ventilation of the restaurant the fire wood scent was very strong, other than that I'd say it was overall a great place."
4,"Buffalo wings are on of my main food groups. One of the reasons I miss living in Arizona, that's right not somewhere in the N East that get's cold, but AZ. Wing are perfect each time, right amount of spice, heat and sauce. Being spoiled by NNY has ruined me for life. I can't seem to find a close second to this, and man have I tried. Love the other food btw, and the service has always been good everytime I go. NNY is my excuse to visit my relatives in AZ."
4,"I don't get haircuts often. That being said I enjoyed miniBar Ber Shop. Its a little more modern than my tastes, but after a few beers I couldn't care less. And yes, beers at the barber....INGENIOUS! \n\nBoris gave me a trim and shaved off my beard. We gabbed about raising kids, and going on vacation, and how generally awful we both think New York can be. After I was done I had a couple more beers. Hey its almost noon and I'm on vacation.\n\nPS the girl at the front desk is c-u-t-e."
4,"I came here last time I was in Vegas, and I came back again cause it is that good!! I don't actually eat burgers lol, so my review is really focusing on the milk shakes.  I've had the mother fluffer both times I came now and it is so freaking delicious.  My husband had the lunch box milkshake and he loved it too.\n\nI had the Caesar salad for actually food - it was good, nothing unbelievable.  My husband had the classic burger and also said it was good but not the best ever.\n\nThe milk shakes are so good though, and so are the fries, so go for those and you will be happy!!"
4,"It's a great theater. Porque?\n\n-It's clean.\n-The staff is friendly, and the super cool guy who used to work at the Taco Bell drive-thru window up by Safeway works here, too.\n-It's cool, as in temperature.\n-The screens are really big.\n-The seats are really big...and soft...and comfortable.\n-The stadium seating gives you a good view.\n-It's never really crowded (which, I guess, is also a negative when it comes to the vitality of downtown).\n-It has 24 screens so the film you want is normally showing at the time you want to see it.\n-Parking is validated in the AZ Center garage.\n\nPor eso, me gusta the AMC at AZ Center."
4,"Coffee addict.  4 years and still going strong.\nI love coffee I have no idea what got me started on coffee. \nI have to give this place kuddos though because their coffee is excelente.\n\nI just had a regular cup of Joe and the chocolated coated coffee bean for free. My friend had a Rockstar with fruitpunch in it. It was really good, the rockstar seemed a little pointless being that they already sell fruit punch Rockstars at your local stores.\n\nOn the plus side they have double drive through. Prices seem way cheaper than Starbucks. Most importanly the staff is super duper diddly friendly :)\n\nHere comes debbie downer, the only reason why I can't give 5 stars is because their menu is so overwhelming. I didn't know what to get. There are way to many options maybe they can minimize or make the font on the menu larger. \n\nI can highly  recommend  you give it a try. If you love coffee and other fun drinks."
4,"When we pulled up to the Senor Taco in Fountain Hills, located in a run-down strip mall behind a Circle K, the 1st thing I noticed was the trucks.  The parking lot (what there is of it) was full of big trucks with construction looking tools and equipment on the backs.  I thought, \""this is a good sign.\""\n\nThe restaurant has gone through an interior upgrade, so the formica booths and tile floors are clean, but not much more.  You walk to the cashier and place your order (or use the drive thru).  It comes up in about 5 minutes.  The prices cannot be beat.  We ordered the fish taco plate and got two huge tacos in fresh corn tortillas with cabbage and fresh crema.  The rice and beans are awesome but never quite hot enough (that's why they only get 4 *).   My husband and I can get ONE platter and split it all for $6.99.  The prices on everything are reasonable and the flavors are authentic.  The folks that eat here know their mexican food.\n\nThey have a self serve salsa bar with your usual salsas, and my favorite, pickled carrots and fresh radishes.  Yum.   It aint fancy, but it's cheap, quick and delish."
4,"Wood paneling, a great (though expensive wine list), and a Goodfellas feel to this hidden gem that has been in business for 35 years.\n\nAn above average selection of pasta standards including squid ink fettuccine, and pesto made with basil so fresh it took on a different flavor.  The beer selection is poor, however the above average wine list made up for it.\n\nMany varieties of scalopini, soups and fresh seafood, makes this more than just a pasta joint.\n\nService is friendly and professional.  I will be back."
4,"Came here for the steak and eggs!! It says 3.99, but it actually comes out to 4.49. But that's ok. The customer service is kinda bad, It seems they're always frustrated.  \n\nAnyways, the steak was full of nerves and fat but had good flavor. When they ask you if you want toast or biscuit in gravy, get the toast!! The biscuit in gravy is always cold and the gravy tastes like its out of a can. \n\nI suppose I would recommend this place, I get a lot of food for a little money, and that's good for a student on a budget!"
4,"This show is different than any other show you have ever seen. \""Different\"" could mean a lot of things depending on your taste, mood, interests, and the level of craziness. \n\nI cannot say how much I enjoyed the music portion of this show, and I wish they would fill more of the show time with music. I couldn't wait for them to play on their crazy instruments. The band is very cool and so are the blue men; plus the special light effects make the whole thing a super fun show. \n\nSome of the comedy stunts are a little too long, in my opinion. I think they could do so much more than just standing there and eating cereals. But again, maybe I just didn't understand the message. \n\nI don't want to give away too much, but please go and find out for yourself. I absolutely recommend this show."
4,"What more can be rewarding after a 5 hour hike at Red Rock, I'll tell you what....a good ass breakfast!  My first time here and by the looks of the food on the table and how crowded it was being a wednesday afternoon, I knew it was gonna be good.\n\nMy friend was on her whack diet (she ain't even fat), so she just ordered tuna salad and biscuit with gravy.  I ordered the mexican omelette and red velvet pancakes, which I never there was such a thing.  The mexican omelette had marinated carnitas, sliced jalapenos, pico gallo, pepper jack cheese and topped off with sour cream.  It was pretty good but the red velvet pancake was the main dish I enjoyed the most.  I have never been a big fan of anything red velvet and this is the first.  She gave me a bite of her biscuit and gravy but I thought she was done with it and I killed it.  Haha she was like really, I look down for one second and you eat it all without sharing, ooops.\n\nVery affordable too with friendly servers who attend to you right away and checks up occasionally, despite the place being busy.  I will definitely be coming here for breakfast again. My ex and her tuna salad, what a waste of visit to baby cakes for her."
4,"I stopped by here on a whim, thinking they had wifi because it is a coffee/tea/smoothie spot and I learned that they didn't have wifi\nNo biggie \nThe girl that helped me was nice and gave me the run down on the menu and the Flavors that she liked\nI went with a strawberry pi\u00f1a colada smoothie and it was really, really good \nIt was pretty cheap too, which made it even better \nI sat at the table out front and enjoyed the smoothie\nThe foam on top made my day\nI will have to stop by and try one of their coffees"
4,I stayed here when it first opened many years ago. At the time Ceasars and The Mirage were the big dogs and the whole pirate ship show out front was a big deal. I was upgraded for free to a top floor room with a sick view and can't help but think TI helped cement my life long love of Las Vegas.\n\nFast Foward 15 or so years. I don't think I have done more than walk through the place a few times since. But when I returned for noodle soup (read Pho at the Coffee Shop review) I saw a $5 craps table on my way out. I stopped to play a while with the  light morning crowd.\n\nThe dealers were friendly and fun and everyone was having a good time playing the game. I think that is all you can ask for in a casino. I also like the feature bet. While  I'm sure it's a sucker bet the 176 to 1 odds can make one happy sucker. I will return to play craps here and eat soup. Good Luck.
4,"No matter what hour of the day, day of the week, or time of the year - the Grapevine is a must visit kind of place for locals and tourists alike!  \n\nThe patio upstairs is fantastic for hanging out with your family or friends, grabbing a bite to eat, and relaxing and enjoying the sunshine.  The bar upstairs has TVs, so you'll be able to catch whatever game you are trying to see. \n\nFor happy hour and on into the night, you can stay and rock out to the karaoke. The people here aren't messing around!   You'll get a little bit of everything from Elvis to Dixie Chicks to Sir Mix a Lot.   Where could you find that kind of entertainment all in one place?!"
4,"Every time that I have been to Montreal in the last six years, I have gone to Schwartz's.  More because of my husband's affliction for it: If we're in the city, he needs to go and get his fix. After all this time, I don't blame him.\n\nEveryone has their own way of ordering - and I don't judge (unless that way is 'lean'; that I don't understand.) You might want a cherry coke with your sandwich. You might eat your sandwich with a knife and a fork. And that's fine. (My order? A sandwich, fries to share, a pickle, cherry coke. The A1 steak sauce needs to be nearby, too.)\n\nI don't know if I would call this place 'the best restaurant in Canada' or 'the Katz's of Montreal', but it is terribly good smoked meat, in a style very different from New York delis (bagels and smoked meat - it's what sets New Yorkers and Montrealers apart). It's mouthwateringly delicious, served in a setting that requires that you get close to your neighbour (and I've had some great conversations as a result).\n\nThe line appears daunting, but the guy manning the door knows what he's doing. Trust him. Trust the staff inside. Trust the smoker in the kitchen that has been churning out incredible sandwiches for the past 82 years.\n\nI just hope that Celine Dion doesn't mess it up when the sale is finalized."
4,I really like that the free weights are separated from the treadmill area. pool is nice trainers are great too. I usually go after work and its never too crowded. they also have some great spin classes.
4,"I love their Chai frost with whipped cream...\n\nHaving said that, it's a cozy coffeehouse with dim lighting, and a warm atmosphere.\n\nHey if you really want to get cozier then bring a pillow and a blanket. :)\n\nThe service is quick which is good, and fun to watch. In the summer when it's super hot outside they'll have the misters going which keep things nice and cool.\n\nOverall it's a good place to sit down and have a cup of coffee."
4,"@ Skip B.  I read the inspection report from 1/24/11 and didn't see anything too serious on there.   There were 5 critical items mentioned.  One was for no date on portioned salad dressings.  I assume \""portioned\"" refers to when you pour dressing from the main container into a secondary container for daily use.  The second was for putting fish and fries at convenient locations during lunch rush.  The third was something about the ice drain line, fourth  was some air gap issue with the drive through window, and the last was for a bag of ice melt being stored on the same shelf as food.  When I see a score of 31 I expect there to be spoiled food, dirty/sick employees, rodent infestations and the like.  These are hardly reasons for me to stop enjoying my guilty cheap burger and fry pleasure.  \n\nWith the previous rant review addressed this place is the best alternative to fast food burger chains.  I have had their burgers, chicken fries, fried okra (!), and fish.  Their fish is surprisingly yummy and burgers should be ordered doubled and split with a friend.   My biggest complaint is that they don't have root beer or ginger ale.  As a result I never order a drink."
4,"Stopped in for some emergency supplies. (Emergency as in there was only butter in my fridge and I had one roll of toilet paper.) The employees were lovely as always, colorful, fresh fruit and vegetables greeted me and I scored in the free coffee & food that was available to sample. Trader Joe's never fails to delight and, of course, I purchased more beer and wine that is humanly necessary. Trader Joe's doesn't need a review. Of course a visit here is wonderful. This is a definite favorite of mine!"
4,Have been here a few times. I like the atmosphere and the servers were very easy going and laid back. It wasn't busy so the service was top notch though I have been there on nights it was slammed and they still managed to do a pretty good job. I will decently be back. Don't take offense it that it's only a four star rating. It's hard for me to give a five anywhere. :)
4,"Big fan of this location. I loved the Sahara location, but alas, it was closed on Thanksgiving (we found out the hard way...)\n\nCame here instead - were told there was a 1-3 hour wait with no guarantees. After bugging the hostess a few times - she let us know that if we kept bugging her - we might get in a little earlier. \n\nWho knew, just as I bugged her a 3rd time - a booth opened up and we were ushered in immediately. So happy.  Note to self -  make a reservation next year when it might be a holiday night...\n\nDidn't opt for the traditional Thanksgiving meal - as that was likely just being carved and dished out en masse.\n\nNew York Steak, Ribeye, Pork Tenderloin - all amazing, all deliciously moist. The sweet potato mashed-up-stuff didn't tast very sweet-potato-y, but it was all decent. Fried green tomatoes app was delicious! But the blandish chicken seemed slightly out of place - but gave the dish an surprisingly good pairing to tackle the heavy textures and flavors of the fried and the balsamic dressing.\n\nAmazing view by the way - overlooking the pool at night, much better than Sahara.\n\nNeedless to say, we brought 3/4 of our meal back with us. Not complaining at all."
4,"Pretty fun place to check out while on the strip.  My daughter wanted to go here to meet the polar bear mascot and he didn't disappoint.  The costume is top notch and better than your standard character.  The top portion is like a puppet and is very animated.  They allow you to take your own photos, however, the background is just a green screen.  If you go upstairs, you can purchase the photos they take with an artic background added.  We bought the package which had two 5x7 photos and a sheet of four smaller sized photos for $35.    Employees are all really nice and of course the store had a great variety of Coke themed merchandise.  One of the nice \""free\"" attractions  Vegas has to offer."
4,"Yeah, yeah, I know, it's a chain.  But it was there for us when we needed it.  My mother wasn't eating well on her own and my middle daughter lived in Mesa, not too far, so she would stop by Boston Market and pick up a couple of dinners on the way to visit her and they would have a nice visit and meal together.  Since Mother always liked what my daughter brought and ate well, at least we knew she was getting good nutrition from it and some leftovers for the next day.  \n\nWhen I was in town I would stop by there too  I always liked their sides and would sometimes just get a vegetarian plate of just the sides.  I liked their roast sirloin or whatever they call it too, for the price.  And their desserts were pretty good.  I liked that they had dishes that you don't find in most fast food places.  I never had a problem with anything I ate from there and they were pretty consistent in their quality so I give it four stars on a sliding scale compared to other fast food establishments.  I'd go back anytime I'm in the mood for good old American comfort food."
4,"I am usually not a fan of restaurants with gift shops inside of them, but I must admit I am a fan of Saddle Ranch. This is perhaps one of the best people watching locations on the west side simply for the fact that they have a mechanical bull. For some reason this device attracts women with skimpy shirts and fake boobs like bees to honey. While sipping on my ginormous long island ice tea, I could not help but utterly enjoy watching people get tossed from the bull, in many instances it was pure comedy. I have yet to eat here but my parents have on two occasions and have had wonderful experiences. The first time they went there they had to wait for a table and the manager walked them over to the bar and bought them a drink. The manager obviously understood that a free bloody mary was the way to my mother's heart and a sure fire way to win repeat business."
4,"We love this place! We come at least once a month.  You can never go wrong with \""bottomless fries\""  as an appetizer and distractor for the kids.  The burger selection is good and service is always prompt and friendly.  I recommend signing up for there frequent diner card to earn free burgers for purchases and a birthday burger as well."
4,"About as large as a small Wal-Mart, this is truly a warehouse of shoes. And surprisingly, not all women's shoes. There is a large section of shoes for men too!\n\nI stuck to my side of the shop and saw that the shoes were organized by style - boots, laceups, slip-ons and such were all neatly put together with one on display and a stack of others underneath with a variety of sizes. I have average size feet, so it's rare that there is any problem finding shoes in my size that fit.\n\nAfter I had narrowed down my selection to just two and was walking around to test comfort, I spotted their \""clearance\"" racks in the back had a pair of the style I wanted in my size! So instead of buying a full-price (marked down?) pair at $62, I got a \""last pair in store\"" with a 20% discount that was a name brand (Timberlake!) for $52. Boom!\n\nWhen you shop at Off Broadway, you also get an encore rewards coupon for 10% of your spending that you can use on your next visit. I can't imagine that I'll be back for shoes again and remember this coupon, but hey, you never know!"
4,"Ohhhhhh Deluca's.\n\nIn my experience, there is a great divide in the city of Pittsburgh, similar to Montagues vs. Capulets.  This divide is Pamela's-lovers vs. Deluca's-lovers.  I am firmly in the latter camp, and I will be pleased to challenge Pamela's patrons to a duel, as long as I have been fueled by a breakfast burrito the size of my head and innumerable rounds of coffee.\n\nDeluca's has quirks: It takes forever to get a table (because everyone's trying to eat there), the ambiance is old-school funky diner (weird mural, propensity for stickiness on the formica tabletop), and you should not expect to be pampered by the waitstaff (they do their job well, for the most part, but the restaurant is always busy, it's not a high-end place, and they aren't going to make enough in tip money off your $10 breakfast to put up with a snotty attitude from their customers).  Personally, I like this in a diner, and it is something I actively seek out.  I like to come here kind of hungover, devour a massive burrito and a huge orange juice and about three cups of coffee when the waitress has time to refill my cup.\n\nMy favorite diner is still that diner under the 16th street bridge, which I forget the name of it but it makes kick-ass biscuits and gravy."
4,"Order half the size of what you actually want. One scoop equates to about two. The prices are fair and they have some unique flavors to try if you don't mind traveling through the smokey casino to the location hidden away on the second floor. Price was fair for how much they give you. I saw a little girl who got shaved ice that was about 6\"" taller than the cup they served it in. My girlfriend is a true ice cream lover and mentioned \""its good, but its no baskin robbins\"" for what that is worth. I had the banana Carmel chocolate chip. It was good, but I'm not an ice cream lover so I don't get excited about such things."
4,"Clearly the magic words here are Capastrami and Bobbie. Go in knowing those two words and I promise you you'll leave one happy sandwich-eating mofo. \n\nFor me the Bobbie beats the Capastrami hands down. (The damn amazingness that is the pastrami from Brix in Sunset Beach has ruined all other pastrami for me.)  \n\nThe taste of Thanksgiving all smushed together on the tastiest, softest bread ever though, truly makes the Bobbie something to write home about... or at least will make you want to find your nearest Capriottis location and get there ASAP!"
4,"Awesome checkouts so they are In a bad neighbourhood who cares??? Take your High class behinds back to the high class ville this is the west side. Come in, friendly associates (see Stephanie) and leave easy, fast, clean and friendly..all I expect from a local Walmart"
4,"Self-serve frozen yogurt seems to be this new crave that is all over the valley. Some places do it extremely well, and others are just plain mediocre, and soemtimes bad.\n\nLots of unique flavors here, however, my fiancee was a little upset that there was no red velvet. I just discovered moshi, and it is quite possibly the most amazing thing ever. Moshi is kind of like marshmallows, but as someone who only eats kosher I try to avoid eating marshmallows from outside. Moshi is an excellent substitute, and it really goes well with ANY yogurt flavor.\n\nThe one thing I have to comment on is the strawberries here which were very, very ripe. Most other places seem to just throw any kind of strawberries into their yogurt line, but Yogurtology happened to have some really good calories.\n\nIts a super clean store, and the decorations are definitely very unique. The only thing that keeps me from giving Yogurtology a 5-star is the price, at 45 cents an ounce its slightly more than the Yogurtland I'm used to near ASU campus."
4,This place is amazing on the weekend although it is busy. The weekday barely anyone is there but the service is kind of weak which you would think it wouldnt be since the employees have nothing else to do. The food is good but everytime we ask for our eggs for be fried or over easy they cone out really runny and sunny side up. Overall you are paying mostly for the environment and the freshness of some of the food. :) I enjoyed the place and I will return agian. :3
4,"Great food, incredible view, excellent service. What more could you ask for. We've done the prix fix many times and just ordering off the regular menu is great too. Can't go wrong for a special occasion dinner here."
4,"Service that my husband and I got in person was great! The morning we arrived we got out of the cab and our bags were immediately taken by the staff! We didn't even have to touch them. We were then told they would hold our bags since checkin wasn't until 2 or 3. We went to the front desk , got our keys and told us that we could call around checkin time to find out our room # that way we didn't have to stand in line at the front desk again. Reason why I did t give them 5 stars: we called around 3 to get our room # where the guy was rude and told us the \""main tower\"". Walked around for 45 minutes trying to find our room!! Come to find out we were in the grand tower. The hotel is too big with disappearing signs. Our room was amazing as we booked a suite. Housekeeping always kept it extremely clean. We are going to stay at another MGM Hotel next month - THE Hotel @ Mandalay Bay and at Bellagio in Decemeber...we shall see which hotel is best for us!"
4,"Wanted to try a local place and heard good things. The place is modest with a friendly staff. For the love of jesus, if you can't take heat, do not eat here! The posole was amazing and you NEED to try the homemade tortillas! A bit different than the posole I'm used to but this is a new mexican style restaurant so it's a bit off from the mexican food I'm used to from chicago. Overall a good experience and will definitely come again!!"
4,"All I have to say is... Grilled cheese and creamy tomato soup!!!! And excellent beer selection. I'm a fan of the Rogue Hazelnut (goes just right with the grilled cheese and soup).\n\nDimmed, relaxing lighting and awesome service!"
4,"Food is delicious. I had the Vegenini, it is like a vegetarian pizza. I loved it. The potato fries are also delicious. Customer service is always friendly."
4,"Nice. Oh so very nice. Not as nice as the Aria or Vdara, but damn close. The only thing though about the Cosmopolitan is that it felt very cluttered and congested. It was hard to navigate through the casino and multiple floors of well, everything. We couldn't even find the sushi bar that we wanted to eat at and we couldn't locate any employees to ask for directions. \n\nStill a nice hotel though. I can't imagine what it would be like to stay here. One of the few hotels in Vegas that actually have a balcony and a minibar. Pretty sweet."
4,"The food would be 3 stars but the service made it 4 stars.   Our cute waitress Tashja made the meal.  Super friendly and personable, but best of all she knew the menu and made great suggestions.  \n\nThe North Boulevard drink was Yummmm...pretty dangerous because you couldn't taste the alcohol but could tell more than one would get you pretty messed up.  Like happy lemonade.  Fried Pickles were great, super crunchy.  \n\nI had the Ahi Tuna burger...yes, I went to a burger joint for tuna.  It was very good.  \n\nHubby had Turkey burger which he thought tasted a little weird.  Just eh.\n\nSandwiches are definitely not very big as others have said."
4,"Bouchon Bistro, in the Venetian, is Thomas Keller's Las Vegas presence. Judging from the google results and \""Bouchon Las Vegas dress code\"" being a popular suggested search, there's some confusion about this bistro. It's relatively casual, but chic. It's decorated like an old French bistro, and the menu reflects its casual but traditional nature.\n\nHis plate: Steak Frites - pan-seared prime flat iron served with ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel butter and frites\n\nHer plate: Sourdough Waffles - sourdough waffles with bananas, toasted walnuts, maple syrup, & Tahitian vanilla bean butter; cappuccino; mimosa\n\nTo share:  Beignets with chocolate and fruit dipping sauces; side of bacon\n\nThe bread for the table was beautiful and fresh, nice mini leaves of thoroughly authentic and crusty French bread. Our beignets came out hot and fresh, very dense and covered in cinnamon sugar. The dipping sauces were chocolate (that may have had a hint of hazelnut) and strawberry/raspberry.\n\nD's steak was good, though he was disappointed that the fries weren't house-made or more special. My waffles were fantastic - and the combination of the vanilla bean butter and the walnuts were really delicious. The syrup was not really needed at all, but I did appreciate that it was served warm."
4,"Took my other half here last week to celebrate his birthday. Nice, cozy spot.. Service was great. He checked on us constantly making sure everything was great. I ordered the Bolognese. It was a little bland. My boyfriend ordered the FRUTTI DI MARE and it was uh-mazing!! It was so delicious that I kept stealing the shrimps from his plate! Lol. The dessert was absolutely divine. We chose the Gelato with espresso on top and it was a hit! We really enjoyed the food and service we received at this place."
4,Solid Vietnamese food in Las Vegas.\nFound this place on Yelp before heading back home and decided to give it a try.  Their dishes are decent and price is right.  The service was very friendly as well.  It's a good place to get some authentic Vietnamese food.\nWill come around again.\n\nPro:\n1.  Solid food\n2.  Great price\n3.  Great service\n\nCon:\nNothing outstanding to mention.
4,"This is the best Arby's around! The wait is a little long sometimes, but the always get your order right and your food is always fresh. They often send coupons out in the mail and in the Centennial View, also they usually have other rotating deals in house. Nothing really to complain about there, they make sure the food on your tray if in your bag really is Good Mood Food! ;-)"
4,"Just a quick review of Macaroni Grill. \n\nI've been to this location several times and I've never been disappointed. The service is always pleasant and fast and the food is pretty darn good for a chain. \n\nI've tried some of their pasta dishes and had the grilled pork chops once and they were quite good. I ordered them on a whim and was pleasantly surprised with them. And they make a great Insalata Blu which is bibb lettuce, walnuts, red onions, grated bleu cheese all tossed in a balsamic vinaigrette. \n\nThe bread they serve with the olive oil and cracked black pepper is always pleasing. And they have a great blackberry mint iced tea. Yum. \n\nThe music they play is a great mix of Italian opera and the Italian crooners of the 50's such as Frank Sinatra. And hopefully there will be a birthday or two while you're there. They usually have a singer who does a great job of \""Happy Birthday\"" in Italian. (What does this person do besides sing? Is that all they do? Anyone know?) \n\nOh, and if you use the restroom they play lessons in Italian while you are....um...doing your business. Pretty cool.( I just hope that if I ever need to use Italian in an emergency I don't have to duck into a bathroom to remember it.) \n\nIf you're in the mood for some good Italian food with good portions and friendly attentive service, Macaroni Grill can't be beat in my book."
4,"This place was good and found this on the internet.  Anyways I wished I had the sushi, but I was sick so I went with the noodles which was good. It was nice and hot and filled my belly. I loved the salad as well.  I wished I had the other dishes, but it is okay though.  I would come back here again."
4,"This place was great when it was Oasis and is still pretty good and one of my favorites on the strip. They use to be the cheapest, but since renovations, I think pricing is more in line with the strip.  I'm not quite sure what was experienced by the individual that felt they weren't clean.\n\nI like the layout and attention to areas for relaxation. That makes it better than Mirage which doesn't quite have enough space for the chill out and Canyon Ranch which is more oriented toward being a Gym. The lighting is wonderful through out, low enough to make you feel at peace.  Also, the ability to grab water and hydrate or to put cucumber on your eyes in multiple places is fantastic.  \n\nIf you are like me and go to the spa to lounge around for multiple, hours, Nuture is a good one to put on the list. \n\nI still think that the strip doesn't quite pay enough attention to spa in general, so I can't give it the full 5.  I mean, go to Asia (half of the Casinos have properties there anyway), check it out and come back and implement all the details. \n\nThe only thing I would additionally mention, the spa is FAR from the parking area or entrance areas.  You've got a trek if you're not staying at the luxor.  Make sure to give yourself a lot of extra time for your appointment to get to the actual spa."
4,I love this place but always seem to forget about it. The rockin shrimp is an absolute must! The slider app actually makes a nice meal for the ladies. I love the salmon and my husband loves the chimichurri  skirt steak. Their happy hour is one of the best around!
4,"We have had drinks and good here twice since our stay in Vegas and it didn't let us down either time. The first time we shared the chicken and steak nachos which was huge and delicious and we couldn't even finish the plate together!! The second time we had the tortilla chips and salsa and mild chicken wings, both so good and not over filling which is great when accompanied by beer. Not expensive and good size servings.\n\nBe sure to get the tickets from the girl out the front though for the buy one get one free drinks as it works out cheaper than happy hour. We had great service both time and very friendly staff."
4,It's Subway! It's probably the most food that you are going to get for $5. This subway is pretty clean and fast. It helps that it's in a rich neighborhood. Beware that it does get busy during certain hours of the day.\n\nAre there better subs? Most likely. But not for $5.
4,"I really liked it here.  Nice atmosphere, friendly waiters, cute decor, The Clash playing on the loud speakers (a wee bit too loud for my liking), and best of all - prompt chips and salsa delivery (for those of us who are famished and just don't like to wait).  Indoor and outdoor seating - with the choice of 2 patios.\n\nChips were good - not burnt or too thick, house salsa was nice with a little smokey flavor and not too spicy for those who are spice-challenged.  I ordered a cucumber mint agua fresca which was really light and refreshing.  Also got the nachos with a little added corn.  The server was right when he told me, \""it's like a meal.\""  Totally filled me up and I definitely had a lot left over.  \n\nWill definitely be back to try different agua fresca flavors and their veggie tacos!"
4,"This days inn is very nice.  Google mislead us and it was a little farther than we thought it was from the highway, but we found it eventually.  Note that the advertised parking amenities are for you to pay $12 per night to park in a sketchy lot across the street - not cool.  But the rooms are very nice and clean, and the staff were very friendly even though we did not speak french."
4,Cheap prices and a great place to get fresh veggies. Place does get busy on the 1st and 2nd of the month given how cheap the place is so try to avoid those two days.
4,"Good but expensive.  But I guess all hotel cafes/restaurants are expensive.  Can get crowded and with long lines.\n\nOpens at 6am, which was perfect for LV because we didn't get back from the late night club til 545 am, so before heading back up to our room, we waited 15 minutes for the cafe to open and had breakfast!  ONLY IN VEGAS! LOL"
4,"For an airport eatery this is above par, hense the 4 stars. Decent medium well cooked burger with slaw. \n\nWould be a 3 star outside of an airport though."
4,"Well, i like the idea of Motel One. Always in the center of the city, somehow modern design, good beds. No fancy unnecessary stuff. All of this is true for this motel one in Edinburgh. Perfectly located even if it's hard to discover. \nBreakfast is ok, but not more. \nService is friendly. \nNo twin rooms available.."
4,"I recently went to Panini Cafe for the first time after learning that it was kosher and vegetarian-friendly.  As far as I could tell, the menu was entirely pescatarian (or pesco vegetarian) -- meaning the only meat options on the menu were fish.  This is exactly the diet I've been enjoying for the past few months.  The fish on the menu included salmon, tuna, tilapia, and others.  \n\nMy friend and I started with an appetizer of hummus and warm fresh pita bread.  Our hummus included sauteed onions, pine nuts, and olive oil.  It was delicious and we devoured it all.\n\nAs a main course, I got the Ravioli Athens, which is ravioli tossed with garlic and basil and topped with feta cheese and kalamata olives.  At $16.99, It was a bit more than I wanted to pay, but it sounded so good I couldn't resist.  And I was not disappointed.  I loved the flavors, and I appreciated the fact that it was kosher.  I also refrained from eating the whole plate, so that I took about half of it home and enjoyed it for another meal later. \n\nMy friend, who ordered the roasted Creamy Eggplant (which came with a house salad), was also pleased with her meal.  \n\nWe had no problems with the service.\n\nI would definitely like to return and try some other dishes on the menu."
4,"Very nice place, great restaurant and bars!! I love how they infuse the air with a coconutty smell like suntan lotion!!! Better then cigarette smoke! The staff is nice and helpful!"
4,At here last night after a rough day.  It helped.  Ordered the duck breast and duck/pork meatballs and loved it.  The chocolate souffl\u00e9 was good as well.  The staff were friendly and service was great.
4,"I had only been to the poolside before, but went to the club for the first time! The bouncers were actually friendly, making sure there was enough space to walk around. The sound system here is amazing! Fun to see some great DJs! \n\nTwo floors to the nightclub - the one upstairs is a lot larger!"
4,"Five guys is a great alternative to fast food burgers without getting mixed up in the world of \""gourmet\"" burgers. Their burgers are very tasty and are available with a huge list of free toppings unlike most places at this level. Get some free peanuts while you're waiting for your order? Yes please. Although I enjoy the burgers, I think the fires are worth equal mention. They come in regular and cajun variety and I've never seen anyone who actually needed to order a large. The regular is plenty, even to share. The menu is pretty basic but they do have a hot dog and a grilled cheese option for those who aren't into burgers. I will say that for me it is kind of a toss up between Five Guys and In N Out, but I seem to find myself here more often."
4,"This is one of our go-to inexpensive dinner places. Their margarita's are good and very large if you get anything but the small. The food is good, I'm a fan of the La Mejor and my hubby always gets Pollo con Crema.  Take home boxes are standard for us at Monterrey having left overs for the next day.\n\nThe service can be hit of miss, but typically they are very attentive and food comes out quickly.  The dining room is a bit of a dive and sad.  The booths and tables have seen better days.  It could certainly use a face-lift."
4,"Stopped by this place after work for a couple strong margaritas and an appetizer. Feels just like the Super-Mex that was there a couple months ago. Drinks were good, appetizer was good, and the bartender was very friendly."
4,"Arrived at around 10 am on a Friday with my best friend. We didn't schedule an appointment and were luckily enough able to be sit right down for a pedicures. \n\nI would suggest making an appointment because after being there 10-15 minutes it became packed. \n\nWe were asked which pedicures we preferred and I believe it was called the Luxury one ($45 one) It was amazing! I have had a lot of pedicures but have to say nothing like this one. \n\nThe Luxury spa was the royal treatment that is for sure. From a mask type cream for your legs, salt scrub, sugar scrub, hot wax for your feet (never had I had that done before) and just all around special treatment. \n\nMy best friend was helped by Henry and I was helped by an elderly woman. They were both very nice and friendly and for the most part understood us and spoke relatively good English. \n\nI was highly impressed at least by receiving a pedicure so we have agreed this will be our monthly spot for our girls day pedicures."
4,"Wow, what a cool place! I went for the first time last night and had the farmer sandwich, it was fabulous. Service was great. Love the atmosphere and vibe here. The patio is especially nice when the weather is right. The menu is just salads, sandwiches and pizzas but if that's what you're looking for, give it a try.  I highly recommend Liberty Market."
4,"Came in to order some drinks for the long ride back to  Los Angeles and was not disappointed... I'd say probably one of the better tasting boba places I've tried while here in Vegas. They have similar squatty cups that don't fit in normal cup holders like half n half have back at home. Tea tasted good, boba was soft but not as \""sweet\"" as I was expecting/hoping. Atmosphere and employees were nice. Overall not bad if you're in Vegas :)"
4,"My parent's love this place and now, so do I.  It is New York Style pizza (thinner crust and longer slices) very much like we got back home in NY.  Dont let their prices deceive you as it is pretty good!"
4,"Stayed here this past weekend and had a great time. I went to Vegas but only once left the hotel (somehow I ended up on the strip outside the wynn after a night of hard partying...still no idea how that happened). Our daily routine was order lunch via room service at 3pm (waking time) then champagne, then champagne again then have the minibar restocked from the previous nights damage....and  proceed to clean it out again. Around 10-11ish we would leave the room to go to XS and around 4am we would hit the tables. Would have been nice to see more (any) of vegas but we had a great time...until we got the room bill. Our hotel room fee was $700 and room service was $800...we didnt feel so big anymore....we transformed from rock stars to nervous teens who had crashed the family car.\nanyway if you choose to go down the same path we did - get the burger sliders (they are ground beef at its finest) with perfect onion strings, also every bottle of champagne was delish and im sure if you want to save some money (in retrospect, always a good idea) you probably wouldnt be able to differentiate the champagne from the sparkling wine. oh, and they have a room service \""happy hour\"" with corona's $5 each and some of the food for $10 a plate which is not bad compared to the regular price, trust me..."
4,"Great service, but almost always packed! Definitely should make appointment if you're not willing to wait 20 minutes. Also a little on the expensive side for gel manicure."
4,I'm already a huge fan of any Cracker Barrel so I was excited to eat already.  This one is just as charming and cute as any other Cracker Barrel.  The homestyle cooked food was well prepared and service was friendly.  The prices are reasonable as well.  One of my favorite spots for home cooked food when I'm feeling too lazy to cook.
4,"The food here at the Beat is better than the coffee.  The sandwiches and salads are well prepared.  The ambiance encourages people to just be themselves, whether they want to chat with friends, listen to records, chow down on some sandwiches or just left alone to surf on the Internet or read. The location's great as well with plenty of street parking nearby and big windows for people watching.\n\nMy only complaint is that the coffee isn't that great. I overlook it because of all the other reasons I wrote above. But it is ironic that a coffee house should serve sub par coffee."
4,"flew into and out of McCarran last week. no hassles or problems whatsoever.\n\nshuttle service to our hotel was handled quickly (TI doesn't have its own, but there are small buses that will do it for a small fee).\n\nwell, aside a slight security issue when a corkscrew/bottle-opener/knife inexplicably turned up in my friend's luggage, but that's a story for another time. we're still trying to piece together the previous night..."
4,I typically use the drive-thru and can expect to wait about 5-10 minutes before I get my burger combo and go. The food has always been good and worth the wait.
4,"The BF and I visited the hookah lounge here during happy hour, and the prices are spot on! \n\nDrinks and food are half off, I'd recommend the Pear-sian Drop martini ($4), the Pesto Pita Pizza ($3.50) and the Athens Fries ($4?)\n\nWe were immediately greeted by friendly and helpful staff, and presented with a tray full of hookah flavors to smell. Pretty simple and awesome concept, considering flavor choices at other hookah places can be hit or miss. It was $7.50 for a hookah, but we opted for the $10 \""frozen\"" hookah, containing a gel much like the stuff found in those frozen cups that keep your beer cold. \n\nThe atmosphere is lush and exotic feeling, and they played great classic rock. I'm tired of euro-trash house music and trance, people! \n\nThe hookah smoke was perfect and taste was great, but THEY DON'T REFILL COALS DURING HAPPY HOUR! WTF! What a waste of a good bowl. It had a good 30-40 minutes left in it!I knew the price was too good to be true. That's my only gripe about the place. I'd rather pay $10-15 for a place that has coal service. \n\nPaymon, goddamn it, change your coal service policy and I'll consider giving you 5 stars!"
4,"I played this golf course for the first time last week.  I am very impressed.  So far, it's one of my favorite golf course in Arizona.  Here's why:\n\n+ The course is kept in great shape.  Fairways, excellent and the greens were soft and rolled true.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eagle-mountain-golf-club-fountain-hills?select=UqYXQGNAtScIvcVrmMo1Dw#UqYXQGNAtScIvcVrmMo1Dw\n\n+ The design of the course is challenging but offers a nice option of distances from the various tees....this allows for a nice variety of options for various skill levels in the same group to play together.\n\n+ I love the rolling hills and changes in elevation.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eagle-mountain-golf-club-fountain-hills?select=cmmUzMXaihxf5keZpadxLA#cmmUzMXaihxf5keZpadxLA\n\n+ The greens are fun to putt on...they're not flat and offer a challenge on all putts.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eagle-mountain-golf-club-fountain-hills?select=50NZhNK5YNoVMm8ipX3s5A#50NZhNK5YNoVMm8ipX3s5A\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eagle-mountain-golf-club-fountain-hills?select=7LDMLKsddbQ816uGBZW_jA#7LDMLKsddbQ816uGBZW_jA\n\n+ The views of Phoenix are spectacular.  The course is located in Fountain Hills, so it's pretty amazing.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eagle-mountain-golf-club-fountain-hills?select=6Je53UZM1NaznmgkzcFsJQ#6Je53UZM1NaznmgkzcFsJQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eagle-mountain-golf-club-fountain-hills?select=XSiwOqUlQOKqTc64phJdtw#XSiwOqUlQOKqTc64phJdtw\n\n+ Cheap Beer....$2 for a 16 oz PBR the day we played!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/eagle-mountain-golf-club-fountain-hills?select=kNoONRCYr_ms-3D9FXKaZg#kNoONRCYr_ms-3D9FXKaZg\n\nI can't wait to get back and play another round.\n\nReturn Factor - 95%"
4,This location had great accessories and I did get a few great blazers. The staff just wasn't the friendliest. However they weren't rude. Just kinda blah lol
4,"Never been to Philadelphia nor have I ever been to a whole lot of places that sells cheesesteak sandwiches. But this place reminds me of a place in Tucson called Frankies South Philadelphia Cheesesteak.  \n\nFrom my understanding this place used to be located on 5th Ave which they've relocated to Craftsman Ct in Old Town Scottsdale. The new location has three times the space than the original one. Still open 24 hours a day, it's probably the only place you can get a Philly cheesesteak at 3 am.\n\nThe GF had bought a Groupon to this place awhile back and finally decided to take me here (feel so lucky). I ordered a regular 9 inch Cheese-steak with whiz cheese and a side of fresh cut fries (oh if you check in here, you'll get a free basket of fries with your order). Within 5 minutes or so our order arrived - and just as fast as the food came out it was gone!  The bread was nice and soft and the steak was full of favor! \n\nThis place is awesome! The only thing that bugged me was trying to find a parking space. Holly hell I think we were driving around for hours! Ok Ok maybe not hours but it sure seems like it (hungry status). \n\nLove this place and will hopefully be back soon. \nKCYE"
4,"Not only are the drinks delicious, but the service is out of the world! They are extremely friendly and love to chat. As for the drinks, they don't have as large of a menu as Starbucks, but they a lot more fun flavors for people who don't just want coffee. Also, a lot of them taste better than those at Starbucks."
4,"I had the buta-burger as it was all the flavors that i love...the burger was surprising good! i didnt expect it to be as bomb as it was....i was like 2nd in line and they were crazy fast too, which is always appreciated...my only gripe is that its kinda expensive..other than that, awesome!"
4,"Thankfully this place re-opened.  What's there to say...you can get a nice NY style pizza hot and fresh here for far less than the poor excuse for a pizza parlor across the street.  When I say hot, I mean HOT...holy mackerel does that pie come out smoking hot.  Good quality and good service to be found here into the late evening.  Great spot to grab a quick slice when on E. Fremont.  Uncle Joe's a cool guy too...just don't get on his bad side or he'll toss you out on the street like yesterday's trash as was witnessed when two assholes decided to go toe to toe in the restaurant.  Good times!"
4,"I moved to Bloomfield in April and being Italian and loving Italian food I thought that Little Italy would be a good fit, I was wrong... Until tonight.  I have found that every Italian restaurant I've tried has left much to be desired; from Del's atrocious food to the over hyped Pleasure Bar, I had not found an Italian joint I liked.\n\nLombardozzi, I have not clue why I had not tried you until tonight.  I had tried their meatballs during Little Italy Days and really enjoyed them, but always forgot to head down the block to try a whole meal.\n\nWe started with calamari and it was fried t to perfection, and no rubbery feel, which is a positive, because 99% of places outside the east coast can't to calamari to save their lives.\n\nI had the gnocchi with red sauce (only sauce option which kind of irks me, because gnocchi is great with a pesto) with meatballs.  The gnocchi is homemade and to die for, and the sauce is pretty good too (I'm a sauce snob, nobody beats my mothers or grandmothers) and the meatballs were as good as I remembered.\n\nGreat food experience, but the service was at best bad.  The waitress took over five minutes to get our drink order, and just kind of seemed annoyed at the whole working thing.\n\nI will be back, because there is no Italian food in Bloomfield that even comes close to Lombardozzi."
4,"Fresh shrimp, crab legs to enjoy. Prime Ribs & Leg of lamb on carving table. Many different other dishes. A lot of desserts, including crepes made to order. Weekday price is more worth it."
4,"Great steak sandwich and the fries have a great taste without any sauce. My wife had Mamas burger, the bun and mushrooms were great tasting, but the meat lacks flavor. We will give this place another try."
4,"If you want to sit down and eat you better be prepared to a) wait in a line on the street and b) share a table with strangers. In any other setting either scenario may have surprised or irked me, but on this day I was so game for it and ended up thinking these two features added so much charm and warmth to the place.\n\nThe smoked turkey sandwich was moist, tender, and so yummy. Topped with mustard on white bread, heaven. The fries were crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. The dill pickle was massive and damn good. And the cole slaw was barely dressed and some of the best I've ever eaten. \n\nOur server was excellent! He was funny, personable, and super fast. With such quick turn over I was expecting crap service and not planning to hold anything against it. But our guy could probably serve the whole place with his eyes closed and just rock it. I loved him.\n\nSuper cheap, quick food, awesome setting, great value. Must go. No wonder this place has the best reviews and is the highest rated. Awesome!"
4,I thought this place was awesome! I had the buffalo cheesesteak sandwihch with a side of jicama fries (not cooked...raw) which was a very welcome and wholesome change for the norm. \n\nThe atmosphere is modern. Seating is pretty ample and comfortable for all sizes. Most of the patrons have on workout clothing as the LV Athletic Club is in the same shopping center. Parking seems a little cramped but there's always a good amount of parking spaces available. \n\nThey also have cafe seating with very nice furniture. I was impressed and will definitely be returning.
4,If it wasn't for Lotus of Siam - they would have 5 stars.\n\nFor appetizers - must have is the beef thai jerky and of course their tom kha soup.\n\nEntrees - Prik King and Panang are incredible.  As I get older I can't handle spice as much as I used to so I always order mild and get the spices on the side.  You have to ask for the spices as they don't always give it to you but it's worth the asking as this way I can add a little more as I go for an extra kick.
4,"I always feel like I've come straight from the black and white movies when I'm in here, red lipstick and cocktail dress in tow. There's something quite cool to say you're going to a jazz bar, and I like to click my fingers as I walk down the steps.\n\nIt's a hit or a miss with the jazz you get when you're there - if it's the house band then great (the pianist in particular can knock out some tunes) but sometimes they have guests which can be amazing, and can be bad. \nOverall, definitely a fan!"
4,"Located right across h&m. From Ceaser's palace walk towards the forum shops and go left at the fork. \n\nOrdered waffle fries dusted with cocoa and chili powder and a chocolate chai to go.  I watched as the barista steeped my tea leaves and made my drink step by step from what looked like a recipe manual behind on of the cabinet doors. I ate a few fries before I trekked back into the mall and before they got soggy in the Togo box. For $7 there were about 10-12. Large waffle fries. I didn't really taste any cocoa and just the smallest hint of chili. I saw it but I just wasn't tasting it... And I'm not even a fan of spicy stuff, but these fries were lacking. The drink was worth the 5.95 strong chai richness and served hot, but not as frothy as I would have preferred."
4,"Had to kill some time waiting for a place to open.  Stopped in at apache and got a enchilada plate, red, cheese, actually white cheese that was melted.  I was shocked to be honest.  The sauce did seem to be tomato based which I'm not a huge fan of but it tasted pretty good.  Also at 6 bucks for that plate cheaper than most."
4,"Really great deal.  Coffee was a little weak but dad's 3.95 two eggs with hash browns was such a great deal.  My Korean omelette (kalbi, onion and cheese) was flavorful but will probably not try that combo again.  Fun, chatty owner and chef.  Brightly colored walls and decor.  Good morning start."
4,Im not from this area so when I come around Phoenix I always have to stop at a Jersey Mikes since there are very few in So Cal.  I can't wait till they open more where I live cause you can tell the quality is unmatched compared to Subway and Quiznos.
4,Food was worth the money- larger sizes. Menu is wayyyy to large and could be downsized or split in an AM PM vs having 10 pages of food chooses. The interior was well thought out w wide range of art. We had 4 different burgers all were great. Love the different French fry options
4,"Friendly, accommodating, and the pizza and wings are always good.  It is one of my go to places for a casual dinner out."
4,"Friend said he seen Guy from the food network do a show here, so we decided to come and check it out. Got here at 6:30am on the dot and ordered the Enchiladas,  the plate was very good and had good taste to it. \n\nWas expecting a bit more but wasnt bad."
4,"I miss this place.  I used to work right across the street from McAlp's and would go there at least twice a week.  The atmosphere is great, food is good, and deserts are tasty.  Its nice to see that some places in the Phoenix area don't feel the need to constantly renovate and are not afraid to keep their days gone by look, feel and approach to business.  Writing this is making me hungry for their food again.  I need to find an appointment to schedule downtown so I can lunch there next week."
4,"Was in Scottsdale for Spring Training and looking to get a great steak.  Everyone I asked kept telling me to go to Mastro's Ocean Club.  now I know why.  From the minute you walk in, you are surrounded by excitement.  The bar area was packed, but not so bad that you could not get a drink.   The meals were fantastic and the steak was prob one of the 3 best I have ever enjoyed.  Highly recommend inf you are in Scottsdale.   Not cheap, but worth it."
4,"First, the wine list is riddiculous, but that is part of their schtick.  I  mean silly the wine list. It is bigger than a phone book, I am not kidding! Worse, the list is organzed by price rather than varietal and region. The list serves two restaurants Cowboy Ciao and Kasmierz. Cowboy Ciao is successful, because of location, setting, and the food is good. I went with l and my dad and his new wife. We had the k vintners highly rated wine for $200. I have a better memory with wines than what we ate."
4,"I was driving home from Tempe tonight when I saw this place so I decided to stop in and get a bite to eat. The first thing I noticed was that the place was super clean, friendly staff, but most of all, awesome food. I had a ribeye steak sandwich, which by the way was only 7 dollars and some change, fries, and onion rings. I can find a good steak sandwich almost anywhere in the valley, but this one was one if the best I've had. I was a huge fan if onion rings, but these changed my mind. \nAnyway, I give these guys 4 stars, can't give 5 yet until I have a chance to try the burger."
4,"Wow, this place is awesome!  I'd heard about it a couple of months ago and my wife and I finally went last Saturday.  And then the next day.  That's how much we loved it.  It's a quaint, cozy place to get some coffee and relax.  Their cinnamon roll was great, especially the frosting!  The waffle sandwich with the Bechamel might be one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've had.  The second day we went we took my wife's cousin Johnny and he loved the sandwich as well.  We are making a resolution to go to Bread and Butter every Saturday, or at least every other.  I definitely recommend it for a nice breakfast and I'm excited to try the lunch sandwiches."
4,"Everything was great here....EXCEPT THE STEAK!! I ordered a 10 oz filet mignon medium rare with truffle butter and it was overcooked. It seemed more like a medium to medium well. Since this is a steak house, I had to take off points for overcooking the steak. \n\nI had the garden salad and our table shared broccolini, spiced maple carrots, and the lobster mac and cheese. Delicious. \n\nThe service was great. The ambiance and music was fantastic. But seriously?? If I'm paying that much for a steak, grill it the way I want it."
4,"Went here on Labor Day weekend,  Saturday night. It wasn't too crowded.  We got a nice spot in the back on some nice couches. The waiter was very friendly and informative.  We tried some wine and dessert.  It's a little pricey, but we will be back.  Overall a really good experience."
4,"Went in and tried the pork rib and fatty brisket and it was pretty good. I generally don't care for pork ribs but it literally fell off the bone and was very moist and juicy. The brisket has just enough fat and was very flavorful. \n\nThey had 3 different kinds of bbq sauces sweet, smokey and a white thunder. The sweet is a typical bbq sauce, smokey was my favorite and white thunder was pretty much just heat. \n\nPrices are pretty much standard to other bbq places starting around $8. Since this is closer to my job I'd definitely go back."
4,"Very urban chic! Their chai tea latte is one of the best I've had in Vegas. Their breakfast items are over-priced, especially since their bagels are supermaket Sara Lee brand; however, they have a honey-butter they serve with them that absolutely makes up for it."
4,"Between 4 and 5 stars.  Everything was so spicy.  Great flavors.  Especially loved the fried avocado! yum yum yum.  I believe the owner was taking care of us and she was super friendly and had great suggestions for a Thai novice such as myself.  \n\nWine was half-priced on Thursdays and we took full advantage of this :) We stayed for hours, drinking and munching on the appetizers we split.  This is a small restaurant and it was packed.  There are apparently a lot of people in Summerlin who love this place and for good reason: It was delicious.  Beautiful lighting too.  Don't let the strip mall location fool you.  Great for a date spot or happy hour with the girls."
4,It smells nice.\n\nIt's inexpensive.\n\nIt makes a sly dig at the recipient's personal hygiene.\n\nAnd this is yet another place where you can pick up gifts for any menopausal women who make it onto your Xmas gift-buying list.
4,"I think this is one of the best brunch buffets in town.  They have the make your own omelet station and great eggs and a fantastic dessert selection.  Also, the champagne for the mimosas was good too.  This place was so good, my petite little roommate ate here for 3 hours.  (Suffice it to say, she was in a food coma for a good part of the day.)  That's some good eating..."
4,We had the lunch menu and it was great .I am sure I will be back next time in Vegas .
4,"great selection! \n\ngot here just before 3 on a monday. there were only 4ppl before us but for some reason it took about 10 minutes to be seated. do not try pushing your luck after that! the line grows terribly fast the closer you get to dinner and the smart diners arent going to leave in time for you to be seated, they want to see the dinner selection too! \n\ni was a little disappointed with a few things: eggs benedict was IMPOSSIBLE to cut with the knife i was given and when i tried to bite thru it, it was rubbery...i LOVE meat but there was only 2 choices of meat at the carving station (top sirloin and a flank steak?)...the desserts were super cute but some were a bit off and none of them made me want to get seconds. oh and i NEEDED to ask for milk because some desserts were too creamy or too sugary (which is weird because ive NEVER in my life have thought something is too sugary)...finally i think we left about 30 minutes after \""dinner\"" started but didnt see a difference in what was being served. dishes were refilled but that was about it. \n\nyes the food was good, but i guess i came here expecting to try dishes that i dont see all the time and that taste phenomenal. minus a star for not serving anything that i wanted second helpings of."
4,"Great atmosphere & wonderful service. My only complaint was when ordering a cocktail I expect there to be a little kick. I had 2 drinks & got not even a buzz. The popcorn is good, albacore tuna was phenomenal, prime rib was fun with the presentation. Overall a fun place that I would love to take out of town guests & visit again to try more of the plates."
4,Enjoying an amazing birthday dinner with family and friends... With a sushi feast to make the gods green with jealousy!
4,"They do take out and delivery! The pizza is tastier than most delivery places. The 10\"" is a good size for an individual pizza. The staff was a lot of fun to chat with and answered any questions we had. We will definitely be getting food from them again."
4,"EM Cafe opened two years ago and was a hit from the start, mainly because the decor is breezy and effortless. It's got tall ceilings, white walls showcasing local artists, and a big table in the middle for communal eating or large groups. The food itself is pretty basic, although recently there's been a dip in quality of some of the food (potatoes are getting complaints). Sandwiches, omelettes, and french toast are all pretty good and portions are decent (not huge, but decent).\n\nIt's become something of a fixed hangout in the Mile End, which is saying a lot because Parc Avenue has this reputation of killing every establishment that tries to thrive within the first 6 months."
4,"I'm on the fence on whether I like Aria or Cosmo better, but I know for sure that I like playing poker in Aria, so it is all the more convenient to stay there."
4,Great food!  Had the carne asada plato special which was really tasty! Friend had Killer Burrito off menu which he loved. Service was so so. The man at the register was fantastic. Drinks not refilled and no one came back to check on us. All forgivable.  We'll be back for sure.
4,"I went to this coffee shop simply bc its name caught my eyes. It's located in the Noda area (which parking can be such a chaos), but it has its own private parking lot  that's a huge plus. Also free wifi too!!!!\n\nThe shop has a very cozy fell to it, and has about 10 small tables inside and outside. It also has its own roasting machine, I guess that's a big plus for HUGE coffee fan. Personally I like my coffee sweet and strong like cuban coffee. However, I made the mistake of ordering a Hazelnut cold brew. I mean don't get me wrong I still like it, but I prefer some sugar to it.\n\nI came here to do a little research, since we haven't install internet at our place yet. After sitting there 3 hours, I decided to order a Chai iced latte and lemon poppy muffin. The latte is pretty good, but didn't stand out to me as a MUST have in my drink list.\n\nI will definitely go back for the extremely friendly staff, and to try the cuban coffee in a colder weather."
4,"I really enjoyed myself. Though I hadn't heard any good feedback from many of my friends. She looked better (presentable) than I expected.  The bottle service really made for a great experience. 1 bottle of ciroc for 4 girls. We drank it all and had a blast.  The cushioned bench style seat was comfortable. The view from bottle service section is excellent. It's fun to have some drinks, get up off your seat and dance with your friends.  The stage props and dancers really help this show.  I would watch it again."
4,"Very loud and boisterous and bustling, and thankfully we had a reservation, but spent a great evening here!  The service was fantastic, the food and drinks came out in a timely manner, and there doesn't really seem to be a bad seat in the house.  I went simple and had the cheeseburger and I'm still dreaming about the next time I can go back and have another, it was fantastic.  And then I doubled down and had the brownie and thought I'd died and gone to heaven.  And the wine list was pretty big with some interesting options.  I would go back in a second, just really decent American cuisine well-prepared and served with style."
4,"This place is awesome.  Persian/Middle Eastern food on the cheap.\n\nIf you want a nice casual, fast food experience with restaurant quality food, then this is the spot.  Lunch with a drink is easily under 8-9 bucks.\n\nThe food is served fresh and is packed with flavor.  I usually order the Kubideh combo which comes with 2 skewers opting with the Ground chicken and Ground lamb.  So much food for only 8-9 bucks."
4,"A very inconspicuous  coffee shop located right below Elizabeth Arden's Red Door Spa. \n\nThey have a couple of pastries but just ordered an iced coffee for $3.00. It was a bit ''watery'' for my taste but on a hot afternoon, it hit the spot. \n\nWish they had sugar water to flavor it but didn't see it available."
4,"Food is ok but service is good, I mainly come here to watch the football game and have a few drinks TVs on every wall with different games going on and the patios big screen it's awesome."
4,"Saturday morning and still on the road for another week. It's laundry time. Easy access and Very clean. The nice attendant told me that they also do fluff  and fold for $1.50 a pound. Plenty of machines, wifi, change machine, soap products, TV's, A/C, ceiling fans, carts, folding tables, seating etc. Oh, and if you're a trucker, this place is on the corner and plenty of bobtail parking on the street. I'll be back!"
4,"Love, love,  love the Cajun barbecue shrimp! Be sure to order extra bread so you can soak up all of the yumminess! Great service, great drinks, especially if you are here before all the crowds. And yes, you must like country music...it IS a country bar with awesome music and some amazing live bands wed-sun. Did I mention the amazing shrimp! :)"
4,"I didn't stay at this hotel but did gamble here.  I had a good time, won a couple hundred bucks so I was happy.  \n\nIt did take forever to get drinks but I guess thats how it goes.  I'm not gonna hate cuz it took a while to get my drinks.\n\nThe roller coaster is awesome.  I didn't ride it this last trip but when I did I had so much fun.  I can't wait to go back.  Maybe I'll stay here and see how the rooms are."
4,"Great concept! I loved the individual portions just for the novelty of it. It might be useful to go with a buddy and pick out things to share.\n\nHighlights included the pesto mashed potatoes, prime rib, fried chicken, mushroom risotto, and truffled scalloped potatoes.\n\nLowlights: ramen (too salty), sushi (I didn't try any, but apparently it was the worst sushi ever), and some of the desserts were disappointing (rock hard red velvet cookies).\n\nCool idea with the mac and cheese bar, but one bowl can be shared with the table, as it's very rich and creamy, and the portions are pretty big. And you wanna save room for those king crab legs, right?\n\nMaybe this place doesn't have the variety like other buffets, but they offer items that are different or use different ingredients, which makes it more interesting."
4,"Overall really good barbecue.  I LOVE their chipotle cheese stuffed sausage!  The cheese is just amazing.  I had it on their burger once and it was good, as well.  The hushpuppies are really good here, too.  The centers of them are moist, which reminds me sort of a conch fritter.  Pulled pork, mac and cheese, and baked beans are real good.  Good variety of sauces...I prefer their signature sauce, which is a cross between a vinegar and tomato based sauce in my opinion.\n\nI had their brisket once and it was not my favorite.  I tried the ribs once and they had a lot of fat and were tough.  I hope those instances were just a fluke b/c everything else has been great.  I love to support local businesses and the workers always are nice and accommodating.  Great place!"
4,My husband and I tried Presto for the first time today and we really liked it! We had the ahi tuna sliders (delicious) and the Greek pide (also very good). I had never had pide before and really enjoyed the non-greasiness of the crust. I like pizza but I always end up using a million napkins to soak up the excess grease so the pide was such a great alternative for me. The service was good (I read a lot of complaints so I was a little worried it would take forever). My only complaint was that they pre-make all the salads and keep them in a cooler.  I initially wanted to order the ahi salad but I came to pick up the food around 3pm and I just didn't think the salad would be as crisp since it was sitting all day as if they made it fresh to order. I didn't try it though so I can't judge. All in all it was a nice lunch and I'm glad we have a healthy restaurant so close to home!
4,"I can only give this hotel 4 stars because I didn't stay here and didn't get the full Cosmopolitan experience. I can imagine that it's worth all 5 stars, but I can't know for sure just yet. I did however visit the casino a few times during the day and night. It's gorgeous inside with strands of crystals hanging from the ceiling like you are actually inside a chandelier. OMG I loved it, sooo pretty. The clubs and shops inside were top notch and most probably out of my price range, but awesome none the less. I went to the Sports Book and got to watch my team kick butt for a little while on their screen of TV's. I had bet at my casino, but The Cosmopolitan's odds were better. This place is pretty much one of the nicest hotels on the Strip right now. I walked through almost every single hotel, and this one really stood out!"
4,I was in North Phoenix for a friend's birthday.  This place was choose by one of our mutual friends.  This place is very authentic!!!  The help speaks Cantonese! (and English) and were very helpful in their recommendations.  I would go back if I lived up there.
4,"On Las Vegas Boulevard without being caught up in the chaos of the strip. My friends and I stopped by this bar to grab a drink and a quick bite before we headed to a movie at the South Point. Knowing that the casino would be packed, we came here.\n\nAt first, I was  hesitant to come because my first experience was disappointing. This second time, it was better. We entered around 10pm and sat ourselves at one of the side booths. The wait staff were slow to acknowledge our presence, but after we made it clear we were there, they were more attentive. \n\nThe menu is extensive and that can backfire. Like I said, my first experience had me never wanting to come back. I didn't care for their chili. I was impressed with the extensive salad choices. On Thursday, they have a  BBQ chicken served over cold soba noodles with tons of veggies tossed in. The marinade for the chicken remind me of the Chinese style BBQ except it was more salty than sweet. The half portion was 8.95 and was enough to tide me over. I was trying to be healthy, but could not help stealing my friends fries. They were thick cut and fried to a golden brown. Absolutely perfect.\n\nA bonus, they were playing so much 90's alternative. Nothing like some Smashing Pumpkins and Bush to remind me of my childhood."
4,"What I love about this location over the two that I am used to in Milwaukee is the basement used vinyl section. The two in Milwaukee run their vinyl on the floor, completely packed. I always have to sit on the floor, pull some out, and move like 20 at a time.\n\nThis location has 75% of the stuff in bins that I can stand and pick through...and the best part is that there is no one in the basement, so you don't feel weird if you want to sit there for two hours literally looking through every album. I don't feel welcome to do that at the one on 76th st in Milwaukee."
4,"You'll find this grub inside a seedy yet surprisingly clean bar called moon doggies.  I told Chris, the Naked City Pizza Owner, I 'd be scared to patronize this joint at night. He is assured me it's cool...mostly industry folk.\n\nTook hubs and dad in for lunch.  Strangely enough, we didn't have any pizza.  I know this guy is from Buffalo so we decided to try his buffalo wings.  We also tried the steak frites sub (a special written on the board).  Dad had a chili cheese hot dog with everything and fries.\n\nThe wings were good.  We ordered them \""hot\""  The were great!  Cooked just as I like them.\n\nDad loved his hot dog.  It had chili, cheese, pickles, onions, jalapenos and so on.  He didn't love his fries.\n\nThe steak frites sub was a monstrous roll coated with cheese and stuffed with garlicky beef, creamy horseradish, and skinny fries.  It was served with a side of peppery gravy to drizzle over the top.  The sandwich was excellent.  Lots of meat.  Perfectly seasoned.  Yum-o!\n\nOur lunch for three was $25 and we brought some home.\n\nI\""ll definitely go back soon to try the pizza!!"
4,"Dropped by for lunch on an early Saturday afternoon. Only one other table of guests there, but considering how new they are, that wasn't surprising. The server we had was obviously new to the job, but she did well.\n\nOrdered the Ma Po Tofu and the Baked Pork and Rice with Portuguese sauce. Both dishes tasted good.\n\nThis restaurant is a good place to try some Hong Kong \""western\"" style dishes. They are a very good east side of town alternative to the wealth of Chinese restaurants on Spring Mountain Rd."
4,I don't go to Dish for the culinary experience.  I do love the laid-back vibe with some good southern hangover/late night grub.  I like to order a half grilled cheese sandwish with a cup of tomato bisque.  I love that you get a deviled egg as a side to many dishes.  Nice touch.  My favorite is the black bean and rice burrito.  Cool tunes in the juke box.  Just a good local spot w/o the frills.
4,"I visited this cage twice within 24 hours during our trip to vegas.\n\nthey are very reasonably priced and the food is surprisingly tasty.\n\nwe sampled the garlic chicken wings, my husband liked it, but i thought i lacked a little flavor. the crispy garlic is good though.\n\ni really enjoyed the salted fish and chicken fried rice. and the portion was huge! they didnt skimp on the salted fish like most restaurants with is a big plus for me!\n\ni bought my dad some jook, since he wasnt feeling well, he had the salted pork with thousand year old egg porridge. it was pretty tasty, just enough saltiness and not too watery.\n\nAt our later visit my dad had their curry beef? i dont know how it was but i assumed it was good since my dad finished it. we also had the beef chow fun, it was very good, a lot of flavor from the \""fire\"" from the stove.\n\nthere were a few more items we had, but overall i'm pretty pleased with this very small but cozy hole in a wall restaurant that is outside of the strip of vegas.\n\nand because its not on the strip, its not going to hurt your wallet eating so much!"
4,"No nonsense, affordable prices.  Had my Audi in for service with Dan (someone whom I have total confidence in and have known since he worked at Chapman), no complaints as usual."
4,"I went here last night with some friends. The service we got was great, she refilled our drinks several times and even split the check for us after we forgot to tell her to. My pizza was fantastic, I got a personal pizza with artichokes and sliced tomatoes. It's a little more expensive than I would normally pay for pizza, but the ingredients were high quality and I was really pleased with it. \nEveryone else at the table had great reviews for what they ate. I didn't see any pizza left on the table at the end of the night. Worth repeating, just wish they had a bigger menu, it's pizza or nothing."
4,"The food offerings are above and beyond normal pub fair, more interesting than the typical burgers and fries and also deliciously made. I especially enjoyed the tomato soup made with goat cheese, the goat cheese fritters, and the butternut squash croquettes. They have many local quality beers on draft and the atmosphere is a cozy dark would expect and enjoy from a pub."
4,"I really like that this place is always busy, but not busy enough for the staff to accommodate you. Every time I've eaten here I've gotten excellent service... and food! \n\nI've mostly tried their pasta dishes and haven't disappointed with any of them so far. If I'm on a (rare) healthy kick I'll order their flank steak salad, which is still awesome. Also love their Italian sodas - Hurricane is my fave. \n\nThis is my new place to go for Italian and a definite must-try!"
4,"Superb cafe right next to Concordia campus that's perfect for a quick lunch, a study area (especially downstairs), a quick delicious drink or a relaxing weekend with poetry readings on Saturday & Sunday. Basically, they have it all! The half panini + soup combo is under $10 which is a steal for a student like myself. The lavender, rosemary lemonade is deliciously tart and full of flavour, which is wonderful because many a-times lemonade is extremely watered down. Yes this may just be another \""artsy\"" cafe that litters montreal, but the atmosphere and table arrangements create a comfortable stay, no matter what you're there for! Also, i read a past review that there used to be shisha and i'd love to see that return! It would be awesome!"
4,"Second time here, food came out very fast on a Saturday afternoon lunch time, pretty dang tasty overall, had a Pa-nang curry, pineapple fried rice, Mongolian beef, chicken pad Thai. We ordered everything spicy, yet still wanted more heat! If you like your Thai dishes spicy, order it at an 11 (out of 10). Maybe you'll get lucky and get that heat we missed out on."
4,"The food was great, but the service was disappointing.  We came here for a late lunch after spending a few hours at Qua Spa.  The pizza here was amazing, with generous toppings and a crispy crust.  Our server was not very responsive to getting water glasses filled and checking in on our meal."
4,"I was told this was the best buffet in Vegas and I don't see how anywhere else can compete.  They had everything from snow crab, king crab, steak, prime rib, shrimp, and all of the other typical buffet foods.  More on the expensive side, but you have to go here if you go to Vegas.  All the crab I ate, must have been worth so much at a normal restaurant.  \n\nWhat can I say, when John Wall is chillin right outside, it must be good.  Everything was tasty and very flavorful.  Definitely going back next time I'm in Vegas."
4,"First, it's a really nice bar.  The bartenders and staff are just great!  If you love beer, get the sampler and try them out, but the red ale is the best in my opinion!.\n\nHaving very fond memories of the amazing tuna poke at Lulu's in Lahaina on Maui, BJ's was in for some steep competition.  They succeeded in a wonderful take on the dish.  The avocado egg rolls made my belly happy as well, and were NOT at all greasy.\n\nVery very good.\n\nLots of TVs to watch various sporting events.  Lots of fun!"
4,"This is the best place, by far to eat on Mill. The chicken ceasar salad is phenominal. I'm very picky w/ my ceasar dressing & this one was perfect, not too fishy. Their margarita pizza is great. Since it is woodfired it may come out a little darker than you want so ask your server to have them cook yours for a shorter time if that bothers you. The service is great & love the ambiance."
4,"HH is the kind of place you go to when you're low on cash, it's Monday night & you are willing to drive to pick up your food.  They used to offer a medium 1-topping pizza for $5.55 on Monday nights.  Last wk when I called to order the special, they said it changed to a large for $5.99.  The beauty of this offer is that you don't have to buy 3 pizzas to get that price like the other chains!!!!!  With the economy in the toilet, I was astounded that they increased the size thereby improving the value for my hard earned dollars.  \n\nAs for taste & quality--it's pretty good.  I like to order the thin crust and usually get sausage or pepperoni anything extra, I add on myself (e.g., red onion, black olives, etc).  They don't glop on the sauce or skimp on the cheese & I've never rec'd a burnt/nearly burnt pizza.  It's even pretty good reheated."
4,"We came in here for dinner and really enjoyed it. I've ordered masala's at other places and they haven't made them as spicy as I like them to be, but here I ordered spicy chicken masala and I received a flavorful hot, SPICY chicken masala. Staff was very friendly and attentive.\nP.S.\nI Love Indian Food! ;-)"
4,"Delicious Southern food!\n\nThe cornbread was so good. I got BBQ Beef Ribs, with Mac & Cheese, Collard Greens, and Yams. The ribs were full of yummy NC vinegary flavor, the mac was cheesy and good, the collard greens were tangy and flavorful, and the yams were savory and sweet. For my first dinner in Charlotte, I was def satisfied.\n\nPrices are decent, and the service is good.\n\nParking can be a little tough. My best suggestion would be to park in one of the nearby structures, bc there really isn't street parking."
4,"Arrgh, just when I kicked my Chipotle habit, this place comes along.  Some great tortilla soup, custom made enchiladas that come out of the oven piping hot.  Why didn't some one come up with this earlier?  My biggest gripe is the parking lot, not the easiest to negotiate a little parking lot on 7th street during prime rush hour but worth it.  Oh they have great snickerdoodle and Mexican wedding cookies for purchase right at the counter!"
4,"I like this little store. It's nothing compared to the giant store in north Scottsdale. However, I like shopping here because it's a little bit less crazy most of the time. They don't carry all the stuff (and no food court or bar-haha) that the other store has, but they still have most of the good stuff. I usually go there after shopping at Trader Joe's!"
4,I like the idea I like the simple menu been there several times the only downside is once in a while the chicken will be rubbery but that just depends on the chicken I guess
4,"Sierra Gold invites you into a very comfortable atmosphere with good quality food & satisfying craves to enjoy whether one might be there for televised sports, video poker, or simple just sitting down at the bar or amusing seating area.\n\nFirst thing to keep note: HAPPY HOUR everyday from 3pm-7pm & 12am-4am (50% off all drinks & pizza)\n\nAs for the food:\n_Thin crust pizza (not a fan, but just got sold with the quality & outcome of the pizza that's served here)\n_Bucket of wings (so many favors, garlic parmesan is a favorite)\n_Bucket of curly fries (gotta love'em)\n_ZOOKIE (too good to be true! The warm white chocolate macadamia nut cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, whip cream, & dizzled with chocolate/caramel just hits the spot to that sweet tooth crave)\n\nService could have been better, but what do you expect at midnigt: top noch service? (minus 1 star)\n\nI have yet to try more & what's best: this local spot is open 24hours!!!"
4,Came here frequently in college. Fell in love with the green curry. I had the chance to go to Thailand for myself and eat some of the dishes I learned to love at Thai Taste - and Thai Taste's versions of the dishes are amazing.
4,"This is a hill with a view. On a clear day you will be able to see all over the Edinburgh-land and beyond. You can imagine being transported in time looking at the observatory and the columns of the unfinished monument. \n\nIn the summer you will have unobstructed sunshine on the days that the sun is out. And if you are into your photography the sunrises and sunsets from this heightened view point are ah-mazing. \n\nThe Carlton Hill is used as a venue for many art and performances - most famous is the Beltane Festival on 30 April. (the Winter spring Equinox)\n\nOn New Year's Eve / Hogmany this is one of the 7 hills that will display fireworks. \n\nhopefully they will not change this hill and its access, as it is a blessing for the residents as not many tourists tend to venture up this hill - since there is loads of other stuff for them to do.\n\nI like it here and it is mostly a very nice place to have a quiet walk and be out of the busy City that is just meters away."
4,"The Great Wall was my first dim sum experience, making me what you might call a tableau rosa*.  Since I know nothing about dim sum, all I can do is share my overall general biased by my own narrow existence perception of the place.  So here it goes.  As usual, Mr. K has accurately described and captured the essence of this restaurant in his review, so there's that.  Read his review.  What I can add is this.  The food all tasted good to me.  The atmosphere was fun and lively.  The demo is certainly nothing like any place I've ever been to in Phoenix, so those who decry the lack of diversity in this town, perhaps you just need to expand your horizons to include Great Wall into your rotation. And I would go back.  I have to get on the HIGHWAY to drive here, so that is saying a lot.  For those of you who are directionally challenged, it's the first shopping plaza on the east side of 35th Avenue, just north of Camelback.    \n\n*It's been years and years and years since high school English.  For some reason I think this means \""blank slate.\""  If not strike \""tableau rosa\"" and insert \""blank slate\"" above."
4,"Been dying to come here for quite some time and finally got a chance during a business trip. So, I've tried many of the so called \""best pizza in US\"" places such as this. Is it the best pizza I've ever tried, no, those honors go to either Motorino in NYC or A16 in San Francisco. Is is an awesome pizza nonetheless, absolutely. Very cool space and awesome service. Would totally go back next time I'm in town."
4,"Boy and I went to Tamari on a Friday evening. We had a late reservation (around nine), and we were asked to wait for our table for about ten minutes because the restaurant was a bit crowded. The hosts were extremely friendly and gracious, and while we were standing, they got us drinks from the bar. \n\nTamari has an ample selection of drinks, with interesting cocktails and decent choices of wine and beer. \n\nI was impressed at the innovative tapas combinations. For the first time in my entire life, I wasn't that hungry. So I only had the appetite to try two tapas; the lamb lollipop and the red snapper. The lamb was very tender and tasty. I really loved the red snapper, which came with mussels in a saffron broth. This was so different and very yummy!\n\nMy date had the empanadas (which he did not like very much), but was blown away by both the price and the quality of the hangar steak. We thought the $2 price was a joke (or a misprint to mean $20). The steaks (or chicken, bacon and quail egg, or salmon) are small servings, of course. But what they lack in quantity they make up for in quality!\n\nI have not yet tried the sushi, but will be back to do so!\n\n*EDIT* Boy insisted I tell you all that we saw Sam Worthington (from Avatar) there. Boy also states that I should add an extra half-star for Sam's appearance. Sorry. Can't do that!"
4,Get here early! Seats fill up quick!\n\nI love this theater. They always play movies for the longest and they oftentimes play movies that you can't see anywhere else. Very roomy and comfy. \n\nPrices are a little higher and it seems to be always crowded. Parking is a nightmare on a Saturday night.
4,"As far as sports bars go, this might be my favorite. Fantastic atmosphere, more than enough high-quality screens. Truly not a bad seat in the house. Added benefit is the phenomenal patio -- one of the best bar patios in town for sure. I've been there twice in the past week to watch Suns playoff games. Food is very good for bar food. First night was just 5-6 shared appetizers (wings, potato skins, chicken quesadilla, etc. - you know the stuff for us health nuts). Everything was fantastic. The second night we had the prime rib, mashed potatoes and asparagus dinner. Only $12 and it was great. After we had the skillet cookie which was one of the best things I've ever tasted -- I will get that every time I go no matter what. ;-) The only drawback was the wait staff. Was hard to get a drink a few times. Other than that, fantastic experience and we will be back regularly."
4,Easy to enjoy such clean fresh food. This restaurant would be a great addition to any city.  It is wonderful to have restaurant owners who are responding to our community wanting more organic and healthier choices.
4,Great place to get your drink on!  We were here for a private event but had a blast on the dance floor.  The appetizers and drinks were great.  Kudos to the bartenders for making the drinks fast.  I really love the lounge feel and the music was bumpin' the night we went.  Great place to hang if you're looking for something more intimate than XS or Tao.
4,"I'm a total fan of the lunch buffet at Villa Antonio! For $9 you get a great meal and of course as much as you want because it's a buffet. One of the best lunch buffets I've been to for a quick lunch during the work day. They have baked chicken, roasted vegetables, salad, mashed potatos, cheese ravioli, and other Italian specialities. You really get your money's worth and more for lunch!"
4,"My office typically orders Jason's to go, but if you feel like getting out, it's worth it.  Kind of a pain to get to but the salad bar is serious business.  For $7.99, you get unlimited trips to the small, but well-rounded offerings, fluorescent glow included free of charge.  It's not a huge salad bar, but it has everything you need to have a good lunch.  Added bonus:  Captain's Wafers!  Those crackers take me back to childhood!  I would suggest avoiding the patio though, as there is always some vagrant milling about.\n\nIf you are not looking for an excuse to be less productive, Jason's delivers ($3 charge I think) and I would recommend the turkey reuben.  Super good and under 550 calories with baked lays and a pickle."
4,"We just returned home after 4 days in Vegas. 2 nites in a row we were at Level 107. We loved it. There were 7 of us. Great service, the food(appetizers) we very good and the martinis great. 2 for 1 on martinis, 50% off appetizers. I'm usually not a martini drinker, but the caramel and the raspberry were very good. Go there, you'll have great drinks, service and a nice group of friendly people working there."
4,"A bright, pleasant breakfast spot close to our hotel.  We ate here several times during our 2 weeks in Brossard.  Come hungry.  They certainly fill your plate.  Crepes, waffles, pancakes, omelets, blintzes, they have it all.  They serve free coffee with your meals and always make sure it's topped off.\n\nThe weekday staff speak very little English.  However, a hostess and other staff show up for the weekend morning rush, most of which are competent English speakers.  Either way, we had no problem making understood what we wanted.\n\nCan't account for the other negative reviews.  Maybe the people up here have higher standards than what I'm used to back in the States."
4,"There may be other breakfast places that are more unique, have better individual menu items, or are more compelling for one reason or another. But over the years, this place has consistently provided great healthy meals and excellent, fast, friendly service. I have never had a bad experience here and have always left wondering why I don't come back here more often. Then I go and try some new trendy breakfast joint, only to realize I would have been better off coming back to First Watch instead. My personal favorite dish is the Chickichanga, but I've eaten half the stuff on the menu and it's all been really good. And I particularly enjoy the fact that no matter what I eat there, I never feel like I just ingested 9lbs of cheese and grease when I'm done. It's all light and healthy and fantastic."
4,"From scratch pastries, breads, breakfast, lunch, dinner options\nCozy coffee shop atmosphere, fireplace, plenty of tables.\nCash only. Pay at front and they will bring the food out to you.\nFree refills on coffee.\nNever dissapointed."
4,"Having traveled to Peru numerous times, I must say that the food here is equal to or better that what is available in Peru. We went there for lunch and went back to have dinner. The owners and wait staff work very hard so that your dinning experience is well worth a visit. Enjoy!!"
4,"My daughter took my husband and I for our anniversary last month.  I have to say this restaurant is one of descent Chinese restaurants in AZ since we used to live in San Francisco.  It's a little pricey but we enjoyed the ambiance, good service and good food.  I'm still looking for a non chain good Chinese restaurants since I love dim sum."
4,"Awesome place for pho ! Special combination is good,  but there serving is  not consistent sometimes you get a big portion then next time you get a sad face\n :( but this is the only restaurant that serves pho in my area . Service is excellent ! Hope \nThis information is useful :)"
4,"The Chuck Wagon is the only reason anyone should step foot into Longhorn Casino.  The Chuck Wagon takes up a good portion of the Casino as it should. The food is decent and the price is even better.  My go to meals here have always been breakfast items.  The Stampede is my usual... eggs, bacon, hash browns and toast.  But, the real reason we come here is for the S.O.S... My father, a retired Marine, thinks it to be really good.  If he doesn't know what good S.O.S. is, who would?\n\nThe service has always been above par.  I take away a star because you have to walk through a smoked filled casino.  And, there is always a wait."
4,"Aw, yeah! I never will go to County Market for my meat shopping again! Old Time can meet almost all of your meat eating needs and they do have a customer appreciation card where you get 10% off your next purchase when you purchase $200 worth at the store. Their sausages are quite good and their special flavors (applewursts you should try for sure!) change but they still have the classic bratwursts and mild and spicy italian sausage. Their flank steak is also good and their bulk italian sausage is also worth your while especially if you make spaghetti sauce from scratch. My complaint is that their hours and location could be better. Their staff is always helpful and they can help with getting special meat cuts."
4,"I've been to Fuzzy's Tacos quite a few times and I've consistently had a good experience.\n\nMy go-to favorite for this place is the Taco Plate. You get two tacos and two sides for $6.49 - enough for a decent meal. I've had the veggie tacos and the tempura shrimp tacos, both very good. The chips and salsa are a sizable quantity with no skimping on the salsa.\n\nThe burritos are alright, but I suggest to stick towards the tacos. The hot sauce is sufficiently hot. I've been stuck waiting a while for my meal a few times... maybe a suggestion, if anyone at Fuzzy's is watching this: If someone orders chips, maybe they can grab those first while waiting for the other meals to come out?\n\nAll in all, a good place to get a few tacos and chips. Lots of TVs so it's good for watching sports. I'd suggest giving it a shot with a couple of your buddies when you get a chance."
4,"Best $6 burger around. Smash fries and fried pickles are excellent. Always friendly and fast service. Great place for a burger, fries, and a shake for just a few bucks more than In N Out!"
4,"It's a fantastic little wine shop! Went here for a CMYE though I'm not much of a wine drinker. All the wines here are made with organic sustainable farming methods for those who are environmentally conscious. Located in the Atherton Market there is plenty of parking, but the Vin Master was quite hard to find. It is seriously tucked away in the back and hidden behind a pizza place. Thank god for the signs confirming it's there and gps or I would have never found the place!\n\nThe shop itself is much bigger than the outside looks. Exposed brick walls, high ceilings, and pleasant lighting give it a nice laid back feel. There's a couple chairs and tables and some people were enjoying a glass of wine when I came in. That's a nice touch being able to try some wines out before you buy them. The owner Chris is ridiculously nice and friendly guy who is a certified sommelier and will help you pick out a wine that's right for you.\n\nDefinitely check out this wine shop if you haven't before. You'll probably be pleased with your experience and happy with your wine choice."
4,"Currently closed for renovation, been out last 2 weeks. \n\nPricey is kinda subjective , I eat here at lunch and for the price of a \""---berto's\"" plate I get to sit in a nice atmosphere , get  great salsa with  flavor and decent dose of heat \n\n So far no complaints with service and I have a  pretty short lunch time. What stops it being great? Well this is a weak four as my meals have been an odd kinda mix  of great   ingredients , prepared consistently well  E.G, salsa, the beans, the rice, the side veggies  are way above most of the fare in similar restaurants  but the protein  comes out a bit bland and is carried by the surrounding material which is a shame.  \n\nIf you have friends that think Macoa's  is great this should blow them away:)"
4,"Love that the restaurant is based on fresh local ingredients. Great atmosphere and decor, great service...my glass of water was never below half full. We ordered the goat cheese appetizer, it was really good, loved it with the beets. I ordered the smokey burger. The flavour was fantastic fries were great, but trying to eat the burger without it falling apart was impossible. My husband ordered the sirloin steak and mushrooms...he said it had great flavour but the cut of meat wasn't that great, very chewy, with gristle through the middle. Had the s'mores parfait for dessert...really, really good! \nI would definitely return, but will try the prime rib or a fish entre next time."
4,"Im going to be honest, i had NO FLIPPING idea what was going on!\n\nbut it looked cool as hell, i say its an assault on your senses. prob wouldn't pay to watch it again though."
4,"I love this pub.  It's real nice and well lit on the inside.  Me and my boys usually come here for their pizza special.  It's half off past 12am so a large pizza would come out to 8 bucks which is not bad because they got some good pizza! Best thin crust I've ever tasted.  \n\nBesides the food and booze, they have a game area with 2 pool tables and some TV's that contain a number of games. Dont know what it actually is tho. I just know it's a touch screen and people play games on it and doesn't have anything to do with gambling.  If you wanna play some music there's a big jukebox where you can choose 2 songs per dollar and has it plays through out the bar.  \n\nIt's hidden near Ann and Camino Al Norte across the street from Smith's. And past 10, if you try to open the doors and they're locked, don't worry it's not closed they just gotta buzz you in."
4,"I've never had a bad meal at Newk's!  Their soups are great, and it's kind of hard to find a good soup (that isn't Panera or greasy chicken noodle) in uptown.  Lobster bisque is money, and I had the Ultimate Lobster soup today (I hate lobster, obviously), and it was awesome.  Great caesar salad, fresh and crunchy, and they have a little toppings bar.  Can't go wrong with some roasted garlic on the side (also hot peppers, pickles, capers, parmesan cheese, and thin crispy breadsticks).\n\nAside from all this... you know what the best part is?  The giant plastic cups that they give you when you get a fountain drink.  We have about 40 of them in the cupboard at work, they are awesome cups for large quantities of water or tea, so you don't have to keep refilling every minute.  It's the little things, people.  The little things."
4,"This place has awesome deals of two for $5 fro-yo or boba!!!  I always get the same, taro milk tea w/ pearls.  They give you a stamp card for everything too!!!  So, every time you buy waffles, crepes, fro-yo, or boba, you get stamped!  They each have their own stamp cards though.  I think its pretty cool how they double stamp you even if you get the two for $5.\n\nI havent had their crepes, but the waffles are delish.  Only downside is that it does take a little while to come out, so if you're in a hurry i'd skip on the savory waffles, and grab something else.  Shaved ice is yum.  I always get the regular one with fro-yo, three toppings of your choice,  shaved ice, and condensed milk. \n\nI really enjoy coming here and everything i've tried so far is good.  Check it out if you're in the area."
4,"Give me another SinCity burger, please! How delectable it is!  A burger topped with an egg, bacon, and cheese.....drool! Their signature Smash Fries are good, but  not consistent in quality based on the many times we have been there. The salads are not bad either. Just make sure you tell them to put the dressing on the side otherwise your lettuce will be swimming in dressing. Would have been a 5 star, but the inconsistency of the quality of fries and drowning of salad dressing makes it a 4."
4,I took my CCW class here and the instructor was very knowledgeable.  No complaints here and he made me a more accurate shooter.  What more could you ask for?
4,"One Of my favorite bars in Pgh:) they have a wide variety of beers on tap and there is always specials running everyday of the week... Appetizers are delicious, burgers are well stacked and sum pretty yummy wings! you can buy the sacuses for the wings which is amazing!! I recomend the teriyaki or the honey BBQ wings!"
4,"Chick-fil-a is comfort fast food for me. I love the original chicken sandwich; I add 1 pack of honey mustard. I grab a second honey mustard packet for dipping my delicious waffle fries - which, unfortunately, they sometimes skimp on, in my opinion. \n\nI have to tell you, though, I witnessed the talent of the best balloon artist I've ever seen at this location! (He's not there every week, but you'll find him there on some Wednesday afternoons for the whole \""kids eat free\"" thing.) I was so mesmerized, as I waited in line to order and then for my food,  that I hardly noticed the wait and the fact that the place was overrun with little ones didn't detract from my experience! Chick-fil-a actually caters to the whole family thing really well. (And, their kids' meals have educational toys, often promoting literacy)."
4,nice and small family run restaurant with great food you can eat in or they have fast delivery everything we tried has been really good and with enough leftover for another meal
4,"Just had steak, bacon & sweet potato tots (& hot sauce!!) for breakfast, Scott had the Hawaiian Breakfast - loved it!!! Soooo good!!"
4,"If you want to commit suicide by soda and sweets, come here and get your supplies.\n\nRocket Fizz is a great place to find odd sodas and candies that bring back childhood memories.  I visited a similar little store in St. George once, so finding one here that's bigger and better is awesome!  If they have the Jelly Belly Strawberry Jam soda, grab one.  They're goooooood.\n\nGreat prices, a plethora of soda to choose from and great candies.  I love the Fizz."
4,"Got a coupon for a free glitter ball in my email yesterday..so off I go with my little man for a free toy!\nGot there and plenty of glitter balls to choose from.\nI highly recommend signing up with the email rewards club. They always have events for the kiddos and freebies and great coupons.\nI also brought the little guy here when Ozzy Osbourne was signing his new book. it was hella crazy, line around the building. But I managed to take cuts right in front..no one questioned me since I had my baby. We met Ozzy and had a fun time. \nThe staff was a bit overwhelmed by the crowd..but they did good.\nI always stop here when Im at Town Square."
4,"R.I.P.\n\nChocolate Swan \n[January 1983 - March 2009] \nResident of Mandalay Bay\n\nAfter a courageous 16 year battle with erratic consumer demand and developing trends, Chocolate Swan passed away peacefully at their home in the Mandalay Bay. CS was very popular amongst both its peers and clients for making some of the most delicious desserts on the Strip. Their eclairs were among the best in the resort, and their cakes so beautiful that brides often called in advance to place orders for their big day. CS reached out and touched the hearts of so many with their delicious treats. \n\nI will add, the minute I discovered they had passed (it was a little over three minutes ago) was a sad one for me. For the family and friends of Chocolate Swan, I shed a virtual tear.\n\nPlease forward all donations, warm wishes and condolences to: Mandalay Bay, 3950 Las Vegas Boulevard South, Las Vegas, NV, (877) 632-7800"
4,"I really like La Condesa.  What stands out is the variety of fresh salsas on their salsa bar, and the great variety of tacos to choose from. I've had the shrimp, and a couple of different versions of their steak tacos.  I've also had the mole chicken, which was great as well.\n\nService can be a little sketchy here, mostly because they're often very busy.  But if you're in the area, it's a great place to try."
4,Went here with some friends for the all you can eat dinner. Pretty cheap compare to other place and the food was good. We got seated as soon as there was a table available. We order our meats and our server was very attentive refilling our drinks and bring more meat as we ordered. Everything was great from the beginning. But beware of smelling like Korean food as you leave!
4,"Over the past 2 weeks I have been a frequent customer at this particular PetSmart!  I have a new puppy in my house and need lots of treats, dog food and toys!  Of course, Howie, is eating the best dog food around BLUE BUFFALO!  No soy, no gluten, and no corn and best of all no meat by products!!!!!  Yes it is pricey but why wouldn't I want Howie to eat healthy food when I eat healthy food, right?  The toy selection is OK, seriously I know a lot of people don't want to spend money on good toys, but really give me options people!!!  As for the collar and leash selection, HELP!  I have a boy dog and I am a girl-options would be great in this department as well.  Think about it, it is his outfit and he should look fabulous everyday with colors that compliment his coat!  The staff has been great and helpful with little training tricks-nice to have dog lovers work at a pet store.  I would NEVER take Howie into PetSmart as it is just a breeding ground for illness.  Geez, you never know what diseases other animals may bring in.  Not everyone vaccinates their animals or takes care of them the proper way.  Though it is nice to shop with your little 4 legger-they are better left home:)"
4,"Good \""fast food\"" sandwich shop. I've been here probably 10+ times and wasn't as wowed this trip to Vegas as I have been the last few but still a good bite and pretty quick (as long as the line isn't insane). \n\nI've never had a sandwich I didn't like, though I'd say I could leave the salads I've tried there."
4,"Great food, really like the green chile burger. ( I know, I order a burger from a Mexican food place, but it's awesome) Also, they bring sopapilla's (sic?) after your meal which are delicious. Service has a tendency to be slow, never got refills, but otherwise a good place to get your grub on."
4,"i went based on good to great recent reviews.and they didnt disappoint. i had machaca breakfast w/came w/rice n beans n tortillas. however, when asked for another order of tortillas i wasnt informed there was a charge. to my surprise it was $1.50 for 2 small flour tortillas. you can get a dozen  for .99........anyways food was good but lil things like that dont sit well w/me n im sure you can agree. like free refills or extra salsa come on guys...ill bring to their attention next time personally..."
4,"I normally don't comment on service because that always varies depending on who you get, but I must say that our waitress was amazing. She seemed to be the only one working the whole restaurant, but I didn't notice. My drink was never more than half empty and she was working her butt off! Extra star just for her.\n\nA little local sports bar with a pretty extensive menus- dinner entrees, salads, burgers, sandwiches, appetizers, etc. I was only expecting pub dishes when we saw this place, but we were pleasantly surprised. My husband and I both ordered the Western burger. Overall solid burger- the patty itself was a little under seasoned, but the BBQ sauce had a good flavor and I enjoyed every bite.  \nHad the Frings on the side- fries and onion rings and they were delicious. Everything was crispy and well seasoned. \n\nGreat little joint to stop in to watch the game and have a well cooked meal. Great selection for a bar."
4,"Amore Pizza Discovery!\n\nI was grazing through the kitchen, looking for something eat, and opened up my fridge to see the leftovers from last night's Amore order.  I grabbed a slice of deep dish, and instead of warming it up, I went \""home on your parents couch\"" style, and ate it cold.\n\nSO TASTY COLD!\n\nI don't know how to feel about this, but the deep dish pizza was much better cold than it was fresh from the oven.  I noticed flavors I couldn't really detect the first time around.  I would recommend keeping a cold one on hand for when your little brother or brother-in-law comes to visit."
4,"Great place for an snack, appetizer, or meal. Perfect if you aren't sure what else is going to be open on Christmas day and you need something to tide you over since you have to wait 2 hours to be seated at Sam Woo/ or Dim Sum. \n\nPork Buns - were a good size at $1.30 a piece, coming fresh out of the oven at 11:30 am.\nChicken Pot Pies - Not really worth it unless you are craving the           great American spin- off.\nShredded Beef w/ Green Onion Roll - Only good because rolls last through the night perfect for hangover snacks. (costs more than the pork bun).\n\nHoney, I want to see your Pork Buns in Vegas, baby Vegas."
4,Easy large parking lot. Went into the bar first and tried to order a crown royal but no luck. Unbelievable that they are just out of it. Ok I won't rant but it's UNbelievable. \nSo the great breadsticks came and asked for butter to go with the oil and they were hot and just perfect.\nWe ordered the grilled shrimp on the rock appetizer and clams again tasted great and the presentation is nice.\nMain course was angel hair pasta with marinara and meatballs. This time all food was excellent and service for dinner was good. It was busy so service wasn't over the top but good.\nNo room for dessert but will be back for the bombalinos.
4,"My favorite pizza in Madison, WI.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/aVBFKYoF0AHuusNssaQpJA?select=jRGZL2b1hdZcoZszIcBQRw\n\nI could care less if the pizza is pre baked and that the crust is meh. Did you see what was on my pizza?! And yes, that is all it takes to wow me sometimes. \n\nSo glad I got to have that pizza again after a 5 year hiatus."
4,The club was really spacious. You didn't feel like you were confined to two areas. It was fun dancing on the water.
4,This is my favorite boa location. Staff is helpful and friendly. It can get busy tho especially with all the retailers banking here. \nI don't mind it because after your done there is so many food places around that area!
4,"A nice casual breakfast spot. Food was tasty and even though there was a line out the door, it moved fast. We did have to sit outside because the tables inside were full. Only disadvantages to note: it's serve yourself/cafeteria style. You have to get your own silverware, condiments and drinks. 2nd is they do not have any alcohol so you can't get your Sunday mimosa or Bloody Mary here."
4,"Went here again (7/5) to get my birthday bowl. GG corporate is pretty awesome and they extended my bday bowl a ways to let me get my bday bowl when we were in the area. Props to them for that. There seems to be a wait almost everytime we go there, but this time my veggies were cooked perfectly and my sauce was almost perfect (I put too much salt..dang) but overall it was a great $16 for 2! Love you GG!!"
4,"The store here is laid out very well.  It is more of a custom baby store, but has quality items at all diffrent prices.  Some of them my husband and I were sticker shocked, but with having our third baby nine years after the last lots has changed.  The staff here was very helpful and we will be registering for some of our items for the baby shower."
4,"This place is solid. It's not in the same league as Two Sisters Thai or Sala Thai in Phoenix (and I wouldn't call the flavors \""exceptional\"" as other reviewers have - I would call them slightly above average), but I go there regularly since it's close to where I live. It's more authentic than a lot of the trendy Asian restaurants in Scottsdale, so that's a plus. One caveat: if you walk in and more than half of the tables are full, LEAVE. This place is not equipped to deal with a full house."
4,Great Burger. \n\nWent on Memorial Day and surprisingly it was crowded but not overwhelmingly. We were able to grab two seats at the bar.  I wanted to split a boozy milkshake but he was in the mood for a cocktail. I got the brown cow float. It was lighter and he still had to help me with it! It was so good. I love a good root beer float. I could taste the booze.\n\nWe both ordered burgers. He added an egg to the steakhouse burger. I got the funghi. Both cooked perfectly. They were delicious. Generous portions. The fries were ok but the burger was so big. Truffle flavor was there and the Gruyere was perfectly melted. It was a more refined mushroom and Swiss burger. In a good way. The fries were just ok. A place like this should have perfectly executed fries there is no reason for anything less. However props to including them in the price of the burger.\n\nWe got good service from the bartenders but the shakes and burgers were slow coming. BF said the cocktail he has was well executed. \n\nWe will be back and next time I will ask them to make sure my fries are crispy.
4,"I live and work 2 blocks away, so the minute I saw the activity in the windows in preparation for opening I was excited.  Having a cheap, tasty taco place that close was a dream.\n\nI've been here at least 15 times and haven't been disappointed, although some of the options are better then the others.  The pork  tacos have recently passed into the sublime category, the beefs are decent.  The chicken is a decent, healthy option.  Carne Asada is meh, and the fish taco is not nearly close to good ones that I have had.  With that said they include organic cabbage and tomatoes which is a huge plus in my book.  Their flavored lemonades range from fantastic to meh.\n\nThe best part is 3 huge tacos are $4.50.  While they may not be authentic, the healthy (non greasy, organic vegatables), cheap price, and super friendly owner make this place a once a week type spot."
4,This review is only for Le Rive.  \n\nThe show was pretty much exactly what I expected.  Here is wasn't what you could assume:\n\n It had almost too much going on.  Can't look at everything at once.  \nStoryline wasn't exactly clear.  It more or less cleared up in the end.\nThe part where the cast is swimming synchronously with the red heels without coming to the surface to breath was pretty cool.  \nThe arena was pretty neat with the 360 degree view of the pool.
4,"Even though XS totally stole Tryst's thunder, I still love this place. I always have fun here. I like how the dance floor spills outside near the waterfall/pond so that there's readily accessible fresh air. Also, the layout is more interesting than the boring boxy clubs and the people who work here are a gazillion times better than TAO. It's never a problem getting in, and it's not uncomfortably crowded. Also, getting a drink doesn't usually take too long. And the bathrooms are really cute!"
4,"A good place if you want a decent burger. Wouldn't say it is the best burger I have ever had, however, it is tasty and hearty and the veggies (lettuce, tomato, etc) always taste fresh. I like that large amount of toppings to choose from. Prices are decent for what you get. A tip: I have heard that their regular burgers are huge so I always order the Jr burger and its more than enough. Also, the smalls fries are basically like a large at most other places so i don't even wanna picture what the large looks like. Atmosphere is clean and service is pretty quick. Like I said, a decent place for a burger in this neck of the woods."
4,I come to this location once every two weeks. Great selection of organic vegetables which they rotate so people who buy mostly organic aren't always stuck buying the same vegetables every week. The employees are usually nice and willing to go out of their way to help... only downside is sometimes it is difficult to find someone to help.  Some of the cashiers are a bit quirky but they mean well. Some reviewers complained about long lines but I haven't had a problem with that... however I typically go during the week.  I enjoy shopping here.
4,"Promising little bakery nestled in among the couple of businesses on this block of Rachel, directly across from the big church, a stone's throw from Jeanne Mance Park, goodie munching paradise. Its a tiny space, if there are quite a few people already inside you may need to wait outside until the space clears out. Friendly staff, delicious looking baked goods. We went in for the croissant festival only to be told we would have to wait for the next batch to be ready, so we decided to be adventurous and try out something different (almond chocolatine and Petit pain brioche). Trust me when I say the couple of goodies we tried were excellent! I will definitely be back to try out more more, there were some pieces of pie calling out to me, and decadent looking squares."
4,It's pretty good. Tons of food choices and there wasn't a line for us. Loved the sugar free cheesecake. Definitely worthy!!
4,"The food was really good, but I've had better.  The atmosphere was somewhat pretentious and uncomfortable, but nicely done.  $10 to add broccoli with my $62 steak seemed a bit gouging.\n\nService was above reproach.  Knowledgable and sincerely friendly staff.\n\nWould I eat at Delmonico's again?  Absolutely.  But my expectations will be lower next time."
4,"The food is fresh (except the meat, which is frozen, which is what knocked the place down a star) and the service is good. For around $9 you can have a bowl full of food, white or brown rice, soup, fried noodles and a drink. The place is clean and you can make your dish however you like."
4,"Pretty solid Japanese food, I must say. I'm originally from California and I go to school in New York so I've tasted some pretty good Japanese food before and I would definitely say that Chaya is among the top contenders. Is it the best Japanese food I've ever had? No, I wouldn't say that at all. But is it Japanese food that is enjoyable? Yes, I would definitely vouch for that.\n\nI think my slight issue is that I feel like the prices are a bit more on the expensive side. I don't think some of the items on the menu are reasonable at all, but I mean, I suppose they can charge whatever they want since they're one of the better places I've had in Pittsburgh. Service is very nice and always coming by to ask how the food is and if you want any water refills so at least that is good.\n\nIf you want traditional Japanese cuisine in Pittsburgh and you have some money to spare, I would definitely say this is a place to go."
4,"New to Phoenix from Pacific NW. Found Big Heng on Yelp. The food was pretty good and the portions were great. Had some misunderstandings and paid a little extra for things that normally come with a sit down Chinese meal - i.e., egg drop soup. Also had to ask repeatedly for mustard and sesame seeds, again, these are usually staples that just come with the meal where we are from. We had the kung pao chicken and a combination dinner (#3). The food arrived immediately which made me wonder about the freshness, but overall the food was good and we will go back."
4,"My bibimbop was good, and it was served in a normal bowl like I expected. I didn't expect a hot pot, because it's not listed as dolsot on the menu. The kimchi was also good, the server was pleasant, and the price was $10 which is reasonable. I'm glad I can get bibimbop in my neighborhood."
4,Love this place! Would give it a 5star if service was a bit better. Usually go here once a month. You can't beat all you can eat sushi for $25. Food quality has always been great. Not once have we had something we didn't like. \n\nUsually pretty busy. Always packed for lunch and dinner! It can get a bit noisy with all the people.
4,"With a fun and upbeat bar area, this place is located in downtown Phoenix, close to the US Airways Center. It seemed that the family area was completely separated from the bar area, which I liked. \nThey have plenty of seating but It can get very busy there on a game night. Also, parking can be a problem if you are just there for dinner and drinks. I didn't think of that and ended up paying $10 for parking. \nI ordered the Long Island Iced Tea, it was very potent and tasted great, just the way it the LIIT should taste. My husband got the wings, which I didn't try but he seemed impressed. I got the fish tacos, and they were very good. The cilantro sauce that came with it was  a little thick and tasted more like ranch, but the salsa was ok. \nAll in all, I had a great time there and the bartenders were all very friendly and attentive."
4,"For dinner, I am definitely a Tao fan. \n\nThe food is delish, the service is top notch and decor can't be beat. The salads are a fusion of American and Japanese, I could eat one as my whole meal and be totally satisfied. The seabass is awesome, :almost: as good as the seabass skewers at Sushi Samba. And their desserts are amazing - trust me, I've pretty much tried them all. \n\nAND I love the lounge, it's perfectly designed for a pre- or post- dinner drink."
4,"Really amazing food, and vegetarian friendly.  Really was surprised to find this place, which reminded me of a great restaurant in the meatpacking district in Manhattan, at about 1/3rd the cost.\n\nNever been there when it's been crowded, but the service is often appallingly slow.  I'd go there much more often - and bump this up to five stars - if it weren't an ordeal to get the bread that other tables seem to manage, or a refill on my drink.\n\nIf you have extra time, aren't in any hurry, and want great Italian that doesn't rely on marinara sauce, go now."
4,"I loved the crab cakes here! They were made perfectly, very flavorful. The decor is pretty and modern with dim lights and lit candles. Very romantic. The one thing I didn't like was how the tables were all so close to each other. The restaurant is pretty big but not roomy. Our server was great, he knew how to crack jokes which kept the mood more lively. \n\nMe and the bf both ordered the ribeye which came in a pretty big portion. Although it was missing a little flavor. There wasn't anything special about it so it was just average. I wanted dessert but we were just too stuffed from the steak. I def. regret that! Although our waiter knew it was our anniversary so he brought out a plate with some chocolate and on the plate it said \""Happy Anniversary\"". That was sweet and it seriously made my night. I left happy and satisfied."
4,"Been here a couple times for the XDC event and I've only ever really seen one track. BUT!!! When I do go, next to the track is a huge lake where people drive their different water vehicles and can do jumps I think if they want to go water skiing. I do get burnt when it's hot but when track doesn't get you burnt?"
4,"fun place to stop for a treat if you're trecking across campus.  perfectly located just off the quad on wright st.  pretty good flavor and rather fresh.  they stopped making my favorite  piece in their collection; the earl grey truffle, so minus one star for creating a love affair with an unavailable partner."
4,"Stayed at the Signature this past weekend so we went to Delights for a post night of drinking meal, and it was good. \n\nI got the Las Vegas Blvd sandwich ( I think that's the one I got) it was a sandwich with Skirt steak, fried egg, caramelized onions, and a sauce. It was so good, my only real complaint is the proportions are kind of small and it's a bit pricey. \n\nI paid $12 for a sandwich but it was a really good sandwich so no real complaints."
4,"This place is really good.  There are five meats (pork ribs, beef ribs, fried chicken, catfish, and perch), and with your meat you get two sides (e.g., collard greens, black-eyed peas, sweet potatoes, mac and cheese, sauteed veggies) and a bread (corn muffin, hush puppies, or dinner roll).  This is for about $8 combined, and you can also order the sides separately.  Plus there are desserts like sweet potato pie and lemon cake.\n\nDoug cooks up all the dinner food in the back, and his wife makes the desserts and does the table service in the front.  That is pretty adorable.  The food is good - no crazy frills, not particularly refined, but solid.  The fried chicken is particularly tasty, with a thin but very crispy skin and super juicy interior.  I also thought the mac and cheese and collard greens were highlights.  The pork ribs were actually underwhelming at the restaurant, but they were significantly better heated up at home the next day.\n\nThere are about 10 tables in the storefront, but you can also do takeout.  There was not a lot of business when I was there on a Wednesday night, probably because the location is kind of out of the way.  But, you should make it a point to go.  In my opinion, Doug's is a clear winner over Kip's, even though Kip's is also good."
4,"All I can say is DELICIOUS! From their Pho, to the fried rice, to their rice plates.  Everything is just delicious.  If you don't believe me, see for yourself."
4,The Rigatoni Bolognese is amazing! It's my favorite dish is in this place. (Meant to post in 2012. Way delayed post.)
4,A Master Chef and food historian brought me to Joe's Diner. I've been coming back ever since. The decor is classic American diner but the food and coffee is a cut above. $10 sandwiches are done perfectly. The coffee is Arbuckles Ariosa cowboy coffee. The waitress was very nice. Nice little mid town jem in the Melrose District
4,"Been here several times and always leave happy and full! \nThe drink menu is fantastic... a few of my favs are the red headed stepchild, stoney bah-loanie and pure vesper. \nThe food is always spot on...love the pork belly, nancy with pork belly, charcuterie, pork tostadas and ALWAYS try to the TOT of the day!\nI can't imagine ever having a bad meal here!"
4,"When I called, they went above and beyond to make sure I got a true quote, including coming out and checking my unit for serial numbers to check on warranty.  They were honest with the price, and they were my third quote and though a bit higher they guaranteed their work with a a year warranty.  Cooled my house down in one day in the middle of summer and called me twice to make sure it was all working!  very good honest service!"
4,"A great menu, very polite staff and a nice atmosphere. Not cheap but definitely not the worst in the MGM. Four of us had some drinks and nice amount of food for $300. Have the server mix up a plate of oysters for you, they are to die for. Clams are always \""ehh\"" so don't expect miracles. The meat selection is not terribly vast, but what they did have is just fine. The rib-eye is something truly special."
4,"First time there, went to the lunch buffet with a couple of friends and it was amazing.\nTons of vegetarian options. Love it!"
4,"This is the place where my husband and I get drinks, peruse books, and play games.  It may not be funky or trendy, but it is open regularly (even on Sunday when I grade papers).  The people who work there are really nice.  If they don't have a book, they will offer to order it, and they have a pretty darn good game selection for a big bookstore.  I even got Pandemic there!  \n\nI find it enjoyable to see how many teachers I see!"
4,"If you don't mind staying a little further from the strip, then this is the place to stay! It's not going to give you that luxury hotel experience that you'd get from staying at some of the hotels in Vegas, but I was very happy with the experience.\n\nI went with a group of friends to Vegas a couple months ago, so we booked two suites for all of us for 3 nights. Each suite had a full kitchen, washer and dryer, two bedrooms (one with a king-sized bed [with a Jacuzzi!!] and the other with two queen-sized beds), and a nice living room with a flat screen tv, couch, chairs, and a dining table. It definitely had a very comfortable, home-y feel to it. Everything was clean and there were plenty of extra towels in the bathrooms. \n\nThey also had a nice pool to relax and do some swimming. No glass allowed by the pool, but Solo cups are fine for drinks, if you know what I mean. ;) The pool is no Encore Beach Club by any means, but it's quiet and relaxing if you want to tan and doze off for a bit. :) \n\nI would definitely stay there again if we go back. My only complaint would be that they didn't have one of our suites ready by the time we checked in, and one of the doors to the bathroom had a huge hole in it, but Customer Service was really helpful in recording the damage and not charging us for it."
4,"Service and food are excellent! No fluff, just straight up, great quality. Every plate that was being served looked and smelled great. \nI will most definitely be returning to sample the rest of the menu!"
4,"We went in the 9:30pm show not knowing what to expect, and we were happily surprised. The show was entertaining with a wide variety of different acts. It's definitely an adult show with some non-family humor. The seatings are a bit packed together especially with the folding chairs seating that are a bit uncomfortable. Overall, the show is quite fun. Definitely a good show to see!"
4,"I'm never disappointed when I eat at a Wildflower.  It's a better version of Paradise Bakery with a feel free to stay all day if you like (but less pretentious) Starbucks vibe.  I also dig that one of the founders of the company emailed me to address some of my critiques of another location, even though the review was generally positive.  It's great to see that they're paying attention to their customers.\n\nThere's a great selection of sandwiches, salads and baked goods.  For the sandwiches I think the secret is in the simplicity and quality.  Most of them don't have more than three or four ingredients, but they seem to put together the perfect combination between those two slices of fresh baked bread.  My wife's caesar salad may have been one of the tastiest caesar salads I've ever tried.\n\nThis location also has a few cool things going for it.  There are power outlets under many of the booths, making it convenient for computer and tablet users to do whatever they are doing as they enjoy their drinks and meals.  Like other locations, there's the standard lounge near the front of the restaurant that's a perfect place for waiting for take out orders, or for coffee drinkers to hang out in a more open setting.  And this Wildflower also has a private party room in the back, which is also nice if you have a big group.\n\nIf you're anywhere nearby, Wildflower Bread Company is certainly worth a try."
4,"I love West Elm... what girl doesn't.  Great bedding, throw pillows, ok everything!\n\nThis is a very large store, but it doesn't seem to have several designs that are on the website.  I know most of the West Elm stores only get certain designs, but for the size of this store I wish they had a little more. \n\nI noticed that they have items on sale online from my email, but it doesn't always translate to the same price in their store.  \n\nStaff is super friendly and very helpful!  I'm so thankful Las Vegas has West Elm... I had a mini panic attack when I realized there was no Crate and Barrel.\n\nThe is the one of the best places in Vegas to shop for home decor."
4,I love Ethiopian cuisine...I first tried it in San Francisco because my uncle knew someone that knew how to make it!  It was amazing and then a really good family friend is from Ethiopia and he has just introduced me to even more fabulous food!  I would eat it everyday if I could...\nBlue Nile was the first Ethiopian restaurant that I tried in Phoenix.  I always passed in when I was in Tempe and one day I decided to try it.  I was impressed!  It was really good!  I do not know the names of the dishes but it was the chicken and I got it with the mushrooms and lentils...and of course the spongy bread that you eat everything with...I love the fact that you get to eat with your hands its awesome!  I wish that I would have been able to try many dishes at one time but that is ok...This place is great but Cafe Lalibela has the special place in my heart!  I will return and I do encourage people to try this place...
4,"The Old Fashioned is far from its name. It's full of energy and in the midst of a college town in Michigan. They offer great mixed drinks at a decent price and their food is fantastic. The one item I will suggest, no matter what your pallet, is the cheese curds. They are one of the best appetizers I've had in any restaurant and come with a multitude of sauces for dipping (provided you pay a little extra for each). Well worth it."
4,"This place is super cool. Loved the tree stump stools, the unfinished tables with hardware and chalk menu board. The staff is very nice and the java is pretty darn good. I went for iced latte but I couldn't resist the the chocolate chip cookie with BACON! Yes...bacon! Why does bacon make everything taste better?! \n\nCan't wait to check out their wine selection next!"
4,"I really enjoy this place. Ambiance is fantastic. Just the right lighting, cool space, nice bar which is the center piece and should be because the bartenders are top notch. Drinks are not the average bottle slinging. Anything off the menu is an experience though the special was too smokey like eating a piece of wood out of the fire. However no uppity BS, she took it back and made me another. \n\nHad the special which was the chacatuire as an app with the fried Brussel sprouts. Both were outstanding. For main course we had the special strip which was also fantastic. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because the waygu was way too fatty and not well seasoned. Dessert was phenomenal. Chocolate pecan pie and the chocolate mousse. Both of them were so good we nearly ordered another. \n\nThis place consistently delivers a great dining experience. Karen was a great waitress as well. My friend from Cincinnati repeatedly said they had nothing like it there. Props to the burgh and to meat and potatoes for bringing big city dining to our beautiful city."
4,Prior to NYC having any Whole Foods location I was OBSESSED with any location I happened upon. We have had WF for over a decade now in NYC but I still visit other locations with interest. This is one of the nicest I have been to probably in part because it is quite new. (having opened last September one of the employees told me) The outdoor seating area on the 2nd floor is nice. \n\nClearly we are not in NYC as one of the deals in the prepared foods area was 4 for $4 where you could get 4 of the salads (healthy selections designations) for $4. The soup selection was pretty good the only thing I would say is the hot/cold prepared foods on the buffet were kind of so so.\n\nLots of available parking downstairs.
4,"We found out about this bakery thru Yelp.  We had been wanting to try out those almond croissants for quite some time.  We happened to be in the area on an early Saturday afternoon.  Unfortunately for us, they were out!  No croissants of any kind!   We opted for an apple pastry and a pistachio eclair.  Both were delicious.  Can't wait to visit, again."
4,"Their sandwiches are so good!\n\nIt's so convenient that they're opened 24 hours. We came here after midnight and there was still a quite a long line and a lot of the tables were taken.\n\nThe bread they use is nice and crispy.\n\nMy recommendation:\n- The Original: I usually don't like horseradish, but surprisingly I really enjoyed it in this sandwich. Yum.\n\nI will definitely return and update my review with more recommendations once I try more of their sandwiches!"
4,"Real good, mesquite grilled steaks, burgers, chicken ect. in a rustic, yet clean setting.  Fair prices, decent selection, the service was excellent. \n\nIts only about 7 minutes off of the US 60 (take the Idaho exit, not Tomahawk) .  If you want a different atmosphere, give it a try, you wont be disappointed. \n\nOnly down side is that It is a snowbird mecca"
4,"Went here once for labwork.  My wife had something down the street to tend to.  No one was there, and it was only me that Friday morning.  I was in and out in 7 minutes.  Too bad this place is now closed :-(!!!"
4,I've been wanting to stop by here before work for weeks and I finally had the chance this past week and it was definitely worth it! They currently have a $1.50 deal for a doughnut and a cup of coffee; the perfect way to start your Friday. Their pastries and doughnuts are delicious! Absolutely stop by if you get the chance.
4,"Flew this airline once when I was flying from PHX to PDX (Portland, Oregon).  Really enjoyed my flight experience.  This airline flies out of Terminal 2, which is the first terminal once you are off from I-10.  Easy parking access and literally walk right in to the security check-point.  Will definitely try again if I'm going to the PNW area again."
4,"As an Italian, I eat way too much pasta. I was a bit skeptical trying out a place that makes \""fresh pasta\"" since we do it fresh at home but this place is definitely worth your time and money. The pasta is very fresh, the sauces are quite tasty and the people working there are super helpful. I would suggest this place if you're having guests over and want to make something super quick and good!"
4,"I had the jambalaya and it was very good. GF had the fish and pasta, she loved it. Only problem was that we sat outside and a bee was bothering us.\n\notherwise the drinks are great, the food was plentiful, and the atmosphere was very calm!"
4,"This is your one-stop Chinese takeout shop!  Hunan park never disappoints, and they always have your order ready super quick.  I highly recommend the general tsao's chicken.  If you order takeout for dinner be sure to ask for utensils or have your own. Overall, solid across the board!"
4,"Great food , the salmon was to die for.\nThe waiter was informative and had a stupid attitude when we had questions ,good price  4 star since it was my first time here and I hate rude and very unfriendly waiter"
4,"If you are on a budget and visiting Las Vegas this is the place to go.  It is one of the biggest hotels on Fremont and had millions of dollars worth of renovations over the past few years.  Most friends I bring here are shocked that such a nice hotel is not on the strip.  The pool is my favorite part.  This is where you find the shark tank with a water slide that goes right through the middle of it!  It is a site to see for sure.\n\nAnd if you are not staying at the hotel the price of admission is only $20, which is not bad compared to so many of the pools on the strip.\n\nThe downside to the hotel itself is because it is not on the strip the air quality is not as fresh.  If you are a smoker this will not be an issue, but if you are a non-smoker this could be a nuisance."
4,Tea Station is a good place if you're looking for a quick pick me up when its late at night. I usually go here with my friends before we hit the Vegas nightlife scene or after we have had dinner. It gets busy around 9pm-11pm. The atmosphere is very casual and. Their service has gotten better than when I first came in 2-3 years ago. The staff is more attentive and conversant than before. They have a wide variety of teas to choose from; as well as various food items. I like to order their taro milk tea with boba.
4,Food was exceptional for a brew pub.  Beer was some of the best I've tried.  Service was prompt and courteous.
4,"Terrific, family-friendly burger joint with an outstanding craft beer selection and a roomy patio. What more could you ask for? The burgers may not be the best I've had (hit SmashBurger or Big Daddy's for those), but they get the job done. And did I mention the craft beer selection? Best I've seen in a casual dining joint. B.T.'s is an outstanding addition to Charlotte's burger scene!"
4,"My favorite aspect of the Cheesecake Factory is its dependability and consistency.  The menu is large and incredibly diverse, yet everything I have there is always good to great.  We're not talking gourmet excellence by any stretch, but for the price point I always enjoy myself there.\n\nI'm also a huge fan of their curbside to go system, where you call in your order and they deliver it to your car.  Very convenient and I believe it was the first restaurant to provide the service (at least it was the first that I noticed).\n\nOh yeah, and the cheesecakes are pretty damn good, too.  You have to love the variety offered."
4,"Since Yelp orders things by original date, and there are 2982 reviews when I write this, I'm thinking my review will be read in say, March of 2017.  \n\nThat said, I've made a point to try most of the Strip buffets, the other reviewers aren't lying it's pretty tasty here overall.\n\nThey've got the small pots/baskets for a lot of the dishes like some of the other buffets do, and though they are cute, you end up with one on your plate, and no room for any of the other tasty treats.   \n\nAll the usual seafood choices (crab legs, etc...)\n\nThe bone marrow is good, but wow it's filling and greasy.  Do not have it first!  \n\nDessert choice is great, a lot of choices (macarons even!) to be had.\n\nService is normal for buffets, the servers are attentive and friendly, clearing your multiple plates away without you noticing.\n\nOut of the way to get to in the hotel though, which is both a good and bad thing.  Good in that it reduces lines.  Bad in that you have a long hike to get there, and honestly, it feels like you're walking through dead parts of a convention hotel where you probably shouldn't even be.  But viola, there you suddenly are, and it's food coma time."
4,"Loved this little hole in the wall restaurant! It's tucked away in a corner of the grand canal shops on the Venetian side. It's a family run business and authentic Italian as they're actually from Italy, including the wait staff. They made great recommendations and we loved all of them! I ordered the linguine fruti de mare (clams, calamari, and shrimp in a spicy marinara) while my mom orders linguine in clam sauce and my aunt ordered the swordfish piccata style with steamed vegetables. I loved my dish and I usually don't like red sauces. I also loved the swordfish, the piccata was so flavorful and perfectly cooked! The garlic knots were also really great, which came free! We ended up ordering the tiramisu for dessert even though my aunt was hesitant because the example looked really creamy. It was really creamy, but surprised us in how delicious it was! It was a light cream and my aunt was glad we ended up ordering it! I was happy to hear that they would be expanding because they deserve to be seen! Great service and food and decent prices for Vegas!"
4,"I had the chicken rice noodle soup and it was good, so was the fried eggroll. My husband had the chicken curry soup, I didn't care for that very much. Their thai coffee was good. I would definitely go back."
4,"The worst thing about this place is its name.  I think even the hostess mispronounced it and it really has nothing to do with the menu or ambiance of the restaurant.  Goodyear needs another Mexican restaurant to go out of business 2 months after opening like it needs another pizza place.  So I was pleasantly surprised to find that although it has a Latin flair, Caballero Grill is not another Mexican restaurant.\n\nWe went for a late lunch which meant we were there for happy hour.  I had a great, big cheese burger and fries for 6 dollars.  Quality ingredients through out.  My wife ordered a couple of their specialty drinks which were a bargain at $4.\n\nThere were some other misses though.  The trio dip, while good was not worth the $5 happy hour price much less the $7 regular price.  Our neighbors had the mini chimichangas and they barely looked worth the $4 happy hour price.  My wife had the club sandwich sliders which were just too much bread and not enough flavor.  Domestic drafts are 50% off at happy hour but micro-brews are only 20% off which does not make me very happy.\n\nOverall though it was a pleasant surprise and not a complete fleecing."
4,Great food and service! Place is small but comfortable. As soon as we sat down we had someone come to us for drinks. I will definitely go back to try some of the other menu choices.
4,"Took \""the Fam\""  and grandkids( Yes, Jeannie has grandkids) to Joe's for breakfast.  Not only did we leave without a huge dent in my wallet, we all left pleasantly stuffed!  If you like bacon, order like 5 sides of it.  You won't want to share this pig perfection! Thumbs up were given by all....French toast, breakfast burrito, pancakes, and cinnamon buns were all gobbled down.  My son and I ordered the biscuits and gravy.  We both devoured them like Evil Skeksis! The biscuits are super soft and they have the gravy just right. I would go there and just eat that each time...for 2.99!!!!  It was more than enough food too.\n\nCheck it out!"
4,"Great pho, the broth is so delicious and a great big portion.  Try the rolls too, they do it right!\n\nBeen here on a couple of occassions since it's a far drive, but a great place to stop by for some great food.\n\nTried a few different items when dining with a group recently. Enough for everyone to share and even took some leftovers.\n\nEven though they were close to closing time, they allowed us and some other folks in.  Great people."
4,"If you want sushi at your own pace and without telling the sushi chef what you want, then this place is it.  The quality I would say borders good to excellent. This is rather surprising in the fact that this is a conveyor belt styled sushi place. The price is very reasonable.\n\nThe staff cycles the dish frequently to keep the items fresh and cold. For a sushi connoisseur, there is nothing worse than warm or luke-cold sushi.\n\nSelections are average in that, there are more rolled sushi as opposed to nigiri styled sushi.\n\nI do hope the staff will provide ginger (gari), along with wassabi to all the patrons. \n\nFinally, this is not a restaurant to hold your power meetings, but will accommodate groups, family style dining, in casual setting."
4,"we went here for dinner and drinks, and it was awesome. the giant soft pretzels are amazing, buttery, and delicious and are served with a roasted pepper cheese sauce. they are awesome, but get them to share, the butteryness is rich! the prices are reasonable, and the patio is nice to sit out on! even better than the food, service, and prices is the music!! they play an awesome selection of music!!"
4,"I love whole foods ! The groceries are soooo fresh and decently priced but the only drawback is the employees... \nThey're kinda rude and don't have much of a personality... The cashiers don't hold much of a conversation, they seem so miserable working here! \nEven though the employees are lame, it won't keep me from giving whole foods my business that's why I am giving four stars!!"
4,"Go to brunch place in Montreal.  Don't know if it's worth the wait though.  Go during the week if you can when it's less busy.  We did and we ended up running into Georges St. Pierre!!  Eggs Benedict and GSP, what more can you ask for."
4,"The green is a blissful centerpiece of Charlotte, our very miniature version of Central Park.  There are unique sculptures that are scattered about the park and fun road signs pointing to random yet creative destinations.  The park is a fun place to take your kids after some ice-cream to run some sugar out of their systems or to walk hand in hand with your significant other while the sun is beating down.  I tossed a penny into fountain with the man-sized fish around each corner.  Often times, The Green is reserved for weddings and receptions, but I would chose a less busy destination.  I just enjoy wandering down the paths to catch some relaxation."
4,"I was badly craving asian food and decided to give PF Chang's a try.  Being a lone diner since I was in town for business, I was worried that they were going to ignore me or sit me in a crappy area to hide me.  However, the service was great.  I was glad to see my food come quickly and taste good.  \n\nI had the lettuce wraps, crab rangoon, and a cup of their hot and sour soup.  All three were excellent.  I would definitely recommend this place to business travelers who might be staying in the area.  (There are a lot of hotels near by)"
4,"I just had to drop a note to say just how nice it was to have fast, clear and strong Wi-Fi in my room.\nWhomever handles that for your place is doing great work."
4,"This shop, located in the Bellagio, is smaller then its counterpart located in Aria's.\nThe chocolate fountain is amazing to look at and take pictures of.\n\nThe line is confusing and there are people everyone in this very small shop with very limited seating inside.\n\nI was so excited to be ordering individual desserts for my friend's birthday that I failed to listen to the girl that was describing what I was pointing to. My taste buds heard \""Raspberry Macaroon\"" and the girl actually said \""Raspberry Macaroon with ROSE OIL\"".\n\nNeedless to say I did not like the mini that I purchased for myself but my friend's all enjoyed, with great enthusiasm their desserts."
4,"Love the food amazing for being as vegan as I can be amazing place to dine in on a date with options for us. Our order has come our a few times with seafood in it but we look past it for the amazing staff and management willing to correct it. As well as more than happy to serve us. When ever our order has been wrong we still paid full price we weren't looking for a freebie just simply a correction in the kitchen and it was made. Great drinks, food, and staff, will always return."
4,"Love this place! If you love Mexican food you definitely have to try this place out! My favorite is hands down the flour tortilla chicken flautas! This is a great mixture with the complimentary chips salsa and beans that you get before you order! Also they have a Sunday brunch buffet that is always a great deal. From the homemade tortillas to the Mexican favorites for breakfast. Juevos con hamon, chile verde con pollo, bacon! Always got to have bacon! It's just a great atmosphere with live music playing"
4,"I'm a fan based on two things:  The price for breakfast and the variety of baked goods offered!\n\nIf I read the menu correctly, you have to get there before 10am to get the breakfast price of $8.95 versus the \""brunch\"" price of $13.95.  The buffet was perfect and offered everything I could have wanted so I suggest sticking with the breakfast buffet.\n\nBuffets can go one way or the other.  Either they are disgusting (ie Golden Corrall) with a ton of plastic, boxed food or they are a display of heavenly goodness.  Fortunately for me, Pike's offered the latter!   We're talking fresh fruit salad, biscuits and gravy, grits, cheese/potatoe hash, muffins, scones and pastries, eggs, egg benedict, sausage, bacon, blueberry french toast, etc.  Everything was fresh, what needed to be crispy was crispy, what needed to be fluffy was fluffy, what needed to be moist was moist.  It was all very good and of course the best part is that it is limitless!\n\nThe servers were friendly and by around 10:30 it was starting to get packed.  Obviously the south-end location is key and there really shouldn't be any other reason not to give them a try!\n\nI'll be back!"
4,"OYSTER SHOTS! \n\nThey have some great oysters here that make for a great starter!\n\nGreat place to come to if you have a group of 8 to 10, but also still great to come if it's just you and you want to suck down some oysters and have a glass of whiskey. \n\nThey have as fresh as you can get oysters in Las Vegas. I did find it funny that their oyster monger had never been to the Ocean, but his knowledge of oysters was great, he even let me sample each one so I could choose the optimal dozen, which I appreciated because they had 4 different kinds and each one was TOTALLY different and the ones I thought I'd like were not my favorite at all...\n\nThe only thing I mark a star down is their seafood special (the lobster, crab, clams, etc.. was only ok) It might have been because that was when we had 12 people and mine was just steamed seafood, and everyone else's took longer to make so mine was sitting a little longer than I wanted. \nStill good though, yeah, still good.\n\nCheck out here and sit at the bar and get buddy buddy with the bartender/oyster monger and you'll have a great $50 meal!"
4,"Super cute and quaint. Pastries are worth the stop, and the staff is delightful. Impressive amount of seating available too, despite the cozy size of this corner shop. However, be warned: they give out free samples of their pastries. If you were planning on just grabbing a coffee, you may find yourself leaving with more than you planned."
4,"They quoted me 15 minutes, and just 10 minutes later called my name to say it was done. Quickest oil change I've ever had.\n\nPaid $38 and some change with the $5 off Ladies' Wednesday discount."
4,What a truly amazing view and ride through that mountainside! I will recommend this place to anyone that ends up in the area. It is something to see for sure
4,"The restaurant space has been revamped, and feels much larger than Nix.  The bar was pushed back, further from the door, leaving ample room for mingling and table seating, and the vibe is hipper too, with tufted leather chairs and low red lighting.\n\nMy favs:  Cowbell Chili & Smoked Cornbread, black bean burger, sweet potato croquettes, which are basically sweet potato donuts balls (or little balls of heaven, as Cowbell calls them), and Dali's fries with garlic aioli, buffalo, Parmesan, and fresh herbs.  \n\nI posted a full review on the blog, but these are the highlights."
4,"Absolutely killer flavors. Very impressed with this place. The taco selection is magnificent and the prices are affordable, and it's open late! If you love authentic Mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting, yet delicious meats to choose from, you need to try this place.\nThe only reason I'm giving Tacos El Gordo four stars is because the line system can get pretty messy. It's not a big deal, just ask a worker or someone around you if you're confused about which line to wait in. All I'm saying is that a couple small signs above the ordering counters would make the line setup a whole lot better, and would earn this place a solid five stars."
4,"Been going to this place for years....... Hadn't been there in a long time and happened to be on Decatur today and we stopped by........ We should have just gotten one hoagie...... We split one and that was more than enough for both of us, ended up saving the other one for later..... Not a fan of fried Okra but we had some anyway, it was so so, I prefer the zucchini .. Don't understand the complaints about the prices, i think for what you get its fine.....We didn't bother eating outside since it's too damn hot this time of year, so we just brought everything home and it was pretty darn good.... We'll be back for more next time we're on that side of town........"
4,Flavors and portions were spot on but customer service is lacking. While the service leaves much to be desired it wouldn't prevent me from frequenting the restaurant.
4,"I have previously reviewed Eggspectation and found its kitchen creations excellent. They appear to have improved their service significantly since I last shared my opinions. As promised, therefore, four stars well-deserved. \n\nThe menu has been revamped and the quirkiness and puns are mostly gone, but the eggs surely aren't. I think I will miss the great variety of dishes one could select from, however they seem to focus on a core set of competences these days and churn out a very pleasant palette of flavors.\n\nWith the sad departure of a couple of my brunch haunts, my trekking over a kilometre to Eggspectation shows it's good, filling and pleasant."
4,"I went with two girlfriends. The squash blossoms were wonderful, the ambience was great. Everything was done to perfection. I especially appreciate my pork chop, it was thick and grilled to a medium rare that flawless. Juicy and flavorful.\n\nThe quail was the show stopper. I would highly reccomend it. I am sure the menu has changed now since it is seasonal, I will get back to you guys when I go back.\n\nThw wine list features wines made in AZ, I did not partake this time around. I will certainly try a bottle the next trip. \n\nIt was a very sensual experience for my tastebuds!  Yum!"
4,"Compared to the malls in Springfield and Decatur, this one is the better of the three. There are no empty stores and it does get busy at the mall. \nThey have a great steak and potato company which closed in Springfield years ago. \nI like all the speciality stores that are here. They have a kitchen store, tons of kids stores, a gamestop, department stores, pet store, etc."
4,"I was I  Vegas for a nursing conference September 18, 2013.  We were on the strip, so my friends decided they wanted to eat at the Bellagio.  After walking around the hotel we settle on eating at The Noddle.  I must admit the food was a lot better than I expected.  I ordered the shrimp pad thai.  The dish was very ,very good; much better than I expected for a strip Asian restaurant.  My friends ordered a couple of different soup/noodle dishes.  They were also goo, but the beef was slightly over-cooked.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.  This was a great place to eat after all the exploring and people watching on the strip!"
4,I went to Praying Monk on Saturday night with my wife. I love the look of this place and it has a great atmosphere. The staff was very friendly and nice.  They did a great job making you feel welcome. \n\nI am a Belgium beer fan so I was very happy too see their great selection on tap.  I had a St Bernardus ABT12 and my wife had the Triple Karmilet (our two favorites).\n\nNow on to the food.\nWe had the Brussels sprouts and the soft pretzel to start. The brussels were light and fresh (not heavy and oily like most places) and the pretzel was very tasty. It was served with some sort of mustard butter that was awesome.\n\nFor dinner I ordered the Burger. The burger was great. It was flavorful and juicy. The Sriracha Aioli had the right amount of heat to kick this burger up a notch and the arugula... arugula always has a place on my burgers!\n\nMy wife ordered the Kale salad. The Kale was extremely fresh and crunchy. I would want it chopped into smaller pieces but my wife loved it.  The dressing was great and they didn't over dress it. \n\nNext time I go I will have to try the Lump crab.
4,"One of my favorite \""cheap eats\"" places. T-bone steak & eggs dinner is the hidden gem on the menu! See photo"
4,"Ohh my ohh my, this place is highly recommended... \n\n.. Despite having the most miserable waiter EVER!! \nI believe that there are 2 of those restaurants at 2 hotels next to each other so my friends and I had a funnydrunken mix up with meeting up for a 6am dinner... (Hmmm Oh so typical Vegas huhh) \n\nAnyways, I've ended up being at both locations the last time I was here. Both experiences were great. \nThe service was good (minus the miserable waiter of course), the food was good and had a great variety. \n\nIt is a shame that you can order from certain menus at certain times, but we managed to find something... \n\nBoth location were nice and clean and we were seated quickly.. MOST important in Vegas in my opinion... Especially when it's whilst partying, right...\n\nDon't think I have much else to say about this place... It's very \""Cheesecake Factory\"" kind of place.. Which is a good thing... ?????? I guess...."
4,Wow lines can get extremely long for tis place ! I went two times on my trip because it was just to good to pass up. Both times I gopt the chicken sandwiches the one with the hot peppers was amazing ! The other with the cheese and bacon and lettuce I did not care for the sauce. The coffee is also amazing !! I got a greek salad one time all the ingredients were just so fresh for a fast food places and very decent quality. This place is also open 24 hours in Planet Hollywod ! Food comes out really fast and the lines go pretty fast too !
4,"Probably one of the \""hidden gems\"" in Charlotte, I discovered Wing Haven during a Bike!Charlotte Bingo Bike Ride on a nice Saturday afternoon.  The bike loop started at SouthEnd and cut through downtown/Noda/Plaza Midwood/the greenway and led us to Wing Haven.  \n\nI have lived in Charlotte for 17 years now and this was the first time I had ever heard of Wing Haven.  It's really tucked inside the middle of a neighborhood street - almost inbetween the Dilworth and Sewlyn areas.  I'm sure the houses that surround Wing Haven are used to the business being there but the \""NO WING HAVEN\"" parking signs our in front of people's yards give me a good sense that this place can draw a crowd when it wants to.\n\nIf you are a bird lover, outdoor lover, or unique place lover... this is definitely a good spot.  I think you can rent out the space for small events and there are plenty of activities for small children to do and see."
4,"Go for the Salt n Pepper Shrimp, fried chicken wings, cocktail shrimp, snow crab legs, raw oysters, greens, and fish... they also have clams, mussels, crawfish... the kids love this place.  We always print out the 10% off coupon online.  For all the seafood thats offered, it's better than your average chinese/asian buffets around town..."
4,"This review is strictly for the lounge/bar area.  I loved the ambiance and decor here, with the balcony overlooking the casino and the changing color lights.  Super soft leather seating and of course pricy ass drinks.  But boogey enough that I was impressed since this was indeed Vegas!"
4,"Oh lululemon... Je ne peux m'emp\u00eacher que te consid\u00e9rer comme \u00e9tant \""The One!\"" Charmant, bien muscl\u00e9 (avec tout le yoga et la course que tu fais, \u00e7a para\u00eet que tu travailles fort), super poli, attentionn\u00e9, bon sens de l'humour, grand coeur... et toujours pris par les autres plus belles filles! J'adore les v\u00eatements du lululemon parce qu'ils sont fait pour garder longtemps, longtemps, longtemps, mais vu le prix et vu que mes couleurs favorites ne sont pas toujours disponibles, c'est un luxe que je ne me permets qu'une fois par ann\u00e9e. C'est pour \u00e7a qu'il manque une \u00e9toile, mais avouons-le, m\u00eame \""The One\"" n'est pas parfait! Je ne peux quand m\u00eame pas m'emp\u00eacher d'aller visiter mon cher lulu r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement dans l'espoir qu'un jour on aura une relation plus durable et qu'on vivra ensemble heureux jusqu'\u00e0 la fin des temps."
4,"You can read others for food reviews.  Just know I am going back again again because of the service.  Server Yolanda even sent an email to thank us for being such great guests!  That was after I broke a glass with my IPhone!  Bartender William is fun.  Okay i will say something about the food.  The dishes our group loved were Tomato Soup, Roast Chicken and Steak dish.  The portions are small but I thought quality was outstanding.  I believe all food challenges will be worked out because the attention to service means someone cares what customers think. For me I prefer only wild caught salmon (or knowing it is sustainably sourced). I eat salmon several times a week and cannot afford the bad stuff.  I liked the raw tuna dishes (i ordered both on menu) yet felt they were heavy on fat content (which I prefer to save for dessert).  We order 4 desserts (there were 5 of us) - liked them all including ice cream minus potato chips next time. \nAnother outstanding element of this restaurant is the use of tableware. Very eclectic old china settings. Made the table fun.  \nAngelo got enough right out of the gate that the rest will come. Thank you"
4,Got a groupon for the ultimate wash for $5. I liked that they scrubbed the car before it went in & thoroughly dried it after. I will go back again...
4,"This Saks location has to be my personal favorite for their service style. Everyone is friendly, they great you, they often offer you a water bottle, however they let you wander if you tell them your just looking, and check on you sporadically but never smother. \nAlso they have the best makeup counter service of any store in the valley, period. My favorite is the YSL and Dior shared counter. Those ladies and gentleman are the best at telling you about their lines as well as other alternatives. For example on my last visit they showed me their concealer and ran to the Nars counter to show me one with more coverage. Which is what I was looking for. \nThe only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because shoe sales rack has really dwindled in size over the last year or two. Other than that, this place is fantastic."
4,"Do you enjoy gyros? I do. I have enjoyed them since I was a boy in the Chicago suburbs. After eating my first gyro from Mad Pita Express, I told my fiance that it was the best that I had ever tasted! The meat is tender, and delicious. The cucumber sauce, tomatos, and herbs are fresh and good. The Pita is puffy and soft. \n\nMy second time to Mad Pita Express I brought my fiance and she ordered a very good lemon rice soup. Very lemony and tasty!  She also enjoyed a piece of fresh baklava which she said was special.\n\n5.00 for the Gyro is a very good price. The soup is 2.99 for a good sized portion. \n\nIt takes a few minutes wait for the food to be prepared. However, the quaint, cozy restaurant has interesting decor that my fiance and I enjoyed looking at for several minutes--family pictures, many different plants, and eclectic artwork.\n\nThis is a small, casual, counter-service restaurant. You can dine in or carry-out. We chose to dine in, and our food was brought to us, along with plastic-ware and napkins."
4,"I have a lot of health issues and a very limited diet.  Trying to stay alkaline, and keeping raw, I have found many delectable options.  My first visit, I tried the raw chile rellano, then the raw coconut curry spring rolls which were PHENOMENAL!  I also got to try a raw vanilla cupcake with coconut strawberry frosting. This is currently my favorite raw food venue."
4,"I love the Destihl in Bloomington-Normal so I had to give this one a try.  A co-worker and I came here for dinner on a Thursday night.  The place was not overly busy but had plenty of business.  I really liked the decor of the place and the booth setup was neat.  Our waitress was very helpful and friendly.\n\nI was happy to see that they have the same menu as the one in Bloomington-Normal with only their beer selection being different.  We started with the Beer Battered Asparagus which was delicious!  I was tempted to get my usual, the White Cheddar Stuffed Poblano Peppers but decided to change it up a bit.  I went with the Potato Crusted Rainbow Trout.  It had wonderful flavor!  My co-worker got my usual and she loved them too.  We decided to go for dessert as well.  I ordered the Creme Brulee.  I was not very impressed by this.  It was a bit on the runny side and I am used to creme brulee being smooth and creamy.\n\nOverall, great food and service!  Love this place!"
4,"Good food, good late night, full of Philly Phans!!  What a great place to find  tucked away in the city.  Naturally, I ordered the Philly sub to give it the ol' test.  It passed!  The key is the roll and their roll was nice and fresh.  If you are full of food/beer and want something else to do.. Stroll over to the shuffle board table and give it a spin while you watch the games.  They even have friendly poker games once a week that you can simply just show up and play.  The whole staff is friendly and dont mind striking up a conversation with you.  The only negative side is that the place just isnt that clean.  But if you dont expect the Ritz ahead of time and know just where you are going.  Then you should be fine.  Enjoy!\n\n-Ian M."
4,Vey clean place a bit pricy but if you don't mind go there great experience I felt like a princess I got a gel manicure white tips with glitter cost 42 dollars. Good job on my real nails but on my broken nails I asked  for a fake nail over it the lady didn't do so good on those they looked really fat and fake but they blend in well with my other nails. Overall good job!!
4,"Pretty good but i'm sure i'll frequent this fine establishment more often as it gets colder.\n\nGood bang to buck ratio. I didnt go for any premium cuts of meat and grabbed the 3 meat combo. Cant exactly remember the three cuts of meat other than one being eye of round but i had about 4 plates of it so mission accomplished. \n\nI would highly recommend grabbing the Sukiyaki style. The sweet soy has much more flavor and everything that comes out of it, especially the udon noodles, much MUCH better. Dont forget to add a healthy scoop of minced garlic as it'll give it a lot more depth. \n\nNoodle and Veggie plates are premade which can be a bit annoying as each plate had too little or too much of one thing or another. Meat plates are done right and slices to order. Depending on where you sit you can watch your meat being sliced and assembled which is nice. No browning of meat that's been stacked on top of another and left in the fridge. \n\nFour instead of five stars mainly due to my mistake of ordering the shabu shabu instead of the Sukiyaki. Pretty much ended up grabbing Anthony M's left other broth and threw it into my own which turned out A LOT better then expected but one of hte staff came by and topped me off with shabu shabu water/broth and it got watered down. Not his mistake but i didnt get to try how everything tasted in Sukiyaki."
4,"So while checking Yelp for some reasonable Vegas fare, I came across a venue with like 3000+ reviews, 1 dollar sign, and 4+ stars.  Check around, nothing else like it exists on The Strip.  Naturally, I had to go (mainly because I needed a break from $75 food bills for lunch).  \n\nEoS is good, really good.  There's a huge variety of sandwiches that are all delicious and easy on the wallet.  It's really close to about half the strip, and even if you need to take a $15 cab, you're going to save money in the long run.  There's a breakfast menu which is open until 11am (I never made it), but the rest of their hot sandwich menu suits me just fine. \n\nI had the Chicken Chipotle Avocado thing, and later I had the Original 1786 or whatever.  The Original needed more sauce on the (the horseradish was great, but it needed more).  I got the Chicken Chipotle with extra sauce and it was awesome.  For like $7 a sandwich, you can't go wrong.\n\nNote:  The sandwich isn't huge.  I only needed one, but I don't eat a lot.  Most dudes I hang with would need two to fill them up.  \n\nNote2: If you go for dinner, head into the PH and check out the Pleasure Pit.  You'll see....."
4,"Had a catered dinner here with 40 colleagues. Food was very good, service very good. Great location - even enjoyed a live string quartet playing in the \""courtyard\"" outside the restaurant's entry.\n\nDefinitely would go again."
4,"Nostalgia. I'm an 80's kid so I came for the Thrifty's ice cream. I've actually been here a few times but tonight's visit was different in a good way. I got circus animal flavor ice cream with snickerdoodle and sugar cookies to make my sandwich. Because who's counting calories tonight...not me. F a diet. At least for tonight. \n\nIn the past the cookies were a bit on the hard side, not the best texture for a ice cream sandwich. Tonight's cookies were soft which made for a perfect sandwich. Their \""scoop\"" of ice cream is Huge. I'm guessing people may complain of price (this ain't the 80's anymore and we must get over the 25 cent a scoop deal) but when you're getting a product/treat like this you forget about $'s sometimes. \n\nStaff is friendly. Place is kept clean. Good amount of space. Bonus that they have the table style arcade game set up and cool unique sodas in their drink fridge. All I need is some MJ, Madonna, Boy George, Cindy Lauper on blast on the radio, some Ronald Reagan on the tube, some girls with biker shorts big aquanet hair and fanny packs and maybe i can give this place 5 stars."
4,"Who can say no to their $2 Signature dogs on Tuesdays? Well of course those who don't eat pork for dietary or religious reasons, but they should reconsider.\nThese hot dogs are delicious. I'm slowly working my way through the plethora of amazing options and then they go and make a weekly rotation of local brewery inspired hot dogs.\nThey seem to constantly be thinking up new ways to dress up the traditional frank. Grilled to perfection and with a myriad of options.\nThey also have great house chips and onion rings.\nI usually do take out but it is a great location to sit and grab a beer with your hot dogs and during these Spring evenings, they have the roof top patio."
4,"I loved the crispy crust of the pizza thought it was super good.  I think if you haven't been there and are at the San Tan Mall shopping that its worth a visit.  We went on a double date and it was a pretty good experience.  The only issue I had was that I thought they had a very small dining area, which was probably the reason for the 45min wait.  Also we went on a friday night and probably because of the small area it got very loud, which I know the management has no control over, but just an fyi of my experience.  I'd say if you haven't been and you love pizza its worth the visit.   I may try and stop in for lunch sometime but definitely not on a Friday night, it was just too busy."
4,"As many others have noted, it's not as if this place invented \""the sandwich\"" but read my star rating: I'm a fan. The food is good, I haven't had a sandwich that I disliked. But it's the service that I was impressed by. Art, the owner, seems to really take interest in each customer that crosses his path. It's a breath of fresh air and something you might not see at the chain next door. \n\nI enjoyed my Roasted Turkey sandwich. I'm picky about cold cuts (I've basically signed an exclusive with Boars Head) and these made the grade. The bread tastes freshly baked too. The mozzarella sandwich is tasty too. Thumbs up on the turkey chili as well, can't beat it on a chilly day. If you get a drink be prepared, they're basically in vat size cups. They offer your typical 1/2 sandwich & soup lunch specials as well.\n\nTo touch again on the great service, on my last visit Art literally sat down with me and chatted it up. It was the end of the lunch hour and the place was pretty much empty. He asked about my job, how I like downtown etc etc. So friendly! Hell, I might even just come back for the conversation! You should stop in and say hi. One of the few lunch places downtown where you don't have to have a fanny pack to fit in, this cafe is worth a try."
4,"Easy to access, not a lot of confusing parking (you have your option between the garage or the street parking lot, both of which are literally right next to the Arena), and  is decently sized. Mainly hockey games and local graduations are held here. \n\nThe Box Office is a little farther away from the Arena than you might expect, but there is easy access to restrooms, and the price for food and drinks is at best what they should be for an Arena (not too expensive, but not too cheap, just the way you like it!) The seating is comfortable, and when events are hosted on the bottom floor, they cover up the otherwise ice rink they use for the hockey games with black flooring that you could still feel the coldness of the ice coming from (but it's actually a nice feeling!)"
4,"Spent a few nights at the Palazzo, then came down to the Cosmo with a group of friends.  Completely different vibe than most other Vegas places.  The Cosmo is definitely a higher class (read pricier) place, but has a more edgy and trendy side to it.  No cheesy statue of Caesar or reproductions of ancient Eurozone here. Rooms are fresh and inviting, and the casino area even has a better feel to it.  This place is in the CItycenter area, so be prepared for a hike if you are wanting to see TI, Wynn, or other casinos on the north end of the strip."
4,"Their pancakes are by far the best I've ever had! Just the thought of beginning to describe them makes my mouth water. They are so warm, fluffy, buttery and moist on the inside with a thin crispy layer on the outside. Especially when taking from the edges. Yummmmm.... The combination of that with their warm maple syrup makes them amazingly delicious. Even though I'm full I still want more! Not only were their pancakes phenomenal but their eggs were also up there on my list. We had the Apple-smoked Bacon, avocado and jack cheese omelet but deconstructed it. We took out the cheese, added pure egg whites (not egg substitute) and had them scramble it well-done (I hate runny eggs). Seriously one of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time. Everything including my OJ was great. The only reason I did not give them 5-stars is because they didn't have any high chairs, the service wasn't the best and the place needs a facelift."
4,Shared a small white pie and cheese steak w/onions & cheese whiz w/my bf for dinner last night. Both were deeeelish! I would highly recommend to try.
4,I love this place because of the great food and I enjoy how they have a separate dining area from the bar. The different styles of burgers are great! We enjoyed watching a hockey game on the big screen in the dining room. Go on a Monday when the burgers are $5. I personally wouldn't pay $8-11 for a burger.
4,"Located in inside what appears to be the craziest indoor state fair like atmosphere of Circus Circus. That being said, once inside this meat oasis did the job. 3 of us stuffed ourselves silly with meat, sides and a few drinks for $200. Not so bad!  I competed in half ironman triathlon earlier that day and ate the whole ribeye and sides!"
4,We had an amazing meal here...granted it was 3 years ago. Had a spicy shrimp dish and it was so delicious. Service was wonderful as was atmosphere. Both my husband and I still talk about the amazing Mexican meal we had here. Give it a try....
4,"Typical SW. The staff is friendly. Sometimes, flights to/from here get really booked, especially when it's during snow season and everyone's trying to go eastward. I never had any issues with my flight, thank goodness. Their gates are super crowded though. So if you want to sit down and wait for you flight, get here early."
4,"I love this place- esp. the breakfast. I started out with a Fat Boy bloody mary. It has bacon. And string cheese. Yum. I ordered the crab Benedict and it was delicious. My dining partners ordered the Denver scramble and prime rib hash. Both said their meals were great. We ended the meal with cookie dough egg rolls. They are evil, but soooo goood. My usual favorite dessert is their 6 layer carrot cake. One thing to remember is that the wait on Sunday morning is long. Do not walk in and expect to be seated in less than a half hour. They have a lounge area where you can get drinks while you wait which makes the time go a little faster."
4,"I just indulged myself with Dinner for the first time at Verrado Grille last night, and I must say that it was a great experience under the circumstances. \n\nThey close at 9 pm and we got there at about 8:30, so I was expecting poor service because of our timing. Our waitress was nice, and the service was still good for being almost closing time. \n\nI had a pint of Verrado Ale (which is 8th street from Four Peaks) and ordered the Almond Encrusted Basa, which was a beautifully cooked white fish with this delicious Orzo/Risotto side. \n\nThe price is right about ball park for the level of quality you get, I would even pay up a little more for it. \n\nOverall it was a great experience and I would recommend that you aim for a sunset dinner, as the view over the golf coarse and the white tank mountains is amazing during that time."
4,Open 24/7. I just have to say every time we come here the girls that work inside are very nice and if they get a chance they will talk with you. Since they see us at least once a week we talk more. It always is clean inside and they are usually stalked up on drinks and snacks etc. \nOf course we will be back.
4,"Yay for good Blockbusters.  There is one way closer to the house, but their selection sucks, the people are rude, and it's just plain ghetto.  This location is very large and has a great selection.  I think their selection is better than most.  The employees we have interacted with have always been very friendly and have a good sense of humor.  We actually have the Blockbuster online thing (think Netflix) and it works fantastically.  Whenever we come here to use one of our in-store exchanges, we are always in and out of there very quickly.  The other location seemed to have difficulties with that.  Anyway, this is my favorite Blockbuster in the valley.  The two reasons I subtracted one star is the awful parking lot, and I wish it were a bit closer to my house."
4,"We were promptly seated at our reservation time, bread was brought (really, one dinky little roll?!! with no options for more?) and the waiter went through a couple of things.  The spinach salad was great, as were the bbq shrimp, but 4 average size shrimp for $20?  Probably the worst value on the strip, yeah they were awesome with a great bbq sauce but way overpriced for just 4.  \nThe seabass was very good as was the lamb shank.  Coming with sides included made it a fair value. The blueberry cobbler for desert was great!  \nWill probably come back, maybe for lunch this time."
4,"Why did I come here: It was close by which is a plus for a student who lives in Campustown and wants to support something local.\n\nThey are open at good hours and I have never had a problem with getting an appointment. \n\nFor a GUYS haircut, it is the perfect price for what I get. I have gone to more expensive places in the NW for a similar quality haircut. It is quick too and I never wait long.\n\nThe stylists are nice and friendly. I love the joke one plays on me when they \""That will be a million dollars, please.\"" If you like deals and are willing to pay cash, you can get your 10th haircut free."
4,"Contrary to what Chheng L. thought, Cali people aren't the only ones who appreciate Yoshinoya. New York peeps also love it! My friends and I used to eat at the Yoshinoyas a lot when I was working in NYC, and the places were almost always packed. And no wonder - the food is good and cheap, and the service is fast. The main drawback (for me) for this lone franchise in AZ its distance from Phoenix; but even that isn't so bad, as it is one minute from the Dysart Rd. exit of  I-10. Still, I wish they'd open some franchises in Phoenix itself. And Chheng L was right -- pouring the clam chowder into the beef bowl sounds crazy but I found it to be yummy when I tried it.  However, if you've never tried the beef bowl before, try it by itself first. Enjoy!"
4,"KICKASSSSS MARGARITAS!!\n\nThis is THE place to go for margaritas in the area (near downtown)!  Come grab a pitcher or 4 of the Kickass Margaritas with some friends and enjoy some delicious appetizers as well!  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=2z1vI-CXPyMHEMntTszyWg&userid=F28n26ynklEioZDInyK__A) \n\nI came here with a few clients to unwind a bit after a long day of work and it was so relaxing that didn't want to leave!  We sat in the outside seating area -- cute, but full of random decor -- I thought I walked into Guadalajara, lol  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-dos-molinos-phoenix?select=mOqppqoOhfgIncilkMVGJg#_5myU5HjdcHdwvbDArXbZg) \n\nWe ordered a couple appetizers/entree to share along with our margaritas:\n\n(They serve complimentary chips and salsa-- I loveee the homemade salsa, especially because it is spicy! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-dos-molinos-phoenix?select=mOqppqoOhfgIncilkMVGJg#hJpJSd1U3xGYs927JX1wJg))\n\n- Adovada Ribs: Country style pork ribs marinade in red chili, served with rice and flour tortilla.  This is SPICYYY!  If you can't handle spicy, you probably won't eat more than a couple bites of this.  I have a pretty high tolerance for spicy food and I even thought this was pretty hot.  The pork was fork tender and the homemade flour tortilla was delicious.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-dos-molinos-phoenix?select=mOqppqoOhfgIncilkMVGJg#AvtkP_Po96waiz-8dDgtUQ)\n\n- Chorizo Pizza: This too, was VERY SPICY!  Delicious, but I was for sure sweating after a few bites!  I love how the pizza is thin, and the crust is nice and crispy!  I'd say this is more like a giant tostada with a generous amount of spicy chorizo.  I would order this again!  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/los-dos-molinos-phoenix?select=mOqppqoOhfgIncilkMVGJg#vLFuk2p51aFrxWaVH8gLpg)\n\nCheeeeerss!

4,Rachel's Kitchen has a small selection wraps and burgers which are all pretty good. Where they really excel is with the smoothies. Highly recommend.
4,So stoked to find such a great gyro place in Chandler. can tell the guy's from Chicago too... I haven't tried the italian beef but I will. I'm just sticking to the gyro's and plates for now.\n\nI've now been there at least 20 times... and still loving it. \n\nI am sorry to see such a horrible web site.. sad. but... that's not at all what to expect with their food.
4,"Never would i have thought of doing this ...but my wife convinced me that it would be a decadent treat ...and a great bargain....and that it was. we enjoyed the 24 hour pass..starting with a late dinner at the paris..it was good, a huge line up till they closed it...and the next day we had lunch at planet hollywood..it was so good we had to go back for dinner...clean,  well managed, and freshly prepared.  i strongly recommend the buffet at PH. Its all about not pigging out....and not eating a taste of everything ..lol...hey its hard to get a salmon caesar  salad in vegas for less than 30 bucks..so $50. for 24 hours of  pretty much whatever  food you want is great...not something i would want to do often..but once in a blue moon why not?   enjoy"
4,I have been seeing Dr. Johnnie Woodson for years.  He is always very nice and willing to talk to me about my condition at length.  The office has gotten so much better since new management has taken over.\n\nSometimes the wait is a bit longer than I would like but the Doctor is wortht the wait!
4,"I've had a few shoes fixed here.  One had a peeled off sole that was glued back on.  The other two had to get new soles affixed.  Boris, the son is a really nice guy.  Fast turnover for repairs!!!  A little pricier than my spot back home but fair and they do good quality work!!!  Thanks yelpers for the recommendation! :)"
4,"Great big Tostones, very nice hot sauce and mojo! Everyone at my table (two who had never had Cuban food) all cleaned their plates :)"
4,"This is a great place to go on a cold winter day. The food is both spicy and warm. First I usually get a bowl of what seems to be miso soup, which is complimentary with your meal. They use really good meat for their spicy barbeque and it's delivered smoking hot to your table with bowls of kimchi and other Korean specialties. Some dishes might seem a little pricey, but most can easily feed two people"
4,Great breakfast place inside Mandalay bay. The cafe over looks the walk way to the pool.\n\nThe corned beef hash is excellent and so are the waffles. \n\nIts too bad they don't have refills on juice. Great place none the less.
4,"Had dinner here with my wife and 3 kids. We were all very pleased with the food and the service. There isn't much available for younger kids, but mine were able to share a drumstick appetizer which was really well done and included 6 drumsticks, so it was more than enough for a young child or 2.  A large, juicy burger was very good and a steak that was just ok round out the standard fare. The nachos appetizer was not great, but it was just an appetizer.  The real star was the pizza. The dough is buttery and flakey yet chewy which made for one of the best pizza crusts that I have ever had. The sauce and cheese were well balanced to make this a wonderful personal pizza. I would definitely order it again if I was dining here. But I would also dine outside as the interior needs some updating."
4,"The location is perfect, next doors to our dentist... and I think their chicken is awesome... the Spicy Honey Mustard and Asiago Parmesan... also MUST TRY.... their homemade Asiago Chips... nice!!!"
4,"Very good pho. I've had better, but I was very pleased with theirs. I ordered spicy but I had to add sriracha. Perfectly hit the spot after traipsing in the snow."
4,"This review is more for the food court than the stores. First a brief review of the stores mainly they have a great selection of stores Nike, Adidas, Oakley, Guess, D&G and many more expect at least more than a couple of hours to go through the whole thing keep in mind this is all outdoors so dress accordingly especially during the summertime. Now on to the food court well not much of a selection you have Japanese and Chinese, Subway and Italian I actually had pizza for lunch it was ok good enough for my taste buds i also got to sample the teri chicken from the Japanese place and orange chicken from the Chinese place both were good but they could have better food."
4,"Had dinner here with my wife, mother, and 9mo old this weekend.  We were the only customers and did not have the problems with service that others have reported.  The food was more \""traditional\"" than we're used to - still delicious.  We had the assorted appetizer platter and 3 meals off the yellow \""specials\"" menu - with one mango lassi, the bill came to $43 with tax.\n\nNote that they don't serve any alcohol, but said we could buy anything we wanted from the grocery next door and drink it with dinner.  So we grabbed a couple of beers.  \n\nWe were cracking up at the background music + TV - when we arrived they were showing the Indian \""Who Wants to be a Millionaire\"", and switched to music videos by the time we left.  Quite entertaining."
4,"Surprised, but it actually was good ... yes, Pizza Hut and good. At least at 10:30AM, this is the place to be!"
4,"Since I wrote about Tacone in Tustin, CA. It would not be fair not to write about Tacone in Vegas,especially the reason I visited the one in Tustin was because of the delicious wraps I had in Vegas. I had a coupon printed out from some Vegas tourism website, so my whole family went to Tacone for lunch. We did not have any high expectations since it is a fast food eatery, and it is inside Aladdin, we just wanted a quick bite before taking my kids to BuildaBear. Boy, were we pleasantly surprised!  There was a free sauce bar, from the popular honey mustard, bbq, to exotic creamy cilantro sauce and balsamic flavored dip, the kids were just having an awesome time trying all of them! The wraps were huge, I could not finish and had mine doggy bagged. I had the Thai cone, the peanut sauce with the cucumber salad tucked inside the wrap with soft steaming jasmine rice was superb! Hubby's Mambo wrap's filet mignon was juicy and tender. Kids loved their Campfire chicken wraps with sweet bbq sauce. The price is a bit expensive, hence the four stars. I think it was about $8.95/wrap. But it is something different and refreshing."
4,"The rooms are nice, a little dull but nice. The big bathroom even in entry level rooms are a massive plus and if you like to soak in a deep tub you will be very happy. The rest of the Casino is nice enough but I think next time I will head back to my usual hangout which is the Mirage."
4,"Exactly we had anticipated,  this will be a great place to have in your foodie book. Good job Vig McCormick Ranch"
4,"So happy that they decided to open up a Komex on my side of town!! Always a good place to go to for a quick bite. I also come here when I wanna introduce this place to people from out of town or if they've never been here before. I come here strictly for the fusion tacos. The spicy pork tacos are my favorite. Delicious!!! I have tried some of the other items on the menu on the other hand. They're alright.. nothing too \""fusiony\"" or special I would say"
4,"This place is interesting. It's strictly a take out spot and they open from 5-10pm. Definitely not your average Thai food joint. \n\nOverall the food is great and my personal favorite is the Mango Sticky Rice. They actually give you a bigger portion of sticky rice here than anywhere else I've been. \n\ncleanliness is key here. Seeing as to how they don't actually have tables here so you can eat, I'd be surprised if it was dirty. \n\nThe lady is pretty friendly and straight to the point. It looked like if it was just her and another employee so probably family. \n\nOverall its small, quaint, cheap and fantastic! definitely recommend this for them nights that you want to stay home and watch a movie!"
4,"We stayed here after getting an awesome deal on Priceline for $90 per night. I admit that if I'd paid full price I'd have been a little annoyed at the size of the room. It felt pretty small, but it was comfortable and had a great view of Heinz Field. It's also a fantastic location. We were able to walk almost everywhere, which I always enjoy when spending time in a new city. \n\nThe hotel itself is beautiful, especially in the lobby. It's a historic hotel and really managed to keep the aesthetics of the original interior but update them in appropriate ways. \n\nI would recommend avoiding the restaurant if you can. As with all hotel restaurants it was overpriced, and the breakfast we ate there was unmemorable to say the least."
4,"A healthy choice for lunch or dinner in the plaza! The dumplings are homemade and are very soft. I had the carrot + beef dumplings and they were quite delicious. The congee is fairly cheap at 2$ a bowl so whenever I have spare change, I stop by and grab one. Give the place a try!"
4,It's cirque so u know it's going to be good. The real only flaw is the somewhat vague storyline but who cares about storylines when u r watching incredibly creative set and costume and choreography. \nAfter a few beers I realized that the KA storyline is basically star wars.  If you keep that in mind it all makes sense- Luke and princess leah versus Darth vader and the emporor. Easy as that
4,"Created by the founder of Cheesecake Factory, Grand Lux Cafe is like a more upscale European version of it's former self. Open 24 hours, it's a great place to sober up after the wild night.\n\nIt's 4am and we're all hungry. Us being Lucy Y., David G., Sarah A., and myself. Having been here before, I recommended coming here for some early morning grub. We encountered some half naked drunk dudes standing around the restroom outside the restaurant. Good stuff!\n\nWe were promptly seated and I was craving breakfast. Ordered the Smoked Salmon with onions and scrambled eggs, it came with hash browns on the side. Simple and delicate at the same time. Contrast of smoked salmon and eggs together created a good plate overall. Filling enough for bedtime.  \n\nPricier than most 24 joints in the hotels, but the food and service is better also. Keep in mind only the late night menu is available after a certain time."
4,"Swanky.\n\nI think that is a good summary of Wynn Casino. I didn't stay here, but had a great time at their casino. If you signed up for their Red Card, you will get $10 FREE PLAY credit. We played our credit and had a couple of delicious Chocolate Martinis. \n\nWe were tipsy at 1 pm and I won about $12 from the Mona Lisa slot machine. Thank you, Wynn. I kinda heart you from that point on. Hopefully next time, I can come by and visit again. It was fun."
4,"This is a really good venue to hold meetings in Edinburgh. We hired the 'Glass Room' at the top of the building which had its own private balcony with stunning views across the city. \n\nThe Hub provided us with lunch - just sandwiches- but they finished it off with some really good, gooey chocolate cake which made me love the whole venue even more!! They also left some Edinburgh rock on the tables for us to munch through...so whenever my meeting became boring/overly bureaucratic I could have a sugar high to bring back my normal hyper-ness!"
4,"Belle ambiance de 'chalet' dans ce petit resto de la rue MCGill.\n\nBien situ\u00e9 a la limite du quartier des affaires et du Vieux-Port, Grange devient un endroit facile a adopter si vous voulez passer une soir\u00e9e sur les quais apr\u00e8s le travail. Le menu est simple et concis, (tartares, salades copieuses, burgers) mais contient des choix vari\u00e9s pour tous les palais. Les prix sont moyens-chers (25$ une assiette). Ils ont une bonne s\u00e9lection de vins \u00e9galement.\n\nLe service est plus qu'amical, quoi qu'un peu lent. Nous avons bien aim\u00e9 notre exp\u00e9rience et serons probablement de retour !"
4,"I recently attended the October Adults Night Out. The premise of the program is great-free admission, adult beverages, etc. I enjoyed exploring the museum and it was a nice activity for a Friday Night. The only downfall(s) were 1. The line to check in was extremely long. It didn't move slow, but it wasn't fast either. I had registered online but forgot to print the tickets. I would suggest definitely printing tickets ahead of time. The second issue was the \""beer garden.\"" While I enjoyed the premise and the beers, there were only 2 beer servers and 1 wine server for many many people. The line went painfully slow and it made it hard to use the drink tickets and visit the center. Many people were actually giving away their tickets because the line was too long. I would attend another ANO again but I hope that they make some changes in the future to the above mentioned things."
4,I love this place.  My friends and I try to have a 'girl's night out' once a month and we frequent Radio Maria because of the delicious cuisine and the atmosphere.  It is relaxing and has several conversation pieces.  The service is spectacular.  This is one of my favorite local spots to dine in Champaign
4,Ordered for delivery here because I was at the TownePlace Suites nearby.  Lots of food and the sushi was awesome.  Delivered in less than 30 min on a sat night.
4,"Across the street from Midwestern, it is definitely one of my favorite lunch places for our anchor lunch break between classes. They have a lunch special and offer student discounts. However, get here early because this place gets crowded and service can be rather slow for those who have to get to the next class within an hour.  Other than that, the food is very tasty from salads to paninis to pizzas. All delicious to my taste buds :) OH, and the tomato soup is a must try...the best I had so far in Phoenix... I could almost just have soup all day"
4,"Two words: Rose Macarons!\n\nOk, their other desserts are fabulous as well.  Just don't get the crepes (savory or sweet).\n\nThis place is what any business or person should aspire to be: detailed, refined, beautiful, clean, amazing..."
4,"Big sandwiches.  Big.\n\nBread is great on a good day and fair when they don't have it fresh.\n\nMom loves the Philly cheese-steak.\n\nI like the Italian.  I always ask for hot peppers.\n\nOrdering and paying can be a bit confusing.  Best thing to do is to order and immediately go to the cash register to pay.  Otherwise you have your sandwich, you're hungry and then you have to go pay.  I'm not sure how they don\""t get ripped off.  It would seem to me it would be easy to order, wait, take and leave. \n\nThe chips they offer, name escaping me now, are very good.  I know that at most sandwich places I do not get chips but here I do.  BBQ is my favorite here."
4,"While not as spacious as Palazzo/Venetian, they do have nice rooms which comparable to Cosmo and the others. It may be the same size or even bigger. \n\nThe difference between Signature and the others is there's a stove and microwave which means you can reheat some leftovers or cook some snacks. It comes in handy.\n\nThe only negative about Signature is it's off strip. I mean, really off strip. The only way to get on strip is to take a long walk through a tunnel which leads to MGM. It's not that bad but MGM is on one end of the strip and when you want to hit up Encore, it's definitely taxi time. Also, there is no casino in here.\n\nThe parking is a little wonky too. You need to be a guest to park here and there's no self-parking, it's all valet.\n\nBesides those little details, it's a nice place to stay. Quiet, but nice."
4,I love it here.  Everyone is happy and friendly. The pool was nice and relaxing. I ate at 5 different places.  Yummy at all 5. Love walking around the forum shops. It's just a happy place.  The cons of this place is the smell of smoke.  It seemed really strong. I had my kids with me. They had a blast.
4,"Flavors of India serves up a decent lunch buffet.  I've been there a couple of times though and it seems some days, the food is better than others.  Also, I wish they offered a bit more selection.  I've teetering between a 3 and 4 star but because of the reasonable price and friendly service, I'm bumping up to a 4 star.  I'll have to go again to make a final decision. \n\nSee ya there!"
4,If you are looking for true Italian food in the Chandler/Tempe area this is the place.  Family Owned and operated by a true Italian New York Family!  You walk in and are pleasantly surprised by the beautiful decor and the mom and pop rapport.  The service was good and friendly.  We started with a Caesar salad that was extremely tasty.  My husband had the linguine with red clam sauce that was delicious (huge chunks of garlic and clams visible).  I had the baked ziti that was no joke about 2 lbs of food and excellent.  My picky little daughter loved it too!  We ended with the cannoli dessert that topped off the already yummy meal!  The prices are very reasonable especially for an Italian restaurant.  With the coupons and incredible take out discounts this is a total hit!!!
4,"I've ordered cakes from them several times, and they are always delicious and feel a lot healthier than your average birthday cake - the icing is not very sweet but really creamy, and the Asian flavored cakes (like green tea, sweet potato) are perhaps not to the average American's palette but they are AMAZING, and the 'normal' fruity flavors are also really good. \n\nOnly one request: PLEASE start using the Square or another payment system like a lot of other local businesses that don't take credit cards otherwise (East End Brewery, Commonplace Coffee, etc.) - the cakes are $$$ and it is a pain to pay that much in cash these days, and there are so many new options for small businesses. I am willing to pay a small extra fee for the convenience!"
4,"A delightful waiter...excellent mango mojitos...a most interesting appetizer...a delectable pan bread, very good entrees.  What's not to like?  Although the restaurant is in the Pima Crossings strip mall, the owner has done an excellent job with the internal decor."
4,"It's admirable to see a record shop avoid the mainstream. Underground  Solu'shn prides itself on offering those hidden rarities, hard to find gems and an impressive selection of vinyl.  Ultimately this comes at a price with the average vinyl/ CD costing 12-14 pounds.  Nonetheless, unlike the larger entertainment mega-stores, you can try out your chosen record on any of the available decks: a sort of 'try before you buy' system. If your a budding DJ and your looking to boost your track collection with some rare gems, chances are Solu'shn will stock such items."
4,"I like to refer to this place as.... The Key Shack! If you drive by, that's exactly what it looks like: a little shack in the middle of Park Road Shopping Center. It make look a little sketch (there was some homemade BBQ for sale next to the Shack when I was here a few weekends ago), but they get the job done.\n\nI went here after a referral from a friend. I was looking for a hard to find key to duplicate for one of the uptown residential buildings. Sure enough, they had the key here. I had a new key and exchanged cash in about 5 minutes. If you have a hard to find key to duplicate - this is your spot!  Plus... one you're done you can stroll through the rest of Park Road Shopping Center if you so desire (cupcakes, coffee, Michael's, antiques, it's all here)."
4,"I tried out Isis Salon about a month ago.  After reading the reviews on Isis, I decided to give it a try! Kelly was great! She was nice and listened to what I wanted. I loved the way my hair turned out! I got a haircut and partial highlights for $85 (half of what I normally spend!). Awesome price! I've gone to expensive salons before and just got an okay service....now that I've found Isis, I will definitely be coming back!"
4,"I'm not drinking the kool-aid on this place just yet.  It was easy to get a reservation on a Sunday. The prices are reasonable.  The service was good.  Attentive servers.  I had the steak bernaise.  I never hand a bernaise sauce, so the lemony buttery flavor really surprised me and I enjoyed it.  The sirloin meat was a bit chewy, but it's thin and if you cut small pieces, you don't need to work it too hard.  They serve a boat load of fries.  I guess for the price, we got a good meal.  I'm just not sold that it's a 4 star times 2000 yelpers.  Dessert was meh.  The apple tartin was nothing we expected.  We've seen many that have the apple slices fanned out making a lot of texture. This one was just one big slice of apple baked with the puff pastry on top.  I will say the food was 3 stars and the good service gives it another star."
4,"We went to Butters around  11am on a Saturday and had about a half hour wait to be seated. Popular place! When we were seated, the waitress came over immediately and got us our coffee and orange juice. There was a carafe of ice water on the table. Coffee was good. OJ was fresh squeezed. I ordered an omelet with hash browns and pancakes - all very good! Our food was served quickly and the service was attentive. Very impressive considering how busy the place was! And since it was it Scottsdale, there were a lot of 40 and 50 something women patrons with big ol' fake fun bags (if you are into that sort of thing)! All in all a very good place for breakfast if you don't mind a bit of a wait!"
4,"I have seen every single performer who has fronted this show, from really good to really bad but last night with Coco was the BEST.\n\nMel B. & ??? was awesome way back in the day when the show opened (but what do you expect with people who can SING & DANCE??).\n\nHolly Madison was absolutely horrible. Might as well have taped a spot on the stage for her to stand because she had no idea what was going on. Sister looked like she was lost!\n\nAngel Porrino! What a DOLL, way better (as in more enthusiastic about the 8 minutes on stage) than Holly was and way better to look at too. I hope we continue to see her around Vegas for awhile.\n\nCoCo last night owned it! Thank god they put someone in the show again who could dance. Shake that big booty girl!!! I hope eventually they change more of the show (they changed it a little between Holly & Coco) so we have more Coco dancing."
4,"Went for a late lunch.  Guacamole was good, as was the sangria margarita that I had (yes, it's a mix of the two, forgot what the actual name was called).\n\nGot a torta, and the meat was marinated well.  A little sweet but not too sweet.  Portion size was huge.  The fish tacos were good also.\n\nService left more to be desired and I'm particularly irked that they didn't log in my Opentable reservation.  I was contacted by Opentable after my visit asking why I didn't show up for my reservation.  It all got sorted out but shouldn't have happened in the first place."
4,Food is great as is the service.  The restaurant is large so there is usually no wait.  This is a great family spot.  Give it a try.
4,We went to Edinburgh Castle early on a Sunday morning trying to beat the crowds and it definitely worked.  The castle is very well preserved and a must see attraction while in Edinburgh.
4,"We went out on a Sunday night just for dinner and to walk around the lake and village for a bit. We had 3 people and assumed it would be a little busy in the late afternoon early evening but oh my was it ever DESERTED. We parked in the Village parking garage and just saw a couple other car and walked through a passage to the lower village shopping area and it was almost scary/embarresing how empty it was. Walking through the main shopping area we thought we were in the twilight zone and would be attacked by zombies at any moment. We ate at the Black Pepper Grill which we had the ask the one guy if they were open and sat at a table in a restaurant where we were one of two total parties. Awesome food and service but just plain creepy with no people around especially at prime dinner time on a weekend. We walked over to the newly opened Ravella and it was warm and comfortable and had a great front bar that was had surprisingly cheap prices, but again just a random person walking through the hotel lobby. I really hope Lake Las Vegas comes back cause it has so much to offer...Until then I am going to film a episode of \""Life After People\"" on the property"
4,"One of my favorite malls. Lots of fun stores, restaurants and activities.\n\nI gave 4 stars merely because this mall is hard to shop at during the summer and some of the major department stores and retailers are located far from the mall itself, so you have to drive and re-park a few times to hit all of your favorite stores. Otherwise, it's great!"
4,"I love sitting at the bar, it's a wonderful experience.  The food was delicious and the execution was right on.  I wasn't crazy about every dish, but I was able to appreciate the skill that was involved with everything.  It's a pricey restaurant, but worth a visit."
4,"Has a some chairs out front so you can socialize under the hot summer sun. The employees are exceptionally friendly, particularly in the early hours of the morning when I typically grab a drink. Expect it to be moderately busy due to the location."
4,"Visited some friends staying at this off-strip hotel and had an amazing breakfast. Our server helped us decide on the menu and explained the portions.  They are extremely huge but we had to try a couple of their reviewed dishes. We had Sage Fried Chicken Benedict (it had spinach, hardwood bacon, tomato & mozzarella, chipotle cream, scrambled eggs) and Griddled French Toast (ooey gooey yummy). Wow...talk about enormous! Our server was kind enough to warn about the size and she offered to give us to-go containers so my friend can take it up to his hotel roommate.  We knew we would only eat half of each dish so its all good. I can't speak for the lunch or dinner dishes but their breakfast menu was highly recommended by the concierge and we were more than satifisfied and full! The only downside for me is the drive cause I was staying at the Strip. Next time I'll go to the one on West Sahara or Imperial Palace :)"
4,"First time I went in, I ordered a slice of pizza and then I had this feeling that they had to make a whole new pie for this.  I was bit annoyed that no one told me this.  I would think this would be a basic form of communication.  So once I inquired and realized this, I left because of time constraints.  I was going to write them off, but didn't.\n\nI ordered tonight and got an 18\"" pizza for $9.95 and...(just walked to the fridge to check)...I DID order a half dozen wings but just realized that I ate about that many and still had some left over.  Nice.  Explains why the total was 20 bucks.  \n\nWings were actually good!  To have a place make really good pizza AND good wings is a rare find.  I'm a wing connoisseur and there's only one place in BC Canada that I could not finish all 12.  The cooks actually walked out to see what fool ordered them :)  But this place actually makes them pretty hot (911).  Not scorching by any means, but I'll probably notice tomorrow sometime ;)  That's always the gold standard test for wings and if they make them hot.  Do you experience them twice?!"
4,Super cute spot with the freshest of the fresh ingredients. Tasty sandwiches and salads. Fast and friendly service. Adorable country farm feel. What's not to love?
4,"This place has really delicious BBQ. I would have given it a 5 if the chicken wasn't a little dry and the interior of the facility was a little neater and cleaner. I'm not saying it was dirty, it's just the trashy sign on the fountain drink saying not to put stuff in the drain. I also didn't like the \""real\"" trash can being turned around so there's no access to the door and a large \""kitchen\"" grey trash can sitting right beside it. All in all a good visit, but not a 5."
4,"Delicious Chicago Vienna Beef juicy hot dog with the works, and made from scratch french fries for $4. Best deal in town. Thanks for reading. The Bike Chaplain"
4,"This place makes Old Country Buffet seem like a desolate fast-food joint. For $30, it's reasonably priced for all-you-can-indulge and for $37, unlimited mimosas, bloody Marys and champagne. Bubbly! \n\nI love that even during the brunch hours (8 am - 3 pm), they had everything from fluffy pancakes to kalbi Korean short ribs. I don't know about you but that's exactly how my palate functions, in a myriad of savory and sweet flavors and textures. \n\nA chef will whip up a customized omelette or you can serve yourself from row after row of seafood, Asian, fruits and veggies, pasta, eggs benedict and even sushi. \n\nAnd if you're feeling frisky, try hitting up the dessert area first. A case of mouth-watering and creamy gelato awaits you as well as a pastry case of little colorful delicacies (rich chocolate mousse atop tangy passion fruit, tiny gold-flecked wafer cones, chocolate covered strawberries!)\n\nFinally, this is a buffet that understand portions. A significant chunk of their offerings come pre-portioned in mini cups, bowls and dishes so it's easier to try a taste of everything. Usually, I find myself putting 5 lbs of mac and cheese on my plate by accident so this was a nice change. \n\nThe wait wasn't too long but it is rather silly to have a cashier line AND a \""waiting to get into the buffet before I keel over from hunger\"" line."
4,"I'm not a big breakfast person, but there are times when I get to work and realize that if I don't eat something soon I'm going to crash and burn. This morning was such a day, so I walked over the The Silver Spoon hoping they would have their corned beef hash special. They didn't. So, I asked Jono to suggest something for me and he recommended the breakfast bagel sandwich. Since there was an everything bagel, I got that. And, of course, my meat was bacon. I'm very pleased with the end result and had to take a break from chatting about banking issues to finish this tasty treat."
4,"Party Mania is my first and only port of call when I am looking for a fancy dress outfit. Whatever the dressing up occasion, Party Mania will almost certainly be able to fulfil your needs. \n\nParty Mania sells a wide selection of different fancy dress outfits in packets which are handy, such as superwoman and an 80's disco outfit. They also sell a range of accessories to complete the perfect outfit, such as wigs, witch's fingernails, hats, masks and gloves. Party Mania also sell outfits for Hen Nights such as L-plates and garters. \n\nIn the run up to Halloween, Party Mania is always absolutely packed with people looking for the perfect costumes. They also sell make up, ribbons and feathers, which I have bought several of to complete my fancy dress outfit. The shop is situated just around the corner from the main University campus, George Square, so it is a handy place for students to go to for a costume. \n\nBalloons, banners and themed decorations are also available in this store. Party Mania stocks everything you could every want for the perfect fancy dress outfit, although it is a wee bit pricey."
4,"Perfect shop for unique, witty, and humorous cards, gorgeous stationery, beautiful paper goods, and various novelties and gifts. I appreciate the staff are always helpful and courteous. Parking can be a pain, but once you score a spot, you will be delighted to explore all the goodies in the store."
4,"So I just cancelled my membership after 6 years or so, no hassle there which was good. Got a refund for the remaining time. \nIt is a nice place, but I started taking yoga, privately, so no need for the gym for now."
4,"Stayed here recently because we got married in Caesars Palace. We stayed in a \""deluxe room\"" in the Augustus Tower. We originally werent placed there but our taxi driver said to ask for that tower cause it over looks the Bellagio water show. Well we got the tower... but on the wrong side. Instead of seeing the water show, we got to see the roof of the building under us. Oh well.\n\nThe room was HUGE. I wish I had taken pictures. The bathroom was HUGE!!! The bathtub had jets in them and there was a tv on the opposite side of the tub! Watching tv while taking a shower was an amazing experience haha.\n\nThe bed was so comfortable and the pillows were amazing. I wish I knew what type they were so I could buy some! Our room was right next to the hallway where people get off the elevator (why do we always get placed near the elevator) but it was quiet. \n\nOverall, I would definitely stay here again!!"
4,"After getting it down on the dance floor, refresh your hot skin by stepping onto the outdoor patio and allowing the squirts of mist from the waterfall cool you down.  Pure bliss!!\n\nThis review is really for those, just like me, who simply DON'T DO LINES!  And I'm not talking cola lines either.. I'm talking those hour long waits where guys promise to buy you a drink if you allow them to perform the \""I'm with her\"" trick.\n\nI have yet to barge my way through the crowd, or stand in line at the bar, so I truly can't write a review based on that experience.\n\nEach and every time we are fortunate enough to be accompanied by our very own body guard, who bypasses the door guys, has the best table waiting for us, escorts us to the front of the line in the powder room (sorry girls), and keeps a 6 foot radius clear around our secluded area..yay for bodyguards!!  \n\nThe table service in this place is phenomenal!  The wait staff are exceptionally nice and attentive. Your glass will never go empty!  And the little details like a chilled bowl of strawberries to accompany your glass of bubbly make all the difference.\n\nAnd if you unfortunately have to wait in line, be sure you're dressed to impress with an attitude that shouts - you'd be lost without me!  And once you get in, gravitate towards the tables that are surrounded only by guys...you never  know, they may invite you in ;-)"
4,"This is the best Dim Sum I've had in Vegas, I've been to Chang's three times in the last couple of months and it's been consistently very good. The service is just ok because every time we go we have to ask for our drinks twice. But really this place is about the Dim Sum which was great, there are always carts running around packed with food. The 'cart pushers' aren't very friendly or talkative but when you point to an item they give it to you so I'm not complaining. The prices are very reasonable for a family of four.\n\nThe place could use some more parking spaces because every time I've been there the lot has been full and I had to wait for somebody to leave."
4,Oh my goodness! This place is amazing!\nIt's like a subway but with pizza.\nIt's a cute place with very nice and friendly staff.
4,"I got a Groupon deal with 2 months of unlimited car washes for $15. Included in the membership (normally $5) is their \""red towel\"" service. They give you a microfiber towel   to use and when you bring the dirty one back next time they give you a clean one. They include air and vacuums so you can finish up after the tunnel. There are also self-service bays if you want to do it yourself. \n\nI asked about adding one-off services (like wax) in the future and not only did they say sure, but gave me a free wax then and there. I've only been a few times but I'm very satisfied. I wish I could pause the tunnel to give my wheels some extra attention but that's not realistic. I also wish they opened a little earlier but 8-6 is perfectly reasonable.\n\nAfter my Groupon is up, I'll be continuing my membership. At $16 a month I only need to go once a week to get my money's worth."
4,"When we used to live in Peoria, we would go to Greek Wraps about once a week. Their hummus is to die for. I've actually never had anything less than terrific there. Everything from the veggie pita wrap with grilled eggplant and onions smothered with their special yogurt sauce to their grilled lemon kebab with garlic sauce is amazing. \n\nThere is always a line at Greek Wraps and expect a wait. The food is made fresh to order and the portions are plentiful. \n\nI wish they had delivery!"
4,I'm having a good streak of pleasant experiences lately. Here for breakfast today and was pleasantly greeted and sat. Super friendly server and 100% efficient. Pancakes and eggs benedict were excellent. They do tend to undertoast the muffins at all good eggs so if you want it toasty remember to specify when ordering. My coffee at home is way better but it is adequate here. Good place and should be on your breakfast list. ......cat just jumped on me so that is all.
4,"I like Tigerlilly ! I prefer better for a cocktail or afternoon tea! I have dined and the food was delicious but really afternoon tea here is fabby!\nWe opted for afternoon tea for two including a ketel pot cocktail, lots of lovely cakes, scones and sandwiches and the staff who served us were lovely. I love the decor of tigerlilly and its always has a nice atmosphere and lots of professionalism."
4,"Little expensive for what you get.  Food was really good but I found myself spending quite more than I expected too for lunch.\n\nAs a plus side, they claim the Krab is Crab in a California roll, \n\nFood was tasty, just a bit higher priced than I would like."
4,This is where you can get not only good Oreintal food but good American choices. They have a wide selection and a sushi bar that is one of the best around. I love it when they have the dishes I like. I don't like it when something I usually like is not available. The sevice is always very good and all you can eat wow! That is good for the whole family or a group of people!
4,Tried Archies cafe for the first time. The service was great and the food was the best Tai food I've had so far. I ordered the Pad Tai 6 on the spicey scale and it could have been a little hotter. It is a great atmosphere and overall a great restaurant.
4,"When it comes to book shopping, I'm more of a get-in-and-go type than a browser. I usually go out to buy a book for a specific purpose (e.g., an upcoming trip where I'll have lots of down time), so I appreciate when bookstores lay out books in the front for quick selecting. Borders usually does a really good job of separating out some quick picks by type (new non-fiction, clearance, bestsellers), so it's a good fit for my book shopping style. \n\nI went to this location to pick a book for this upcoming weekend (my husband is taking the AZ bar exam early next week, so I'll have a lot of alone time) and quickly found something that looked interesting on the bestsellers table. The downside of Borders is that the prices are high compared to  buying a book online (my top choice is Amazon.com), but the upside is that it's easier to browse than on Amazon, where I usually find book shopping overwhelming if I don't have a specific book or genre in mind. \n\nThe staff at this particular location are friendly and the parking is definitely ample. There is also a Seattle's Best inside this location, a coffee shop I love, but I didn't buy anything from it on my first visit here."
4,Lots of hands on stuff to do and explore. My faves - the robots - they never miss shooting baskets and will kick your ass at air hockey. Fun and informative way to kill an afternoon.
4,"Finally got here. The food is excellent and if you ask for spicy they give it to you spicy and assume you can handle it. That in itself is worth it.  The veggie curry was superb, they have an excellent wine selection. Staff was friendly and they even brought out extra rice when they saw that we were running low."
4,Went here for a quick dinner. It is a newer place. Food was pretty good they have a good variety of foods to pick from and they give big portions. The staff was great  They rolled some of the food up in Chinese pancakes table side which was cool. The also offer wine and warm sake which many small places do not. Overall it's a nice place for Chinese food in Apache Junction
4,"Even if you're not in the area but want some really good Mexican, you gotta come here. The staff (everyone) was very nice. Very clean inside and outside. Plenty of options for seating, even outside. I had the shrimp tacos and side of sweet plantains. Awesome. I also had the ultimate margarita. Supposedly it had 3 different kinds of tequila, but I didn't even catch a buzz. I complain only because of the price! I mean the drink was really good, especially since I'm not a fan of margarita pre-mix (this was homemade). All in all, this has been the better Mexican I've had so far."
4,"So before heading home to L.A. from Las Vegas, we decided to have some lunch here.\n\nSeating was quick and easy, our waitress was okay, but not sure if the whole place was ready to go, and i heard they opened a few weeks before, not sure if it was true or not, but some of those waiters were not all there.\n\nAnyhow, the salad alone took forever to get to our table, and it arrived two minutes before our meals arrived, which is not cool, we need to enjoy the salad atleast half way before our meal gets there.\n\nHad their Twisted Mac,Chicken & Cheese, and i was not disappointed at all, good lunch.\n\nJust like any Hard Rock Cafe, the feel and your surroundings are Cool.\n\nHope to stop in again once i am in Las Vegas."
4,"The original Postino has only gotten better since they separated from LGO, and this new one is the best yet (I'm biased...it's closer to my house and I don't have to valet or fight with the LGO bunnies over parking). I love the indoor/outdoor bar and the feel of the inside. I love the food. The menu looks like it has been updated/revamped a little since the split and everything I ordered was cooked and seasoned perfectly. They have this breakfast dish that is a piece of grilled french bread with an egg and grilled asparagus and a little tomato salad...to die for. I love the cheap wine during the day (even on weekends!). The sparkling Sauvignon Blanc is worth a stretch outside your comfort zone. In general I just really like this place. In fact, I like it enough to forgive the sometimes spotty service...which is the only thing keeping me from a 5 star review."
4,"Coming from Vegas this is another thing I have come across in the Scottsdale area and wonder why this isn't there.  Prices were great twenty bucks for a haircut in a great atmosphere.  \n\nOf course hard to beat a two dollar a beer happy hour.  Which they will serve to you in the bar area or while you are in the chair,  \n\nThe guy who did my haircut was cool and was knowledgeable.  I imagine this will be where I go for my haircuts from now on."
4,"Our family of 4 dined at Roy's on a Saturday evening for dinner. We walked in, were greeted and sat promptly at our reservation time. We were happy that we were seated in one of the off shoot rooms from the front area, much much less noisy. Waters were poured, server had introduced herself, complementary edamame were placed down and drink orders were taken. We ordered a Cosmo and a Martini on the rocks with extra olives. The Martini, came forgot the olives and there was a lime wedge with the Martini, wrong, sent it back and was redone and all was well.\n\nWe started off with appetizers of Tuna Poke and a Signature Roll, both very good. For entrees we had: Braised Short Ribs of Beef, Seared Sea Scallops, Blackened Island Ahi, and Tempura California White Sea Bass.\n\nAll were perfectly cooked and very good. I can't say anything bad, but for the prices, Roy's still had that \""Chain Restaurant\"" aura about it. Can't put my finger on it, maybe the decor, the amount of tables, the scent or the lighting? I think its a great fine dining family restaurant. Would I come here for a romantic evening, maybe not. Service and Food very good."
4,"Love this place. Its like a neighborhood bar, but all grown up. You can enjoy a nice delicious meal. The entertainment is always great. Make reservations, gets crowded during the summer months. Service is outstanding."
4,"If you're hungry on a Friday afternoon during lunch time, you don't know where to eat, and only have $7.55 cents to your name, this is the place to go.  For that price, you can get a lot of food and drink in your stomach.  It's not the best buffet, but it's definitely a great price.  \n\nBy the time I was done, I was so satisfied.  My belly was about to explode.   Sad part is that on the way there, I kept telling myself \""You are not going to over eat, you are not going to over eat, you are not going to over eat!\""  But, what happened?  Geez, this is why I don't do buffets.  But, it was cheap though, so I shouldn't complain.  :)"
4,"These guys rock. I needed to get a new fan motor for my heatpump and they checked around and got me a good price on one. When I showed up to pay for it, one of them actually drove to the place they were ordering it from and picked it up for me so I could have it that day. They were also offering to give me a free capacitor for it, but it wasn't necessary.\n\nOnly negatives: I waited a full week after telling them to go ahead and order it because they never mentioned that I'd have to pay up-front. Simple miscommunication.\n\nNOTE: their hours on Yelp are not currently accurate; they close at 4:30pm."
4,"My husband and I went to Bunna for the first time this past Saturday night. I was excited to hear they were having a Poetry Slam and we were starving, having not had dinner. \nThe spoken word was great, even for their first night and there not being too many in attendance.\nThe owner was there that evening and you could see the pride he had for his small coffee house. The atmosphere is cozy and eclectic, with various tables and chairs. We didn't taste the coffee, so I'll update you about t when I go back. \nMy husband asked for a recommendation and tried the Mediterranean Chicken Wrap and a cherry italian soda said it was good. I had the Turkey & Swiss Panini with pesto mayo and a strawberry lemonade. It was delicious. They both came with Veggie Chips, which we had tried for the first time and were pleased. I LOVE when your accompaniment is something different from the norm.\nor $5.00 each meal plus our drinks, their lunch menu offerings are fantastic. I will happily go back and try the coffee another time, despite the drive. \nIn addition to all flavors of coffee, espresso, cappuccino and lattes, they also make shakes, smoothies, hummus, breakfast sandwiches and have bakery items. I see they also have a byob date night every Friday when they have a pasta dinner with acoustic music. I think we'll try this as well.  \nImpressed!"
4,I love Lisa's Bowl of Balls.  It is a very yummy and satisfying dish.  I go to Lisa G's just for her meatballs when I'm craving meat.  I highly recommend this dish.
4,People and company make mistakes. \nThe owner personally took responsibility for the mistake and fixed the problem. \n\nThis shows they care about their customers and value the business!!
4,"Nice place, my boyfriend raved about it so he decided to take me here. I love good backed potatoes and he said this place had huge potatoes and great food. I should be fair all I ate was the potatoe and some corn bread; but i can't help but feel I was ripped off. We both got potatoes, cornbread and two drinks and paid $30. I can't believe that. $30 for potatoes? Granted it came with meat on top but hell i could've done that. \n\nNow taking that into account I have not tried the BBQ as of yet. Looking around though I saw some of the others food and it looked amazing. The place overall has a nice homey and friendly atmosphere. When you walk in the place smells delicious and the place was so busy. I will be back if only to try those ribs I saw someone else order they looked great. The cornbread and honey butter as well are my favorite. I would like to take just a pan of that stuff. \n\nOverall I feel it was pricy for what I got but the food was still good. The place seems jumpin in the sense of customers coming and the food from specualtion alone looks worthy of a 4 star rating. Just wish it were a little cheaper but you pay for quality right. I'll be back soon."
4,"Food quality: 4/5\nThe pho here is awesome! I loved my pho tai chin with some bo vien. It wasn't too hot and the noodles didn't stick together. The one thing I wasn't impressed with was the spring rolls which are something my girlfriend and I almost always get with our pho, hence the 4/5.\n\nCustomer service: 5/5\nIt's good for any sort of asian food place. The people were courteous, kept my water filled without me asking, and delivered the bill promptly/returned the receipts.\n\nAmbiance: 4/5\nThe place is in the heart of asian town on Spring Mountain Rd. It's nice inside and smells strongly of pho (which is why you're going here, right??). The one thing I disliked was the fish tank looked quite unkempt while I was there, but that could have been something they were in the process of cleaning or something... Still, minus one star."
4,"3.5 stars rounded to 4. Biggest gripe is the looooong lines, especially during their Xmas BOGO promo. Had to wait an hour, and barely made the 4pm cutoff to get in on the promo (they had told us if we didn't get to the register before 4pm, it would be full dinner price per person!)\n\nOnce in, the selection was out of control. Everything and anything you can imagine, plus free beer and wine. Quality of food was very good as well.\n\nI'd suggest going to lunch for $12 or so (with the players card) as dinner is a bit pricey. I think they take reservations as long as there's not a promo going on."
4,"Delicious dishes with generous portions.  Their Peruvian purple corn drink, chica, is also delicious, and tastes a bit like hibiscus tea rather than a \""corn drink\"".  We ate here on a Friday, and tried their roast chicken.  It was juicy, tender, flavored with herbs and roasted just right.  We had fish ceviche as an appetizer, and it was nicely piquant, marinated with citrus/lime flavor.  I tried some lomo saltado as well, and the beef was tender, and packed with flavor.  Service was friendly, but a bit slow.  I will definitely be dining here again!"
4,"I stopped by Federico's for a quick bite to eat.  I ordered two beef tacos with a drink.  The woman at the counter was doing double duty at the drive-through so service was a bit slow, but the food was excellent.  The tacos were tasty, ,the lettuce was very crisp and fresh, and I was totally impressed by the food.  Very very good value for the money."
4,"I do admit the clothes here are not exactly at the quality that I want, but if you do stop by frequently you can spot some really nice items. And the guy who works there is super nice so make sure you get to know him! He can help you a lot."
4,"How can I say this without betraying my commitment to my local deli... Well-- let's say this: if Primanti Brothers existed anywhere near San Francisco, I'd live next door. These sandwiches are sloppy, robust and full of goodness that is just essential to the signature Pittsburgh experience. \nI love this location because it's the original, and I have good memories drinking and devouring kielbasa like a Yinzer at their counter over the years when I'm in town. \nMay Primanti Brothers reign supreme in sandwich world domination. Amen."
5,"When it comes to food and service, Houstons is as consistent as it gets!! This Hillstone Group restaurant should teach Fox Restaurant Concepts a thing or two about this notion. \n\nAnywho.... I just wanted to let all Houstons soup fans know that they just changed the Sunday soup from Mexico City style to Mushroom Artichoke. =-0 I'm personally very disappointed with the removal of this favorite. However, I love mushrooms and artichokes. This soup is two thumbs up! \n\nBon Appetite!"
5,Had a great time with Maverick Tours this morning.  Was my first time on a helicopter and the staff was great providing safety training before the flight.  Our pilot Joe led us on a smooth ride all the way to the Grand canyon and back.  He provided information during the flight to add to the enjoyment of seeing the sites from high above.  Once we landed in the Canyon we sipped champagne and had many photo ops.  Lots of room in the helicopter too.  Thank you to the great staff at Maverick for a once in a lifetime adventure!
5,"Phenomenal! Make a reservation and bring your best bottle of wine! From the grilled octopus and Israeli couscous / duck confit ravioli appetizers, to the grilled, marinated bison flank steak... This place has it all, ambience, five star service and an attention to classic French culinary detail that is rivaled by few. \n\nEvery part of our meal was perfect.. And with a five course pre fixe under $50.. How can you go wrong?  The staff was friendly and every single stage of the meal was perfectly executed. \n\nWe came here for our anniversary dinner and left with happy tummies and big smiles.\n\nThank you Le Pegase! :)"
5,"Pam & Nibblers saved me!  Last minute office luncheon and they were able to put together a great menu. Prompt service and set-up, with everything you need and/or can think of.  (try the grilled veggies, flank steak ...everything.!!)"
5,"One place that I love coming to is this place. I know I can depend on this place for a good breakfast, lunch or dinner. I was flying out of Phoenix and I desperately needed food before I dealt with TSA, and flying. I ended up buying the power protein sandwich which was a very reasonable price. $5 in an airport for a good sandwich. I'm down!!\n\nAnyways they took my order and it took about five minutes to make my sandwich. The power sandwich had whole grain bread,  egg whites, white Vermont cheddar and lean ham. The ham and egg tasted so good. And the bread was very hearty and delicious. It made eating healthy be delicious. I really enjoyed my sandwich and it kept me full until lunch time!!"
5,"I have not experienced anything but the BEST food every time I go to Pura Vida. I have brought my Father, who refuses to give up meat, and my Mother, who is extremely picky, and this is the one place we can all eat without one complaint. The food is always gorgeous, but I can never get a shot of it without a bite mark because it smells awesome.\nI recently tried the cafe con leche and it was the smoothest, yummiest coffee I've had in my 31 years. I don't know how she does it, but Starbucks doesn't even come close. \nEach time I have come, I have noticed that Chef Mayra takes time to come out and personally speak with her guests, first time I have ever met the person making my food which I really enjoyed. The place is tucked away, but once you find it, I promise you will remember how to get back."
5,"A few years ago, I tried scuba diving on vacation in a resort and it was a very stressful situation for me. I wasn't sure if I would ever try scuba again. \n\nA friend of mine told me about Destination Scuba and it changed my perspective on the world of scuba diving. Before I was afraid of scuba and felt rushed because I never had the chance to learn at my own pace. Destination Scuba was the complete opposite and has great instructors that know how to handle a scared little guppy like me! The ocean can be overwhelming, but also amazing and beautiful and given the chance to learn the basics of scuba with calm dive instructors who want me to enjoy it just as much as they do- it was just priceless! \n\nAnother cool aspect of Destination Scuba, they live up to their name! They plan many dive vacations throughout the year in tropical destinations. Sounds like the perfect excuse for a trip to the Bahamas- if you ask me!"
5,"A beautiful hotel with clean, spacious rooms.  \n\nNever had the buffet here, but the casino itself is comfortable, clean, and fun.  I didn't win, but I've never, ever won in Nevada!  haha  \n\nFun anyway.  I'd certainly stay here again, and recommend it to friends.\n\nThe fitness room, while pricey to use, includes great access to the \""spa\"".  While treatments are pricey (and a terrible value if my pedicure was any indication), it was great to be able to work out and then use the scented steam room and awesome showers and stuff."
5,"Vegas has a gazillion restaurants to choose from, so the list of places that I want to visit is quite extensive. I definitely knew that wanted to go to a place that would have more locals than tourists. After running through my list and seeing the great Yelp reviews, I finally decided on India Palace.\n\nWow, I was not disappointed! Started the meal off with the Vegetable Pakora and the Onion Bhaji. The Onion Bhaji, which are onions dipped in spicy batter and then deep fried, was amazing!!! It had the perfect amount of spiciness to start with, and when I felt like upping the spice meter, I just added a little of that really hot dipping sauce. I don't know the name of that sauce, but you know, the one that burns your mouth off.\n\nI went for my usual Chicken Vindaloo for my main course. Chicken Vindaloo is chicken cooked in a hot spicy sauce with diced potatoes, and of course, you can request the level of spiciness. I went for \""hot\""! To die for... it was sooo good!!! It was so spicy that I started sweating while eating it....yeah, that's some good shit! I gobbled this down with some garlic naan and cheese naan, and was quite full. I didn't even have room for dessert, which is usually required in my book.\n\nWhen I checked in, I unlocked a Yelp coupon code, which they pleasantly honored. The service was absolutely awesome! Nice, quick, and always a smile.\n\nWill be going back!"
5,Love it. From out of town needed a mani pedi and they were great. Close to the strip and great quality nail work. Friendly staff
5,"Miss my old home! Best place to live! Gated community, security, and close to everything... The 101, 202 & 60. Tempe Marketplace, Mesa riverview and 10 minutes from Old Town Scottsdale!"
5,I like to come here as an alternative AYCE sushi place especially since the prices for AYCE is better than most places. The Sushi is great definitely don't have any complaints. The place is a little hidden in the shopping center but I definitely make it one of my top 3 in Vegas for AYCE.
5,"Allure is awesome! The salon is always clean, the staff is friendly, and their prices are reasonable. I live about 15 miles from Allure, but make the drive there whenever I want my nails done or need a wax because nobody else does as good of a job as Allure. Get your eyebrows waxed by Jen! I've been going to her for 2 years and she's the only person I trust with my brows. She does a great job, keeps them full & natural looking, but cleans them up nicely.\n\nAlso: Bring cash to tip because you can't write in a tip on your credit card receipt!"
5,"So far this had been the best CB I have been to. The wait is shorter than the one on bell and 101. I love the cheesy hashbrown casserole and it is highly recommended. It is always pretty loud in CB, but is still enjoyable. I love to go Sundays after or before church."
5,"This is by far one of the best hotels that I have stayed at. We stayed here during December and I don't know why it has taken me this long to review the hotel. \n\nHere's a lots if why I like this hotel compared to alllll the other hotel one can choose when visiting Las Vegas. \n\n1. Very nice elegant and modern architecture. Our room was very nice and decorated to perfection. Our view was priceless and the best part of it was that it was about 220 a night. Our stay was during middle of December. \n\n2. The location. It's centralized within the strip and it's a easy walk to the surrounding hotels, shops and  restaurants. There is also a tram that one can take to get around. We just walked everywhere because it was  so convenient. \n\n3. The restaurants. Specifically the Buffett. I used to think that Wynn had the best Buffett. But that is until I tried Aria buffet. I believe it was about $40 for dinner or $45 for dinner per person. But not was it worth every penny. The variety of food was endless and the quality was unbeatable. \n\nI loved everything about this hotel and I truly recommend it to anyone a traveling through Vegas. The off season prices make it affordable. So try it of you can because it's truly worth it."
5,Amazing one of a kind furniture!  I have purchased several items for my new home and love everything I chose.  Everything is hand painted and has a special touch.  Owners are very nice and have a delivery service available to assist you if you don't own a truck.  Check it out!!
5,"Don't let the word \""grocer\"" in the name or the sandwich/salad-based menu available online fool you. This isn't just a deli or a grocery.  With the 7 or 8 daily specials on pasta, beef, and seafood, this is quietly one of the best Italian restaurants in town. \n\nNot to take away from the sandwiches, salads, or other antipasto, all of which are excellent and priced under $10. But the white board specials menu is where it's at. The specials range from risotto with shrimp, mussels, and sea bass, to homemade meatballs, to veal ravioli, to tuscan-style steaks. Specials range from $10 to $30. Wine available for sale on site, with a corkage fee for wine. You wouldn't expect it at this counter service-only spot with a sandwich-heavy menu and just a few tables, but this is a unique, fantastic, and authentic spot (particularly when the owner/chef and his friends are sitting nearby loudly speaking Italian with soccer on the TV!)."
5,"Excellent food and service. Had the chicken bento box ($9) for lunch came with tons of food. Also had the green tea crime br\u00fbl\u00e9e, unbelievably delicious. Will be back here soon!"
5,Great fresh food and craft beer selection.\nOrdered the 29 burger one of the best burgers I've ever had and fresh cut fries to go with it.\n\nClosest bar to the kitchener rangers arena.  Owner Liam is very friendly and let us park here for the game. \n\nHighly recommended.
5,"We made a quick stop for a late lunch as we were drove through Wickenburg the road from Phoenix to to Las Vegas. The food exceeded our expectations and was served up faster than most \""fast food\"" restaurants. We ordered the pulled pork sandwich, brisket sandwich, baked beans, sweet potato fries, and potato salad. My wife thought the sweet potato fried were the best she has ever eaten. I thought my brisket sandwich was great until I tasted the pulled pork, which I rated even higher. The baked beans were to die for. And to top it all off, they served up a warm triple chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream. Wow!"
5,"Very nice people and great food! Got warm chips AND a salsa bar...that's my type of bar....also dessert bars are nice as well. \n\nBack to this place, cheap, fast and friendly...pretty damn good these days."
5,"I thought the place was near perfect.  Our experience was flawless.  The service impeccable.  \n\nThings i loved about the place:  \nExcellent wine selection.  Not your normal everday average wines that most Phoenix/Scottsdale restaurants try to pawn off on us.  Well selected and nicely priced.  \n\nWe started off with the carpacio... it was beautiful.   Perfectly sliced. It was like butter in our mouths.  Simple, fresh,  high quality meat.  \n\nI had the mussles linguine in a white winegarlic sauce.  It was exquisite.    Just enough garlic to give it a spice and nothing overpowered the mussles.  Again... ingredients were fresh and of quality.  The pasta was perfetly cooked.\n\nFor desert.. the tiramisu.  YUMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! \n\nThe decor was great.  I felt it was a sincere attempt at fine dining while maintaining its personality.    The big round bar in the middle was elegant.. semi flashy but comforable.  The table where all well placed. There is a beautiful wine cellar with a special table for private dining.\n\nAnd of course, Mauricios genuinie hospitality embraces your table from time to time.  \n\nI'm glad to see a restaaurant of this caliber that is not owned by a major corporation  I consider this fine dinning with comfort."
5,Cloud 9 is the best hookah spot. Great DJs. Great staff. Great crowd over all. Yeah they might not serve alcohol  but they do have a xbox one that you can play with while smoking the best flavors in town!
5,"I've been vegan for about 4 months now and have been wanting to try this place for a while...Very progressive and upscale both food and decor wise...We got the lasagna, pad thai, the living burrito, and a veggie burger..Everything was good but the burger was a little dry..So borrowed some of my GFs hot sauce and it was all good..A little pricey but that was to be expected...Definitely what us southerners would consider fiancy.."
5,Went on Sunday morning for brunch and enjoyed bottomless bloody Mary's and mimosas for $16. What a great deal! I ate a breakfast skillet scramble and it was amazing! Angie was our server and she was awesome and very attentive! We will definitely be going back again soon!
5,"We eat at Toms pretty often.  The bbq is awesome, but so is everything else!  Don't sell yourself short just getting bbq.  Get the fish, get the Italian beef, try their burgers and don't miss Toms pride and joy!  Fair prices, excellent food and friendly service!"
5,"Love it. Simply elegant food that is cooked to perfection. We were lucky to get good seats next to the window that overlooks the Bellagio fountain that made the meal extra special. The servers were numerous. We had a different person for almost every type of service; one guy who pours the water, another who seats you, another who takes your order, another who brings out the dish. It was very fun to get pampered. \n\nWe split the spaghetti and ordered mushrooms and brocollini as sides. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the tomato sauce is creamy with great flavors. Really a satisfying meal despite it's simplicity. The sides are as amazing as the main dish if not more! Again, we didn't order anything too exciting but the flavors are spot on. \n\nWill definitely come again and look forward to having the same dishes all over again."
5,"I don't know what else to add that hasn't already been covered.  This made-to-order frozen dessert place is entertaining and an exercise in patience.  Watching the Ice Pan folks slap your (non)dairy atoms on the icepan is definitely a fun show.  Of course, all the while you're watching, you're wishing that the process would just hurry-up-a-bit-because-you-really-want-your-dessert!\n\nChoose from your choice of dairy milk or non-dairy milk, then select your choice of flavour, then decide upon the topping(s).  No preservatives or additives (except what may be in the toppings -- Oreos, Reese pb cups, etc.) and all made in front of your eyes in about 2 minutes.  (I timed it.)  \n\nIt's too bad that one has to fight through the Harrah's smoky casino to get to Ice Pan, but it's worth it.  Be prepared to wait a while; we checked out Ice Pan on a weekday during the late afternoon and despite being 2 of about 5 people in the queue, it still took about 15 minutes for the Ice Pan folks to start our order.  We forgot that pain as soon as we tasted our dessert though.  :)"
5,"Always a great place to stay.\nVery clean, and attentive.\nThey offer free Internet and a great Tapas bar to unwind from a long day away from home and family. \n\nWhen traveling on personal trips the hinton would be my go to hotel, very close to Metro and other fine dining."
5,"Herbs and Spices OH MY!!!\n\nEvery Spice, Herb, baking ingredient you can imagine is here and the quality is just superb! I will never waste my money at any other place on spices or herbs...because unless they are Penzey's they are a waste of money!\n\nI personally love there Cumin, their extracts, Vanilla and Almond, and their many Cinnamon Choices, are the most amazing quality and are worth every penny. \n\nI look forward to every visit to the store so I can try a new item each time I go. I keep a list in my spice cabinet to make sure I never run out and so I never have to rush off to the grocery store for a spice while cooking...God forbid I run out of my Penzey's Spices!!"
5,"Yummy! I bought a groupon and went in immediately.  Although their selection was limited, I was lucky enough to get in there in time to get a decent selection.  I didn't know you could special order with a groupon, but I was pleased with what I got. Red velvet, cookies and cream, peanut butter, chocolate, and vanilla. My kids LOVED them... And they were so big they couldn't even finish one. The icing is very sweet and you probably won't be able to eat it all. The cake is super moist and Full of flavor. The cupcakes are huge and a great value for the price. The groupon deal is a steal! The staff was attentive and very friendly. The gentleman there was very nice and helpful. I will definitely be back."
5,"I love this ballpark.  Nestled in downtown Phoenix.  US Airway arena across the street.  The rail runs past it.  The area is very clean and alive, especially on game day.  Parking is not hard to find and is pretty reasonable.  My favorite lot is about 1 block away and costs $7 to park in.  The lot is fenced in and secure.  Getting out after the game is easy.  The streets are blocked off and the police guide you fairly effortlessly through downtown.  \n\nThe park itself is awesome.  My favorite spot is the RF bleachers.  Just something about that area we love.  Plus you can buy tickets that include a dog and a drink for $25 after all fees and stuff.  I try and sit as close to the field as we can.  Tonight we sat up at Friday's Front Row on the balcony.  I prefer to sit in the crowd.  The game is more involving and the people are way more entertaining.   The vendors are usually pretty good and will make small talk or tell some jokes.   They opened the roof tonight and it was quite enjoyable.  Their were fireworks after the game too.  \n\nI recommend catching a game here if you get the chance.  The DBacks are not playing well so far this year, and are even worse at home for some reason."
5,"In the best crate-digging tradition, Record City is an old, converted house that's filled to the gills with vinyl - Lps, picture discs, 45s, what have you, both new and used. \n\nI've been collecting for a very long time, and I love this place for a couple of reasons. First: quality. It's superb. Most vinyl is in near-perfect shape. If it's not, it's there because it's rare (like that Whispers Lp on Soul Clock that I found during my last visit). Second, selection: although the bulk of their vinyl is rock and R&B, there are smaller but respectable collections of jazz, country and classical. \n\nCool thing about record shopping in Vegas is that so many people come through there from all over. This makes for a lot of inventory change, all the time. And that's very cool. Unlike other local stores like Zia, you will come out of here with an armload rather than one or two Lps.\n\nNote that they close at 5PM and are NOT open on Sundays, so plan accordingly. Last time I was here, I came up with a half-dozen sealed early 70s Motown titles, a couple of hard to find Quads that i'd been searching for, and a ton of other cool goodies. Definitely worth the visit if you're in Sin City, with a better chance of a \""win\"" than any casino you might drop cash at ;)"
5,"Best vegetarian \""meat\"" sandwiches I've had out. Got a veg cheesesteak (morning star chicken shreds) and a turkey and slaw (sliced smoked soy based turkey of some sort). Fan. Tas. Tic. Good bread, good portions, great veg meat, polite staff...I wish there was one of these near my home town. I would eat here every night. $13 for a 20\"" sub just can't be beat."
5,"amazing, amazing, AMAZIIING.\n\ndrinks, food, service, decor: 5 stars.\n\nbeing a bartender myself, i was pleased to find that not only could they make a mojito, it was the best i've ever had. the drinks did take an average of 10-15 min to arrive per round but it was because the bartender actually took the time to make them with love, care and expertise. you can tell by the product. it was perfection. worth the wait anyday.\n\nDW is a diamond in the rough (no offense, west las vegas)\n\ncant wait to go back!"
5,"What a great time@YELP HELPS 2013...,All the vendors presented their best products and the Organizations showed the important work they do for the Pittsburgh Community.I especially liked Luke Wholeys Mahi Mahi and Vito Girosole's RED RIBBON soda pop...Ciao Vito molto bene!...Thanks Rachel and all the YELPERS for another fantastic evening.                                                                                                                   Gary Katocs"
5,"The chicken kabob entree is my absolute favorite thing to order here.  You get:  1 kabob jam packed with marinated chicken, 1 kabob of marinated mixed vegetables, a huge side of rice pilaf, a heaping of greek salad, and hummus and pita chips.  Talk about bang for your buck!  \n\nThe original lamb gyro is my second favorite thing to order here.\n\nMarket Grille now has a waitstaff, which I am kind of disappointed in.  I felt the old system of ordering at the register, taking a number, and getting your own drink worked just fine.  \n\nTheir customer service is superb, everyone is always very friendly and attentive.  \n\nTip:  Occasional 15% off coupons for Market Grill inside of the Review Journal."
5,"We love Winco! It's easy on the pocket especially on produce which has been good quality so far. Also Milk is always under $2 a gallon! I love all the different types of breads they carry and their HyTop brand products aren't bad. \nWe hate shopping at Walmart and supporting an awful company. Winco treats their employees well and have always had exceptional service. You can't compare it to Fry's or Safeway it's a hybrid! What really helps is that it's great for just 2 people, I don't always want bulk quantities from Costco but love the grocery store prices that are very competitive."
5,"I can't say enough about how much we love this place! We first went to the farm for my son's second birthday and did the hayride and petting zoo tour. We loved picking flavors at the milk bar and hand feeding the animals. We went again after purchasing a Groupon and are now Dairy Club members. I really enjoy getting close to the source of our food and trying out all the special nosh that the chefs whip up. From peanut butter ice cream, garlic & herb butter, red pepper aioli, to the awesome chicken salad- we are hooked!"
5,"I really wish that I had gotten a larger size of the tortellini salad, it was super.  And the key lime dessert was ridiculously wonderful....mellow, not too tart but not too sweet.   I also wish that I had gotten the apricot pork tenderloin, it looked great.  My daughter did love her two cookies :-)  This is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood!!!!"
5,"Ambiance, proximity, and chocolate cappuccinos--these are my favorite things about Sambalatte.  It's in my 'hood and a great place to hang out and meet friends for great coffee, tea, and/or food.  It's always buzzing up in here, with free wi-fi available and an area dedicated to those packing their laptops to get some work done.  I've come here to do just that with my son and solo.  It's also a great place for people-watching; it feels like you're in Southern California, not Summerlin. It's everything you want in a cool Italian-style coffeehouse, with great decor and a second floor that overlooks all the activity down below.  If you have some time to spend, are in the area, and not in a rush to speed through like at Starbucks, come check it out sometime; Starbucks has nothing on Sambalatte."
5,Best pizza in Arizona. Arizona had been waiting for this for a long time!!  We were customers in IL and the owners have kept up the exact same quality and service!!  We didn't want to move back to IL to have great pizza!!!  Thank you Buzzyz for always delivering a superior product.
5,"By far one of the Top 5 poker rooms in Las Vegas. Plenty of tables, good action, and good overall room. My go to spot."
5,"Their arepas are AMAZING! It was my first time trying this but it was a perfect fit to my taste buds. Location is couple miles from the strip and the plaza looks old but it is nice inside the restaurant. The arepas also come with two sauces in a bottle. You can use it as a spread for the arepas and it is absolutely delicious! It is spicy, savory, and creamy! It went so well with my food! The cashier, George, was also very patient when I was ordering and knowledgable about their menu. It is not cheap cheap but compared to other restaurants and buffets on the strip, it is cheap and worth it for the quality of the food."
5,This place did an amazing job in helping me to recover from Friday night on the Strip.\nHonestly I was surprised by how good the food was! Service was really nice and prompt. And out of nowhere I had the best Mechilada ever....my hangover was happy @_@\n\nGo for the Egg Benedict and you will not regret it. Perfect place to visit before heading out to explore the strip or going to the pool summer time...!
5,"This place is so freaking good.  No way anyone can tell they vegan.  The people who work here are always so nice.  Cash only though.\n\nI flew in for my oldest daughters graduation, I had two food wishes while in town, Spam Musabi, and Vegan Donuts from Ronald's.  I know, contradicting food forces pulling at me. ;)\n\nThe apple fritters are delicious, I carried them thru graduation then on plane, and now they are cleverly frozen and hidden at my fianc\u00e9s house in her freezer.   \n\nSeriously, there is no way to tell the donuts are vegan, they are delicious.    Just remember, CASH ONLY.  Also the lady who co owns it is incredibly nice and polite, a rarity in Las Vegas."
5,"Just finished a wonderful dinner here!  Never had Turkish food before.  Will be coming back soon!  The Kuru Fasulye a white bean and chopped lamb dish was delightful.   The Lentil soup was velvety smooth and seasoned perfectly.   Turkish baklava is softer and chewier than most others, not overly sweet.  MUST have the Turkish coffee with it!   Awesome.   Staff was friendly and welcoming.   I highly recommend it.  Like a mini Mediterranean vaca!"
5,One of the best sushi places i have ever been to in my life!  This is honestly not an exaggeration as I tend to do that at times.  I was only in Vegas for three nights and I came here two out of the three.  Highly recommend and absolutely everything we ordered was amazing.  There was a special crunch spicy roll that was to die for.
5,"Dig the food here not fast food but really good food, everything I have tried is so amazing the carnitas burrito delicious the tacos are quality and the street corn reminds me of my trips to Mexico when I was younger."
5,"Wow is a good way to start with. I was blown away with this show. Words are hard to put together to show how much i loved it! A Beatles Tribute it is, the music had everyone moving to the beat. It was AWESOME for me and the Wife to see. It was the best show we have ever seen. And the best of Cirque du Soleil, I'd have to say."
5,"I think I've found a new favourite in Uptown Waterloo.\n\nI went here with a friend of mine a week or two ago as I'm in my final year at Waterloo, and I've decided to be adventurous and try all those places I didn't even know about in 1st year.  I'm now sad to discover I could have been indulging in this place for years, but alas - better late than never!\n\nThe place itself isn't lots to look at - it's cute, quaint, but it has character.  The staff were extremely friendly and welcomed any questions about the menu.  I ordered the eggplant parmesan and a water (I was driving, so I'll have to revamp my review once I try one of their cocktails!).  I've had eggplant parmesan before, but I'd say this is probably the best I've had - if not then definitely top three.  Served as a sandwich, it was super flavourful and came with the marinara sauce on the side which I loved as I'm not a fan of soggy bread!\n\nThe place itself was quiet as we were there on a Tuesday night around 7pm, way before the bar crowd would get there.  If you're looking for a quiet dinner then I'd say come around that time, and stay tuned for part two once I check out their cocktail menu!"
5,"Rolled into town on a Saturday night after driving 16 hours to get here.  The car is dinging some nonsense about oil and coolant.  \n\nSince a used car is less expensive than a brand new auto, I think I'd better give the green car a drink.\n\nIn haste, I top off the coolant with some brand I purchased at the nearest gas station.  Then the panic sets in.\n\nI grab the manual and search the forums on coolant for specific requirements for my maturing road beast.  I think I put in the wrong kind of coolant.  I keep reading about colors and brand specific benefits.\n\nI head to Zimbrick and Bryan is awesome and friendly and patient.\n\nHe takes the coolant supply I have and checks it against the kind the service folks have in bulk.  I'm good for the top off.  No dangers.  Then we talk oil and other road-preparedness details I should not skip.\n\nHe grabs the oil grade I need, checks the levels, complements my ride and I prepare the wallet.  I ask how much I owe.\n\nThe transaction ended with a smile, a handshake and a sincere \""...thanks for visiting Madison, enjoy your time, and have a safe trip....\""\n\nI'm in love."
5,"I love DB! I am consistently served great tasting coffee with superior customer service!  I have no complaints. I was already in love with DB, and then I saw the special on Undercover Boss, and it confirmed my appreciation for this business. Had I known about this company when I was in high school, I would have worked for them!"
5,"We love this place. Very clean, excellent customer service and most importantly, the food is amazing. They make their own delicious pasta, cheese and sauces, all of their ingredients are fresh (hence the name of the place) and the macaroons are to die for. We will definitely be back."
5,"I used Lucky Me Pet Care last time I went out of town and they were great. The dogs were happy, they leave notes to update you on when they were there and what the dogs were doing. I felt very comfortable leaving them in the capable hands of Heather and her staff. They went on walks each day and got the attention they need. It's a much better alternative to having to board dogs when you go on vacation as they are in the comfort of their own home. Not to mention, it is much more affordable too!"
5,"I ordered chocolate shaved snow and it wasn't what I was expecting, but good. Employees were super friendly and the store was spotless, even on a busy Saturday evening. Fun addition to Centennial Hills"
5,This place is next to my work so it's convenient. The staff is friendly and always willing to help. Definitely recommend this place
5,This is my choice for Indian food. I go in for the buffet so i don't have to choose which one i want. Favorite would be the curie chicken.
5,Found this place on yelp and just want to stop by bcos my brows getting out of control. When I was getting two people ahead of me and the wait was les than 10 minutes. Did my eyebrows and lip for $9.00 that first time $5 deal applied to my service. Wow!! What great experience and now I know where to go. Thank you fabulous eyebrow threading.!!!
5,"Pork on a Fork is an unexpected awesome BBQ place in the north valley.  If you're from Nebraska like me you may appreciate the Cornhuskers \""N\"" on the smoker and picture of windmills & farmers in the dining area.  To me, those are a few of the reasons why I left that terrible place.  No points lost though.\n\nI have only been here during lunch and they usually have a line at the door, come early.  Their brisket, BBQ pork, beans and waffle fries are hot, tasty and fresh. PoaF's meat is awesome. The cornbread is good too. The portions are big too, I typically have to fight the afternoon food coma but it's worth it.\n\nTheir sauces aren't anything fantastic, but I enjoy the spicy sauce. The dining areas have flat screen TV's and aren't bad, but the chairs and tables are picnic quality."
5,"Toys R Us is to kids as Bass Pro Shops is to adults. If you love firearms, camping, knives, fishing, golfing, hiking, boating, hunting, ATV's, archery, or all of the above, this store is for YOU. Literally, every time we go to Vegas I have to stop at this Bass Pro Shops to stock up on ammo. Conveniently found next next to I-15 on Blue Diamond Road, Bass Pro Shops is my welcome committee to Las Vegas from California.\n\nOn my last visit we walked the store and found our way towards the giant aquariums and the mermaid painting exhibits at the Silverton Casino connection. What can I say, my wife likes mermaids. After looking at mermaids and stocking up on ammo, I found my way towards the crossbows on the second floor. I fell in love with a Parker Compound Crossbow. I think I found my new hubby to compliment shooting.\n\nIf are visiting Vegas, love the outdoors, and have not been to Bass Pro Shops, stop by and enjoy a good walk through this great store."
5,"... as always, 5 stars if the place would stand up anywhere. It would. \n\nFirstly, I'm overjoyed it survived these past few years. Secondly, on a regular Saturday night 8:30-ish, it was 40% full - and in-line with it's 2 street-facing co-tenants. That's hopefully enough to ensure survival. These 3 delightful restaurant/bars have carved out a wonderful second life for the industrial building they're housed in and provide a luxury of urbanity to this burg. \n\nWe had to scoot in for a quick small supper before going to a comedy show a friend was in. Small check quickly and un-resentfully served - thank you gracious server! \n\nThere was a single man drinking a coke and eating a bowl of pasta at the bar while diligently reading his book. It was clear he felt abundantly welcomed. That tableau epitomizes the civilized urbane establishment this place is. \n\nThe pasta carbonara remains true after two years to the unremittingly high standard set for me by a Queens neighborhood Italian joint decades ago - and Pasta Bar remains the only other place I've ever ordered it more than once. For that, and so much more, I'm eternally grateful."
5,"Friendly Service. Fresh Veggies! At only 1 dollar a person for BYOB and no corkage this place is a steal! The price is right too! \n\nIf you are a veggie, curry, wine lover who loves family style friendly service, then this place is for you!"
5,This place is very busy till about mid nite then you have a good shot at getting a place to sit.
5,"This is the greatest addition to the Basset St neighborhood... fantastic service, great food, locally owned, awesome prices, nice atmosphere...I can't say enough. They change the menu 2 times a season, hence the name. The entrees and breakfasts are great. You don't get cheesecake factory sized portions, but you definitely get a good value. They have a great selection of teas,  and offer a full coffee and regular bar. Two brothers own it and you can tell they care about their customers a lot. Get on their mailing list too, they only email once a month and have good specials."
5,This is the best mom and pops Korean restaurant I have ever been to. They treated us like their own family and spoiled us immensely. It's a small hole in the wall place that needs more visitors here. Try it once and you will be hooked. I plan on coming here again and again. The chef/wife's cooking is to die for. The husband/ host is absolutely hilarious and genuine. It's hard to find great quality food run by an old loving couple. The husband is a chemical engineer and the wife was a nurse for many years so you know they pay attention to every detail of the cooking and make sure everything is clean and perfect when ready to be served on the plate. They gave us 3 free dishes and even offered us a 4th free dish and even refused our tip because we were students. I made sure to slip one pass the husband though lol and still we did not think that was enough to express our gratitude towards such an eventful experience at their restaurant. We truly felt like we were at home and we were sitting around dinner table amongst family!!  I highly recommend them and would give more than 5 stars if possible!!
5,"I don't really care what the overall stars rating is, this place is great!\nThe Shepard's pie is one of the best in the valley and the staff is always ready with a fresh pint.\nThe Sunday jam sessions for traditional music is great."
5,"I recently had the privilege to dine at Gordon Ramsay Steak and am amazed at just how wonderful of a dining experience I had. The wait staff were wonderful, attentive, as well as very informative on every dish offered on their menu and the food was just fantastic. A symphony of flavors that came together to create one of the greatest meals I have ever eaten. Thank to everyone who made this the best dining experience of my life."
5,"Love me some Genghis Grill.  Always exactly what I want, because I get to pick exactly what I want.  It is flavorful, cooked to perfection and the staff is always great.\n\nThey always have a pair of chop stick helpers for my little one so she can feel like a chop stick pro.  \n\nI highly recommend taking your kids here.  My girl tends to eat more veggies or try new things when she can see it before it is cooked, and see other people trying it too."
5,"I went to the Grill Friday night with two of my girlfriends. We sat outside on the beautiful patio overlooking the golf course. There were several other people dining outside- the patio has been remodeled with new furniture, a bar and even televisions outside- so relaxing! There is a new gastropub-style menu so my friends and I got a bottle of wine and decided to try a little of everything. We had the truffle deviled eggs, cheese plate, duck confit tacos, ahi tuna, duck fat grilled cheese and kiltlifter fish and chips- everything was delicious and perfect for sharing! The wasabi crusted ahi was my favorite, but there are so many other things on the menu that I can't wait to go back and try. Staff was really friendly and attentive. Amazing menu and one of the best patios in Scottsdale!"
5,"Best pizza I've had since living in the greater Phoenix area, hands down! Pizzeria Bianco is located in a quaint historic area of downtown Phoenix surrounded by several other turn of the century homes that have since been turned into little restaurants and bars. We went here after hearing some good reviews for lunch this past Saturday. We got here around 3ish so we were able to get a table right away on their front patio in the shade, but things fill up pretty quickly and I've heard its fairly typical to wait an hour for a table. We split a salad and had the margarita pizza with added fennel sausage. Everything is very simple but is done with very high quality ingredients that gives the food a very unique and delicious flavor! We will for sure be back!"
5,Best threading place in the valley- she has invented her own device to help threading. Instead of holding the thread in your mouth they put it around a necklace. Way more sanitary than the other places- great service great quality overall a fabulous place to go. The girls are very thorough when they see you. They have a stamp card too!
5,"I've eaten a lot of bbq in my life and this is the best I've tried here in Arizona.  For those who understand Texas bbq, this is the place to go.  The brisket was very tender, and I tried the corn souffle and slaw as well. Corn was incredible,  the slaw was. .. slaw.  it was a nice contrast to the rest of the food on the page though.  Service was very friendly,  Lynn was shooting the breeze with me about different bbq styles.  I came away feeling enlightened.  Mentally,  definitely not physically.  I had to undo the button on my pants after that meal.  All in all,  the decor could be better,  and it is in a strip mall,  but the food and  service make this a five star diamond in the rough."
5,"Great place to shop, the bakery and coffee area is cheaper than a Starbucks and the pastries are much better. The outside patio is a nice place to read the paper in the morning.\n\nThe staff is top notch and cares about the customers compared to other markets in town. For quick meals the sushi bar is excellent, so is the salad bar, and deli selections.\n\nThere is no negative to shopping here, unless you are using it as your main supermarket, then things can get pricey."
5,Today I had tne best hair cut of my life.  The place is cute the people and clients were very nice. My hair cut is excelent and the message was a very pleasent suprise
5,Rubio's is a real simple & straight to the point cantina style Mexican food restaurant. I've been a hand full of times & I haven't deviated from my house favorite the Atlantic salmon burrito. It's super fresh I wish is was bigger (because I'm fat and I could eat 2) sea food isn't always something you think of at a quasi fast food joint but the food quality is good. The salsa selection has a nice variance. My favorite is the roasted chipotle! \nNice place to come during lunch breaks.
5,"This is a wonderful surprise! I saw this place announcing Brats and Burgers... so I tried it. Wow! The curry sauce is amazing. A definite \"" must stop\"" when I'm in the area."
5,With grand opening still a couple of weeks out I was a hesitant about checking out the new location so soon. Boy was I glad I did. Sure they have some kinks to work out and the brick oven isn't completed but what is offered on the limited menu has been outstanding - huge upgrade from other location. They will have 24 beers on tap when they open but currently have about 15 - including the hard to get Four Peaks Callabru Up N Runnin! Very impressed and can't wait for grand opening!
5,"I am always in a rush when I come here but they have awesome food and super cool items to buy!! We found this place before it was super busy and loved that this find was close to our office.\n\nFavorites: pulled pork sandwich, black & blue burger and the blue brisket salad.  Love all of these!! \n\nSorry so short gotta go back to the office!!"
5,"Had a truly great dining experience here. Our server was very helpful with our groups indecisiveness and recommended the signature pizza to share and the garlic olive oil for the bread was outstanding. I wish they sold that stuff in a bottle. The only complaint was the wait which was understandable given it was a crazy friday night with loud obnoxious drunk people rampart throughout the restaurant causing chaos and disorder. If you want authentic Italian food that is not a far cry from downtown, this is the place."
5,A fun place with tasty cocktails and a large variety of locally made whiskeys. They cocktails are reasonably priced and unique. I'll be interested to see what kinds of aged whiskeys they produce in the future. I want to come back and take the tour next time.
5,"This is a great addition to the NW for the discerning pet owner!  I love everything about it. They carry premium foods like Orijens, Acana, Natural Balance to name a few.  Plus they have a refrigerated dog section for those that feed raw.  All their treats are made in the USA.  They have a table with doggie desserts that look good enough for human consumption that are .90 an ounce.  They sell deer antlers, jerky and sausage items by the ounce too.  A perfect way to give you dog variety.  They have dog grooming and offer a nice selection of leashes, collars and dog bowls as well.  The owners, Adrienne and Jim are super friendly and support dog rescue which is a cause close to my heart.  I'm excited to see how the deer antlers go over cause sometimes Momma needs a break and those are supposed to keep them busy for awhile."
5,"Mexico City is located on smithfield by the bridge and is without a doubt the best authentic mexican I have had in Pittsburgh. The staff is great, very friendly. The tacos are awesome...I think the homemade corn tortilias are the reason they are so good. I felt like I was back in sayulita, nayurit!! All the food is very fresh and flavorful. Enjoy because this is as close as you can get to the real deal!!"
5,Very nice owner. Did handgun transfer at the store. Also score a Colt Python during transfer. Will definitely buy again.
5,"Grotty, dirty, cheap, and the unofficial Ground Zero of Edinburgh's seedy underbelly, a visit to Diane's will always be a memorable one. Expect to be offered knock-off DVDs and suspicious looking drugs, expect a pool cue across the head and a broken bottle in the face at some point during your visit, and expect to drink heavily alongside dealers, con artists, and every type of petty criminal under the sun.\n\nNeedless to say, I absolutely love it."
5,"went beyond my expectations!!! food,ambiance and service was awesome. I highly recommend the firecracker shrimp and the grilled chicken with cilantro cremation. we will definitely be back."
5,"Visited on a busier night than last time and again walked away impressed. Service and food were outstanding. We were celebrating our anniversary and got the memorable meal we were looking for. Sommelier was a bit pretentious but our server was great. Wild mushroom risotto, squid ink rice, and albondigas were standouts."
5,"Kind of like Japanese tapas (Izakaya?), you can get all sorts of interesting small dishes, like orange salmon canapes, oishii lobster (our favorite!) - including strawberries and served with shrimp chips, and many others.\n\nIn a city with a bad reputation for sushi, Oishii manages to put together a very interesting and solid selection of quality dishes, and is still reasonably priced, at least in 2010.  Definitely a neighborhood go-to spot, and at the same time unique enough to please visitors to the city too.  Definitely to be recommended.\n\nGreat for groups too, as they have a decent amount of space, and I think they have 1/2 price cocktails on Thursdays."
5,"How's about a 30-minute hike to get away from the woes of the city? Exploration Park is a beautiful park for children and hiking spot for families of all ages to enjoy! At the halfway point, there is a small bench area where a breathtaking view of the Strip can be seen; or teenagers can venture up there to gossip about their high school lives without being overheard by other vicious gossip-mongers that you can find in school. \n\nAt the top of the peak, there is a circle terrace and another bench area where the view of the city is even more dazzling. The trail is a very small hike and really good for kids and beginners that want to step into the world of the outdoors. Make sure you can handle this small mountain before taking on bigger game ;) \n\nAt the bottom is a big play park for children with multiple swing sets and slides. They even designed it so it looks like the Ol' Vegas West!! It even has a tiny mountain replica that smaller kids can \""hike\"". It's just way too cute for words! \n\nSo how about a hike? Exercise, exercise, EXERCISE! Get those New Years Resolutions done while letting your kids play!!"
5,"I love all things Cirque du Soleil but this is my absolute favorite! I love Michael Jackson and they did a fantastic job in bringing these two worlds together! I was moved to tears-I actually cried watching this show. It's beautiful, fun, emotional- His music combined with the amazing choreography of dancers, gymnasts, everything - just awesome! I don't want to spoil it but you have to see it! This is a definite must see show!"
5,Lunch in Las Vegas does not have the power element like most other cities as everyone is on vacation! Milo's on the other hand has become my favorite new lunch restaurant to eat and be seen. With an amazing prefix menu this is the spot to be.
5,"My pal Daniel G put me & my 5 girlfriends on the list, so no cover for us. Security was a bit strict with what items you can bring is, so travel light. We were just getting settled by the pool when Patrick the VIP host asked us if we'd like to join a couple guys in their cabana. Of course we said yes & enjoyed free mojitos with some nice guys for a few hours. Beautiful pool, great music, fun crowd, and no idiots splashing in the pool like they're 5 years old. Perfect day!"
5,"I stopped to get a quick bite to eat and wasn't disappointed. Beef chow mein is delcious,  it's not the bland stuff you'll find at similar joints.  Orange chicken is also A grade.  Service was quick to us and quick to deliver."
5,"We really enjoyed our pizza here! They had a great atmosphere, lots of choices!! I had the spicy sauce, jalapenos, two different cheeses, sausage, pepperoni and red bell peppers. So good. I don't think that you need to have a bunch of stuff  on it to make it great!!! They charge extra. for wheat or glutin free crust. Everyone there were very nice"
5,"This spot was the light of my life for about 3 solid weeks. From the first bite I could tell that parting ways with Pittsburgh would be heartbreaking. After driving out of pittsburgh and paying my friend for his leftover half a sandwich, I knew that id made a special connection. To that bacon egg and cheese waiting for me, I miss xou and cant wait to hold xou again."
5,"Never in my life have I written any sort of review for anything, whether good or bad.\n\nHowever, this place was the BEST sushi I've ever had for the CHEAPEST price I've ever seen Sushi cost. Came here because it was Good Friday, and I DEFINITELY recommend this to any sushi lover. The customer service was amazing, the food was amazing, the food came out VERY quickly, and I will DEFINITELY be coming back here.\n\nI just felt like I had to tell someone about how great this place was."
5,"5 stars for the vibes.\n5 stars for the rad chicks running the joint.\n20 stars for the Coyote Oatie ice cream sundae!\n\nStopped in on our way out from the Glendale Chocolate Affair and found heaven in a bowl.  I got the famed Coyote Oatie ice cream sundae and it was facking awesome.  Its basically the best ice cream sundae you've ever had with one of their signature Coyote Oatie cookies all warmed up and on top.  This is the perfect dessert.  When the cookie crumbles into the ice cream and caramel it is awesome.  Loved this little joint in downtown Glendale, loved the ladies running it.  I'd much rather give my money to a local joint like this rather than a CORPORATE Coldstone or Baskin Robbins.  \n\nAlready planning another trip.\n\nMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,"I'm not a car girl and Lester couldn't have been more accommodating.  I needed an inspection and he was able to take me the same day I called.  He's open past 7pm so the evening hours make it convenient to pick up or drop off. \n\nVery honest and upfront about the work he did, too...typical Pittsburgher who knows his stuff. Labor was $70/hour and parts were cheaper than other places. Cost me $3 to have a break light replaced.  Couldn't have been happier with the quick, honest, convenient service.  Lester's the best!"
5,"To those of you who have given this place a less than favorable review more than a month ago, you owe it to yourself to give it another try.  The new management has really stepped up the food, service, and the Happy Hour is as good as it gets, both eats and drinks.  I'd give it six stars if I could."
5,"I don't remember dying, but I must've died because I'm in Heaven. First of all, the ambiance is freakin ridiculous, (in a good way.) It's like I want to keep switching tables so I can take it all in! \n\nSecond, the best staff EVER! Andrew and Priscilla, I want to adopt them. Seriously. Happy, friendly, adorable, knowledgeable. Awesome. Perfect. Give them raises.\n\nMy husband had the beef tenderloin, of which I had a \""few\"" bites. I had the ribeye. It was hard to share but I gave him a bite. We finished with the \""Chocolate bar\"" dessert. Really, there is no way to describe the deliciousness. It's one of those desserts you want everyone you know to try so you can talk about it later. Just awesomely good. \n\nI've never wanted to live in Phoenix until now. \n\nCome. Eat. Drink. Share. Repeat."
5,"The M Resort is one of my favorite resorts in Las Vegas.  Since we are local we have not stayed here yet.  They have quite a bit to offer.  We mainly come here for the restaurants.  The Buffet is by far the best in town!  I love that they have my favorite dessert, Creme Brulee all the time and not just once in a while!  They also have espresso drinks available in the dessert area.  There is also a Hash House, Baby Cakes Bakery, Vig Deli, Anthony's Steak house and Burger Joint.  \nThe hotel as a whole is spotless!  The smoke in the casino area is kept to a minimum.  \nThe pool area is great!  Plenty of seating and the pool staff is great! Even the food at the pool is great too! \nRavello lounge has some great entertainment.  The wine/drink selections are great with a nice price range for everyone's tastes."
5,"I can think of no greater compliment for Aloha Kitchen than this: the adobo in the adobo fried rice omelette reminds me of my mom's. \n\nAfter an early morning drive to Las Vegas, lunch, and a little entertainment, my wife and I had dinner at this comfortable and casual eatery. Aloha Kitchen offers a touch of the island vibe away from the hustle and bustle of the strip. Order at the counter, sit down, then wait for your meal to arrive at your table. Locals, students from nearby UNLV, and Yelp-savvy tourists populate the restaurant. \n\nThe adobo fried rice omelette is lip-smacking good. The adobo and fried rice are garlicky and flavorful, with the omelette cooked to delectable perfection. I tore through most of the enormous serving before hitting the wall about 3/4 of the way through it. I couldn't eat another bite, so I boxed it up for a late-night snack after a visit to the casinos. My wife ordered the pork kahlua and it was tender, smoky, and a huge serving. We also tried the spam musubi, which was your standard spam wrapped in rice and seaweed. Nothing remarkable, but enjoyable.\n\nAloha Kitchen offers affordable and delicious meals and it's a terrific way to get out of the casinos for an hour or two. The adobo fried rice omelette alone is worth a visit. \n\nHighly recommended."
5,"I had to get the carpets cleaned in the house I was moving out of and my neighbor referred me to these guys. All I can say is if you want to deal with true professionals, not the typical Las Vegas service company, call Noble. \nThey were on time, polite, professional and most importantly did a great job. \nWhen its time to get the carpets cleaned at my new place, I know exactly who I will be calling!"
5,Great food here.\n\nBanana Foster's Waffles (might be the best waffles I've had)\nFrench Toast (wife said it was the best french toast she's had)\nCorn Beef with hash browns (corn beef was decent but the hit were the hash browns which had some sort of caramelized onion on it)\n\nAwesome food.  We had a group of 10 (6 adults and 4 kids)
5,Tired of going to mass and not understanding the gospel? Well then this is the church for you! I honestly dislike going to church and being so lost during the gospel because the priest does not make it relatable. Father Nadim on the other hand uses real life experiences when speaking about the gospel. We also had a private mass for both my daughter's baptism and it was great! I was almost brought to tears due to the way Father Nadim explained things during the mass. He also knows how to make things funny which makes time go by fast! My husband and I fully enjoy this church and that doesn't happen often!
5,"I love Herb & Rye. I like the dark decor and last time i was there on a friday night they had a DJ in there as well.  Aviation is my favorite drink there and i don't normally leave the bar without at least three of them ;)\n\nThe food is also great there, i like the wings (hot & sweet & crispy, YUM), beef carpaccio, mussels, and the steak actually tastes good here.  Definitely order it during their happy hours, really worth it :)"
5,Good parking. Although I am upset I had to pay $1 for my 30 minute parking. But that's Scottsdale for you. Nothing is always free. Even parking. Ilove all the shops here but they could update the map of the area because they are missing new places that have opened up.
5,"Being here twice for work gathering. This place is great, the service always excellent with friendly staffs and the cook is extremely entertaning. The first time I was skeptical about the amount of food you would get for this type of place, let's put it this way I can barely finish my share. The fried rice is absolutely delicious. We always have a good time here."
5,"FIrst of the event coordinator Annie is AMAZING.  She is spunky, beautiful, and so nice.  She made me feel so welcome!  The patio at Tommy's is breath taking.  You feel like you are on an island.  The atmosphere is so calm and breezy.  \n\nThe staff welcomed me as if I was a regular.  I had this amazing steak salad called Saba Steak Salad.  And I had the Island Goat Cheese.  I can barely explain them because I will talk myself into going back there.\n\nThe steak in the salad melted in my mouth and was seasoned to perfection!  The dressing had a garlic aioli that added so much flare and flavor.  There were 3 potato coins on the side that were a great addition to the salad.   The spring mix and romaine was fresh and I was very pleased.\n\nNow to the goat cheese.  HOLY COW.  So tasty!!  It wasn't overwhelming is was perfect.  There were tortillas strips on the side that were dangerous because I really wanted a bag of them when I was done.  There was also a mango salsa with the cheese and I will admit I had a spoonful of it on its own.\n\nAs you can tell I HIGHLY recommend Tommy Bahamas.  What would be great is everyone bought tickets to the Original Taste this weekend and you can taste 36 restaurants in one event!!!"
5,"This hotel is awesome! My boyfriend and i stayed here for 3 nights. Our room was gorgeous, beds were comfortable and the WATERFALL shower is great! You get free entrance to Drai's night and beach club which is a mega plus! You get free breakfast which was delicious overall this hotel is amazing! I cant wait to go back. All the employees were so nice and helpful. The only bad thing I can say is the walls are thin so you here vibrations all night from the music at the club but that was no big deal for us."
5,The burgers are good and so are the prices. But if you really want to experience The Works skip the restaurant and sit at the bar. Introduce yourself to whoever is sitting next to you and I *guarantee you'll you have an interesting conversation. Unless you're the one who's not interesting.\n\n\n\n*I can't really guarantee anything. Wtf.
5,"The only bad thing is that I can only give 5 stars to Settebello. Carmine is an artist of the \""white art\"" and nobody else in town, even with the same (or better like due forni)  ingredients is able to do what a real italian from (around) Naples like him can do. Every pizza is a masterpiece perfectly crafted with passion with just the right tasteful amount of toppings and cooked perfectly to delight even a very sophisticated palate. \nBravissimo Carmine! A presto."
5,"One of my favorite bars ever! I love the constantly changing menu (but that long-time customers can still get their favorite \""classics\""), the quality of the drinks, the laid-back vibe (unless it's 12-2 on a saturday, then it can be super-crowded).  \n\nThings you might not know:\n1.  VEGANS- beware! Some of the drinks contain eggwhites, honey, dairy, or Campari and are not necessarily listed on the menu.  When in doubt, ask the bartender.  They're usually cool about making you a vegan version.\n\n2.  Usually the first Monday of the month is \""Mixology Monday,\"" which is a hot mess of a good time.  A guest mixologist makes 4 special cocktails to highlight the featured booze of the evening (I went for Veev Acai liqueur and .... some other stuff that I drank too much to remember what they were... but every time I've gone it's been excellent.)  \n\n3.  On weeknights, it's a great place to go with friends/ a date that you actually want to talk to because it's not too crowded, the music is not loud, and the ambiance is nice.\n\n4.  Expect to pay about $10/drink.  They also have a \""temperance menu\"" of non-alcoholic drinks that are done mixology style.  Great for  DD's, preggo's, or Mormons!"
5,"Amazing, unique, and fresh wings.  If atmosphere is important to you, then go elsewhere.  But if you are all about the food, then this is the place for you.  I dragged my lady (who loves wings) to this dive bar in the middle of nowhere.  She was very skeptical until she had a wing.  Apparently now we have to go there every Sunday for football.  Great great wings."
5,Amazing! Short rib tacos were some of the best I've had. Lunch wasn't as busy as I thought it would be. Service was excellent.
5,OMG!  My boss took me here for lunch.  You order and pay for your order 1st.  The hamburgers were to die for.  The fries were very good and flavorful.  Fried twinkee is what we got for dessert.  I loved the whole meal and will bring family and friends back for sure.  I will take pictures next time so you can see how much you get for your money.  You will NOT be disapointed.
5,"What can I say...always fabulous, every time we get off the plane, whether I'm with my Mom, my boyfriend, my friends, doesn't matter...this is where we come first! The hash is AMAZING, the service is always with a smile and efficient. The venue itself is fantastic and just all around one of my favorite Vegas restaurants."
5,"Came to this location for the first time this afternoon.\n I was impressed ,nice red,white, and black decor.\nFood was about $20.94 ,for 2 Burgers, one fry and one drink.\nWe ate it there,but outside. It was a beautiful day, so good to sit outside.\nThey even provide Peanuts on the table so while you are waiting for your food to be cooked you can enjoy cracking peanuts and eating them.\n Bathrooms were nice and clean, as I went to wash my hands before I ate.\nPlace was clean, even outside.\n\nFood was fantastic!  the bun should be toasted it would not fall apart so easily.\nFree refills on drinks. Their drink machine is very different in looks, but works great!\nFries were fantastic, we were going to get 2 but, the girl working said one was enough for 2 people. It was the regular size and it was enough for 2.\n\nWe enjoyed it and will go back again for sure."
5,"I've enjoyed this place off and on for the last few years. The only thing that kept me away was the price. It was reasonable if you wanted just dark meat teriyaki chicken & white rice. Everything else was an up charge. Well, it looks like they decided to change that. Now there are many choices included in the price. Which means, I'll be back a lot more. Spicy chicken breast bowl with brown rice & veggies is so yummy in my tummy!"
5,"I have never had bad service at this location. The food is always spot on and I am greeted with a friendly hostess. Last night I went and no one greeted me, the service was slow (because they were busy and only had three waiters on) AND I still left satisfied. Alicia really helped us out and did a great job keeping our waters full and our food came as promptly as it could. GREAT customer service will keep me coming back to this location. \nPlus THUMBS UP for the new decor!"
5,Awesome place... a bit on the expensive side but all the food is very good and so are the sweets.
5,had his croissant at Bellagio a few years ago and never forgot how good it tasted.  \ngot to relive that memory this weekend.  it was every bit as good as i remembered it.\n\nregular croissant + dub expresso\n\nBest Ever!
5,Lindo MIchoacan has received so many BEST OF LAS VEGAS awards and now they have a location in Henderson with an incredible view of the city.  It doesn't get much better than great Mexican food with a view.
5,"Fresh, \""real\"" food made by some of the nicest people in Las Vegas. Don't be put off by the location in a mall. The food is one thousand times better than what you'd find in a fancier place. The difference is in the freshness of the ingredients and the homemade quality. Try the roasted chicken with paprika and carmelized onions or the chicken skewers with rice. Also great is the Greek salad, gyro platter, and of course baklava for dessert! Support small, independent businesses like this one rather than corporate chains that care more about profits than quality. You will not be disappointed!"
5,"I am new to the area, I\nNeeded to find a good salon and hairdresser, I had seen all the great reviews about Sweet Salon so I thought I would give it a try. I love the salon it's very adorable! My stylist Paige was amazing! She new exactly what I wanted and did a great job, she has a great personality and is very stylish and adorable, they are very affordable also! Great place would totally recommend it and I will be a continued customer!"
5,"I rented a Spot GPS personal locator over the interwebs from LowerGear for a hiking trip to the Grand Canyon, Zion, Sedona, etc--- they shipped it to me where I was staying in Southern California and helped me do all of the online setup over the phone. When the trip was over, I put it back in the box and used the return label they provided to send it back. Then I got a thank you email saying they received it and that I could expect the charge to go through.\n\nSeamless!\nThey were ultra helpful on the phone and even gave me advice on where to find some specialized items that they don't carry.\n\nI wish we had a LowerGear in California, I will definitely be calling them again if I need a GPS rental or can think of anything else they can help me with. I want to give them my business!  \n\nThanks guys!!\n:)"
5,"Yes this is a local dive bar. However, it is quite good in the food dept.as well.    Came here last night for a quick dinner. Quite a lot to choose from on the menu.    My girlfriend was even able to get hot green Tea,and you would not expect that would you!    We both opted for sandwiches.  Very good, they subsitute without a problem. Our waiter was very good and our food was hot.                                                           They have a different menu speical every day of the week.    Lots of pluses here. They have 14 TV's all with differnet channels going.                        So you can't say you couldn't find anything to watch.    They have resone all the boots so they are nice and comfortable. Bathrooms are claen. Lots of  parking in the lot.....We like it!"
5,"I loved it! What a place! This is the first Chinese restaurant I've ordered from in Tempe that actually has respectable food. This will always be my first choice for delivery. The vegetables taste fresh and delicious, the chicken has just the right amount of sauce, and the rice portions are perfect as always."
5,"The Panini's are great and the brewed teas are very cheap. Less of a bar vibe more of a coffee house. Staff is very attentive. Great place for those who want a nice place to meet up to study or for those who wish to relax and have drink while playing video poker after a long double shift. BTW Mariana the Barista is awesome, I come back because of how friendly she is."
5,"Phoenix Metro Retro is a mid century modern furniture store that also specializes in Scandinavian furniture pieces. Heidi and Douglas are the owners and they are the most genuine people! They are extremely helpful and they take pride in their storefront. Their furniture is top-notch and so amazing. They work hard to bring their customers the best. \n\nHeidi Abrahamson also has her silver smithing studio out of the back of the store and her one-of-a-kind pieces are SPECTACULAR! Next time you're in, go up to the display cases and take a look for yourself. Heidi also sells vintage Scandinavian jewelry pieces. \n\nYou can get your couch, your lighting, your art and maybe even a jewelry piece or two here and you'll always leave happy!"
5,Best dentist and office in Vegas! After going through quite a few dentists after my move to Vegas I am so happy I came across this office! The staff and dentist are so friendly and genuine! I highly highly recommend this office to anyone looking for a true dentist and not someone looking to just make money from insurance companies.
5,"Unlike the previous review, I've ate here. 4-5 times, and each time I've had EXCELLENT food and service. Never had anything bad, free kids meal on the weekends with a paid adult, and the owners are extremely nice. Can't say anything bad about this place! If you're looking for a good place to eat that won't break the bank, this is the go to place."
5,"Best.Gelato.In.Vegas.  It's a must stop whenever i'm in Vegas.  Creamy, smooth consistency, delicious - AMAZING!  I've never been disappointed when I've gone, except when it's closed.\n\nI always get the same:  stracciatella and hazelnut and it's consistently good.  And reasonably priced with plenty of seating on a normal day."
5,"These donuts were the bomb! I had eaten one and a half donuts before I knew what was happening...I was in heaven! Of course I went with chocolate, but I had part of the buttermilk donut, which is to die for! Got to check this place out! I just wish they had one in my state!"
5,I love coming to Panera! Ashley Love and Luke always brighten my day. The staff here is so amazing and friendly! We have been coming for years. Great food and wonderful service!
5,"Best Thai food I've ever had. Try the Northern Thai menu...it's very different from typical Thai fare. \n\nGreat Service. Convenient Location, even if you need to take a cab. \n\nDefinitely worth going."
5,"Love, love, love this place. Dramatic entrance, outstanding food quality, super delicious taste, friendly staff and desserts that are to die for! After 10 trips to the food and dessert stations I had to stop ... I really wanted more but I couldn't. I actually ate so much I had trouble moving around lol. Anywho, definitely worth the price and easily the best buffet on the strip!\n\nMust try:\n- Chocolate crepe\n- Creme Brulee \n- Prime rib\n- Beef brisket"
5,"From the moment you walk into the theatre, you are engulfed in the environment of the show.  Not really a bad seat in the house!  There are speakers located in each of the comfy seats so you really feel involved in the show the entire time.\n\nOne of the employees gave us some interesting facts about the show and took time out to show us around!!  Thanks for the hospitality.\n\nGreat locals discount also.  Like that Cirque show alot!!"
5,Super friendly staff! They made my out of town drop in feel like home. Huge studio that can fit up to 100 students
5,"This company is fantastic, my thanks to Jose, Sergio, Luis & Francisco, all family\nmembers what a truly reliable, informative, hard working family.  They did a beautiful\njob on installing carpet, putting in tile and it was cost effective, no rip offs with this family.  What a pleasure, I would highly recommend them."
5,"After flying across the country we were hungry and as I've done in many other cities, I went in search of pho.  \n\nI ordered the pho dac biet.  The broth was not oily, and packed with flavor.  The noodles were just right and there was a generous amount of tripe and tendon."
5,"I recently purchased a Dodge Charger from Greenlight Auto and I couldn't be happier with the customer service I received.  Bill and his salesman Cody where more then helpful throughout the entire process.  Great place, great car selection and they are definitely a customer first place. I refer everyone I know to go try them out."
5,"Scrambled eggs, eggs benedict, smoked salmon, smoked trout, dragonfruit, sausage gravy and biscuits, prime rib, steak, potatoes lyonais, melon, strawberries, oatmeal with caramelized peaches and pecans, jook with shredded pork, waffle, bacon, sausage, cheese, bread, strawberry tart, chocolate cake.\n\nThose are all the things I had for ONE breakfast at the Bellagio buffet. Heavenly five stars."
5,"Red Rock Harley Davidson is the best motorcycle dealership I have ever visited.  If you want to buy a Harley-Davidson, new or used, see Jack V.  He is an outstanding, no pressure sales person.  If you need your motorcycle serviced, see Matt F.  He is knowledgeable and very informative.  \n\nIf I were in the market for another bike or when I need mine serviced, I will only go to Red Rock Harley Davidson."
5,"BEST Chinese in Charlotte! \n\nChina Palace is by far the top Chinese spot anywhere in Charlotte. Bold statement, I know. But true statement indeed! \n\nThe ambience is very classy while remaining casual. I love R&B music, and they play Chinese versions of my favorite R&B songs. They also have a couple TVs so you don't have to miss the big game over getting grub. \n\nThe food is to die for. I'm a big Sesame Chicken fan, and this is the sesame chicken by which all other sesame chickens will be judged. They have Pepsi products so all Mtn. Dew fans are appeased and their egg rolls and chips with duck sauce are great.\n\nThat doesn't even cover their service, which truly sets China Palace apart from everyone else. If you take three sips, the waiter gives you a refill. Doesn't matter how busy they are. I drink a lot of water, and my glass doesn't get as much as half of the way empty before I get a refill. Talk about attentive! In addition, everyone is as nice as possible. \n\nOne last thing. One time, I showed up with a friend who was getting an order to go. I didn't get anything that time, but they gave me free sweet tea just for waiting there. \n\nIsn't hard to see why China Palace is one of Charlotte's top restaurants."
5,"I LOVE Bosa! And to be honest, I prefer them over Dunkin Donuts! Friendly staff and delliiicciooousss donuts and cheap too! :) Their breakfast food items are really good too!!! I recommend this place for donuts over Dunkin any day if the week!"
5,I like this place! Been coming here for years. Chefs are fun and servers are friendly.  Good food and great price.  Try it.
5,"I'm in Vegas 3 or 4 times a year for work or vacation and I'm always looking for new places to eat. On vacation with my wife in September (2012), we went to Jaleo and had our minds blown!! This place is pricey, but worth it.The whole experience was amazing - the food, the service, the big open kitchen, the drinks - I can't wait to go back. Highest quality ingredients and cooked in a very unique way. Both of us are thinking we'll have to go at least 2 or 3 more times to try all the amazing dishes we saw on the menu."
5,"This place is AMAZING. Whether you do the lunch buffet or order by plate, you'll love what you get. No matter what though, you must try the mango with sticky rice. It's perfect!"
5,"My sister and I went in there after seeing their ad at LVAC. Got a gel manicure and pedicure. The prices were very fair. Gels are always a little more expensive, but for me it's worth it because it lasts longer and they rarely chip. Erin, the woman who did my nails, was really sweet and did such a great job. The experience was wonderful. I will definitely be returning. Thanks again guys!"
5,"The new owners of this place really put their heart, soul and what sounds like a few layers of skin into fixing up the place. It's been closed for quite a while. They have cleaned, painted, cleaned, renewed and cleaned the place! It's a little loud when you have many people in there, but worth the trip. There are TVs everywhere including a large center screen. The staff is friendly as well. I tried the turkey wrap, as is. They add dried cranberries to the wrap...wasn't sure how that was going to taste. After the first bite I was hooked! On the menu they have sliders (Philly cheez, burger or grilled cheese), apps, salads (including a grilled romaine salad that I've heard is to die for), sandwiches, pizza and more! There is a separate kids menu too. They are going to serve food late too - hard to find in that area. Definitely check this place out - even just to see what work was done."
5,"Doesn't look like anything special from the outside and was a bit reluctant to go in, but I'm thrilled I did. Honestly used to go here every weekend when I lived in the area. Perry makes one of the best burgers in town. I think they said they get their meat fresh from the willy st co-op every day. So delicious. Then I'd stay and fill up on relatively cheap drinks and catch the Brewers or Bucks game. They have a ton of tv's along with pool, ping pong, and darts. Perfect place if you want some good food and a place to watch the game."
5,"They were able to take on my Galaxy Note 2's broken LCD.  They lived up to their promise of time and beat everyone in town on price.  They were knowledgeable, friendly, and tested everything in front of me before I left.  Well worth the money."
5,"I love books. Absolutely love them. I don't care how advanced we get with technology i hope books never go extinct. Seriously. \n\nI loved this store and will definitely be back here...a lot. I ended up spending over an hour just walking around and checking out all the different sections and fell in love.Ended up with a handful of books that i needed to choose from but i did walk away with 3 new books that i just had to have. I love the environment here as well as the vast selection of books. If you are a book lover you will love Changing Hands, it's wonderful."
5,"The moment Pha started on my pedicure, I knew it'd be great. She was very friendly and patient. She was meticulous and took her time which makes me feel important, as a client. Yen painted my nails and she did an amazing job. I'm a perfectionist when it comes to the color covering every edge of my nails and she did just that without me mentioning a thing. This is hands down the best mani/pedi I've ever gotten. Pleasantly surprised and super happy."
5,"We've never taken advantage of their grooming services,  but the dogs who are being groomed when we are there always look happy and not stressed!\nOur little dogs fit in our kitchen sink, but I may bring our big dog for professional grooming at some point. \nOnce a month we visit Kathy and staff to pick up a bag of Fromm dog food for the kids. They love their Fromm. Another reviewer mentioned,  Fromm has a program where after you buy 12 bags, you get 1 free. Great deal!\nWe also pick up some items from the bakery section, our dogs love the peanut butter cookies. \n\nBe sure to like their Facebook page and join the email list to receive deals and coupons and be informed of special events."
5,"I always get nervous when it's time to service my car, as I don't know much about what's goin on under the hood. So I have to find professionals who I can trust, feel comfortable with. Gene is one of those guys. He's gonna lay it to me straight. If I need something  he'll say it, if not, he'll tell me not to worry about it right now. Now, That's what you need in a mechanic...the truth! Go see Gene, you'll thank me later."
5,"One of my favorite restaurants! I eat at Cornish Pasty at least once a month because the food is that good and the atmosphere is ago much fun. Everything on the menu is yummy, but the Reuben pasty is the best on the menu. Truly delish."
5,The Food and service was excellent. I left feeling highly satisfied and will absolutely be coming here again to fulfill sushi cravings. I especially recommend the calamari.
5,I love this place! Great prices and even better food. I try something different every time and am never disappointed.
5,"Pomo was an excellent choice for us to celebrate our 5 year anniversary! We went on a Saturday night around 5:30 and there was no wait. Literally 5 minutes after we walked in though we would've been waiting. The service was excellent and the owner even brought us a special anniversary treat on the house! The pizza was delicious too. The bruschetta was very different than any others I've had before. Not bad, just different. We probably wouldn't order it again. The ambiance is also very charming. We had a wonderful time!"
5,"Stayed here during the Rock N Roll Marathon weekend. \n\nMy wife and I showed up around 9am, due to an extra early morning flight. We went to the front desk expecting to have to check our bags with the bell hops but to our surprise we were checked in and got our room keys right away.\n\nOne of my favorite things about the hotel is the way the elevators are set up. I believe we were on the 26th floor and we had 4 elevators that only served 5 or 6 floors total so we never had to wait for an elevator and we did have to stop at five floors before we got to our floor.\n\nThe hotel tower is well designed and seemed surprisingly small. We were all the way at the end of the hallway but it was not a far walk to the elevator.\n\nWe had a king room which was pretty spacious. There was a sitting area and work desk and a huge entry. The bathroom was also spacious with an enclosed toilet and an oversized shower and tub. The bed was a little too soft for my liking but was comfortable. \n\nI loved the automatic shades and how everything could be controlled bedside. The blackout feature is pretty amazing and it does just that, blacks out the whole room. Perfect for sleeping in to recover from the night before."
5,"This is my go-to Starbucks, less than a block from my office.  I'm the Dutchess, actually.  They know me by name.  :)  \n\nThey tend to be busy most of the time, but the line always moves quickly.  The entire crew is so friendly and takes time to chat with customers who want to chat back.\n\nKudos to James, Derek and everyone at this location.  I hear the staff will be dismantled once the new City Scape location opens and this location shuts its doors.  Some will go to the new location, others to various other locations.  Boo!!"
5,I eat here all the time you get alot of food for a good price. The teriyaki chicken is very good. There macaroni salad is the best I've tasted out of the few island places I've had in the area. The crab puffs are also very good.
5,"Great spot to find a wide variety of records, and most other things music related! They also have guitars and amps, and everything is priced fairly. The owner is friendly and always helpful to answer any questions you may have. I mostly enjoy that they have records old and new. You're bound to find entertainment when you walk through the door!"
5,"If you're looking for a bakery in Charlotte, you really have to do some digging.  Nona's Sweets is a great find.  One word of caution: They are moving.  It's just up the street, but if you are used to them in their current location, you'll need to look for them in the new place soon.  It's in the old Hollywood Video location.\n\nAnyway, Nona's is a great little bakery offering all sorts of items for your sweet tooth, including the aforementioned \""cupcake bar\"".  I'm not much for cake, and prefer cookies, but luckily she has me covered there too.  Lots of cookies to choose from.  Feel free to go as wild as you like.\n\nAnd if you like to watch cake shows, she'll be on Platinum Weddings  in 2010.  January I think."
5,"Just wanted to put in a plug for their new food cart, on Johnson a little east of Mills. They have squash curry, mango/pineapple curry, and a few sides. This is my new favorite food cart in Madison. Fast service, good prices, and the best curries in Madison (aside from the brick and mortar locations)."
5,"The place is clean, well maintained and as a rule you don't have to wait for machines or weights. The staff is very amiable/helpful.  There are a variety of fitness levels of the patrons (beginners to buff). It strikes me the clientele are on the more mature side.  My wife does the classes and yoga (which are included in the membership).  She says he are well done.  Membership prices are reasonable.  The trainers are good but I think a bit spendy.  I have been a member of a few gyms and this one is one of the better ones. I would recommend this facility without reservation."
5,"A gorgeous cafe on a busy street in New Town.  A small patio outside to enjoy the weather, and cute cafe tables on the inside.  We had no wait even over the Xmas/New years holiday at prime lunch hour.\n\nExcellent service, very tasty lunch fare, and reasonable prices.\n\nI would definitely return here, and would try dinner or an afternoon tea as well."
5,"Toyama has two wonderful Sushi chefs (Mo & Giro) who remember you by name and offer great \""off the menu\"" selections if you request chefs choice. I highly recommend Toyama for their great rolls and sushi. They have the freshest sushi around and their wait staff is very attentive...so much better than the \""other guys\""."
5,In short...it was fantastic. I have access to many celebrity chef restaurants on the strip & Embers rates as high as any of them. Just delicious comfort food...and we left knowing there were many other menu items we would have ordered.\n\nA great locals spot. And very affordable.
5,"Listen up people! This is THE most fan friendly team in all of professional sports. Period. I'd stop my review there but you probably want to know why, or not but I'm gonna tell you anyway!\n\nEverything about this organization from top to bottom is designed for two reasons. To win, and to make the fans happy. What more could you really ask for in a sports team? The tickets are some of the most affordable in all of baseball and the players are really friendly too. This is a great group of guys that really appreciates the fans and understands how important it is to support them back. Best part of all is if you ever have and concerns or questions well Derrick Hall, the President & CEO  of the Arizona Diamondbacks is on Twitter. Just shoot him a message and he usually responds rather quickly. What other team is that intimate with their fans?!\n\nAbove all else, it's just fun to go out and have a night a the ballpark. But that's a separate review for Chase Field the venue itself. Just go out there and support your home team. They work very hard on and off the field for the fans and this community, why not go support them, your Arizona Diamondbacks and have a hot dog while your at it!"
5,"I was walking with a bunch of friends when we decided to stop in. The place was alive with music and the bartenders were great. I got to meet the owner and dance with a great group of people. To slow down and eat, they have a great outdoor patio to enjoy the night. Next time I'm in town, I am definitely stopping back."
5,"Staff is friendly and recognize you.  Great food and nice atmosphere.  Not fancy, but prefer that to a dress up type place.  Love taking family there as they can have pancakes and I can have gluten free French toast.  Wow!  Being GF sucks (food allergy not a preference), but places like this make me feel normal again.  Now a regular place we go for breakfast since moving to QC from Sacramento a month ago.   Thank you!"
5,"My wife and I ate at Ruby Tuesday Saturday night for an early Mother's Day. Even though the line was out the door we got immediate seating because we had reservations. The service was still good even though they were busy. My wife tried the seafood treo, which she loved.. I tried the new Mahi Mahi and had them blacken it. I loved it. We love the ambiance, food, and service at this Ruby Tuesdays. We keep going back because we know we can depend on them for a good meal, a good value, and good service."
5,"Mmmm so much choice and it's all completely awesome: thin crust pizzas, pastas, gnocci. Everything is done to perfection and the service is top notch. You may end up sharing a table with complete strangers, but who cares, that's totally fun! There is truly something for everyone on this menu and you cannot go wrong no matter what you pick.\n\nI had the Chef pizza: mozzarella, black olives and tomatoes; it was deeelish.\n\nBest part about Napoletana is that it's BYOW, yesssss! (There's an SAQ a 3 minute walk away, so there is no need to settle for a bottle of Chateau D\u00e9panneur.)\n\nOh yeah, and it's cash only!"
5,"Went for a Birthday party in a large group,  we had the private dining room booked.  Great quality food, a little expensive but i guess its true you get what you pay for.  Had Prawn Tempura starter and Chicken Pad Thai main course.  All very well done and presented."
5,"Words cannot express the warm welcome and friendly nature of this business.  I had the opportunity of working with \""K\"" who was knowledgable and courteous.  I had dropped my iPhone in water, and he was able to fix the phone to take it from inoperable to working flawlessly.  You are insane to go ANYWHERE else.  Great price, great people, great service.  I wish I could give it a 10/10.\n\n5/5\n\n-Doug"
5,"Hurry in and try this Ginger Cinnamon Latte!! I added carmel sauce and soy milk over ice in their large, a whopping 32oz size, Delish!! The flavor combination was amazing! I would drive out of my way any day for this place. \n\nTucked behind Fox and Hound Pub & Grill this coffee shop is small, but warm and inviting. The staff was very helpful and friendly, my barista even asked me to try this unusual concoction, upon pickup, to make sure I liked it. I was in love! I may have found my new coffee stop. \n\nComparable to *bucks pricing but has a much truer taste without the burnt espresso taste = worth it! They also have a convenient drive up window. (Yay! now I can pickup this coffee goodness in my pjs!)"
5,"This place makes the best latte I've ever had. I miss it so much after I graduated. Hot/iced latte, macchiato, berry tart, sfogliatelle are my favorite~"
5,"Great food! Great service! Great atmosphere...99% of the time. The bar can get loud and obnoxious. If the bar is full, avoid it. The dining area is very nice. Order a cheese crisp and a beer. This place does Mexican comfort food right!"
5,"This is the only place I go for massages anymore. The way this works is a bit different, so I wanted to explain. You need to wear loose fitting, comfortable clothing, as this is a clothed massage. I wear yoga pants and a T-shirt. They soak your feet and you get a full massage and the price is UNBELIEVABLE. What I love is you can call this place and make an appointment for an hour later. I have never called and been told I couldn't get in. They have several people working there and are eager to work. I love this place. Janet"
5,"This place kicks ass. Kudos for the buffet and various assortments in baklava!  Perfectly cooked gyro meat, however their hummus is typically overblended to the point of pure cream. BUT that didn't kill my appetite or anything. Great value for the $$, they are very generous with portion size. I love this place. And it's not overly popular (read: crowded) as other places. I would totally recommend this for lunch hour, a quick takeout for movie night, or dinner. I am looking forward to my next visit here."
5,"This is one of my favorite places in the valley - there's always something new here, and it's big enough that I don't often get to walk the entire thing in one visit. \n\nIf you visit often, I recommend a membership. $75 gets you in for free, but the $200 level gets you invited to all 4 private exhibition event evenings.  The $100 level gets you invited to two. \n\nThey host frequent lectures and all kinds of interesting events. You can always find something  going on, on their calendar.\n\nSome of the permanent collection I am very fond of... Seeing the same exhibitions a bunch of times is kind of like visiting an old friend. There is always something new to appreciate. The rotating and visiting exhibits are always well presented, as well. \n\nArcadia Farms is a fantastic place to eat, the healthy slow food really fits. I mean, what do they serve at the Met in NY? They have a shitty cafeteria. We have Arcadia Farm bitches! OK so the Met has a huge Egyptian temple and Dutch masters paintings, but we have this weird reflective black plastic concave/convex thing and a dark room full of hanging LED's and mirrors. \n\nThere is more culture in Phoenix than the out of date yogurt in your fridge!"
5,"Shady, dirty, dark, and stinky. On the plus side, they do have cheap tables. But despite all that, you come here for  that $1 monster of a hot dog. Five stars for inspiring margarita-drunk ladies to pose promiscuously with this delicacy."
5,"Well tonight I will be going to bed early.  Thanks to the unbelievable dinner I had last night at Basil 'N Lime.  I woke up at the crack of dawn to the reminder of the delicious leftovers that were calling to me from my refrigerator.  This quaint establishment is enormous in flavor.  The fresh vegetables were saut\u00e9ed yet crisp, the meat was as tender as eating cotton candy.  Starting out with the eclectic plate of appetizers was a trip to heaven.  The spice rating is a scale from 1-5.  I always treat my spice ratio as if I'm putting together an outfit.  In the words of the famous fashion designer Coco Channel...it is easier to add than take away.  The entrees were ordered as a  three.  The delectable flavor of the food was not hidden in the heat.  I can't wait to go back and enjoy more of their tempting choices.  The restaurant does not serve alcohol.  Which is a blessing in disguise.  You would not want any of your senses denied the aroma, taste and presentation of this restaurant.  I highly recommend the Thai Iced Tea.   To top it all off, I can sleep sounding because I know that their Garlic Beef is only a phone call away because they do deliver.  My hat's off to you, Chef Moo and your staff."
5,"I don't use 5 stars, but this place deserves every one of them!\n\nWithout question the best food for your money you can eat in Las Vegas, assuming you like japanese food (and I don't mean terriyaki beef).\n\nI have had nothing there that was not great.  Notables are:\n\nDaily Specials\n\nTofu, both fresh and fried\n\nDuck, get like 3 of them.\n\nFoie Gras.\n\nPork Cheek.\n\nShishito peppers.\n\nMy favorite is this cold dish, it's a bowl with egg, roe and uni.  Not sure what it's called, but if they have the uni, it's a treat.\n\nOrder everything, especially the daily specials. Make reservations or show up late, but not too late as they have essentially two waves of busy. From 7 to 9 and from 11 to 2am. So you can usually drop in around 9 to 10, otherwise you'll want a reservation. \n\nI will miss few things about las vegas, this is without question, the top of that list."
5,"This place was amazing! I loved the decor, it felt very warm and welcoming. I don't know why people are giving this place such a bad review. This is going to by our new spot for dates and dinner. We were so happy with how friendly our server was we gave him a $20 tip. That never happens."
5,Fantastic! Bulgarian food is always delicious but these cooks go above and beyond to bring back childhood memories. I left feeling so satisfied! On top of all this the service was impeccable. \nIf you are looking for fast food go somewhere else because all the food was made fresh right after you order. Perfect for socializing with friends around big plates of delicious memories!
5,"This is easily a 5, I laughed from beginning to end.  People have to realize this is a small show and please don't expect something like Ka.  It's an intimate show and it's charming and you gotta go in with a positive attitude.  \n\nI could not stop laughing at the Twigglers (sp?)  These were the dancers that were pretending to be short singing the Village People and doing tricks.  Even thinking about their facial expressions makes me laugh right now. \n\nThe host is great and he does some pretty cool tricks of his own.  There was a bowling ball juggling moment that I jumped out of my seat, as well as a rope stunt over the audience that I thought someone was going to fall on the audience.  Well done!\n\nVery entertaining, get your local discount, have fun.  Similar to Absinthe, way less raunchy.  Definitely fit to take adults and kids."
5,"After 4 years on the University of Illinois campus, I have never found a place that does an exceptional job of eyebrow waxing- until today. \nMary Kay listened to my requests and concerns about my eyebrows, and proceeded to give me an eyebrow wax based off of the structure of my face. I am more than happy with the results and I will continue to come back to Mary Kay's for further treatments. \nHer prices are very reasonable for the services she offers. Seriously, check this place out!"
5,"Now, I am very hesitant to give a dentist 5 stars.  I mean if I was rating dentists as a whole, I would give them negative stars.  I have gone to a *lot* of dentists in my day and would never have considered giving one above 3 stars.  Then, I met Dr. Wyatt.  \n\nFirst, his helpers are super helpful and friendly.  They are nice and sometimes when they ask a question, they actually take the tools out of your mouth for you to answer!\n\nSecond, Dr. Wyatt himself follows suit and is nice.  Even when you have issues he's nice about it.  He doesn't lecture or raise his voice or even seem angry that you don't do something, like oh floss all the time...  He truly seems like he wants you to have a happy, healthy smile, not like he is frustrated with your behavior.\n\nLastly, his office is called \""Reel Dental\"" and they have a movie theme.  Though somewhat cheesy, it's nice to have movies on in the waiting room and such.  Rumor has it that when you go in for long dental work, which I never have, you can watch a movie while it's done!  Anything to take your mind of the fact you're in a dentist chair is great.\n\nOh, and for the ladies, he's quite easy on the eyes to look at while being worked on!"
5,"I totally understand this is a hate it or love it place. Well I love it! It's really small so no matter where you stand you have a good view. And the sound system is pretty good. Drinks are reasonably priced, and made really strong which is nice. Get some pre-show pizza it's really yummy for 3 bucks a slice!"
5,"this is easily my favourite place to eat in montreal, let alone the best thai i've ever had. everytime i order a veggie pad thai elsewhere, i constantly compare it to bangkok and how i'd just rather be sitting in that depressing foodcourt."
5,Amazing customer service. These guys know what they are doing. I would give them 10 stars if I could! Highly recommend.
5,"Hella cute lil place! My sister and I shared a couple desserts: strawberry snow fluff & peanut butter honey toast - both were DELICIOUS! The staff was friendly and flexible with our snow fluff order (strawberry snow fluff with mango & lychee - oh my! lol). The dining room is cute and there's board games too. If you check in on Yelp, you'll get 15% off. Win win win =D"
5,"We are in from Texas and happened upon WhereUBean and were pleasantly surprised. Great little coffee shop! Clean, comfy, and nice staff!!! The coffee is very good, according to my very picky friend and their new chai tea is delicious!!! If we're ever in Phoenix again, we will definitely visit again!!!"
5,"added the lengua taco to the tried list today -- wow -- so delicious...\n\ndon't know what Gabriel is talking about fried fish -- their fish is only served as cocktails or on the half shell (oysters) -- no fish tacos -- nothing fried.  And the cashier always speaks english -- she has to since she runs the drive thru, too -- \n\nYes, there aren't that many white folk -- but that's fine with me -- Took my 72 year old white mother for tongue and pastor tacos -- and to share a shrimp cocktail, with watermelon juice --   tears, people, tears, it was so good...   I keep looking for flaws, but there just aren't any."
5,"I've been following Pinkberry for awhile and anxiously awaited for their expansion to the East coast.  So when I heard they opened a new store in Charlotte over by Southpark (Phillips Place), I had to check it out.  My first time experience was fantastic.  The girls working the counter were energetic, friendly and very helpful.  After some samples, I went with the coconut yogurt, raspberry, pineapple, chocolate crisps and yogurt chips.  It was absolutely awesome and I can't wait to do it again."
5,"In vegas, every restaurant is pretty good... but N9NE does it better with little things... things like the best atmostphere, a simple menu where they focus on things they can do well, smores, one of the best and freshest seafood platters I've ever had, etc. etc."
5,"Chef Xavier is a wonderful ambassador to the world of raw food.  The food is tasty, fresh and delicious.  He recommends going to the cafe website to look at the menu, and calling ahead to place your order, so that it can be ready for you upon arrival.  Or, if you pop in on the spur of the moment, you can select something fresh from the deli case.  For those who want help improving the nutrition in their diet, he offers a smoothie program.  He makes a delicious smoothie called \""The Works\"" that contains many different vegetables but tastes absolutely delicious and refreshing."
5,"A daily must when I work from my downtown office location, Simpatico has great prices and the service is great.\n\nThe fact that they are inside of the old alcoa building may result in them having less foot traffic than a Starbucks or Crazy Mocha, but the service and quality produced make Simpatico a gem among downtown coffee locations.\n\nP.S. Free internet available in the lobby too."
5,"*** Breakfast review ***\n\nSimple formula for the 5 star review here --- superb setting and a legendary huevos rancheros. \n\nAs someone said -- \""This is simply the best outdoor place to eat in Vegas....the decor is relaxing, fresh, pool side, green, so soothing!!\""\n\nIndeed. So relaxing, fresh, clean, quiet --- a stark contrast to the rest of Vegas.\n\nThe coffee was perfect and I am a picky coffee person. Service was good and not in your face at all. But the best part was the main.\n\nHuevos rancheros. A relatively straightforward dish. Made differently at a lot of places. But this sets the standard. The plate came out piping hot, the flavors mixed together so well, and the presentation was superb.\n\nLet me put it this way --- I eat out a LOT and am blessed to try some amazing places. I rarely have something I remember vividly later. The duck at the Modern in NYC, the cashew chicken at Ryutenmon Tokyo, the sushi at Kaygetsu here in in Menlo Park --- and now the huevos rancheros at Verandah Vegas. Well done guys, thank you for a great meal."
5,"It was a great hotel. It's not luxury but it was very quiet and clean. The staff was nice and very helpful, I would stay here again. You are around the corner from the strip so it's perfect and a mile from the convention center. It's super cheap too, can't beat it."
5,"Went here for happy hour and sat in the cantina, chips and salsa were delivered immediately and were delicious. Our server was kind and on top of it. The meal I got seemed a little over cooked but besides that everything was delicious and their happy hour prices were great."
5,"-This place has totally redeemed its name from my previous visit to the Boca Park location. Amazing pizza, to make a long story short, and a pretty decent beer selection. Even more so in the wine department, unfortunately I have not totally educated my pallate in alot of red varietals, but I know any wino would appreciate such a vast collection.\nChinedu (I hope I spelled that right) was more than willing to help me find a suitable wine, but we were kind of in a rush to visit a friend and see a show. Got to shake hands with Joe, the regional manager, if I recall correctly. The man knows what he is doing when it comes to expanding.\nThis will definitely be a new pizza spot for me, especially because they have traditional, white and pesto options.. not to mention it is so close to my work. Thumbs up, all the way around... Congrats on the new and soon to come locations :)"
5,"When it comes to airport food, there generally aren't many great options. It's usually a mixture of chain restaurant or something of equal or lesser quality. Then there's Beaudevin.\n\nI don't know where this place came from. I can't even find a website. It's almost like it was quietly placed here by a divine Airport God as our reward for dealing with TSA's across the lands. This is easily the best and fanciest place I've eaten at Any airport. \n\nI ordered a bagel with a side of all the necessary ingredients for a lox bagel combination creation (herbed cream cheese, capers, red onions, tomatoes and smoked salmon). Everything tasted fresh enough for my liking. The salmon was great. Mind. Blown. \n\nIf you're flying into Charlotte and have some time to spare, check it out. I read they also have one in Chicago O' Hare and Miami. Travelers rejoice!"
5,"I have been here five weekends in a row and last weekend I didn't, only because I was out of town.  No matter...I'll be back on my ramen kick starting up again this weekend, woohoo!\n\nI have not been able to stray away from the tonkotsu-shoyu ramen with char shu (pork), nitamago (egg) and nori (seaweed.)  I've ordered and enjoyed it every single time.\n\nSee you again this weekend Monta!"
5,"I'm always disappointed in my pedicure massages ... Until today! Mai gave what was HANDS DOWN the best pedicure and massage I've experienced! Just got the basic standard pedicure and the massage seemed to never end and was firm but not painful and sooo relaxing! Amazing place! 25 minutes from my home and 10,000 places I could go in between but ill be making the drive regularly! Totally worth it!!!"
5,"Everything here is amazing. Their pizza is bomb, its not on the menu anymore but ask for the kale pizza its to dieee for. Their turkey lasagna is also my go to. Their flavored margerita's are also really good...... and i dont even like margaritas. that is all."
5,"I have a client that had mentioned this place a couple times as one of her favorite restaurants. I recently made it in myself and had a great experience. Noah was our server, he made great suggestions and was totally patient with us, GREAT service! We started with the Blood Orange margarita's that were amazing! Followed those with the tableside guacamole that was equally fantastic. I had the fish tacos... they blew Wahoo's out of the water, plus the presentation was beautiful. To finish out the night we had the pumpkin bread pudding and the chocolate dessert of the evening... Unbelievable! I am so glad I don't live closer or I would eat the bread pudding every day! This is a great place for food, ambiance and service with friends or for date night. Noah mentioned their brunch and I hope to check that out too! Love it!"
5,"This is the best breakfast spot on the strip!  The potions are HUGE. I'm a big eater and my wife and I could share the chicken and waffles. Biscuits and gravy is good too.  We had a large party, but the service great.  We know that large parties can be difficult to please.  Scott ( young red head guy) was EXCELLENT! He even checked on us the next day even though we weren't sitting in his section.  If you come to Vegas you have to eat here!"
5,"This place is super delicious! Customer service is great, and the food is awesome. Simple, and delicious. \n\nI've tried basically everything on the menu, super yum. Pork tenderloins my fave! Level is usually 5, and its not bad at all. \n\nThey even got specials and side items around the restaurant. Look out what they are and try em too!"
5,"Looking for Sex On The Beach? Don't waste your time Nancy Boy! This is one of the best Cocktail Joints in town, that's for sure. I use it as the turning point in my night out, the mid point in the Tim J Drinker's Guide to Edinburgh - its the final farewell to classy drinking (and its all down hill from there).\n\nThese guys know their stuff, with a very particular drinks list, the decor and 'uniform' of the staff demonstrate a 100% commitment to providing a quirky-kitsch cocktail Nirvana! They have been recognised throughout the bar trade for being at the top of their game.\n\nTea cups have been trendy for a while, but these guys are no newcomers, so don't knock them for being in amongst it. You wont get a pineapple filled with pina colada, but if you ask them for a straight forward mojito or an old fashioned it will complete you. I, however, prefer to go for something straight from their list, some of which will smack you in the face and make sure you are standing to attention. \n\nTip from the professional drinker, always buy a beer chaser to maintain your rhythm, perfection takes time, and if you drink these the same way you would a straight up spirit and mixer, you will be carried out the back door....\n\nIts a very small snuggle of a place, I prefer to find a ledge to stand at as the couches will eat your sexy ass alive..."
5,"I had the best burger in this place, it's awesome, the waiters there are so friendly, elegant atmosphere, great place and reasonable prices"
5,"I loved this place.  Our son, Andrew, and girlfriend, Sara, took us here to enjoy a wonderful breakfast on our recent trip to Wisconsin.... Everything they had here was delicious and I hope to get a chance to go back some day.  It was definitely worth the wait to get in.  I had the strawberry pancakes with marscapone cheese and I will dream about it now."
5,The Doc fixed my eye & the staff rocks... you all get out of Jail for free... Maricopa County Jail only.
5,"Fabulous.  Fantastic.  A group of six. 4 of the six had the trio of Elk, Beef, Bison and loved it.  I had the flat iron special.  Fantastic.  Only complaint - the beet salad was very LIGHT on beets - but they were fantastic.  I could have done without the cabbage piece of it - very nondescript - but the beets were fantastic.  Also, we were celebrating a birthday and brought a bottle of wine as a gift - not to share at the meal, but as a gift.  We weren't allowed to bring it in - I'm hoping it was liquor laws that forbade it.  If we had it in a bag or wrapped - it wouldn't have been a problem.  interesting.  But overall - a great meal!  Highly recommended."
5,Every time I go to Vegas I have to come to the Gun Store. It's so fun to be able to shoot guns you can't shoot legally. My husband was able to try out an AK-47. He shot other ones but I forget the names. (girl sorry) They have awesome packages at really reasonable prices. Each package come with a free t-shirt too! A taxi ride to get here from the strip is pretty expensive. The first time we came here the taxi was around $30 each way from the strip. The last time we came we just drove here in our car. There's plenty of parking. All the employees are very helpful and they help you every step of the way. Highly recommend the Gun Store.
5,"Great selection and wide variety with good prices make this my new favorite Asian/international market in Madison! Store and items were clean and fresh. Variety of ethnicities-- I went home with Jamaican, Mexican, Indian, Arab, Thai, and Chinese foods/products in my bags! Near downtown and very close to the beltline make it easy to access, even if you're coming from out of town. Seems like the strip mall and library which share a parking lot with Yue-Wah has all been recently updated. Looks nice."
5,"Southern BBQ has finally come to Verdun!\n\nWhile Black Strap sits on the same digs as the recently-vacated-and-still-mourned Casa Manolo, the ambiance is completely different. First off, it's extremely informal, the way BBQ should be, with rolls of brown towel paper on each table, service is very friendly and casual. The two large tables up front look like gigantic picnic tables.\n\nThen there is the food! OMG Reader! This is probably one of the few places in Montreal that finally has gotten American  Southern BBQ right and done the right way. No disgusting drippy sauces and coating of brown sugar like Bar B Barn. No half-assed attempt at \""faux\"" BBQ like Bofinger. The got the smoking, the got the rub, they got it all right. Prices are also very reasonable and the place has a virtual line up almost every night. (Please for the love of God, stay in Verdun!).\n\nThey literally just opened up a few weeks back so I'm guessing there may be new additions to their menu, because for the moment there are no desserts. If they do it, do it all the way! Bring on the Shoofly Pie, Sweet Potato Pie, Red Velvet Cake, Hummingbird Cake, Peach Cobbler, sun brewed iced tea and Mint Juleps!"
5,"Every time I leave Vegas to go home, this is where I eat.\n\nFriendly restaurant for crepe lovers.  I try to find a crepe eatery every city I visit; this is my favorite for Vegas."
5,"Line to get a ticket is long, but moves surprisingly fast. I like the method of different tickets for different needs. It expedites the process. Friday is really busy. They have a tv."
5,"I go here at least 1 a week with my wife.  I get the meatball Pho along with the BBQ pork Bahn Mi.  The food is great, cheap, and quick.  The staff is friendly, not in your typically way, but they do a good job.  Da Vang has become of my favorite places period in Phoenix."
5,"After getting in at 5:00am, I stumbled down to the cafe to grab something quick. I was sat down, Omar was my waiter and suggested the Lobster Eggs Benedict. I am so glad I took him up on his suggestion. My dish was the best breakfast I have ever eaten. Bomb.com!!!! So amazing!!!"
5,"Incredible, try the sliders, ham and cheese crouquetes, stuffed dates, and anything else that looks interesting to you, can't go wrong.  The mojitos are delicious too and come by the pitcher if you want.  Just a great fun delicious place and for the prices you can't go wrong.  Every one I have ever taken here loves it and I have taken more than a few."
5,"After playing eenie meenie minne mhhhoo, I weeded Butters over 5 other breakfast restaurant. It was a little whiles away, but I am sooo happy we chose it! Our server was Rafael. Cool, calm, collected, took our order, gave me some good highlights of the menu.\n\nFood came, literally within 10 minutes, and we were diggin' in. I ordered the chorizo omelette, chedder grits,  and it also came with pancakes. I never had chorizo omelette, so I wasn't sure what I was getting into, it is a tad oily, but that is from the chorizo, however the veggies and egg balanced it out. CHEDDER GRITS delicious! My boyfriend stealth the rest. I cried. Pancakes, fluffy, buttery, melts in your mouth- probably the best set of pancakes ever. I ate it all. Then I cried. \n\nWe don't quite live in the area, so I am quite bummed that we'd will probably never have Butters again. It was a great choice for us, we enjoyed the service and food. Thanks Butters!"
5,"I treated the husband for a birthday staycation this weekend. The staff was great from all angles. We got picked up in the parking lot by the golf cart driver to bring us to the lobby. The front desk had a seamless and simple check-in. The concierge was very helpful in answering my questions regarding transportation options into Old Town (I didn't want to worry about having some cocktails and driving back). Of note: their towncars will drop you off anywhere in Old Town for $21. \nTheir rooms are so pretty-I really love the simple, modern, sleek style. We didn't get to take advantage of the Release Pool Party this time around as it was raining, but it's free for hotel guests. Nice views of the desert too from our room."
5,"This place rocks.  Super friendly.  Not just fake friendly; really.  I am sitting here in the lobby working and one of the hotel staff came up and offered me cookies.   The place is clean; the meals are nice; it feels safe;  nice business center to print and fax documents; good fitness center and cut-rate daily passes to LA Fitness next door; very convenient; good laundry machines.   Even our kitty cat likes it.  Being out of your house because it is flooded and needs repair is no fun, but this places has made life much better."
5,"I knew that the next time I came to Montreal I was going to pop my Garde Manger cherry.\n\nMy first time was everything I had hoped for, and more!\n\nWe made a reservation (smart idea), and were seated right away at the bar. Perfect place to sit for a small group of 2 or 3! \n\nMust have - Lobster Poutine. One might think this is probably Chuck Hughes' most overrated dish...but trust me, it was well due the accolades! Absolutely delicious. Poutine with just the right amount of \""fishiness\"" added to the gravy, curds, and frites. We also had the Albacore Tuna and Crackling Pork (equally amazing) and the Pierogies & Pork Belly (yum). \n\nService was great. Ambience was perfect. \n\nIt's a great feeling when a restaurant can live up to high expectations! I can't wait to come back again and try other items!\n\nC'est tres tres bonne!!!!!"
5,Great food. Reasonable prices. Very friendly. We were looking for a relatively quick lunch place and this hit the spot perfectly. We would definitely come back.
5,"Great service every time. Always seem to have what we need. Today I took in 5 watches. Normally I go to another place for watch batteries that might be a little cheaper, but lately I was having trouble getting there before closing time. This place is open til 8pm on weekdays and 7pm on Saturdays!  Even 10-5pm on Sundays!!  This is great news."
5,"My husband and I have a slip here and are members. We love this marina and its laid back atmosphere. The only downfall to this marina is the long walkway if the shuttle service is busy but you are more than welcome to wait. They do have call boxes for the golf cart shuttles at each end of the walkway. Being a member you have access to private showers and bathrooms, a bbq area thats shaded with tables and chairs, washers and dryers, power and water hookups, 2 free bags of ice daily etc.. Love the staff. All of them are friendly and helpful. The whole marina and docks have the feel of one big happy family. Never have had any issues with theft etc. Definetly laid back with the exception of the party weekends lol.. I reccomend this marina over Scorpion Bay Marina based solely on how laid back and personable Pleasant Harbor is. I have been to Scorpion Bay Marina a few times and things just seem a bit more uptight over there. Not to mention the cops that seem to consistently be driving around. Just an uneasy feeling all around for me. If you plan to get a slip here make sure to talk to Shannon. She knows her stuff. :)"
5,"Body Heat has kick started my fitness like no other workout facility has done before. I have started running, cross training, and  overall fallen in love with fitness. I am in love with with the classes and yes they are all Hot. The facility is very pretty and well kept, at times I wish there was a little more emphasis on sanitization but that's just me. \n\nI never thought I would love yoga but it has become the best part of my day. I also enjoy the hot Pilates, kettlebells, and bootcamp classes. Their candlelight class is a great way to unwind on Friday nights after a hectic week. Body Heat has become my sanctuary."
5,"Since there's over 200 reviews before mine, I'll keep it short.\n\nCibo is a cool place, with hip customers and an emphasis on quality.  The bruschetta appetizer is a winner.  See pic. Try to save room for the crepe desserts."
5,Great food and fun classy atmosphere. I love the menu because there is something for everyone. Everything I've tried has been good but my favorite is rice pudding with Turkish coffee. And the hookah lounge is a great place to hang out with friends after dinner.
5,This is the best dry cleaner I have found. They do a great job and have a very convenient pick up service. Their representatives are always professional and courteous. I would recommend them to anyone.
5,i have been getting my hair cut here for 15 years.  Marjorie is amazing and priceless.  I am as picky about my hairstylist as i am my dentist or doctor.  I travel extensively for work and get compliments no matter where i travel.  Wouldn't go anywhere else!
5,Hands down the most delicious prosciutto sandwich I've ever had!  I came here for lunch and had the most delicious meal ever!  \nThey make their bread and it's so light and crispy- so worth the $$$ and trip!  My meal was about $9 for lunch.\n\nStaff was friendly and quick.  They even have valet for your car!  This place is a house turned into a restaurant.  Very clean and I would 100% recommend this place!  Can't wait to come back!!!!!  Might be my go to Friday lunch spot!  \n\nYou won't be disappointed you came!
5,"New to Vegas, I picked this place solely because it was close and convenient. What a great surprise! We just got pizza to go but it was some of the best I've had; hot, fresh ingredients and perfect thin crust. Will definitely be eating here again!"
5,Just got my brows and lip done and all I have to say is wow!! Totally professional environment and so modern inside. I have really weird shaped eyebrows that pose a challenge for many estheticians but they were shaped perfectly here. My esthetician (forgot her name I'm sorry) even showed me how to correctly fill them in afterward. Reasonably priced for such a great job!
5,"We had the best Thanksgiving dinner at Arizona Charlie's buffet!  Fabulous stuffing, real mashed potatoe, great desserts!  No mess to clean up at home!  Thank you for working on this holiday and for making such good food!"
5,All the food is awesome and most of it is homemade... Definitely not freezer food. Bartenders are super friendly. Beer selection is always changing and always above average. Awesome happy hour deals. Overall good atmosphere. Highly recommend it for drinking AND eating.
5,I was shopping around in the area for quality laminate flooring for my new home. I decided to go with TLC because of the quality service Ramin provided. He was very honest with his products and very knowledgable. My mother wanted to install hardwood flooring but he explained the pros and cons of it. We went with laminate flooring instead because he explained that hardwood flooring is not ideal in Las Vegas because of the dry climate. I did not know that!!! We went with the Shaw laminate flooring. He gave us a good deal. 1.89 per sq ft for Shaw laminate flooring and that included the padding!!! I did not go with chinese made laminate or home depots because of the quality. TLC has good quality products for a great price!!\n\nThanks Ramin for all your help. I love my floors.
5,"We just returned from dining at Al Hamra with friends and had to comment on the great meal and service we had.  Mario, our waiter, was knowledgeable and friendly.  Our orders came promptly and all were excellent.  We ordered the samosas and onion paneer for appetizers.  We had the shrimp vindaloo, the chicken with coconut, the chicken curry and the eggplant dish along with aloo naan and mango chutney.  All had the right amount of spice as ordered and were tender and very tasty.  It's been several years since we dined at Al Hamra but we will definitely go back."
5,"I have been visiting my 80yo friend and neighbor for almost a month now here. \nCompared to TLC in Henderson,  this place is heaven sent.\nMost of the staff says hello and express interest in my friend's concerns and needs all the time. I can see that this rehab center helps the resident to progress and they never give up on them. The Staff are very patient, kind, and self motivated in doing their job. Kudos to Mike in P.T., Jackie in nurse aides,  and more.\nThank you for having standards that most rehabs dont."
5,I am not a great golfer by any means. But i do love the sport. this course is great for beginners and good golfers alike. It's wide open with few houses in a hittable location unless you REALLY get a hold and slice or pull badly. water is a recurring nightmare and provides some good challenges. Greens were in pretty good shape. not perfect but compared to other courses for under 50 dollars a round I haven't found any better. \n\nThe part that sets this place a part from courses i go to is the employees and service. from the clubhouse counter all the way through to the food service were the best I've experienced.  ll actually have starters rolling around DOING their job and pushing the very slow groups along. My green fee included some draft beers and some food which i didn't plan on. and to top it off unlimited range balls. It was the best Saturday of golf I've had in Vegas.
5,"I have finally found my groomer!! This place is absolutely amazing. The service here is TOP quality.. Absolutely no complaints.  I always schedule my appointments with Addie. With her work, you can definitely see how much she cares. My Yorkie, Preston, was given the best hair cut he has even seen. My Yorkie-Poo's hair cut was spot on. She cut his hair right on the very first time... It literally took my last groomer 3 attempts before she finally gave me what I wanted. \n\nIf you're in the market for a new groomer, for whatever reason, I highly recommend you trying this place out. I can call in the morning and they can get me in the same day. If I need a quick nail trimming, all I do is stop in and they will take a quick break to trim the nails. Support this locally owned and operated salon - you'll be so happy that you did :)"
5,"I do get my nails done here and there.. when I feel like it. However, this is the ONLY place i have been where the have the newest up to date acrylics: shimmer-sparkles- AND colors OH MY! to choose from. I recently moved and still keep in contact to say hello with my girl. SHE MADE MY NAILS LOOK LIKE SHINY JEWELS!!!  The Price is fair for the precise and neat work that is done. Around $35/40 (new) depending. I usually would get a shimmer acrylic on the tips then would fill later. No second thoughts.. if you walk in its worth the wait. :) I have recommended MANY friends here. Nails would never pop off, i would ask to soak or drill down to take off."
5,"Don't get scared of the line! It's so worth it! The hot links are fantastic, and the green beans are done so well even a veggie hater will eat them."
5,"HTC is tops!!!  \n\nGot an anchor done by Marilyn.  She did a beautiful job!  It was super quick and painless.  \n\nTwo weeks later I went back because I was being a little paranoid.  I spoke with Jon this time and he was super amazing!  And, then there is also Anthony who is very kind, informative and pleasant!!!  And, yes I was just being paranoid...  But, both Jon and Anthony made me feel a million times better :-)\n\nThey have all been superb to deal with and I can't wait to go back for some more additions.  \n\nI will NOT go anywhere else!  You will be in very safe and educated hands!!!"
5,"Awesome burgers!! Delicious and made to order. Drinks are on point. Cute bar ambiance with friendly customer service and managers greeted me with a smile. For a bar, it will exceed expectations and the beer and burgers won't disappoint you."
5,"I hired Skyler and the Myriad team for their Real Estate Investment advisory services and it continues to put a positive cash flow in my bank every month!! I knew I wanted to invest in real estate but there were so many different options and opinions. It seemed like everyone I talked to was their own personal expert and quite frankly it was overwhelming and stressful. Skyler and his team were a breath of fresh air! These guys were young but experienced. Smart but fun! And most importantly, they were laser focused on producing results. They helped me analyze my current situation, understand the risks and rewards with different real estate investment scenarios and most importantly, taught me how to understand the numbers. It made me look at real estate in an entirely new way, \""passive income!\"" My recommendation? Use them today, or regret not doing it tomorrow."
5,"You will have to pay a lot to hang here, but if you are in Scottsdale, definitely one of the top places to stay!  The pool is great, and the constant ice water, great food service is great.  Its near impossible to get a room that has a great mountain view and even if you do you are quite a ways away from the pool.  The casitas close to the pool are really  nice, like little condos, and most have nice sliding doors out to the pool area.  The grounds are gorgeous and the place really is worth it.  Be sure and use the hotel's car service to take you up to the hiking trail.  Great Scottsdale Haven."
5,"We went here after golfing and all of us though this place was great. We're from Phoenix and only wish this place was closer. Service was very accommodating and attentive and the food was fresh, hot and very delicious. Prices were right too! The next time were in the area, we would return for sure."
5,"Dinner buffet price is up to like $37/person now and wait on a Friday night at 5PM was non existent.  \n\nOur waitress was A-mazing!!!  My brother liked the tea so much that he asked what it was.  Not did she just tell him what it was but she went out of her way to find and write down the distributor name, website, and product flavor name (it was actually a papaya tea by China Mist).  She also noted that they were just testing out the tea and may or may not continue to serve it in the future but the response from customers has been highly positive.\n\nSome new favorite foods this time around to add to the must get list when you come to the Wynn Buffet:\n1) Chilean seabass (they didn't have this the first time I came here and I'm a big fish lover so you usually don't see this kind of fish served often)\n2) Spicy tuna hand rolls\n3) Some kind of buffalo salad\n4) Mushrooms (marinated in a delicious sauce)\n5) Key lime pie (I didn't like it before, now I do)"
5,"Stopped by with my friend after work for the first time a few weeks ago. Not a HUGE coffee drinker but I love teas. I ordered a hot chai latte so that I could get a fancy design. I asked the nice lady at the register if they are able to make designs and she reassured me that that they can. Once I picked up my drink I was highly disappointed! There wasn't a design!! I spoke with the barista and he said they never make designs for chai tea lattes. What a let down. But such is life. \n\nI took a lovely pic of my friends fancy design and was content. We say up stairs at the loft like section. I adored the writings on the walls and the library if real encyclopedias.  \n\nI almost forgot to mention the yummy gluten free cookie and macaroons I had as well. In love with the decor, chai latte was yummy, and the gluten free treats were a huge plus! Its a bit pricey but a nice place stop by to change it up a bit. I will def be returning!"
5,"Dear Hotel Chocolat\n\nI want you to know I dreamed about you last night, I think I might be in love.\n\nyours,\n\nJd\n\n...........But really what an awesome shop. Was lucky enough to be there last night for a tasting that was free but I still ended up spending \u00a330 on things to take home with me.\n\nStaff are great, welcoming, banterous and inlove with what they are selling. Was treated to a great avriety of their treats my favourite being a chilli caramel!! Nom!!!!\n\nTheir Cocoa-coffee shop at the back is inspired - loved my wee machiato.\n\nVery much looking fwd to cooking with the cocoa meat rub. This place is a palace of chocolate and a must visit for anyone!!! :o)"
5,"It's not Red Lobster , and that's why I go there. Clean bathrooms , friendly waitresses , (freakin' hot guy waiters  ;)   , tasty BBQ , happy hour is amazing there. Not too keen on the live bands , but i still love it."
5,Love this place! Lettuce wraps amazing! Egg rolls so good! Love the passion tea! Good service good food good times. This location is not as busy as some of the others so it's a great place on a Friday night!
5,"Ambiance is amazing....very Zen, without being too Zen-y.  The massage rooms are bliss, iPods with playlists to be chosen by the client, something gorgeous to look at (flowers on the floor) and scented (or un-scented) oils that are so beautifully fragrant.  The staff is exceptionally kind.  Lockers area is complete - could leave for office right after a treatment.  Good for solo spa-goer....areas set up for solitude and the atmosphere encourages quiet.  Divine."
5,"I'm not going to rehash what's been stated hear a billion times, this place is solid.\n\nBut due try to get a Sunday brunch reservation about a month in advance, the brunch menu is unique and unbelievable.  Skip the bloody mary bar and just get something off of the menu."
5,"First \""Vape\"" Store in southwest.  About time!  Prices are cheap and competitive!  Good selection of products - They keep adding more every time I go there.  \n\nAwesome selection of e-juice flavors!  Staff is very friendly and informative!"
5,"I don't give out many 5's. Let me explain why they get a 5. They are better than any of the Chinese fast food places I have been. The food was plentiful, hot, and taste. The service was good. I just don't think it could get better. \nI drive to Arrowhead area several times a week and have seen Yu's. They are new and have only been open a couple of weeks. Since they are in my neighborhood, I thought I should give them a try.\nVery clean and friendly place. We went in at lunch time and looked at the lunch menu. They have lunch meals for less than $6.00. With drink was just over $7.00 per meal. I got the house chicken. Marked spicy. Not overly spicy but I am used to eating some very hot foods so I am not always the best person to ask. My wife got the Orange Chicken. Wow. We got enough food to feed 4 or 5 people. Depending on how hungry you are there is enough food to feed 3 people in each meal. The food was good, and temperature was hot, hot as they cook it while you wait. Much better than the other Oriental food places in the area. I will be back. Many times. \nThis place just got started. Go see them. You will enjoy your food and service."
5,"As a resident of South Scottsdale, this is a true gem.  The food is fresh and crazy good.  They are creative and farm to table I believe is truly what they are.  The cocktail program is spot on if you want to enjoy true craft spirits.  The service is 5 star and you never get disappointed."
5,"Is this a 5 star restaurant? NO. But for what it is - a casual elegant neighborhood restaurant - I definitely give it 5 stars. The menu is creative and original and every item I've tried has been excellent. The staff is friendly, professional, eager and helpful. My water and soda glasses never got below half full (it's a desert here so that's a biggie). A very good dining experience and quite reasonable prices."
5,This place has the best fish and chips I have ever had. Bring your family bring your friends.  Every dish at my table looked amazing! I will be returning for more. They have plenty of beer on tap.  Best British pub in the US. Great service and food was hot.  Try this pub or you will regret it.  The server was very knowledgeable about all of the dishes and desserts.
5,"I love this place. They are always friendly, the cheese curds are the best as well as the chicken tenders.  This is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison."
5,"Conveniently located on Higley and Ray in Gilbert, The Coffee Shop has the best omelettes ever. I ususally get something like the Ham and Cheddar omelette.  The potatoes that come on the side are awesom and add some fresh oj and you are set.  It will cost you about $9 but it is worth it.  I go there once a week on Fridays to work and enjoy breakfast.  I will be Friday if you want to swing by and say hi Facebook friends!!"
5,"I can't say enough!  We were in Las Vegas on vacation and left the strip on a whim, overwhelmed with the pricey, under appealing food.  We happened upon Ventano's through an internet search and could not have been more pleased.  From the moment we walked in the place was amazing.  Danielle took fantastic care of us and the entire staff worked together to make the experience phenomenal. When we arrived we noted the fantastic view of the strip and the potential sunset.  The staff worked as a team to make sure that the sun was never a bother and in a single synchronized effort made sure that pall of the blinds were open for the diners to enjoy the majesty of sunset.  Add to that the delicious food and completely reasonable prices and I am not sure why there was not a line out the door. \n\nIf I lived in Henderson I would be a regular for sure.\n\nAgain, thank you so much for the special attention and for a wonderful evening."
5,"Rosie's makes the best doughnuts I have ever enjoyed. I travel quite often for work and their doughnuts are worth a trip every time I'm in Madison. They always blow me away with the texture, flavor, and sheer quality of product. FANTASTIC!! The espresso is pretty awesome as well. \n\nEAT A ROSIE'S DOUGHNUT AND YOUR DAY WILL BE BETTER."
5,"This review is for the bar area.  \n\nOn a trip to Vegas November 2010, Hubs and I stayed at Mandalay, so we tried a plethora of their restaurants. I had read that Aureole had a great happy hour, so we headed over to the bar to partake. Two for one wine flights and appetizers. We got, how do I put this delicately...wasted. The wine was plentiful and the appetizers, while delicious (I had my first oxtail) were not enough to stave off the effects of the alcohol.\n\nOur bartender was really nice and attentive. I disliked one of the wines in my flight and he chose another one for me to replace it. He let us play with the digital wine list, and kept a close eye on our needs all evening. After our flights he suggested some desert wines that were a great way to end our Aureole experience and then release us into the casino, inhibitions shorn away!\n\nOverall, a very pleasant experience and I am sad to see the bad reviews Aureole has been receiving lately. I have always wanted to have dinner there but I will wait until things improve."
5,"I LOVE this Petsmart! I shop here, adopted my cat and my dog here, use the grooming salon (well, not personally) and just really like everything about it and its employees! They really go above and beyond to help you figure out and find what you need."
5,"I have been going to Elliott's for a couple years now, and they have quickly become one of the only shops in the Valley I feel I can trust. I have brought my 2000 BMW in for wide a number of reasons, from major to minor; everything from a faulty ABS module and a broken A/C unit to bad wheel sensors and broken thermostats. Among many other things.\n\nThey have always been highly communicative, honest, and fair; informing me throughout the entire process of what needed to be fixed, detailing throughly how everything would be done and what it would need to cost. They have always fixed only what needed to be, and never anything more, not allowing me to repair something that would be unnecessary for me to do. They have always been very timely and productive with their work; I recently had to replace my alternator and they had the job finished within the day. They are knowledgable and friendly, always more than happy to explain in great detail any specific questions I have had.\n\nI firmly recommend Elliott's Auto Electric to anyone who needs a timely, cost effective repair by honest professionals who have a great understanding of their work."
5,"It must be a Vegas thing, but you cannot beat a store that servers adult slurpies. The service is quick and you are on your way to explore the main drag with drink in hand. Keep your container and you will save a dollar or two on your refill. It is also a small way to save the planet."
5,"I had been wanting to stay at the Sanctuary for a while now, and we decided on a quick 3 night vacation last week.  I must say we were extremely impressed with the resort, and cannot wait to go back!  The resort is a quiet paradise; it's in top-notch condition, with beautiful grounds, rooms, and amazing service.  The spa was a great experience; we both had reflexology treatments, and were able to spend time in the whirlpool and eucalyptus steam room as well.  The $ we spent on this vacation was well worth it!"
5,"I love District one! The bartender Adrian is amazing, she recommended the Stir Fried Pepper Lobster with Garlic Noodles and it was incredible! 3 pounds of heaven! Thank you Adrian! You made my birthday so special and those coconut mojitos blow my mind!"
5,"Very nice crew and excellent service today 2/11/14. They came out right away for an estimate but since is was raining that day I waited a week. Wow, my windows and screens are beautifully clean for a really, reasonable price. My windows had not been cleaned for at least 5 years and it was wonderful to see the difference. Thank you and for this price I will definitely do it more often, at least once a year!"
5,One of the best pho noodle places there is.  I definitely recommend anyone go there if you love noodle soup.
5,"We absolutely LOVED Carlsbad Tavern! We weren't sure what to expect by the name, but we were pleasantly surprised when we walked in. It was late in the evening and we sat on the patio, which has a really cool ambience with the fireplace, palm trees and water features. We enjoyed a few cocktails from the Late Night menu, and at the suggestion of our server, we ordered the New Mexican pot stickers. All I can say is they were amazing. The sauce was so good, I could've seriously licked the plate clean if I knew no one was watching! (Lol) The only downfall is that we found this place on the LAST night of our vacation, otherwise we would've been back at least one more time. The atmosphere, service and food here is simply outstanding. Try this place, you won't be disappointed!!!"
5,"Great place to get the things you just can't find at the big chain stores.\nHigh quality pet food, snacks, toys, cloths, and staff that care.\nThe store is small, but well worth the trip.  You won't be disappointed.\nI just moved to the area, and after doing a little research online, I found that this place carried not only the high end food I feed my dog, but also the brand of shoes I wanted to protect my dog's feet from the hot ground here in Phoenix.  I looked some more, and they carry, or deal in just about every high end food on the market, and just about anything worth getting for your dog, and they even have a few items for your feline friend too."
5,"Love what Smart Security has to offer! Josh is very knowledgeable, and I'm sure he can answer any security question that you can throw at him. Give him a call & check out the smart phone apps!"
5,"Seitdem ich 2004 zum ersten Mal hier war (ich bin in eine Wohnung gegen\u00fcber eingezogen) ist der Mevlana f\u00fcr mich mit Abstand der beste D\u00f6nerladen weit und breit. Die 4 EUR f\u00fcr einen Yufka bezahle ich bei der Qualit\u00e4t gerne! Insbesondere beim Fleisch wird auf h\u00f6chste Qualit\u00e4t geachtet, in 7 Jahren hatte ich nicht ein einziges Mal etwas zu bem\u00e4ngeln.\n\n\n Besonders zu empfehlen ist die D\u00f6ner-Pizza mit Creme Fraiche und Paprika, gebacken im Steinofen.\n\n\n Im Sommer kann man auch sch\u00f6n drau\u00dfen sitzen.\n\n\n Der Chef ist der netteste D\u00f6nerladenchef den ich kenne, er kennt mich noch immer mit Namen (so wie auch viele seiner anderen G\u00e4ste), auch wenn ich auf Grund eines Umzugs in einen anderen Stadtteil leider nicht mehr ganz so regelm\u00e4\u00dfig vorbeikomme."
5,"This truly is a spectacular dining establishment. I bring all my craigslist dates here for the elegant environment and well cultured Spanish service staff. If you thought eating at the house in \""Beauty and The Beast\"" was classic, you have yet to try whattaburger. Swing by your local drug dealer first and I can assure you that all the appliances will be talking you into being their guest! Long live McDonalds!\n\nGod bless"
5,"Amazing food! Have been here twice. Very intimate setting, good service & great food. \nGarlic & spinach Nan was so yummy! So is the chicken tiki masala."
5,It is our last day in Montreal and we were looking for one last lunch to close out our wonderful trip. We stumbled to Cafe Cherrier and were happy as soon as we stepped in. It was hustling and bustling with a local crowd including some business lunches. Was really interesting to see and observe. Really nice French food lunch. I had the French onion soup which was excellent and a Duck Confit with frites and salad. The salad was fresh and had a light vinaigrette. The duck was cooked close to perfect. Bread was super tasty and wine was light but flavorful.
5,"We live in Seville, and have been going to the Blue32 up on Val Vista and Williams Field.  We waited anxiously for this to open, and all of the anticipation led to some really high expectations.  \n\nI'm happy to report that our expectations have been exceeded twice in a row. \n\nLast time, we were seated at a table with a server named Amanda and we loved her.  The food was great (I had the Alfredo pasta, very flavorful) but my favorite every time is the strawberry daiquiri.  They're made with real strawberries rather than gloppy corn syrup mix, and the taste is miles apart.  \n\nWe couldn't remember our awesome servers name this trip (sorry Amanda) but we won't forget because we've now immortalized her in this review.  \n\nShe's thoughtful.  We had been dithering about what to order (flatbread? Shrimp poboy? Steak?) When a massive party arrived, requiring extra tables and chairs to be brought in, she was nice enough let us know so we could get our order in before they were all seated.  \n\nWe never wanted for a drink or water refill, food was correct and piping hot, and she's just delightful.  \n\nAlso... Fresh Strawberry daiquiris... Did I mention that..???"
5,Go soft and juicy burgers!  I dream and crave these burgers.  Basic cheese burger with pickles and they special mustard.
5,"This was my first experience with Gunnel's.  I had them put in Firestone HD airbags and an on board compressor system for my work truck.  Set me back $800 out the door but those bags were exactly what I needed.  Gunnel's couldn't get me in for about 5 days but they did exactly what they said they would and they did it on time.  Looks like they did a good job too!  I'm a happy camper, and my truck will be happy to not be dragging the bumper with my trailer."
5,"Try to find a cheap but good place to eat on the Plateau, and good luck!  Well, here is one, all dishes including desserts are only $5.00!!  Mind you, the emphasis seems to be heavy on the junk...poutine & more poutine, the godfather hot dog, (mac & cheese on top of a giant hot dog) and different burgers. Take heart ,and if you are worried about your heart, fear not, there are veggie and some lighter fare options. I had the veggies wrap, which was very good, lots of FRESH crisp veggies wrapped inside a green tortilla, with a chocolate mousse with raspberry coulis for dessert... yummy indeed! My friend had the curried chicken dish ,followed by the same dessert as I had, and she proclaimed that it was better than what she'd had at Juliette & Chocolate,and for a far better price, oh my! Great little place with a retro-oddball decor\n(old desk lamps with extension necks, all cobbled together as chandeliers, old 78's as place mats,graffiti walls) but it all works. Service prompt, courteous and informative."
5,Five stars is for food only !! Hands down best pastrami I've ever had. Maybe best sandwich period. I got the pastrami Reuben on sourdough. The gentleman on the meat sliding station let me sample the corn beef and pastrami to see which I liked better. He was very friendly but the two girls working the other counters were frowning and not friendly. .  I will def be returning on my next Vegas trip.
5,"bonus... located right across from Sugars.  :D\n\nwe came per suggestion of Michelle E.  and actually went with her on her second trip.. [in one day] to have a light dinner after swimming at the planet hollywood hotel.   The menu is big.. with LOTS to offer.  Things may seem ordinary, but trust me.. the bread makes all the difference.  They have a soup menu, a hot sandwich menu, wraps and salads... and of course desserts!  \n\nyou order your sandwich, wrap or salad.. they give you a buzzer and a receipt... you walk down the line of neatly arranged extras of potato salads, macaroni salads... fruit cups, brownies, chips... ICE CREAM SANDWICHES!  it's pretty overwhelming ... in a good way!!\n\ni had the full montague: Freshly Roasted Beef, Turkey, Aged Swiss & Sharp Cheddar Cheese, Lettuce, Roma Tomatoes & the Earl's Mustard Sauce...  the roast beef is fresh, the consistency is perfect.. the bread is amazing.   I also had the broccoli cheddar soup and it's seriously one of the best broc cheddar's i've ever had.  Michelle E.  also bough a cup of brownie bites that topped off my meal... i didn't even have to visit sugars after wards.  :P\n\nthis sandwich shop definitely makes the top 5 list of sandwich shops i've ever been too.. you'll be seeing me again Earl of Sandwich.. I PROMISE!"
5,"My husband and I hosted our son's Rehearsal dinner at Spiedini's.  I worked with Tonya to plan the event.  She was delightful and very organized.  The evening was so wonderful.  I had nothing but rave reviews for the food and service from all of our family.  There were 60 of us, so that is high praise.  The Chef, Gustav Mauler, was terrific and was on site to keep things going smoothly.  \n\nI recommend them to anyone looking for a wonderful evening and great food!"
5,"Incredible service and attention to detail. Each person in our group of 4 was thrilled with their manicures. Peter and his crew are perfectionists and artists, and are committed to what they do. \n\nIt was my twin sisters' birthdays, and they both received a complimentary bottle of wine! We're not from Vegas, but this will be a part of our itinerary every trip!"
5,"I went to the 3933 St Denis location and I loved it. I was looking to get my first tattoo done, and while my tattoo was by no means complicated, I wanted to feel comfortable when getting it done. Customer service and atmosphere was really important in choosing a place. I stopped by MTL Tattoo one weekend and was immediately noticed, and my questions were answered without me needing to pry. I decided that MTL was the place to go. \n\nI called ahead of time the day I was planning on getting it done, I asked about a time and was told that they'd be able to fit me in! Great! I went and met Tony, the guy I'd talked to on the phone. He was super friendly, and recognized me from the call. In all honesty, the paperwork and setting up took longer than the actual tattoo. He made me feel comfortable, reassured me and explained what he was doing every time he did something new. I could not have been better taken care of. He was efficient and compassionate, telling me to relax and distracting me. \n\nAll in all, a great experience. Everyone is super friendly, the place is really relaxed but professional and I'd totally recommend MTL Tattoo to anyone who was looking to get something done. Thanks Tony!"
5,"Hash House is hands down the best place for breakfast in Vegas. Their portions are too big for on the spot consumption which is an issue and almost gets them four stars from me. Not too many people know this, but Hash House also serves up great lunch. This is a must visit whether you are a resident or tourist."
5,"I live close to the greenway half moon and loved this place so my fianc\u00e9 and I decided to try to other location, heard they had different food and different interior. \n\nWe sat at the bar, I ordered some wings (cant get enough of half moons wings) and my fianc\u00e9 ordered a burger and a side of wings.\nWINGS WERE PERFECT.\nMy fianc\u00e9 didn't like the bun as much on the burger but it was still pretty good.\n\nI really like the change up of this bar, I loved the environment and the way everything flows.\n\nThe best part about this visit was probably the bartender, her name was Alexandra.\nBecause of her my fianc\u00e9 and I stayed at least an hour past the time we intended on leaving. She did a damn good job getting my fianc\u00e9 drunk and we had a blast with her. \nVery outgoing girl and the customers around me seemed to think the same.\n\nWe will 100% be back on a regular basis!"
5,Two words! Tina Mateo. She makes this place fun to hang out at anytime! The Food and Gaming Specials are great too. Limited graveyard menu as well.
5,"Cooper Coons, Ltd. helped my husband and I setup our family trust, will, and directives. We really appreciated how everything was thoroughly explained to us and we were able to feel confident we had the right firm. This firm has a great office and everyone I have met there was very friendly. Cooper Coons, Ltd. takes the time to get to know their clients and make sure that they are well informed and have what they need to make smart decisions while protecting their interests. We plan on using them to setup our LLC in the near future. I would highly recommend them!"
5,"Hands down the best restaurant around. If I were to take one place to a desert island, it would be Houstons. BridgetZ gives me a hard time because it's a chain, but she was also spoiled by living in Manhattan for a while. I still bet she'd put it in her top 5. Things I love:\nHamburger (best in town)\nSpinach Artichoke Dip \nRibs (best I have ever had)\nAhi Tuna Salad (if you are needing to keep it light)\nChicken tenders"
5,"Went back today for the first time since moving across town...got a soy latte and pastry. As usual, the staff was incredible. The soy latte cannot be beat...as Jason S. mentioned, they are one of the only places in town that can do a soy latte correctly.\n\nI did notice a sign that their muffins are all $1 and cookies are $1.50 after 4pm - though you have to pay in cash.  This makes me want to go back at 4pm just to get the leftovers...they are amazing! \n\nToday I saw, a true sign of a real coffee shop...two groups of people engaged in conversations about current issues..."
5,"I just wanted to complement Ali Murray, the Catering Sales Manager at the Mandarin Oriental Las Vegas.  I had been communicating with Ali regarding possibly having an upcoming event at the resort.  She was extremely timely, helpful, and detailed in her email responses.  On a recent visit to Las Vegas, I was able to pre-arrange a meeting in person to discuss details, and she was even waiting in the lobby when we arrived. She gave us an outstanding and thorough tour of the Mandarin Oriental, which by the way is gorgeous!  Ali also followed up upon our return to see if there was any additional assistance she could provide.  \n\nAs far as the resort itself goes, the Mandarin Oriental is sophisticated and provides a quiet and relaxing atmosphere, among the hustle and bustle of Las Vegas, without being far removed.  it is definitely the best of both worlds.  \n\nAlthough, we ultimately decided to go in a different direction, we will definitely consider this resort for future events.  Hopefully, Ali will still be there!  She is sensational, a joy to meet, and represents the best of the Mandarin Oriental.  I would HIGHLY recommend working with her."
5,"I can see why people are just packing it in here. A great place for visitors and locals.\n\nWonderful atmosphere. Quality wines and great gnoshing dishes. There is a friendly, knowledgeable staff to advise folks about there options. Top notch bruschetta with a great combination of fresh ingredients. Brie and apple, dates with pistachios being my favorites.\n\nMake reservations because the beautiful crowd is huge. \n\nBest deal ever, happy hour - $5 wine by glass is the best deal before 5pm"
5,"Las Vegas has a big islander community, so Hawaiian food is easy to come by. I've been to a bunch of different restaurants, and Ohana definitely stands out.\n\nPrice wise, it's similarly priced with other establishments of its kind. However, the servings seem a bit bigger than normal. I order the mini katsu (one of my favorite dishes), and can barely finish it. Don't get me wrong, your boy can eat. I've tried maybe 6 or so of their dishes, and have yet to be disappointed. \n\nI haven't had a bad experience yet at this place. The service is always nice. They greet you when you come in and say goodbye when you walk out. Wait time for food is normal. A coworker and I have even recommended that our office have Ohana cater a luncheon, and the whole office loved their food."
5,"This place is amazing, once again, this place rocks. Today I had the Quezadilla with Argentine beef and chimichurri sauce, fresh avocados, just to die for!!! I would ditch any overprice mexican restaurant for the oportunity to eat here, they kick butt!!\n\nIf you like the gourmet food from Cancun, then you will not be desapointed!!!"
5,"Excellent waiters, nice and clean tables and floor. Good food portions.decent prices. Food is delicious and fresh. Beer was excellent ."
5,"We were seated promptly by a friendly beautiful hostess.\n\nMichelle our waiter did a fantastic job on keeping the drinks flowing and the courses coming out on time and perfectly cooked bone in rib eye.   The sides (steamed spinach, garlic mash and saut\u00e9ed mushrooms were outstanding completing a great meal.\n\nThe decor is modern and well laid out with an extensive wine menu.  We recommend making reservations well in advance.\n\nJ&O"
5,"I can't believe I haven't already written a review for this place!!! Sorry Guys! So if you're reading this review, debating on if you should check this place out tonight, stop thinking and GO!  Super fun, great atmosphere, I have come to know the owner and staff as you will soon too, and they are amazing. This is a great place to go with a group of friends, there's boardgames, music, poetry slams, and great company! Don't forget to wear your coolest hat on friday for a fun treat!"
5,"Just getting back on a bike after many, many years. Great to have a bike shop that takes the time to answer questions and give advice because they want you to do it right. Did not buy my bike from them but they treated me as if I had. Great service and rider support."
5,You never know what you will see on Fremont st. The place for a cheep show from the man in the box to the guy painting with spray paint to the guy doing clay sculpture while you wait also you may see jesus. The light show if pretty cool to.
5,"My son had a blast here. \n\nWe went on a lazy Sunday afternoon, around 1pm and stayed until 4pm.\n\nWe only paid $10 for an all day access (unless you go out and decide to come back later, then you have to pay again)\n\nI wish we packed some food though, because you can basically pack your breakfast, lunch and dinner and stay there all day and still pay $10.00.\n\nI didn't have any problems with other kids, or moms not watching theirs. \nIt was a really good experience for us.\n\nBesides, you can't bash a business when that happens to you. The parents are responsible for their kids, not the business.\n\nThe place is clean. I don't mean SANITIZED but it doesn't have the sticky feel or look to it, and the play sets are not dark or dirty or anything.\n\nWOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!"
5,So amazing! I just moved in down the street and Those Guys Pizza is shizznit! Love the spinach salad.  Super friendly staff.  The have made me a happy pizza filled camper.
5,"A case study in great service. No more than 10 minutes after sharing our unfortunate and clearly uncommon experience, we received a call from the head of food and beverage extending their sincerest apologies.\n\nEveryone can make a mistake from time to time, but the great places make things right. In our case they made things right and then some. We've never been taken care of so well as we were by the staff and management of Prado.\n\nThank you for an even more memorable evening than we were expecting!"
5,"Whenever I visit Las Vegas I always make sure to stop by CASA FUENTE. A mojito and one of the house blend torpedos. Sitting in the patio watching Sportscenter on one of the TVs. Nice way to spend an afternoon. The nights are pretty cool too. Especially during the weekend of the BIG SMOKE in November. The prices are not cheap, but, IT\""S VEGAS BABY!!!!"
5,"It's been a while since I've updated my review for Komol, so here we go. \n\nThe food is still delicious! I finally got to try the herbal salad, since I'm attempting to eat healthier lately. It was refreshing and absolutely delicious. It had just the right amount of spice and the texture was delicious. My dining companions got the mee krob to start and the spicy mint chicken, pork pad thai and some chicken dish that escapes me at the moment. All were incredibly happy with their meals. I took some garlic fried rice with beef home to my fella as well. I took a few bitefuls of that as well and love it!\n\nThe service can be hit or miss here, but they were extremely attentive on this visit and refilled our water glasses regularly. They were pretty packed for the holidays and seemed to accomodate the large amount of guests quite nicely. Definitely still one of my favorites!"
5,"Sam met me at the service area, checked in my vehicle for its appointment and got me a curtesy vehicle. I was excite to get my car back clean and ready to go."
5,"Maple bacon only made on weekends! Worth waiting all week for!\nOh this place is the end of my waistline! Yikes. \nFresh donuts, need I say more? Oh yes, you can ALWAYS say BACON!!!!\nFriendly service, reasonable prices and fresh warm donuts. YUM. \nThis place is my go-to spot for donuts when I'm in the Phx/Scottsdale area. \nHIGHLY recommended. And trust me, I've eaten a TON of donuts."
5,"Water heater pilot light was constantly going out, called MC Plumbing and got a same day service call (no charge).  Adrian showed up on time and provide excellent service on my warranty repair.  Will use MC Plumbing again and will recommend them to friends."
5,Cobra Kai Is the best gym I ever went to!! sim is the best jiujitsu coach in the world I recommend this gym
5,Yup!  I'm a major fan.  I love that parking is so easy for a downtown restaurant.  The place is cute and you can dine in the restaurant portion or enjoy the bar or outdoor patio.\n\nThe service was very friendly and helpful.  I like that I can get unlimited amounts of water myself when it is hot.\n\nTried a bowl of the yellow lentil coconut curry soup.  It was huge and delicious and came with two slices of bread for only $6.  My daughter got a lemon bar out of the display case that was amazing for $2.50.\n\nI can't wait to come back and try other things.  The prime rib looked amazing but I was feeling to frugal to pay the $19 price tag.
5,Eli and his crew are great. They take great care in making my yard look the way I want it. and Eli follows up after every visit to make sure I'm happy and get feedback. I highly recommend them.
5,"This is our favorite take out place.  The food is always fresh, flavorful and plentiful.  The owners are very nice also.  We drive out of the way for take out from them."
5,"I know all y'all care about is what to order, so ima get right to it: Brussel Sprouts, Buta Shishito (not spicy), Crudo (probably my favorite dish), Sake Orenji (extremely refreshing), Pokuyaki, bluefin tuna, karaage, carafe of sake sangria, & GREENIES (I would come here just for the dessert).\n\nApparently their HH has changed from 5p-7p to 5p-6:30p so get there early! We arrived close to 6p on a Tuesday night (during Magic convention week, mind you) and it was empty, score!! Service was prompt, friendly, and conversational. We had Charlie as our server and he was awesome! I almost want to ask for him next time we go. Everyone was super friendly and involved in our experience, cleaning, recommending, etc. \n\nHonestly I keep thinking about this place and plan to bring every single one of my friends back. Mad love to Yonaka."
5,"I bumped into Slade, Donna, and Nancy at a Suns Fundraiser last week at the W hotel.  They were serving up some of their new treats, and boy were they ahhhhhmazing!\n\nSlade insisted that I sample the salted caramel - one of a new line of gourmet chocolates... omg - incredible!  It was bite size so I didn't feel too much guilt from that one but it was smooth, creamy, salty, sweet, and chocolatey all in one bite.  Yum!  \n\nI should've stopped myself there and walked away, but the new line of gourmet candy bars was staring me in the face.  How could I not sample one of the 'Rocky Rhode' specials?  This one was a bit bigger - more like the size of half a candy bar you buy at the store, and I polished it off no problem... here is the description straight from the menu:\n\n\""a wickedly sinful twist on the classic rocky road. beautiful classic flavors based on a rich milk and white chocolate peanut butter ganache and finished off with toasted marshmallows and candied pecans.\""\n\nThere you have it... one of the most sinfully delectable gourmet treats I've ever had!  Go check out Wicked's new creations... and another FYI - I think that they are changing their name slightly as well, to Wicked Kitchen Gourmet.  Either way, old skool or new skool, it's all wickedly amazing!"
5,"If you haven't been to Wah Kee, this restaurant needs to be next on your dining experience list. In a sea of pre-fab noodle places, Wah Kee continues to create all dishes from scratch, all noodles from scratch, and all of the  food is fresh and prepared masterfully by seasoned chefs. This dining spot has been around for years  and is family owned and operated. It is not glitzy like some of the national chains- but if you are interested in very good, authentic food at a very reasonable price, skip the bagged noodle places and try Wah Kee."
5,This hotel provided us the best view I've seen from the strip overlooking the fountain shows. The hotel was very trendy and high tech isn't even a good enough phrase to describe the ammenities. YOU must stay here if you want a great Vegas experience.
5,"Heard about this place in Vegas Seven, and had to try it. I'm so glad I did!\n\nI went with my boyfriend and he got the pulled pork sandwich with the bacon potato salad. I got the 2 plate combo with brisket and pulled pork, and yams as the side. We got a free dessert for checking in and got the banana pudding. It was awesome! \n\nEverything was delicious! Best BBQ I've had in Vegas. Service is great too. We talked to the chef for a little while we ate and he was really friendly. We'll be back :)"
5,"I don't eat sashimi so I can't comment on their fish quality, but I do like cooked rolls and luckily Sushi San has a wide selection.  All the rolls I've tried are delicious and you probably can't go wrong with anything on the menu.\n\nWhat stands out the most to me about this restaurant is their amazing customer service.  I usually order to go and sometimes find \""extras\"" in my bag, such as miso soup, edamame, or even an entire extra roll!  The staff is super friendly and it's rare these days to find a restaurant with such a stellar level of customer service."
5,"Probably my favorite sandwich ever.   I usually get the Pitts-Burger, and it has always been fantastic.  And while I've never really been a big fan of cole slaw anywhere else, Primanti's slaw has a delicious, unique taste that perfectly compliments everything on the sandwich.  \n\nThere's not a whole lot more to say. The service at this location has always been good, but it's the 5-star sandwiches that will haunt your dreams (in a good way!) and keep you coming back for more."
5,"We went here during a bachelor party in March.  All I can say is WOW.  The view is incredible, you can walk out on to the balcony and see all of Las Vegas.  The club is on the smaller side, but that did not take away form the fun.  We got bottle service here and it is like night and day getting bottle service in Las Vegas over my home town Atlantic City.  The bouncer was there every time watching over us, they kept our tables free of drunks trying to sit down and would walk us to the restrooms when it got too packed.  Halfway through the night, the dancers rolled out flashing glasses and foam bars and the club was lit up in neon colors.  The waitress was back every few minutes to check up on who needed drinks.  At one point towards the end of the night my friend fell through the table and they set the whole thing back up even though we told them not to worry about it.  The host was extremely friendly and even took care of us the night before.  He got us 5 bottles for the price of 3 even with 10 guys.  Make sure you take care of all the staff and they will take care of you!"
5,just fell into this place today and WOW what a gem  GREAT sandwiches  I had the super sicilian and it was fantastic!  great meats  great toasted bread  great cheese and great dressing  wish I had found this place sooner  I will be back to try their pizza which is only served at dinner.  friendly staff and great service   one of only a few great sandwich shops I have found in Phoenix    a MUST TRY!
5,"Moon stands out as one of the better nightclubs in Vegas. Where to Begin?\n\nPros\n-If you look around well, you can get comps to enter Moon, Playboy Club & Rain for free (or cheaply)\n-The View is spectacular, the Vegas strip serves as your backdrop\n- Since it is away from the strip, if you get there early enough, the wait is not too bad\n-Since Moon is in the Palms, you are guaranteed a young, hip crowd with some of the best hotties Vegas has to offer\n-The roof opens up and lets you breathe in some fresh air, when we were there, the roof opened up and produced some fake snow\n-The music is very good!\n-By Vegas standards, the bars are not too hard to get to\n-It is exceedingly superior to the Playboy Club located on the floor below\n-The venue itself, the decor, lighting, ambiance, etc. is young, hip and cool!\n\nThe only cons I can think of are\n-It is harder to get to since it is located off the strip\n-It def. draws in a more pretentious crowd \n\nI was very satisfied with my experience at Moon! it is easily one of the better nightclubs in Vegas!"
5,"Nice selection of Fuente Cigars including some very exclusive lines. Knowledgeable and friendly staff, reasonable, not cheap cigars. Top-of-the-line cigars for the most part. And finally, a very nice lounge. Nice to see a classy cigar-bar to enjoy while my wife shops! A win-win!"
5,"In my 8 years living in Las Vegas, I never had a chance to try Spago.  I view it as a bit out of price range, so when their 20 Year Anniversary came up with roll-back pricing, I had to try it.  Went last night with my date, and we asked the assistant GM Drew to pick our food.  Here's what he picked, and my thoughts on each:\n\nSignature Roasted Beet Goat Cheese Salad\nI never would have ordered this but it was delicious.\n\nHouse Smoked Sturgeon, Crisp Potato Galette, Horseradish Cream - $12\nIt was like a spicy latke with fish on top.  Really good.\n\n\n\""Chinois Style\"" Colorado Lamb Chops, Cilantro Mint Vinaigrette, Sweet & Sour Eggplant - $33\nTender and delicious even without the sauce.  Eggplant was so good my date and I couldn't figure out if it was eggplant!\n\nCantonese Style Roasted Duck with Wild Huckleberries, Ginger and Stir-Fried Baby Bok Choy - $20\nHuge and delicious, and unexpected as we thought we were only getting 1 main course to share.  Needless to say we had plenty of leftovers.\n\nEven with the discount I spent a bit more than I had hoped, but everything was delicious and the service was great, as well.  Oh, and they have an amazing bread platter.  Wish I was hungrier and got to try more of that!\n\nThanks, Drew W & Scott G!"
5,"Ordered takeout on twice-cooked pork, chicken katsu, and pork pot-stickers. \nWife and I were most impressed by the good flavor profiles on the 2X pork and chicken katsu. (We liked that they used fusion flavors, not just the standard bland Chinese take-out seasonings we've experienced with other locals). Pot-stickers were small but OK. I would order take-out from Flo's again, for sure. I award this restaurant 5 * on flavor! Look forward to trying other dishes.\n\nAlso, I arrived at 5:00 pm on a Tuesday afternoon in mid-May, the bar seats were full for happy-hour and the restaurant had about seven 4-tops in play. That's a good sign, I think, especially as seasonal tourists are mostly absent."
5,"This place is AMAZING.  The chef came to our table and personally welcomed us.  We ordered 2 of the daily specials and were MORE than pleased with the food.  I had the Dagwood sandwich, and my dining companion had the Chicken Parm.  Both were delightful.  The desserts were to die for.  One of the better Creme Brulees I've ever had the pleasure of eating, and the indulgence platter is an astounding mix of brownies, cheesecake, ice cream, fruit, whipped creme, and these cheesecake spring rolls that were good enough to warrant a return visit all on their own.\n\nThe place is a sports bar, so you wouldn't expect to find gourmet food here, but give it a shot.  I'll definitely be back."
5,"I have nothing bad to say about my RC Willey experience.\n\nMy fiance picked out a new couch in the Henderson store.  We were pleasantly surprised - the salespeople were somehow able to strike the balance between being helpful and letting us browse without pressure.  We chose a beautiful tan leather sofa (which, of course, was backordered).  When it was delivered, I was surprised that the delivery was actually made IN THE TIME FRAME GIVEN!  You know how it goes... they say sometime between 11 and 2, and it ends up being 9 p.m.... well, not this time!  The delivery men worked very hard to get the large couch in our small apartment without destroying anything.  I was surprised that we didn't lose a wall, but they were skilled!\n\nOur couch is in perfect condition.  We even got a follow-up call from the store manager to make sure it was delivered satisfactorily.  All in all, we couldn't be more pleased with RC Willey.  We will be returning when we want more furniture!"
5,"My husband says, \""Can you write a review when I brought you food and you did not go to the restaurant?\"" I replied, \""Yes I can!\"" Love In and Out! In fact, people who live in states without In and Out are jealous of those of us who are able to enjoy the succulent burgers whenever we want! The burgers are juicy and yummy. I am not a huge fan of the fries, but because the burgers are so good, the fires are really an after thought for me. I wish they would embrace the idea of a curly fry. No one really offers a good curly fry any more. Other than Chipolte, this is the only fast food my hubby and I eat, and we eat it rarely, but now with the new location, we are becoming regulars. So glad they are breathing new life into this area which is our part of town!"
5,"These guys rock! Perfect For your Mediterranean fix. Spanakopita, Tiropita and Chicken gyros have all been tried and loved. Have always gotten a friendly staff member whether in person or over the phone. Snappy delivery, too. Can't lose with this place."
5,Went there for lunch and the food was fantastic! There is a free valet which helps as there seems to be limited parking. Their ice tea is a black/passionfruit blend that was very refreshing. Very trendy decor and I would definitely go back!
5,"Go no farther than the Seabass!  Miso glazed to perfection!  We are so addicted to this dish we always order it, and let our 2nd dish be whatever...  Crunchy Spicy Yellowtail is one of the best rolls in town, often we come just for a quick nibble of that.  Be sure to make a reservation!"
5,"I was a little skeptical about trying a fro-yo place because they are popping up all around the valley, but when I stepped in here, I knew this place was good. They are very inviting and the atmosphere is relaxing. I come in every time i'm in the neighborhood. Yummy flavors!"
5,"La Unica rocks. \n\nThe authentic tacos are awesome, there a $1.75...try one if you have never had one.  We almost always get the burrito Tuawana...also their ice tea is perfection mixed 1/2 sweet and 1/2 unsweetened.  Staff is AWESOME, some of best people I have ever meet.  To ME there is no doubt this is the best Mexican food in the Charlotte area.\n\nAlso, this is in a small strip mall...they also have signs to that read no meetings, no seating before all parties arrive...in other words \""we're too busy to seat you if your not ready....and please don't hang around because we are really busy...\""  (my interpretation)  GREAT FOOD!!!"
5,"Fun fun fun, a steakhouse cannot get as entertaining as this one. The bar scene in the center is very stylish, with great DJ spinning good music in the background, and yet the tables are set at a comfortable distance allowing for private conversations, STK is such energetic steakhouse fit for great food as well as people watching. I just love the vibe of this place!\n\nThe Green intensity martini is exicting, spicy and refreshing.\nThe tuna tartar was really yummy, especially love the chili oil on the side, really brings out the flavor of the tuna.\nThe baked bread with blue cheese butter was one of the best bread i have tasted in any restaurants, so innovative!\nThe filet medallion was done just right, i savored every bite of it.\nThe chimichurri sauce on the side was excellent.  \nParmesan truffle fries was good, but didn't really tasted the truffle.\n\nThis is the kind of place you would want to return again and again~"
5,"This course has been on my radar for awhile, but just a bit out of my price range, but I decided to make this a \""tax return splurge\"" for myself, and could NOT be happier with my decision!  Every hole is different.  The staff is excellent.  The greens, while a little marked up, putted true and very fast.  And at a rate of $110 from their own website (booked a week in advance and cheaper than golfnow, btw), it's a far better value than your standard North Scottsdale courses, and equal to, or superior in quality.  A couple negatives; sand was a bit compacted and a couple tee boxes were hard to find a level spot.  Also, if the ball gets into the desert, get a new one.  \n    I will play this one more time in \""season\"", and several times this summer.  Don't miss this.  It will eventually go totally private at some point."
5,"This is our Sunday after-church destination. Phenomenal hummus, pitas, pizza, and wraps. We like the hummus trio with grilled chicken, add extra pitas and cucumbers. After that go with the mahi mahi. Our kids love the lavash pizza and red lentil soup. Get a half and half of the tropical and green iced tea and they'll always offer up a to-go cup on the way out. \n\nMy wife and I walked to the PJ in Tempe off Apache during college and now have one within biking distance again! Great vibe, healthy delicious food, and good service!"
5,"The food was outstanding, as were the drinks. The decor is simple, but cool. Service was top notch. Worth the price tag!"
5,"Wow!!! Seriously, drop whatever your doing now and run to Greco Fresh Grille. The menu is simple; greek salads, pitas , gyros, kabobs, veggie options. I am on a bit of a health kick, so I asked if they could serve one chicken kabob with a side of grilled veggies(not on the menu). The cashier was more than accommodating,  and said it wouldn't be a problem. A few minutes later, she brought out my food.  First i took a bite of the grilled veggies They were flavorful, and not too salty. Next came the AMAZING chicken kabob. With out a doubt,  the best I've ever had, and that's coming for a girl who loves Greek food. It was tender, juicy, and seasoned to perfection with herbs/spices from the heavens.  I scarfed it down in 5 minutes! To top it all off, the owner and his staff were friendly & make you feel right at home. I will definitely be a regular at this place. It's a ten: great prices, fresh ingredients, and awesome service. I'm thrilled that I found this gem in South Charlotte! :)"
5,"I have family out in Vegas..And its a MUST to stop by when we come into, In the middle of our stay, and right before we leave. Carne asada fries are the shit! The shrimp Burrito is pretty gnarly too.."
5,"Heck yeah.  I love Beef Stand.  Cheese fries, check, meatball sub, check.  I am happy with those two things, though their italian beef and hot dogs are good too.  \n\nMy one critique is that the meatball sub is hard to eat; it's more like two huge meatballs accompanied by some bread and sauce.  Maybe that's part of the charm?  It's distressing for me because I can never seem to walk away from this place without getting some red sauce on my shirt.  This is why I never wear white."
5,"Our room faced the Bellagio shops which was absolute torture. I'm pretty sure when I die, heaven will reappear in this exact form (Chanel, Prada, Louis, Dior, Tiffany's). So when my friend told me she was considering purchasing a Prada bag, I almost died (of envy). \n\nSo we went into the store and the sales associate Charles Punzal was the absolute sweetest. He was patient and pulled practically every color option of saffiano leather totes we asked for. Definitely made the selection process a lot easier on us, and we left with the most gorgeous, black purse. \n\nWould recommend coming here and asking for Charles to help you out if you're thinking about making the financial plunge into timeless happiness."
5,"Home away from home. Great selection of Cigars, wrist watches and shaving products. Great place to hang out and have a smoke and watch sports on 6 large tv screens. No membership fees and you can also store you collection in the back room free of charge. Highly recommend Cigar King."
5,Dr Glassman has been a caring and thorough physician. He takes the time to make you feel at ease and important and he always explains everything so I can understand it. His staff is friendly and kind and they always remember my name and make me feel wwlcome. Highly recommend this Doctor to anyone!
5,"This place is fantastic! I've been there a few times for business lunches and everyone has always been happy. The pizzas are ample for one person or could be split if you also got a saled (which is huge). Everything looks and tastes fresh and I love that you can ask to have as much as you want piled on and it's still the same price. Although the line can back up at lunch (much like a Chipotle) since everything is made to order, the pizza is done in 3 minutes after being cooked in a hig-powered 550 degree oven. I don't think I've even had a problme finding any seatign even when the line is long. I actually think this pizza is better than 90% of pizza I've had elsewhere. To me, it's worthy of 5 starts. I just wish they had one right where I live."
5,"This place ruined all other Chinese restaurants for me. Seriously. I've eaten everything here that I can pronounce and even a couple things I can't. \n\nThe absolute MUST from this place is the tofu flower with spicy Szechuan sauce. It comes with pork or chicken in a broth of dried, fried whole chilies. It is smaller than it used to be, but still quite a lot of food. Worth every bit of pain you will feel the next day. In fact, you'll probably grow to like it. I recommend you ask for a dish of steamed broccoli (not on menu) to incorporate with the dish. \n\nOther homeruns include the seafood sizzling rice, cumin beef, Szechuan peppercorn anything, green beans and pork and the shallot beef. All so very, very good. Remember, though, when they say cumin (or any other spice/flavor), they really, really mean it. \n\nRating Scale:\n1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  \n2 Star: Risky at best. \n3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.\n4 Star: I eat here regularly if financially and calorically feasible.\n5 Star: I'm comfortable taking other chefs here."
5,Bun Bo Hue.... that is all I have to say. You don't always find bun bo hue with that much flavor but this place has it all. I'll be back for sure
5,"I am 100% confused by the one star rating on here. \n\nI'm a newbie bicyclist/triathlete and just trying to learn the ins and outs of bike maintenance. I knew my gears were being wonky and I suspected it was my derailleur but I know just enough to make an educated guess and then turn it over to someone that actually has a real clue. Being a newbie I was a bit worried about being taken advantage of or not being considered a \""real\"" biker with my 2nd hand Trek. \n\nI'm so glad I stumbled upon Espada's great reviews on Yelp. I easily found the shop right on North Davidson. Parking is like anywhere else in NoDa - sometimes easy, sometimes a pain in the ass. When you walk in you're in an art gallery/jewelry store/bike shop but no worries, bike shop in the back, easy to see. Steve isn't a huge chatter but he was able to take a look at my bike right away and I wondered around the shop as I waited. I asked some questions all of which he easily answered and his prices are beyond reasonable (I'd called around beforehand). I rode around yesterday and my bike is back in business. I never felt like he thought I asked a dumb question (I'm sure I did) and I certainly didn't feel like he tried to up-sale anything\n\nSo go support this local bike shop and check out the art while you wait."
5,"Where do I start? \nThe mixologist of course! Daniel was runnin the juice joint while June was out of town. Wow! The drinks that he made (his own), were A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Especially this one..... well, I can't tell you,  it's a secret. From beginning to end he was darb! No where else can you go and have a personal mixologist, in a private setting, and in Las Vegas, or anywhere! \nI can't really begin to decribe every single detail in this place. The thought that went into it is incredible.  Everywhere you look you see something else to appreciate. I don't want to spoil anything. So all I can say is trust the reviews! \nI also have to give a shout out to the talented piano player that played for us, Spidoni (I hope I got that right). He is there on Wed night only. Great guy and plays beautifully. \nOne last thing. I would definitely recommend going early. There are very few seats anyway, but my husband and I sure enjoyed having Dan, just about all to ourselves!\nTruly the BEST experience and can't wait to return!"
5,Macaroni and cheese with martini...a great way to end a long day. And the music in the bar area doesn't suck.
5,"As a local, it would make ZERO sense for me to go to Planet Hollywood for a sandwich. So my 5 star rating shouldn't be misconstrued as me saying I would frequent them all the time, but rather based on convenience and price compared to what you typically find in a Las Vegas casino. At $6 you would be hard pressed to find a better sandwich on the Vegas strip. Is it the best sandwich I have ever had? Certainly not. However, with warm bread, tasty meat and relatively quick service... you can't beat Earl of Sandwich. Added bonus is that it is directly across from the Sports Book... grab a sandwich and go sit and watch a game. \nI agree with Misti that they have a major lack of options for not only bread but toppings and sauces. No oil and vinegar? How does a sandwich shop not have oil and vinegar?\nSandwich is not overly filling, which could be either good or bad depending on how you look at it. Heading to see Peepshow? Probably don't want to sit through that on an overstuffed stomach! Grab some Earl and you will be good to go!\nI order the Full Montague (I believe) which has turkey and roast beef. Consistently good and they have not messed up an order of mine yet."
5,"Cornerstone is what one may call a \""Mega Church\"" and it is mega-sized for sure.  But the interesting thing I have found is that the size of the church actually enables it to be whatever you want it to be.  Sure, you could come to Sunday services every week for a year and never see the same person twice, but if you are looking for a deeper community, there is literally something for everyone.  Be it a class, small church, support group, or other gathering, you can find whatever is right for you for your place in life.  Or if it's the anonymity of a large church you're looking for, that's definitely possible... with smiling faces all around and a really great energy.\n\nCornerstone offers a coffee shop/cafe area, bookstore, a ton of volunteer opportunities, men's ministries, women's ministries, retreats, mission trips, top-tier worship leaders, sermons that dig in to the bible and provide real-life context, and thoughtful kids programs.\n\nYou can feel confident dropping your children off while you're at the service, because they will be cared for by background-checked, well-trained individuals ready to teach your kid the week's bible lesson!  Babies mere weeks old are welcome, and the older kids have fun activities every week.\n\nCheck out a service to see what it's all about, and stop by the information booths for further direction!"
5,"This was our first time eating here and we had an amazing experience! Our chef and waiter were very friendly and attentive. The food was amazing!! We got fried rice, chicken, New York steak, filet mignon, shrimp, and lobster. The filet mignon and shrimp were the best I've ever had... Definitely a must! I wish I had gotten our chef's name. All of the food was seasoned and cooked to perfection. Our 7 year old absolutely loved it and was begging to come back again. We will be back very soon!"
5,"Now this airport Is much nicer. Not perfect, but much better than one in Texas Huston. \n\nPeople are welcoming. All is good. A lot stores and restaurants. I love to shop while I'm waiting for my flight. So it's all good."
5,Really beautiful place. Must go see - herb garden - TOUCH N FEEL was really good. Otherwise really big place and definitely can cater to an event. Thai Garden was also good.
5,"I love me some Merc Bar, it's tres chic from it's comfy couches to it's awesome staff.  The drinks are indeed pricey but they pack a punch so it really all evens out in the end. How can you not love a bar that's got a twin in NYC and lets you dance on the tables?!"
5,"Allan Wolper did an interview with Natalie Bauman of Bauman Rare Books last year! \n\nHere's the link, her interview is near the bottom of the page: http://www.wbgo.org/news/ondemand/wolperArchives.php"
5,"I have no idea why this place has 3.5 stars... I thought the place was absolutely amazing!  I get it that these are some expensive burgers... but they are also very VERY delicious! This IS Vegas, and for Vegas I thought the price was pretty reasonable.\n\nI had the Tenderloin Rossini under the Tiny Buns section.  They were two mini burgers of BEEF MEDALLION WITH FOIE GRAS, WILD MUSHROOM, ARUGULA AND TRUFFLE MAYO.  It was so good... It was a perfect portion too!\n\nOther burgers that I recommend are the Rising Sun and Duck Duck Goose.\n\nIt's casual, its comfortable, and definitely a perfect place to go to if you want to avoid bougie and expensive restaurants on the strip.  I thought the service was great... I'm sure other people had different experience with the service depending on what server they got, but ours was very nice :)"
5,"So a few years ago my brother tells me this story about how a few high rollers from New York wanted their pool cabana catered by a local deli.  To make a long story short these guys wanted some of the best and authentic New York style deli and Italian food in Las Vegas.  \n\nSo we figure lets go check this place out. I'm proud to say that after about 5 years this is still one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas.  And that's not even with me getting to the food.  Julia and her family are the nicest, kindest,  sweetest people on this earth.  It doesn't matter if it's been a day, a week,  or a few months,  they take the time to chat with you.  Ask how the family has been and always have a smile on their faces. That awesome attitude translates into the food.  Fresh sauces made daily,  authentic New York style pizza,  garlic knots to die for,  and those rice balls.  When I first started going to Cugino's they weren't regularly available,  you had to ask or pre order them.  I always get the larger rice balls with the meat inside.  If you are eating in store ask them to heat it up and put some sauce and cheese on top. Everything from a basic plate of spaghetti to the linguini and clams is always top notch,  hot and amazingly fresh."
5,"Best pizza I've found in Summerlin. Lots of fresh toppings and great flavor. Not the cheapest pizza, but worth it."
5,Partying all night in Vegas would not be complete without a night at Drais! Hot hot crowd. Coool people. Easy to get in. Not easy to leave.
5,The ambiance was the only thing I didn't love about this place but even that was fine. The food was interesting/unique and the service was exceptional. James our server took our experience to the next level. This place was worth all of the recommendations we got from friends
5,"Loved my experience at Nevada Nails! Diem did a great job on my nails and was so nice and personable. Definitely made a mani/pedi even more enjoyable. I loved how many colors they had to choose from - lots of regular polish colors and hundreds of gel colors, including Rockstar. They have a special right now for a gel mani/reg pedi for $45, which is a great price. I can't wait to go back and be pampered again!"
5,"Very cool people, a good mix of independence and help. Very team oriented. Really cool box and loved the programming. Thanks Joe!!"
5,"Had the Fried Chicken it was cooked to perfection hot, crisp and juicy! The crew was friendly and accommodating all food cooked and prepared to order. Service was fast and friendly . If they are on your area give them a try you won't be disappointed !"
5,"Man, what can I say?  The absolute best.  Always excellent customer service, always consistent beverages.  What more could you want from a five minute stop on the way to work?\n\nCory and Lexi hold it down in the AM and are always on point with everything.  On my second visit, they remembered what my drink of choice was on my first.  Amazing!  If I get the same thing several visits in a row, it's sitting there ready for me by the time I get to the window (I assume they see me pull up into line or park and walk up).\n\nI am SO glad they opened up here in Phoenix... who knew what we were missing."
5,"Yum! I was visiting Montreal and my friend suggested this place. Delicious burgers, sandwiches, fries, salads and beers! Mmm. Everything is reasonably priced. I had the Bac'n'Cheese burger with half fries and half salad and it was sinfully delectable!\n\nDefinitely good bang for your buck! Hit this place up if you're in the area!"
5,After reading all the negative comments about their customer service I was apprehensive going in there this afternoon. But I've shopped at their London and Swiss stores and love the brand. I must admit all those fears came to naught. All the girls were very helpful. Especially the girl in the changing area. She helped me diligently for the almost 2 hrs I was there. All the staff were most helpful and prompt in checking for sizes. Great experience overall!
5,"best apple experience ever! Super quick and easy. I had a broken screen and was given a brand new phone under warranty. Byrd is the best, very friendly and knowledgable !!"
5,"Even though Dreyer's ice cream is available everywhere, it seems to taste better between two fresh baked cookies. You can even get two different cookie flavors and my choice was double choc. chip and red velvet. Peanut Butter cup ice cream was placed in the middle and off to Mill we go to eat as I walked past the hobo drawing photos nearby. Great sandwich to eat while walking, nice staff member and a great deal for 2 bucks."
5,I discovered George's through my restaurant.com coupon.  My girlfriend and I ordered two original Gyros.  I had the fries and she had the salad.  We also ordered the fried mushrooms and jalopeno poppers.  The fried appetizers came out first.  And they were perfect!  We have had fried mushrooms in the past that were dripping in grease or still frozen in the middle.  These were absolutely done to perfection.  They were crispy and seasoned without leaving you feeling greasy.  The gyros and fries were also well done.  The portions were generous for the price.  This is my new Gyro spot for sure.
5,"My Wife had read that the bar at the Capital Grille had a good menu and after checking the reviews it appeared to be a good choice. We went to the restaurant and were greeted by a very attentive hostess who immediately began to seat us. We asked if we could sit in the bar and she said yes and seated us in the bar. \nthe bar was empty as the restaurant had just opened however there was a bartender there preparing for the day. She greeted us very nicely and brought us the menus. She then explained the various items on the menu that we asked about and then took our orders. As she was leaving my wife made a comment to me about my birthday however I did not know the bartender had heard the comment. \nThe bartender then brought us our wine and appetizer which was incredible. We tried the Ahi Tuna Sashimi which was incredible. After that we had the Capital Grille Burger and truffle fries which was also incredible. For desert we had the flourless chocolate cake and once again it was incredible, especially with a glass of port. \nAfter a great meal the check was delivered to us at which time the bartender said that it was my Birthday and that they recognize this and provided our appetizer and the desert at no charge; what a wonderful thing to hear. \n\nWe had a great time, great food, great wine and outstanding service. We will be back."
5,"Wayne, oh, Wayne--you and your staff could not have been more amazing for our bar mitzvah Shabbat dinner at Greasewood!!!  Not only was the food really tasty and the atmosphere super fun, but you also handled our very serious food allergies with such patience and detail. From showing us labels to bringing in special buns, you really went above and beyond.  The night could not have been more perfect. How can we thank you enough?  All I can say is I so hope that this gem of a place is saved - what a loss it would be to Scottsdale if this place closes. Save Greasewood!!!!!"
5,"Thank you, Nikko, for the best sushi we've had in a while! \n\nWe felt special from the superb valet parking service to...well...the superb valet parking service when we left!\n\nWe sat at the sushi bar and enjoyed a lovely sampler platter last Saturday, including sashimi, nigiri sushi and a tasty slightly spicy tuna roll.  For a couple of hungry people, the Sushi/Sashimi Omakase is a great value at about $36.  We also shared Age Dashi Tofu with Shrimp, served piping hot with an amazingly rich (almost beefy) dashi broth.  House sake is good.\n\nThis place has incredible atmosphere, and is a great 'night out on the town' place to go.  Decor is gorgeous and modern.  We were dressed pretty casual, but didn't feel under-dressed.  The sushi bar is fun and lively - and the prep line is impeccably clean and orderly.  Fish is fresh-fresh-fresh.  The chefs are well-trained and conscientious.  Bravo to the ownership and management.\n\nFriday and Saturday nights, if you are in the restaurant around 7:30 or 8, you will feel a transformation as the lighting changes and the DJ starts mixing.  It gets LOUD.  But it's fun.  Nikko has great energy!  This is one of Charlotte's best."
5,AMAZING!!!!! No need to bore you with the details. Look at the youtube vid for the food network that will tell you all you need to know.
5,"I've been to this place a couple times and I've constantly been blown away. It's a bit small and unassuming, but this restaurant is big where it counts.\nThe freshness of the ingredients really shines and the prices are great.\nI recommend you try one of the \""specialty\"" items for everyone in your group and ask them to serve them to you back-to-back so you can share. They'll bring you one item at a time until you finish it, at which point another even more delicious dish will be brought out! This way you can try more food, enjoy more flavour and it's a great sharing experience. I'd also recommend having some papaya salad and spring roll to whet your appetite before your feast.\nI love this place!"
5,"My wife and I love this place.  The service is always excellent and every dish we've had is off the hook.  I love the shrimp and grits and the shrimp poboy.  The poboy is the best I've had outside of New Orleans when I lived there.  My wife loves the scallops which is an occasional special.  Great for kids, too, and our 6-year-old daughter loves it.  \n\nLast time we were there, our daughter wanted to walk around and talk to the hostess and they became bff's and then she met the chef.  He was super friendly as well.  Everybody is very accommodating and tolerated a talkative, charming 6-year-old.\nGreat job!!"
5,"Such a wonderful exhibit! I came here with high hopes and they were far exceeded. The entire exhibit is so well put together. Touching a \""real\"" iceberg to feel how cold it is. They have the perfect mix of Science and History in here, the way the museum leads you from one point to the next is so surreal. You have an entirely new understanding when you leave. The ending board where you see if you lived or died is especially interesting!"
5,"I have to give credit to my husband on this one.  We finally got better insurance coverage so I told my husband we needed to switch dentist.  He was in need of a cleaning before the end of the year, so I told him to find someone as soon as possible.  This was a week ago.  I was impressed that he found this office and he even found a spot for me the same day.  The front office was really easy to deal with and my hygienist Deann was very nice and professional.  The doctor came to do the check up and told me that if there was an emergency, he is the one answering the phone, so no answering service to deal with.  That is awesome.  Although I hope I don't have any emergencies."
5,"I was looking for a great family spring break activity and I found it!   We are not experienced riders and were not looking for an all day adventure, the 1.5 hour ride proved to be just the right amount of time. Great scenery, great horses, very nice staff...just a great all around experience. \n\nOur cowboy, Dave, was really good at pointing out local history, flowers, etc. and was very patient with my 9 and 12 year old children."
5,"Best start to my days and always a favorite amongst visiting family and friends. Can't beat the cupcakes or breakfast! Also a great place to drink coffee, relax, hangout or study."
5,"I knew I wasn't trippin' when I saw a skinny, dancing banana at the house party I went to last night, A. because I was sober (boooo), and 2. because it was Halloween. But today, right in the middle of a post Halloween funk/Sunday blues combo, I started to wonder if maybe I was slipped something last night, when Mr. Incredible who was there too, greeted me at Pink Spot. To protect his identity I won't say who it was, but the tomato, egg, bacon, avocado sandwich with chipotle mayo, sprouts and American cheese on wheat bagel he made me, truly hit the spot, and the mocha was just what I needed to lift me out of my forlorn state. It's a good thing they have free wi-fi here, because that's why I'm yelping. I'm going to go ahead and throw a solid five stars at these guys because they genuinely accomplished something that trumps, taste, price or ambiance; they served up a generous helping of good humor. And it wouldn't hurt to up their star count a little after that dreadful Megan D imposed her two stars. Who does she think she is anyway, trolling around Phoenix handing out miserable reviews? Wait... go back to that happy place Dugaldo. Happy place. Pink Spot."
5,I had the lamb dumplings which were flavorful and I would highly recommend.  Very friendly service from the staff.  And I cherished the more traditional Chinese  seaweed served as the salad.  I'll be coming back just to find this salad.
5,Talk about selection and of the higher caliber! This is an awesome smoke shop! Their selection is huge and so is their variety! Not only do they have some amazing pieces but they also have some awesome artwork and even have a hallway that they use as an art gallery. If you're looking for a budget piece to smoke out of they have them for you there too but they mainly focus on higher end pieces which are all like works of art.\n\nThey also sell caps if you do graff art work and a beverage fridge to purchase some tasty Arizonas.
5,We ate here on a Friday night and were able to get right in. The food was quick and fantastic! I wanted to take three more orders to go. If I had the room in my hotel mini fridge I would have. Noodles were cooked perfectly. The pot stickers were made from scratch which is hard to find sometimes. The fried wontons were filled with something other then cream cheese which was a really nice change. The sake was one of the best we've ever had. Would recommend this place to everyone.
5,"I have been coming here for 6 years and have always had an amazing experience.  The bartenders are always friendly - and in the dinning room, Jen is an absolute amazing person to have serve you.   Also, way cheaper for quality drinks right next to the strip."
5,"Heard about this interesting steak house from Lindsay, my Yelping 'go to' and I am grateful. What a fun night, feeling \""Mad Men' ish as we walked through the kitchen when entering the restuarant. \n\nAtmosphere was amazing and the food.... WOW. My fav had to be the amazing steak and bean chili/soup.... fantastic.\n\nSteaks were our of this world and the mushrooms... devine.\n\nWhen entering the restaurant we greeted by helpful eager staff ... with each one adding input into our experience.... especially Patti, our server. She was helpful, informative, fun and sealed the deal of a fantastic night. Thanks"
5,"What a surprise! Came here from a recommendation by a friend, and it lived up to it's rep. It's got a nice, trendy, modern sort of atmosphere, and combined with tasty Thai fusion (I don't know if I'd call it 100% traditional) - it's a definite hit!  We'll be back again"
5,Usually when I expect something to be amazing it sucks. This place was actually as good as I thought it would be. I ordered the famous chicken and waffles :) good stuff...between my sis and I we barely finished it. The place is good.. def worth a try and I def would go again when I'm in Vegas.
5,"Love it.  \nGreat Place, nice Location.  \n\nMaybe a happy Hour Would be Great. ;-) \n\nManager i forgot his Name greated & seated us immediatly & was so nice. Explained everything.  \n\nOut waiter Ron or Ross??? I think Ross was nice & attentive\n\nFood : we ordered Pizza & mushrooms. It was excellent \nSalat was Great Too\n\nSizes are huge & Perfect to Share. \nWill  be back soon."
5,"I came here with several folks and we got cocktails, shots, steaks of all sorts, and some sides.\n\nThe steak is legiiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!!! I shared the NY 16oz with the booface and I don't know if we were starving or if the steak was just THAT amazing but we couldn't stop salivating even at the last bite of medium rare heaven. I tried some of the other people's filets which which also mouth watering.\n\nThe sides (creamed spinach, potatos, asparagus, mac n'cheese) were also good though the meat was definitely the star of the show.\n\nOther mentionables: friendly service with a waitress with nice arms and strong cocktails. The price is hefty but you kinda realize that going to a place like this in Vegas."
5,"I have been going to Don & Charlies for years and am amazed how consistant the food and service is. Love the creamy cole slaw, liver, Seattle Salmon and especially the ribs. The memoriabelia is a Major League plus."
5,"I have been to Rosemary's for Lunch (now only on Fridays) & Dinner multiple times in the last four years.  They always provide great food, service & value.  I like that they provide wine & beer pairings with each course.  Nice bar/lounge area where you can get a \""small plates\"" menu or anything off the regular menu.  I recommend the BBQ shrimp & salmon tartar apps.  They also have great seasonal soups.  For entrees I like the scallops, crispy skin bass & the steaks.  Sunday nights they have half off bottles of wine.  They also have many beer & wine dinners during the year."
5,"I recently took NCT's level 1 Improv Workshop and I LOVED it.  My first class I awkwardly sat on stage and nervously laughed and couldn't come up with anything.  By the end of the class, I was kung-fu-ing my way to rescue Princess Miyuki with a prince who still lived with his parents.\n\nThe class focuses on the basics of Improv - listening, \""yes, and\"", relationships, responding emotionally and staying rooted in reality.  Dorian was able to provide consistent guidance and constructive criticism to move me forward as an actor.  The other students are equally awesome, as everyone is at least some form of funny.  \n\nI would recommend (and do recommend!) everyone I know at least take a level 1 improv class, and I love the people at NCT.  The skills I've gained from 6 weeks of workshop have already helped me become a better listener and improviser at work, as well as with friends.  Looking forward to more Improv with NCT in the future!"
5,"I read the reviews and couldn't believe we hadn't tried The Deli with it being so close to home.\n\nThis place has it all. Great service and a new take on fresh local food plus a little cocktail lounge on the weekends when there is a long wait for a table.\n\nThe hummus with warm freshly made crackers is a must order. I ordered the half sandwich and chicken and corn chowder it was so good, but I couldn't finish it because it was so filling, but not in a heavy greasy way - just very satisfied with a delicious meal. We had to try their homemade ice cream and it did not disappoint either. The Peanut Butter ice cream was YUMMY! Everything that we ordered surpassed our expectations.\n\nIf you haven't tried this place - stop what you are doing and go check it out!!!!"
5,"Go to Sweet Republic this week and say, \""I support Bake for Hope,\"" and they will donate a portion of their proceeds to Bake for Hope.  Bake for Hope is a charity that is raising breast cancer awareness and providing proceeds of nationwide bake sales to local Susan G Komen for the Cure affiliate offices.  On this Saturday, Bake for Hope will be there to sell our delicious homemade cupcakes, brownies, and cookies.  It is the PERFECT pairing- cake and ice cream!"
5,Steve's communication and professionalism is exceptional. I had a dent that the dealer and Dent Pros said could not fixed but Steve was able to do it. \n\nSteve was good at setting expectations and estimating price. \n\nIf I ever get another dent this will be where I go.
5,"I will make this brief.   This is not just the best Scottish pub in Pittsburgh, this might be the best pub / bar / restaurant in Pittsburgh - period. \n\nFOOD\nLove the scotch eggs but the cardiologist said to only have these once a decade.  Stilton and Rasher salad is incredible.  Pub burger is the BEST!  Reuben and Fish & Chips are excellent.  Open face roast beef on italian bread covered with a dark/rich whisky onion gravy and a side of half-mashed red potatoes = ultimate comfort food.  So many other great options - you cannot go wrong!\n\nDRINK\nLove the beer list.  There is a focus on imports but they also have a dozen or so excellent PA craft beers on the list.   This place takes everything that they do seriously - the beer tastes fresh and the lines are clean.  If you are a fan of scotch whiskey, the list at Piper's Pub cannot be beat - http://piperspub.com/scotch/\n\nSOCCER / FOOTBALL\nFans of the beautiful game rejoice - you have found your home at Piper's Pub.  This place is packed during the big games and they get satellite feeds beyond ESPN and Fox Soccer Channel.   Every once in a while, I get my boys out of school early and we throw on the EPL jerseys and we go catch an afternoon game at Piper's Pub with other raving lunatic fans.  This place is worth a 2 hour drive if you are not in the Pittsburgh area.\n\nDefinitely deserving of 5 stars.  Love it!"
5,"Most know Rosati's for pizza and take out, but they have so much more including an eat in dinning room.  There pizza is great, but you also need to try the ribs and fries, chicago hot dogs, and pastas.  They have dinning room specials every night that are an incredible deal!"
5,"What a difference good customer service makes!!\n\nFor my second visit I took my with daughter with me. \nI called before heading over to make sure they had room for us. The person who answered the phone was friendly, improvement right off the bat!\n\nWhen we arrived we were immediately greeted kindly & given an option of 2 tables that were open. The place was packed, but while our server was available, her co-worker took our drink order & got us started. Our server was WONDERFUL. Seriously :) \n\nThe food was absolutely delicious. My daughter is a teen, & anyone who has teens knows that they are hard to please. I was a little worried that the menu would be a little too adult for her, but luckily that wasn't the case. She ordered the The Cabernet Burger with, what she calls, the perfect french fries :) , & I got the best Meatloaf Sandwich. To drink our server recommended a French lemonade to my daughter because I ruled out wine & she doesn't like dark sodas. The lemonade was a big hit :)\n\nThe entire experience, like the fries, was perfect & we both can't wait to go back!"
5,"I probably will never buy a cake from anywhere else.  I am totally spoiled. I was treated like a Queen, the shop itself is lovely, and the cake??? OMG!!  I've tried two now, and both were beyond delicious. I bought one small one for my husband for our anniversary and another large one for my daughter's birthday.  It didn't just taste amazing, they took such care in wrapping and appearance.  The customer service is the best I've experienced since I've moved here.  Price? I thought it would be along the same line as the cakes I used to buy in KC where I moved from.  Nope, not as much.  The prices are great.  I LOVE this place!!!!"
5,"Phone in your orders because they're cooking your food to order.\n\nMy last year of undergrad, I called in so many times the guy knew my voice (when I changed my phone number, he still recognized me).\n\nI could eat a half dark meal every day."
5,"I just found this place last week 12/31, 2014, the last day of 2014. I have to say, their crepe is the most delicious I have had. So so good!!! I also love their coffee! The service is good too. The waiter is friendly and cute! He gave me free small and cute desert and starter. ;-). You probably have to wait for a while to get your food. But I suggest you just laid back and enjoy the waiting and the atmosphere of the store."
5,"Five years in Edinburgh and I had never been to Palmyra; last night this little void was filled. I came here with a friend at 10pm, frustratingly everything else in town seemed closed.\n\nI ordered a small falafel (\u00a33.50) but got a 10% student discount upon showing my university card, making it a \u00a33.15 falafel! The falafel looked as though it had not been previously frozen, the hummus was clearly homemade and the wraps were like the ones you get in Lebanon. The wrap was generously packed with salad, falafel and hummus and then toasted and conveniently wrapped in tin foil and a napkin.\n\nThe lighting inside is a bit dreary, as one expects when it comes to kebab shops, so we took the wraps home. They were super tasty! Fresh, filling and tasty. I couldn't finish mine as it was so big!\n\nI will definitely be back when it need of something cheap, tasty and filling, though advise taking away!"
5,OMG Yelpers - thanks so much for your recommendations - we were in Vegas for the weekend and didn't want to eat on the Strip. We drove out to this place for dinner because of all of the Yelp reviews and it was fantastic. Everything was delicious and authentic (and spicy!) and the service was great too. We cannot wait to come back - yay!
5,"I finally got the chance to stay at Encore and holy beejesus, the rooms are absolutely beautiful.  There really aren't words to describe how gorgeous and luxurious the rooms are.  I've stayed at almost every single big hotel on the strip and this is the nicest by leaps & bounds.  The rooms are big, the bathrooms are big.  Even the hallway from the door to the bedroom is longer than my last apartment's.  We had a beautiful view of the pools.  The bedroom and living room are separated.  I can tell the casino was definitely decorated to appeal to Asians.  Everything is red and gold, with dragons, lucky dogs, and butterflies everywhere.  If I could afford to, I'd stay at Encore on every one of my trips to Vegas.  I'd give it 20 stars if I could."
5,"My sisters and I all went to Vegas to celebrate our youngestest sisters 21st!  We originally made plans to eat at another restaurant but ended up at Lavo...and I'm sooo glad we did!  One of the best meals i've had.  We all ordered something different; kobe stuffed rice balls, clams, sea bass, pene ala vodka and for dessert tiramisu.  Everything was delish and we had a great time at the nightclub upstairs!  I would go back in a heartbeat!"
5,"Outstanding dentist and outstanding staff. The dental assistant is excellent in assisting you with understanding your dental coverage. She knows how to work with your dental insurance to get maximum results. I came to this dentist because I needed emergency dental work. The scheduling of an appointment was smooth, and service was prompt. No long waits. I was misinformed by another dentist that I had no coverage for dental implants when I actually had 70 percent coverage under my existing insurance plan. THANK YOU! My dental implant work was also well done.This is a very competent and professional operation."
5,"holla atcha baba ganoush!\n\nomfg, LOVE this place.  i hadn't been before one of the soldiers i work with said she wanted some hummus & chicken.  \n\n\""hummus?\"" says i.  \""i shall venture out to retrieve this prize for you, if you will man my station for the duration of my investigation of this location.\""\n\nanyway!  i went out to grab lunch for my co-workers in the lab.  as the reigning queen of indecision, i decided to get the mediterranean combo.  best decision of my LIFE...well...maybe weekend.  but STILL!  the baba ganoush is my new fave thing!  the hummus was AWEsome!  they gave me a whole pack o' pitas.  A PACK...they didn't even take them out of the bag.  HOLLA!  and i know this sounds weird, but the croquette things tasted like burritos i used to buy for like...a buck and microwave.  might sound gross, but in reality, i would eat those burritos everyday if they weren't disgustingly bad for me.  so BONUS!\n\ni got hummus for another soldier, he LOVED it.  i heard that the gyro was to die for AND the hummus/chicken combo was DE-LI-CI-OUS.  gotta get it with the lime/cilantro hummus.  PLUS, i got all this for less than 40 bucks!\n\nyou'll see me here again, in a t-shirt that says \""baba ganoush is my homie\"""
5,Wonderful locally owned boutique. Carries great brands you can't find everywhere and amazing staff. Very quaint store. I highly recommend checking out Shop Pepper.
5,"Hands down! This is the best Yelp decision I have ever made. Ever since I yelped Sushi places in Las Vegas and came across this gem, it has been nothing but amazing! The staff is super friendly and recognizes you after have eaten there a couple handfuls of times. \n\nThe Happy Hour menu is small but everything is AMAZINGLY prices and I love the Sake choices! (Lychee Cold Sake is my favorite). \n\nMy boyfriend and I even came here for a Non-Happy Hour dinner and everything was delicious. The chef gave us some Cajun Albacore on the house and that blew my mind. The next visit, we are letting him take control on what we eat because it was that delicious! \n\nSoho, you have customers for life!"
5,"One day Brett came in to my store ( Home Depot )  with his family to rent a tool. I recognized him since I watch the show. I happened to help him since he was next in line.  He was really a nice guy and very friendly. When I helped him to his car since the tool he rented was very heavy to lift. We chatted for a bit. Before going, he said for me to come in to the shop for a tour of the shop. Of course I accepted. Days later I went to the shop. Someone at the front desked walked me to his office. He did recognize me and kept his word about the tour. I met some of the workers. Everyone was very friendly. I got showed some exotic fish, the back area where they make the tanks. Met a few of their birds lol. It was a good experience. Thank you to ATM"
5,"Compared to the palazzo, this (Caesars) store is much bigger in terms of their display cases so my gf got to try on and see what's in season."
5,Amazing beef rib & baby back pork ribs!!! Super cute place & great prices...the outlaw burger was ok..not so great as i expected it to be..
5,"Yes indeed! This is by far the most authentic Mexican food I have ever tasted in the US. Born in  Chicago but raised in Mexico, this is why my taste buds are very familiar with Mexican cuisine. I ate the Mole Verde and it was fantastic. Besides the great food and margaritas, the place is just amazingly stunning! They have this gorgeous art work that is a wooden piece of Mexico history... I cant find words to explain so please feel free to check the youtube link below you will not have regrets it!  \n\n http://youtu.be/of2E6GAXStg"
5,Famous Dave's ribs are the best in town and I've tried a lot of different barbecue houses. Their wedge potatoes are incredibly delicious and the corn bread muffins are awesome. The service is friendly and the place is clean with an open roomy atmosphere. This is one of my favorite restaurants and I recommend it to anyone who likes barbecue.
5,I highly recommend the groomers who work here. workers and the owner are really caring. I've been a long time customer of this store because of their groomer and really great customer service.
5,"Ever since we moved into our place a few years back this has been our favorite and only place to go for donuts.  A very popular and renowned donut shop has since been opened in our area, but Rainbow Donuts can't be beat!  After going to the new one once or twice we realized how much better Rainbow Donuts is.  They're always friendly, always delicious, and always a very wide variety of all the flavors you'd expect.  Highly recommended!"
5,"Britney Clark was fantastic with her services! We met her and gave her all the information necessary to serve our party.\n\nWe handed her an OOP along with a picture of the person needed to be served, and she was able and successful at serving her within 5 minutes!\n\nMoney well spent, thank you Britney!"
5,"aw man, this is a far, sketchy walk from the quad at 2:30am but worth it!\ni kept going back up for more and more spicy adobada tacos- they were so freaking good.  i thought that the asada meat was a little dry but delightful nonetheless.\n\nthis is not gastronomie, it's street food at it's finest and probably the most authentic taco experience i've ever had."
5,"I love this place!  You can always find something great eat.  I recently went for a friends birthday.  I would recommend their outdoor dining area.  It's a pretty decent size and you will have to wait if you don't make reservations even during the week for lunch.  We had my favorite appetizer, the bacon wrapped dates.  I love the arugula salad that comes under the dates.  They also give you bread and olive oil pesto dip.  That's a meal in itself.  We ordered the chicken chopped salad which was delicious!  We told the waiter that all four of us were going to share so he brought it out already divided in four bowls.  We also had the margarita flat bread and the sweet potato cannelloni that was to die for!  We also ordered the cheeseburger that was cut into four as well.  The server also brought out a chocolate cake with ice cream for our friends birthday.  We experienced great customer service!  We will be back soon.  Probably for happy hour since it's a good one!"
5,"Seriously one of the best meals I've ever eaten. Ordered the Wellington, chorizo stuffed lobster tail, onion soup, green salad & rib eye. All absolutely amazing! Service was awesome place was cool worth every penny. If you are havin hard time thinking prices are high it's def worth it. Will go back my next Vegas trip!"
5,Loved finding this unique and tasty restaurant off the strip for our vacation! The food was a  pleasant twist on the authentic flavors. Since my husband has taken trips to Spain this was a real comfort food trip for him. \n\nBe sure to try different tapas and share them in the standard Spanish tradition. We also enjoyed the Paella. A must for Vegas.
5,"My husband and I were out and about with our two youngest when we happened upon this place. We decided to check it out. Wow! Am I glad we did. \n     I did the Build Your Own Bowl and had tofu, no carb option (twice the veggies), with the green curry sauce. The tofu is organic non-GMO and everything I ordered was vegetarian. It was incredible! Fresh veggies, perfectly grilled tofu, and the sauce was spicy and flavorful. \n   My husband ordered a spicy tuna roll and the cucumber salad. He was very happy with the flavors.\n   My son (22 months) had the kids teriyaki chicken with noodles. The kids get the option of having a cookie or mandarin oranges. My son had the oranges. It also comes with a drink. My infant daughter passed on the food. ;-)\n  It's a sit down/take out place. You order at a counter and they bring the food to you. The service is speedy and the prices are good.\n   We were able to eat a delicious, healthy meal for about $20 for all of us. In a country where fast food has become a staple in many people's diet, Tokyo Joe's is a breath of fresh air. \n   If you eat meat you're covered. Pescatarian? They have fish. Vegetarian?  No problem. \n    I will definitely be back!"
5,"I'm going to give this place 5 stars only because I feel bad I kinda threw up on their floor... \n\nI'm really sorry, Jimmy. I was really trashed!!"
5,"This is exactly what Vegas started out as.  It's what it's supposed to be about. A great live jazz band, beautiful women that are great dancers and a wonderful singer. I would recommend this show to anyone looking for something to see in Vegas."
5,The service was awesome. I called them last second for an order of chocolate dipped strawberries and they were able to get them for me.
5,"Another truly amazing Cirque show that needs to be seen.  The acts in this show, I believe, are the most dangerous acts I've seen in all the Cirque shows in Vegas.  The mastery of skills that were on display during the show is just incredible to watch.  The athleticism required to perform the stunts leaves me speechless."
5,"Feeling yucky one day and wanting nothing but some reminders of my bay area asian food... My search began with my iPhone for Pho.. AND I wanted good Pho.. (Im skeptical of some dishes in the desert, just sayin'!).. I drove a good 20min from my loft to find this place.. worth it. Usual toppings you will find with real Vietnamese Pho.. but awesome! I asked for a variety of tofu and seafood.. I couldnt finish it all.. but never can with Pho.. its a big bowl, and filling! \nExtras on tables to get your Pho on.. \nOrdered the Vietnamese Shrimp Rolls too.. left feeling not so stuffy! AND full.. OH yeah, and I still had money for a bit of shoe shopping the next day... :-)"
5,"I have been searching for a computer repair place to upgrade my tower PC from Windows XP to Windows 7 and migrate all my Outlook Express files to Outlook.  Apparently this sounds too involved to the 5 or 6 companies I approached only 2 ever even gotten back to me but quoted me open-ended service charges I never went.  Anyway, just when I was desperate to get this done, this new store opened up right next to the UPS Store where I rent a box.  Joe at the UPS Store told me how great Matt & Dave helped him with this laptop so I decided to give them a shot.  Boy am I glad I did!  A \""simple\"" job took from 6/13/14 to 6/24/14 but they kept at it despite how involved it got.  Others would have long given up but they honored their word and their price.  I am now typing this review on this \""new\"" computer.  I am soooooooooooooooooo glad I bumped into them.  Give them a try and you will not regret it.  They fix PCs, laptops, phones, TVs, tablets, etc.."
5,"I love luv-it.  My go to sundae is the western.  Lately I have branched out a bit and tried some of their flavors of the day.  I might just be used to my sundaes but I prefer them over a flavor of the day in a cone.  It is nice they offer different flavors though.  I will still give them a try from time to time.  There is almost always a line, even in the winter but there is plenty of people watching to do to pass the time.  I do wish they were open a little earlier but when I first started going they weren't open 7 days a week like they are now so I will take what I can get.  My fave downtown lunch is Viva Arepeas then dessert at Luv-It.  So good!  Oh yeah and make sure you bring cash, if you forget there is an atm in the mini mart next door."
5,"In town celebrating my son's wedding, I came in to Vo's looking for a pedi/mani/fill's for 5 people on 6/6/14, including the bride.  \nOne of the best experiences we'd ever had. We all agreed on that.  The fact it's family owned and operated makes for a great time.  From the customers to the staff, everyone was happy and engaging.  \nThank you Vo's for being so attentive and making us laugh. We loved our time with you."
5,"We came in here during a Yelp event and just wanted to draft a quick review. Julia was there for the event and gave us a very interesting class on chocolates and how she got started in the chocolate business. She was very upbeat and was very interesting.  She's accomplished a lot in her life. \n\nWhile at the event we were able to be lucky enough to sample 3 of her delicious desserts including the passion fruit cake, red velvet cake, and a chocolate moose while drinking a wonderful chocolate martini. Man they were just awesome!!! I know my wife was in heaven and we will make this a regular stop next time we are in the Biltmore!!"
5,"Incredible food and service!  I had their pumpkin curry,  very good... unlike many Thai restaurants this one has a heat scale from 1 to 5 and I ordered a 5.  Now I like my curry spicy but a 5 might have been too much.    Try the green tea ice cream,  its delicious.   I will return to this gem."
5,"It was almost the end of the day and I was able to get out of work a little early so I called D'Lisa. She was able to book me almost immediately ( within 40 minutes ) although it was last minute notice and so late in the day. When I arrived she was ready for me and offered me something cold to drink. She professionally and painlessly waxed my brows to a perfect arch. I will be back, wonderful experience wonderful everything!    Thank you!!"
5,"Yes, you can find a cheaper tire. I like this place because they offer a warranty and a bunch of other services with your tire purchase.\n\nAnother great thing - I was literally out of there in less than 15 minutes! Extra star for their awesome service!"
5,"Other quick-mex places charge you for adding fajita veggies, or extra salsa on the side, but Chipotle lets you ask for extra of almost any ingredient for free (*not double meat or guac.)  The portions are huge and the whole \""ethics of food\"" marketing is terrific.  When in doubt, I will happily eat here any time, with any number of friends.  :-)"
5,Go see Heather G! She's cut my hair the last few times and I won't go anywhere else .. She does a. Ice scalp massage and uses good styling products.
5,"I would not trust anyone but Connie to watch my dog.  The pictures she has posted of her clients are so cute and adorable.   She is so flexible and when she has watched my dog in the past, I would always get a text message about how she was doing.  Great place highly recommend."
5,"The best mussels ever, and great pastas and pizzas. my husbands favourite is the steak in Diablo sauce.   friendly staff and great atmosphere nice selection of wines  this is  my favourite italian restaurant"
5,"Five stars because it's a place were comfort food meets a classy and friendly atmosphere, meets a perfect and very attentive service. The duck breast was spectacular, I'd totally recommend having the duck. It took them longer than expected to bring us the starters and they came separately, and they took them off the bill. We were definitely delighted by great food and a great service."
5,We had a delightful early dinner on Saturday at Tina's!  The food was fantastic and we loved the laid back family atmostphere.  My daughter was with a friend and I and even she loved the food.  We spent quite a while having the unique experience of conversation and learning of this culture!  We all three cant wait to go back for yumminess and a warm atmosphere!  thanks Tina!
5,"Love scottsdale quarter and this store by far has the best semi annual sale selection. Organized, clean and I got wall flowers for $2 refills what a huge reflection will be back! A great asset to the shopping center!"
5,"I LOVE THE ABC STORE. \n\nI am used to loving the ABC Store in Hawai'i and this one in Vegas on the Strip is no exception!\n\nI love, love, love all the grocery selection. I was able to quickly get a gluten free lunch or breakfast here for cheap. And, oh yeah, stock up on Hawai'i-made stuff, too!\n\nTons of Hello Kitty Vegas souvenirs! If you are looking to get something awesome, DO YOUR SHOPPING HERE. Don't go anywhere else for a few groceries and stuff to bring home."
5,First time there and seriously impressed. The server did not stop moving once. She was the bartender and server and the place was fairly busy. Great atmosphere and the food was delicious. I'm still full but already thinking about what I'll have the next time I'm there.
5,"So, I just read some of the other reviews and YIKES!  I mean, I know we Madisonians LOVE all things local but since when did \""chain restaurant\"" automatically come to equal \""terrible, horrible crap\""? Being from Madison, I'm a huge supporter of local restaurants but why look down on a small company just because they're growing? I did a little research and Claddagh only has 15 pubs & they're all in the Midwest. And unlike most \""Irish\"" pubs in the states, they're are actually owned and operated by Irish people.  \n\nAs for the food, it's great.  They have hands down THE BEST Fish & Chips in town and their burgers are great!  They also have some fusion dishes on the menu that are pretty tasty.  I tried a bit of the Chicken Curry dish my sister got last time we were there and loving Indian food, I was a little skeptical of an Irish curry but it was delicious.  I got the BBQ Chicken Burger which was awesome.\n\nI'd say that more than anything though, the best thing about Claddagh is their Happy Hour!  My Bud Light was $1 if that tells you anything.\n\nAnd they DO have Spotted Cow so I'm not sure if the keg was just tapped when \""Aaron B.\"" went but they had it when we were there:)\n\nOh, and their patio is dog-friendly which is nice too."
5,The bone in ribeye was freakin delicious!  I am glad had a good experience at my first Emeril restaurant.  Hopefully my next one will be Commanders Palace in 2 years.  woot woot.
5,"We stayed here over the ASU move in weekend. We absolutely loved the rooftop deck with the pool and hot tub at night. The breakfast was amazing. Fresh fruit was delicious! The staff were so friendly, and they took us by shuttle when we needed it since we didn't have a rental car. Thanks, everyone! From our family in Wisconsin to yours. We will be back!"
5,"I used to tell people I don't eat sweets. Now I tell people I don't eat sweets except for cupcakes from Butter and Me.\n\nKelly's cupcakes are amazing. I have never tasted any icing that can compare to her butter cream. The cake has the perfect consistancy. \n\nI have tried cupcakes that have been recommended to me by friends and family members, and I have not been impressed. I have been consistantly wowed not only by Kelly's cupcakes, but also by her service.  Delivery is always as promised and on time, even on weekends!\n\nFollow her on twitter @butterandme"
5,"Urban Mutts has changed their name to So Fetch! I took my Saint Bernard and my cocker spaniel here. They did an UNBELIEVEABLE JOB! My Saint Bernard came in with an awful thick coat and she has a summer cut with a lion's tail that's PURPLE! She looks GORGEOUS. So Fetch did above and beyond to what I was expecting. Bridget, my St. Bernard, now has pigtails with beautiful Hawaiian flowers. She has never looked so girly. When I had my cocker spaniel done named Leo, I mentioned that I wanted the long hair shaved off and again, So Fetch did above and beyond and made him look handsome with his new clean cut appearance while keeping his signature ears and legs. To top everything off, Leo and Bridget now have glitter!"
5,"When I came here, I knew it would be hard to go to any other bar on campus again. Their beer selection is impressive to say the least. The range and caliber of the drink selection is great. \n\nI came here on a number of happy hours to meet with colleagues and friends and it has always been a pleasant experience. \n\nOne criticism (for myself or the owners) is that it is sometimes annoying that there are two Blind Pigs (the original and the brewery; one on walnut and the other on Neil) because oftentimes we get confused which one we are going to. If you are looking to get some food, I am afraid you are out of luck because they only have drinks. \n\nOn many occasions I went to the sandwich/bread shop to get appetizers and/or a meal and there were no objections. I call it: BYOF. Definitely the best place to go for a drink for those who love and appreciate good brews."
5,"I LOVE THIS PLACE. My second review, yes--but I wanted to see if I could add a sixth star. Came back here three more times, and every single time the owner has come out and talked to me. He's such a great guy and totally boosts this place. GO GO GO."
5,"A new benchmark has been set for pubs in Las Vegas. \n\nIn my initial review, I praised the amazing service and exceptionally friendly atmosphere of this hidden little gem on the western edge of town, but I also mentioned that the food was nothing to get excited about.\n\nWell that has all changed with Sagos new menu. I have two words - GREAT JOB!\n\nMoving the menu closer to the restaurants Baja theme, management has introduced a completely new menu filled with some great selections like fish and shrimp tacos, homemade pizza, a delicious chicken avocado sandwich, a new twist on the BLT with a tomato jelly that rocks and much more.\n\nIf you go, and you will, you have to try the Ceviche - cradled in what looked like a sea-shell shaped crisp flour tortilla, the taste is fabulous and the serving size to price ratio will fill you up but still make you want to order another.\n\nWay to go Sagos, you guys have hit all the marks now - great food, great service, great atmosphere. I'll be there - soon."
5,"It's like the Scottsdale Gun Club without the expense of ammo! A great place to practice for the amateur or Olympic champion alike. There are lessons for kids and adults. Air conditioned and safe, I could spend my entire summer here. Love it. 5 stars all the way."
5,"I recently stayed at the Cosmopolitan and had the best experience ever! Our room was beautiful and had the a great view of the strip. We can see the Bellagio fountain right below our balcony. I had so much fun that I accidentally left my beloved $230 Tory Burch sandals behind. I was sure I would never see them again. When I called the lost and found, the housekeeping lady actually turned them in! I was so happy I wanted to tip her, but they didn't know who turned them in. I must say, thank you Cosmopolitan for providing top quality service and having a very reputable and honest staff."
5,"Milunka is great! I never really write yelp reviews but I decided to write one for her because she really takes her time to make sure your face is clean and thoroughly taken care of. Her facials are great because she does extractions, which is probably the most important thing about getting a facial done! I've gone to her twice and will definitely be going back again!"
5,"I've been seeing Meg now for probably close to a year for massages. She has treated me with massages ranging from lymphatic drainage to deep tissue. Every time I see her for a massage, I feel like a brand new person leaving the room. I really enjoy Meg as she gets to know her clients on a personal level prior to the massage, making the massage experience that much more personal. I would recommend Meg to anyone that wants an experienced massage therapist, who truly loves and enjoys what they do!!"
5,"This place truly could not be better. I came here for dinner with some family after reading some good yelp reviews. Upon entering, we were warmly greeted by the owner's father. He brought out chips & salsa for the table immediately and answered all of our questions about the menu. The food was insanely delicious - I had the CC Sizzle sopaipilla style. It was so good that I devoured the entire thing, which left me in a ridiculous food coma - but so so worth it. The rest of the family loved their meals as well. Before we left, the cook came out and placed warm sopaipillas covered in cinnamon on our table & said they were \""on the house\"". Once again, delicious. As we were leaving, we paid & tipped our lovely waiter. Much to our surprise, he did not even want the tip! After some insisting though, he did kindly accept. He went above & beyond to make his son's customers happy and that alone was enough to bring us back here. Try this place - you won't be disappointed!"
5,I honestly have never gotten my nails done at Polished and not that I want to write a review about waxing- but all I can say is Hayley is fabulous-quick and professional. I have visited here for six years and will continue to. Tips in cash or check only.
5,"I have no complaints here.  European-style shop for gourmet coffee and tea.  You can buy fresh-brewed coffee or beans and loose leaf tea in bulk starting with a 1/4 pound and up.  Besides that, the shop is crammed with coffee and tea supplies, candies, and chocolates.  Good prices.  Friendly, knowledgeable staff.\n\nI usually buy coffee, but the last time I went in for green tea and wanted to try something new.  The man who waited on me didn't know a whole lot about tea, so he did something amazing:  he found someone else who did!\n\nTip: Go on Thursday afternoons when Market Square has their farmer's market and pick up some fresh produce and pierogies, too."
5,"I love Paymon's. During the summer they have the best cold cucumber soup! So delicious. The chicken curry, hummus, dolmas, lentil soup are all satisfying... I think I am going to go there tomorrow for happy hour! Yay!"
5,"This place and its owner/operators are the best.  Phong and his wife are pleasant, fun, and have great stories.  They have a good selection of import beers and Phong even ordered in something for us that he did not normally stock.  The prices are reasonable and he has all of your convenience needs on top of the great beer and liquor."
5,"With all the hype and great things said about this place, why wouldn't I try a little Good Fellas Grill.  In addition, I was looking for something a little on the healthy side, and this somewhat meets that criteria.\n\nOH MY GOSH!  Isn't that hummus and baba ganoush amazing?  The owner split our plate in half so we could enjoy this excellent dip.  It packed flavor, freshness, and a delicious spread on top of my pita.  The wifey and I were not able to finish it, and I would have to be so bold to say that it even tasted better the following day.  No way?  Oh yes way, my friend!\n\nThere is a ton of hype on the lentil soup, but I would have to say the potato soup had more flavor and was definitely more hearty than the lentil.  Therefore, I would highly recommend trying the potato as well.\n\nThe wifey had salad wraps while I had the 2 meat combo.  Since my wife did not share the wraps, I am sure they were delicious, as she kept them to herself.  The 2 meat combo is like the combo punch and kick you would see watching old school batman with the words saying, \""bam, pow, or crunch!\""  Meaning, the meat, the chicken, with the rice, onions, and tomato make for a treat for excitement.\n\nIt definitely lives up to its hype and adds on to another great Greek Restaurant in Phoenix!  We will see you again!"
5,"I love, love, love me some  Oregano's and I'm so glad I live just a few miles away. Their salads, their sandwiches, appetizers, pizzas and pizookie dessert are all amazing. Serious grub, very affordable, huge portions, a fun atmosphere, super friendly wait staff...this place has it all.\n\nThe only negative I have ever had is just a personal preference. If you are in a mellow mood or looking for something more romantic on a date night, this isn't the spot. It's LOUD and pretty cramped full of tables, people and antique 'stuff.' Fun if you are in a social mood and don't mind your personal space being invaded often."
5,"Great tourist attraction. feature shops, botquies, night clubs, art museums, Good Luck with finding a place to park. I highly recommend valet.\n\nThere is so much history in Old Town. You can find historical museums or take a ride on the trolley. My favorites are all the options to dine at after taking a stroll through all the shops. \n\nFarmers Market on Saturday's with local vendors. That is another great perk about old down many local shops and boutiques with a variety of things to enjoy."
5,"My boyfriend and I took a last minute trip to Vegas, and based on reviews, made a reservation at Cut.  We were not disappointed.  From the moment we walked through the door the service was friendly, accommodating, and attentive from the hostesses, to the bartender, to our two waiters.  Wine choices were on par. Nice, simple decor.  Excellent presentation and recommendations on types of steak.  Did not skimp on the bread (which unfortunately we took full advantage of).  We shared the American Wagyu Beef porterhouse for two and it was possible the BEST steak I have ever had.  Cooked to perfection.  Sides of mac and cheese and caramelized cauliflower also did not disappoint.  We finished with a huge and yummy chocolate souffl\u00e9.  The whole experience was a delight.  Great meal, great atmosphere, great service.  You can't ask for much more.  We definitely made the right choice with this restaurant."
5,"Wunderbare Filme in heimeliger Atmosph\u00e4re, ein typisches Programmkino mit dem dazugeh\u00f6rigen Publikum. Hin und wieder muss man eben auch Filme mit nur 18 weiteren Personen im Saal ansehen. Daf\u00fcr ist die Schauburg genau das richtige."
5,"If you are looking for a wonderful way to \""board\"" your pet while you are away, I highly recommend Doolittle's Doghouse!  Your pet will stay in the home of a carefully selected \""nannie\"" who will provide loving care while you are gone.  (No more cages and dog runs!)  As a veterinarian, I make recommendations very carefully and I highly recommend this service to my friends, family and clients!"
5,"Don't really need to say much here, as 2000+ reviews at a 4.5 star average speaks for itself. I was out all night and was too tired to go out for lunch with my friends, but they were kind enough to bring me an Earl's Club back. It was probably a good hour or so by time they ordered it to the time they brought it back to me, but the sandwich was still warm and delicious! I can't imagine how much better it would be fresh! For $6, this is a freaking steal compared to a lot of the more expensive food options in Vegas. Couple that with the fact that it's open 24 hours, and this place is money."
5,"First time here (yesterday) I had the beach house burger, was the best hamburger I have ever had.  Came back today for lunch and had the br\u00fbl\u00e9e burger... New best burger I've ever had.  Didn't know a hamburger could do this to my taste buds."
5,"Anna pretty much took the words out of my mouth on this one. I'm going to add one more thing. They have a extremely unique way of arrange flowers, very modern and bespoke looking. I can't (and won't) describe it any further, visit to see!"
5,"Meaghan has been doing my hair for 18years and she is amazing! I have followed her all over the city! She is very precise on her color, blending highlights and a perfect hair cut every time! I highly recommend give her a try and I promise you will be in love. She is also very reasonable priced for the excellent services! I love going to see her!"
5,I always stop in here when I'm in Vegas.  It's always busy regardless if I arrive at 11:00am or 10:00pm.  That's how I know it's good.  Ordered tacos al pastor & carne asada.  Best tacos in Vegas as far as I'm concerned.
5,What a great place. The location is tucked back in this little strip mall area. The creamy broccoli soup was wonderful and I really enjoyed my Mediterranean wrap. Will keep this on my list for future lunch spots.
5,Best advice for de'lucas is to get there early if you want a weekend breakfast.  We got there at 8am on a Saturday and waited for about 5 minutes.  We did some shopping on the strip and we we passed again at 10 there was a huge line waiting to get in.  Our food was fresh and delicious.   All the toast and French toast is made from fresh Mancini bread.  Pancakes were awesome too.  Service is fast and friendly for how busy they are.  Get here early and make a nice little morning out of it like we did.
5,"This is our kind... a real winner-the most godly breakfast burrito I've ever had!! and FRESSSSSHHHHH made with their own special salsa. Love the urban decor indoor, and you see a mexican grandma cookin' it up in the kitchen-you know you're in good hands. We had to wait for a while for our food, but that was good news to us=ignore the whiners who demand the food fast. It meant that they were cooking everything from scratch. It's important that chefs invest their time and love in their food, and it reflected through my first \""ahh, this is heavenly\"" bite of the burrito. I'm so happy I found this place!! I plan on buying their El Sol salsa. Always follow the traditional mexican bakery-guaranteed you will get authentic mexican dish. Not only El Sol was an exciting discovery, but downtown Chandler is a very cute n historic area to scope out! It's filled with many other mexican joints, which I'm sure are delicious. I look forward to going back to that area!\n\nThis beats Los Favoritos. Period."
5,"Vegas is a foodie town, and Aria has a lot of wonderful restaurants.  If you ask me, Julian Serrano is the best restaurant in Aria and it's one of my favorite places to eat in Las Vegas.\n\nI LOVE THIS RESTAURANT.  \n\nService is top-notch and fast.  For a party of 14, I was worried about the wait time for food.  No need to worry, they know what they're doing!  Food started coming out almost immediately.  Tapas are a terrific option for large groups.  The pace of dishes coming out was perfect.  Also our waiter was able to split up the bill (we ordered in groups of 3 to 5 people).  \n\nFinally, the food.  It's excellent!!  Everything is amazing but I particularly recommend the calamari, which is among the best I've ever eaten.  Other notable dishes include the salmon, the risotto, croquetas, peppers, papas bravas.\n\nYou simply cannot go wrong eating here."
5,"Best red curry I've had in a long time!! Seriously I am salivating just thinking of it. And if you ask for it extra spicy, oh boy will they make it hot! I love going in for their lunch special. For $7.50 you get soup, 2 wontons, an egg roll, and an entree with rice. Good prices, good service, and excellent red curry. Their orange chicken is also very good, but I can never bring myself to order anything besides the red curry because it is so freakin' good. My one complaint is they serve sweet and sour as the dipping sauce for the egg rolls when I prefer the sweet chili sauce many Thai places serve instead."
5,"Consistently the best customer service around. Needed new rear tire a while back. No up sells, just options for my budget and needs. Today in for a flat repair. No waiting to talk to someone - they meet and greet you immediately. Both times I've been quoted accurate wait time which is a huge deal to me. Knowledgeable, friendly, courteous staff- I highly recommend this location to everyone in the area."
5,Hands down one of the best restaurants in Phoenix.  We were ecstatic to hear of this opening as we were frequent diners at Postinos.  Everything we have ordered has been fabulous.  Their specialty cocktails are a perfect blend.  They always have different beer selection that is wonder.  Their service is top notch!  \n\nIf you are looking for some home cooking and great service give Windsor a try!
5,"I went to Rochelle's Salon once before and hated the girl who did my hair. After about a year later, I slowly got the courage to give Rochelle's Salon another chance, but only for a blow dry and style. We kept dating like this for a while. They referred me to Abel who did a great job and eventually, the relationship progressed and I now trust him to cut my hair and color it. I love Rochelle's and am now a loyal girlfriend. Abel is great, creative, easy-going, and very accommodating as most my appointments are last minute. In addition, he's great at giving dating advice-NOT, but it's hilarious to hear his escapades being a straight hairstylist. Scandelous. Liz at the front desk has a great memory, too!"
5,"I dropped into this gym while traveling for work. The staff was amazingly inviting and friendly.  The facilities were spacious and new.  The workout was rewardingly tough.  I can't say enough good things about this gym.  If you are contemplating joining a cross-fit gym, I highly recommend."
5,"Incredible customer service! Scheduled them for an airport pick-up before Thanksgiving. They called to let me know driver was delayed and to keep me ontime, reimbursed me for my fare in another cab."
5,"We have been here several 3 times in the last few weeks and each time the food was excellent!  We've tried something different each time and have been delighted at how tasty each item has been.  Great salad made with Kale instead of just plain lettuce for a healthier option, HUGE chicken wings fried to perfection, the Turkeygiving Burger that gives the Bobbie a run for it's money and the Chicken N Waffles..oh la la....Absolutely Delish! We will be back again very soon!"
5,Excellent service! Van is so nice and helpful. We bring our clothes here for cleaning and alterations and have never been disappointed!
5,"If you are looking for a funky pair of sneakers, this is the place to go. They have an awesome selection!!!  I will definitely be back."
5,"Went there today for the first time and was impressed!!!  It's really lovely inside, very spacious - couches, tables, and a side room with big tables where you can sit and do work with books, a laptop, etc.  The decor is also really lovely.\n\nI also think their menu is fabulous. While I've only been there once and can't speak to the quality of all the items listed, my friend had a tea she enjoyed, a panini that she said was delicious; and I had the side salad that was excellent for only $4.99.  They are also giving away free donuts with purchase to promote their opening and I thought it was very tasty.\n\nTheir menu includes salads, sandwiches, paninis, deserts/pastries/donuts and coffee/espresso.  \n\nI will definitely go back - great location, lovely inside, and a great offering of foods."
5,"My wife and I heard about this restaurant/bar through a friend and we were not disappointed. The food is great, the people are friendly and the prices you can't beat. We've been there three times since hearing about it and we will continue to stop by."
5,I have used completely clean for several years for my cars and company trucks and they are fabulous always on time and will work on meeting me were my trucks or cars  are even at last minute to get them cleaned Thank you
5,"I went there three times in my one week stay to Vegas this February. The food was great, the service was wonderful (great conversation) and the atmosphere was fun and inviting. My favorite was The Avalon. Mmmm... more goat cheese please. ((Don't miss the Berry Lemonade))\n\nKeep it up! When I come back through, expect me again. ((If you're in any doubt, check it out))"
5,"Walked in, 3 minutes later had a new battery in my watch.  Way better than those places at the mall."
5,"Oh my goodness. I didn't know what outstanding auto service was until I came to Rebel Auto!!!! So professional. So kind. The free play arcade while you wait? AWESOME! It isn't like a cheap gimmick. It's legit!!! The price is perfect - way better than what the dealer charges for my  2 year old car. I couldn't believe how fast they got my oil change done, either. And they gave me recommendations but didn't pressure me. Being new to the area, I'm so glad I found Rebel Auto. I believe they have gained a customer for life!"
5,"I went here today for lunch   Needing time away  from work so I drove to sakana I walked in, the place was very busy right off the bat I was greeted with a big hello and smile ......thank you I had the savanna lunch special 9.99 which included miso soup a nice salad  6 or so pieces of fish 6 pieces of rolls and a smoked salmon tempura roll  thing very good and plenty of food"
5,"Let me say that I've done Vegas without LV Top Shelf and bought the tickets, waited in line, no special treatment, and it is definitely not as incredible as our experience with Skoti.\n\nRegardless of how big your group is, Skoti always make it super easy and gets you to the front of the line and into the clubs that you want. I've had friends text me once I get in the club telling me they saw me walk in and I just go \""whoops! well.... I'll see you when you're done in that line! (;\"". If you want the VIP treatment, he is definitely the guy to go to. I recently introduced some friends to Skoti the last time we booked a cabana at Encore Beach Club, and boy were they massively impressed. All of us can honestly say we had the best time of our lives. \n\nI don't think I could ever experience the Vegas clubbing scene without Skoti. Unless you happen to like waiting in uncomfortable heels in massively long lines as your buzz dwindles away and your seal is about to be broken, then sure, you don't need his services. Otherwise, there is no one else I would recommend for all your Vegas needs.\n\nFYI, coming from a huge foodie, Skoti's restaurant recommendations are ON POINT. Highly, highly recommend."
5,"Great donuts, a little hard to find but worth the hunt. Must taste their cronuts and their apple fritters. My wife loves the chocolate chip rolls. They can also make your next party cake. We have had them make a birthday cake and a anniversary cake in the past. Always excellent!"
5,This place is amazing! Location is easy to get to and valet is Perfect! It's free and I didn't mind paying a few bucks for the convenience! The food is great! Came here for a brunch with some girlfriends on a Saturday morning! They were willing to give us a nice comfy couch area for our group of 6-7. We all got mimosas and our server offered to just grab us a bottle since it would be the same price ($5/each). Yum! I had looked up reviews before going and was all about ordering the bruschetta but my friends were feeling the brunch items. Everything looked so tasty! I ordered the prosciutto and Brie panini and chips. Oh my gosh soooo very flavorful!!! It was in the sweet side due to the fig but so many flavor profiles in each bite! I can't wait to come again. I hear they have deals on Monday and Tuesday nights for wine and bruschetta!
5,"My wife and I were out shopping on Saturday and as is our custom we were looking for a new and interesting lunch spot.\n\nShe spotted Hiromaru Fusion Ramen and said \""That's it!\"".\n\nThe simple yet colorful decor was bright and refreshing compared to some ramen houses I have been in.  The waitress was quick to bring our drinks and explain some menu items to my wife.\n\nI ordered the TATE-YAMA RAMEN which was truly a mountain of vegetables, sprouts, and delicious ramen.  My wife ordered TONKOTSU CURRY TSUKEMEN and it looked and smelled delicious.  Both dishes were beautifully prepared and presented.\n\nWe only had the ramen dishes listed but saw many other interesting meals being served to our fellow diners.  We will visit again to try out other menu items!\n\nHighly recommend Hiromaru Fusion Ramen for a great meal with a little twist."
5,"Simply put, the best fried chicken I have ever had! Mind you, I'm no connoisseur, but this was 110% legit; crunchy, juicy & ripe with flavor."
5,"Get out the AmEx!  A great little boutique convenient to center city, Dilworth, Wesley Heights, Wilmore and SouthEnd with unique gifts and offerings!  Paper Skyscraper is a great place to buy stuff for my gay friends or co-workers, but I was stumped recently when I needed to buy something for my mom's birthday. I visited Boulevard not because they had clothes that would appeal to my mom, but they had neat little gifts like quaint ceramic bird candles or bird houses or grapeseed beauty product gift baskets.  \n\nThey also have cute and inexpensive jewelry that make great sursees for friends or a splurge for yourself (like Greenmarketgirl's eco cuffs!)  They have cute homemade stuff that isn't available everywhere but at reasonable prices and great service.  Stuff changes all the time, so stop in!"
5,"O.k., o.k. We had to stop in and try this place just to see what all the hype was about and if any of it was true. Can you say OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!! This place is the real deal and I can't say that I, nor my taste buds, have ever had a sandwich as good as these are. Yes, we have been back and it is just as good and we will be back again and again as long as our stomachs don't explode from the massive amount of food you get on the plates they serve you. Hot dog they call them here but they are the largest hot dogs I have ever seen and cooked to a plump juicy temp with an awesome bun. The burger is a 1/2 pound which we ordered well done and yet it came out so juicy and full of flavor. The cook has his stuff together here. I might just have to forgo the diet and head back over there tonight.  ;-)"
5,We just randomly stopped for breakfast here.  It was really delicious! Julie was our server and she was really perfect.
5,"One of my all-time favorite restaurants, definite proof that value doesn't have to mean compromise. \n\nPerfect for lunch, dinner, to-go, catering, I've done it all here. \n\nI have pretty Americanized taste buds, but still I spring for the traditional menu often, it's adventurous without being intimidating, and it's less than seven bucks after tax for a properly filling meal. The soups in particular just warm you up inside. \n\nPad thai here is also exceptional and come with plenty of meat.\n\nI ordered catering here for a large party and it was incredibly competitive pricing plus they delivered the order such a convenience.\n\nGreat place to bring people great date place too the decor is very nice and there is a great drink/happy hour menu. While not alcoholic, I do recommend their thai ice tea if you like sweeter beverages. \n\nReally cannot speak more highly about this place, but there is a small warning if you are not a fan of spicy foods make sure you order yours MILD. Even some dishes when ordered mild will have a kick and medium to hot dishes can have quite the lingering burn, but I could just be a wuss. Order the sweet ice tea in case and the spice won't be a problem you can't handle."
5,"Best Buffet, hands down.  \n\nIt's now noon and I'm still full from last night's buffet chow down.    Went down there for the Labor Day weekend buffet where they increased the cost to $37.95 + tax, but it was way worth it.  I would have paid $50 for this buffet.   \n\nLamb Chops -  Delicious... King Crab Legs... Delicious  \nPrime Rib - Nice and pink.. just the way I like it .  It was seriously a meat fest at the Wynn. \n\nBe sure not to get too bogged down by the fillers (i.e.  bread, pasta, rissoto bar)\n\nThe wait was a good hour 15, but that was expected especially when we were arriving at 6ish.  Didn't leave the place until 10.     I'm not normally a dessert person, but there was room made for them inside my stomach.   \n\nWill definately come back to The Buffet at the Wynn next time."
5,"I love love love this place!! What a little hidden gem in downtown Phoenix. Me and my girlfriend try to go at least once a week. It's such a hip, fun spot. The food is fantastic! I always get the Cash Money.  The dressing they use on their greens is to die for! Staff is very friendly as well. A great date spot- atmosphere is perfect...all candlelit once the sun goes down. And you gotta love the old school hip hop they blast! I recommend this spot to everyone I know!! \n\nThey are closed for a week and a half for vacation and I am already itching for them  to open!"
5,The duck fat fried French fries come out to start and you know you're in a good place. We tried a few things off the main menu but the Rib cap is seriously the best thing I've ever had.
5,"In N Out Burger is hands down the best fast food place I've ever eaten at. The food actually tastes good, unlike most mass fast food chains. The burgers are to die for, as are the fries. I love how everything is made fresh daily and the fries are cut in the store. The one thing I don't like is how it seems everyone in Phoenix seemed to be at this location when I was there. I guess the fact that it was the day after Christmas and that it's near Paradise Valley Mall didn't help that. We couldn't find a table so we tried eating outside, but it was way too cold and windy (I was visiting from Cleveland, so I was shocked at the cold weather) so we ate in our car in the parking lot. It was worth it though. Hands down In N Out is one of the best burger places in America. Now they just need to come to the Great Lakes region."
5,"I go to Lifetime Fitness on my own, however, I found my weight loss goals on a plateau even though I was doing cardio twice a day!  \n\nI've seen this place since it's close to some of my favorite restaurants; Nobuo at Teeter House, PIzzaria Bianco, etc...  \n\nI read about them online and I saw that many people had only great things to say about them.  They were correct!\n\nI've only been here three times total; once to sign-up and twice to workout.  The staff already knows me by my name!  They are incredibly helpful, friendly, and they genuinely care.  I've had personal trainers before but they don't compare to the staff here!  \n\nThey have  free class at 9 AM on Saturdays if you want to check it out at no risk to you.  You have nothing to lose!  Come check them out!  I've already recommended them to so many people I think this Saturday morning may be packed!"
5,"We were staying on the Las Vegas strip and were looking for a good sushi place tha t was a good value.  Yelp reviews led us to Sushi House Goyemon that is a few miles away.  We went for the AYCE and it was excellent.  Everything we tried was excellent.  A few of the YELP reviews suggested the pig bellies or something like that, and that was the only item we chose that was one I'd pass up next time. Nice people and great service."
5,"Disappointed by a warm room and no table having been reserved for us we decided to leave after 10 minutes, but the manager, Bill, persuaded us to stay and spared no effort: we were glad we did.  This was our best dinner in Vegas.  Yum Pretzel bread.  Stimulating ginger and  rum cocktail and careful preparation of Gypsy and Martini.  Delightful bouche-amuse lily plate of creamed eggplant salad; best Cioppino for a long time, M had best FG, one seared, one mousse, as well as divers scallops with pork-belly;  refreshing rum-pineapple-coconut upside down and chocolate truffle desserts with paired champagne and tawny port.  Many extra touches and care to make you feel special"
5,"Started out with She Crab Soup, it was excellent should of had a bowl instead of a cup. Fish tacos where great. Will come back again for dinner."
5,Best steakhouse in Vegas. My wife and I come here almost everytime we are in Vegas and it is always amazing. We have tried all of the other top steakhouses on the strip but this place is much better with out the over doneness of the casinos and they dont rip you off. \nSteaks are always cook perfectly and their sides are great.
5,"I went in the store walking into a chaotic warfare! It was the day when Ashleys was handing out up to $2,000 credit limits. Although many customers complained about waiting for over 5 hours, I simply waited for 2. I was greeted in a very friendly manner and assisted very thoroughly for my first time purchasing furniture this way. Each of the employees and even the manager that assisted me were extremely friendly. No complaints and I will visit them again for future purchases."
5,Really fresh sake. Great rolls. Nice option to get a half or a full roll. Delicious lychee sake. Fast service. Amazing!
5,"I usually wouldn't review a theatre, but I really need to brag about a manager (Aries). He is an amazing person that reminded me there's still people out there we can be thankful for this holiday season. My husband, daughter, and I drove from California to visit friends & family for Thanksgiving, but wanted to catch the \""Frozen\"" movie the day before (Wed). During our drive I called AMC Theatre's number and asked a nice lady if they still had the $5 special they use to have Mon-Thurs. She said yes except for holidays. I asked her if today counts as a holiday cause it's so close to Thanksgiving, she said no. It will still be $5/ticket. I was so happy ... Until I got to the theatre to purchase tickets. The young boy said it would be $29.90 for all of us. I was shocked cause I mentioned the $5 special I talked to a lady on the phone about just that morning. He suggested asking his manager, Aries. When the manager came out, he immediately apologized to us & handed us our tickets ... for FREE! My husband and I looked at each other shocked cause that's the last we expected. I wanted to hug him!!! \n\nThank you Aries for making our family night out a memorable one :)"
5,"A well kept secret! If you are looking for wine treats, you have to check this out. It is like a little wine store located right inside the department store. They do tastings and classes and have a special room for the fine stuff.. I have only just peeked through the glass, but YUM!"
5,"Everything but the Kal-bi was delicious, but then again it is a tofu house.  It would give any garden grove area tofu restaurants a run for their money.  Kal-bi was good, just needed to be seasoned more.  Bim bim bop was very good; fresh ingredients.  Banchan was fresh and tasty also.  Great Korean place in Vegas!"
5,"Great hole in the wall chicken wing joint. Large variety of flavors - will need many more visits before I've tried a majority of them. An OK beer selection, and flat screens abound for watching sports."
5,Great place to spend an anniversary! They really treat you well. The service was top notch. Fried Calamari was excellent with the spicy sauce. I had the Fillet which was great. My wife had the Butterfish and loved it. The Hawaiian martinis are delicious. Would definitely recommend it.
5,"So happy this place opened up so close to home. \nYummy yellow curry, and they offer the spice level from 1-10.\nGarlic chicken delicious with crunchy garlic sprinkled on top.\nWe do wish they had some outside seating, though.\nWe will definitely be back!"
5,"Truly an Authentic Chinese experience. It' looks like a Panda Express from the outside. Inside is a whole new story. Bunch of Chinese waiters running around. There's the infamous cliche of a fishtank. When we got here we were seated next to the fishtank. And fish were looking at me.....So I ordered one. Fried. With a black bean and spicy garlic sauce. Teach that fish to look at me....Grrrrr\nBut in reality. You can order chinese food on the menu. I like things off the menu that only the cool asians know. So my advice - learn some chinese food that's not americanized with sugar and sweetness. And order off the \""cool secret menu\"".\n\nUpdate 6/2/08\nSEE I FUCKIN TOLD YOU - BEST CHINESE! EVER!"
5,"Another favorite in Vegas definitely the best Indian in town! I've been to the lunch buffet and the a la carte dinner. While the buffet is certainly worth the price I love coming for dinner so that I can order exactly what I want! \n\nThe garlic naan is a MUST. And I recommend it with some plain yogurt on the side! For main courses I really love the lamb (or vegetable) korma and the chicken tiki masala. I get both on medium (5) level and it still has a good amount of spice!! I'd say those two sauces are my favorites since I've tried others that are not as memorable to me. I don't love the chicken tikka but probably only because I'm a big sauce girl! I also really enjoy the okra vegetable dish! Full of flavor!\n\nThough the talk of slow service is true I'd say the food is too good to pass up and don't mind the service. I also like to finish my meal with a chai tea at the end. Overall great place eating so many delicious spices just makes me feel very warm and calm on the inside I would definitely consider this \""comfort food\"""
5,"This place is amazing! Very crafted cocktail that taste wonderful. They have a \""smash\"" of whatever type of liquor you like with whatever fruit you like muddled into it with some triple sec for sweetness... I chose strawberries and lemon with vodka and it was so fresh and delicious!"
5,"I love how there are a variety of menu options here (vs. Hot N Juicy), and their cajun sause is so unique...it's tasty and DELICIOUS!!  The service here is wonderful, as they are always upbeat, happy, polite, and care about your dining experience."
5,"Last night I hosted a last minute MNF party at my house. I spoke with a very polite and respectful employee named Danny. I placed my order through him and explained to him I needed this order to be right. He reassured me without hesitation my order would be taken care of. When my order arrived, I thoroughly inspected everything and boy was it spot on! Pizza and wings well done as I ordered. The wings were seasoned perfect with the right amount of wing sauce. My guest were very pleased with the food as I was and wings were definitely a hit! Thank you Danny for your attention to detail, your outstanding customer service and the great food! We will be ordering here, along with our friends, in the very near future. HH should be proud! \n\nThank you, \nJR"
5,"Love love LOVE Fox Sports Grill.  Its the perfect combination of 2 of my favorite things: beautiful people and (midwest) sports.  \n\nBelly up to the bar in the middle of the restaurant for the best people and sports watching seats in the house--there are a ton of TVs so you wont miss a minute of your favorite games, even if youre cheering for more than one team at a time.  \n\nThere are pool tables for your entertainment at half time, and a private room in the back where I once got way too saucy at a company gathering.  \n\nDJs are mixing the latest during commercials of REALLY big games, and Fox Sports broadcasts right in the bar from time to time.  \n\nPrices are Scottsdale par and the food is upscale bar.  \n\nBe sure you shower and put on your best jersey, there are some seriously good looking sports fans at Fox Sports and hell, you might even be cheering for the same team."
5,"I lived in Tucson for 16 wonderful years, leaving with my three children, new husband and two stepchildren in 2002 for New York. New York is wonderful in many ways, but truly is lacking in true authentic Mexican food. And there is no fooling my family. So when I come back to Arizona to visit my family here, the first thing I want is authentic Mexican food. Since my parents and sister live in Apache Junction, we find our fix at Los Tacos. The place is immaculately clean, the staff courteous and genuinely kind. I think we'd have a longer conversation if I spoke Spanish but their English is just fine. The food is cooked to order, the tortillas homemade. There is a salsa bar with salsa fresca, roasted hot peppers, spiced carrots, salsa verde and a nice chipolte salsa. I am not sure if they serve coffee as they are always so kind to let me bring in my morning addiction, Starbucks Vente. My son, who came on this trip with me, wakes each morning to walk the two miles to Starbucks and then a few steps more to Los Tacos. What a wonderful way to start the day. I can't recommend them high enough. Definitely worth the four mile walk each morning."
5,"This place is very cute, clean, and the lady whom I think is the owner is very friendly. Prices are reasonable too. Delicious."
5,"I had such agreat experience here. The massage technician was professional and courteous. I was so relaxed I think I dozed off for few minutes. When everything was said and done, I felt so much better and rejuvenated. I definitely recommend this place."
5,"French cooking at its best! Vogue Bistro provides a wonderful atmosphere for a couple or a group. I've done both. A great selection of cocktails martinis compliments a menu that leaves nothing to be desired.\n\nPersonally I like everything I've ever ordered here especially the meatloaf, steaks, and any of the chef specials. You won't be disappointed no matter what you get."
5,"We stayed at Wynn last week.  One of the days, we had lunch here and on our last day we had breakfast.\n\nLunch: Chinese Chicken Salad with Iced Tea - very good and slightly spicy.\n            Vegan Sliders - my husband loved it\nBreakfast: Peach Bellini - Yummy\n                 Main Lobster Benedict - Delicious with a huge portion of Lobster pieces.\n                 Garden Vegetable Omelet - My Honey loved it!\n                 Coffee and Orange Juice - both were excellent!\n\nThe service and the food were great!  We had lunch inside and it was beautifully decorated.  We were lucky that there was a table available for breakfast outside by the pools.  It was beautiful and the weather was perfect.\n\nSpecial Note for VEGANS:  Steve Wynn has become a Vegan and his restaurants now offer a Vegan menu.  The few things we tried were delicious!\n\nLooking forward to coming back!"
5,"This new development I believe is a success! There's tons of people coming in and spending their money in what used to be a parking lot. From random eateries and retailers, you're sure to find something you'll want. I particularly like the layout and the designs of the shops as well as the high roller attraction that boasts being the tallest eye In the sky on the west coast. I will return for sure whether it's to dine or people watch or even play. If the goal was to keep people close and on only Caesars Properties then I think it worked. Kudos to the architects and developers and whoever brainstormed the idea. People hop a from the Linq Hotel and Casino to the Flamingo to Harrahs and so forth keeping their money all on this side of the strip. Nice thinking"
5,"I haven't frequented the Linq enough. There are so many cool little spots to hang out at, including Blvd. Cocktail! I was meeting a friend here Tuesday night and it was quite slow. The bartender, Mike, was super awesome and friendly. He made me an Irish Mule even though they didn't have ginger beer on had. He worked some magic with real ginger, ginger ale and other things and the drink was even better than a normal mule with real ginger beer. \n\nThey had a piano player who kept asking us for requests, and he was able to play any song we listed, including songs by JT, Foo Fighers, Kanye West, etc. It's cute little place with a speakeasy feel. The bartenders are obviously very talented mixologists. There's a beautiful patio right out on the promenade as well. I'll be back!"
5,"I do 97% of my families shopping here. I love the bakery that this location has! Some of their prepared meals are better then others just like any store. The Indian ones are actually quite good for Indian on the go. The meat  and their cheese selection is always awesome. The staff at this store are great, they are always friendly and helpful."
5,"BurGR is amazing! By far the best burger I have ever had! The staff is great, on par with Ramsey steak! I ordered the Farm Burger and it was awesome. My wife had the Hells Kitchen burger and it to was amazing. We shared a basket of \""Just Fries\"". They were good, but what set them over the top was the two ketchups. A chipotle ketchup on one side and a curry ketchup on the other. We will be going back again before we leave Vegas!"
5,My husband is so obsessed with this restaurant! It may not look like much from the outside but it is fantastic! My husband got the full rack of ribs and I got the Pulled pork sandwich. Both of which were great. My obsession from this place is definitely the corn bread It is so sweet...almost like cake :) && I love cake! \n\nDefinitely a great place to try if you are looking for a local joint with awesome food!!
5,"Ive been going here for 2 years now and just cannot get my nails done anywhere else.. The quality and selection of nail gels is incomparable to any nail salon I have ever been to.  The only downside about this place is that you must make an appointment and have to make it a couple weeks in advance to get a time that is suitable for you. I personally have been going to Lil Kim there... She always takes her time, pays attention to detail, and does excellent work.. Like I said before I could never go anywhere else regardless of the price or location... They are that good!"
5,I absolutely love POLISHED! I live about 15 miles away and I pass hundreds of nail salons and I would never go anywhere but here. The color selection is like no other. I have never seen so many. It is always busy in here but I have never had to wait to get serviced. Tina does my nails and she makes them look perfect each time. The receptionists Arielle and Brianna make everything go smoothly and they always greet you by name. Whenever I have people in town I always take them to Polished! I love it here!
5,"Ate here with a group.  Everyone enjoyed their meal.  Can wait to return to Vegas to eat their again.  I had the brisket dog, so yummy!"
5,"Nostrovia martini, a great summer drink and Starry night martini, like the Van Gogh painting, are both very excellent!!! the ICE bar (literally) and the decor are FANTASTIC...makes me feel like I'm in Russia! I love vodka!"
5,Both my dogs go here....One of my dogs that goes there is a cavalier King Charles spaniel which can be challenging to groom but they do amazing she always comes out happy and refreshed and cute as a button (which she always is) and my second dog is a Lhasa apso poodle mix she is still a pup she had her first big dog hair cut there they did amazing especially since she a nervous little dog. They made her feel real relaxed and loved and had her in and out.
5,Wow - I was totally impressed with Chris and his crew. We got in everywhere we wanted to go - communication was easy and fast. My cousin and I had a GREAT time at the Palms and Foundation Room. I'm sure I'll make my way back to Sin City and will definitely hit up Chris and his team before I go. Thanks guys!!!!!
5,"omg this place was reeediculously gorgeous! i felt like i had walked into some adult version of raging waters/candyland. seriously, i wanted to play with all the little water contraptions they had, like this stripper pole that showers water on the girls underneath. and this overflowing mini-pool with see-thru sides (VIP tables only i think :(). it was *the* most perfect sunday ever! blue skies, 90 degrees in august, lots of space around and in the pool to sit down, lots of shade, easy-access and clean bathrooms, beautiful people everywhere. i am *so* bummed i did not buy a new bikini for this and put on some heels :("
5,Wonderful find! I just saw her today and all I can say is I hit the jackpot! I just moved to az and as any woman knows trying to find someone to do a Brazilian wax is a pretty anxious experience but right when I met her I felt comfortable. She knows exactly what she is doing and from someone that has been waxing over 12 years I can say she is the best! I have very sensitive skin and have always left everywhere else with some soreness/sensitivity and today I left without any of that. She was quick and efficient. I also got a facial as I bought her yelp deal and she also did a fantastic job on that. No need for me to look any further I have found my regular estetician! Also want to add my navigation took me to a field so if yours takes you there turn around and it's in a strip mall on the left.
5,Brueggers was my DC area go-to for a yummy morning soft-wich or the post-lunch cookie break. I did a little dance when I saw it in the Biltmore area... everything is just as good as the E Street experience and the lunch sandwiches are pretty good if you are too lazy to walk across the street to the restaurants. Oh... and I recently discovered that their teas are really yummy too...
5,"Classic sports bar...great bar food (wings are the bomb!!), service is good for food type...it's not a steak house people!!!! Love coming here with friends to have a drink, play pool or shuffle board, and catch up with sports. Fun happy hour specials...come check it out!"
5,"I've lived here for 1.5 years and am surprised to see anything less than stellar reviews - especially ones posting outlandish claims.  For purposes of this review, I'll focus on my experience since becoming a tenant.  As others have stated, the complex itself is fantastic - great grounds, pools, apartments and location.  However, it is the staff which necessitated I leave a five-star review.  I have been a serial renter and have found the staff at The Dakota to be top notch and 2nd to none.  I have leaned on them heavily and admittedly, have been demanding at times.  Whether it is picking up my weekly deliveries or setting high expectations in terms or my service requests, they have always gone out of their way to accommodate me, show proper urgency and handled with professionalism and a welcoming demeanor.  If you're in the market for a new place and want to know more than what brochures and websites convey, have confidence in the team here.  Cheers -"
5,"Found this place through yelp with tons of awesome reviews and happy to say that Pizzeria Bianco did not disappoint! I'm a big fan of thin crust pizzas and this place might be one of the best. \n\nThe restaurant is pretty small but I loved the atmosphere of this place and the beautiful brick exterior of the restaurant was my favorite! We almost didn't come because we didn't want to have a long ridiculous wait, but I'm so glad we decided to come anyway. Luckily, we went there after the lunch rush around 2pm so we got seated in less than 10 minutes! \n\nThe service was great and the pizza was amaaaazingly delicious! We devoured our pizzas in silence cus it was that good hahaha. I'm actually craving it quite a bit as I am writing this review.... everything about the pizza was perfect! It was a 10/10!! :D We got the Margherita and the Wiseguy pizza. The toppings were extremely fresh and I loved the smokiness of the crust from the wood-fired oven. Wish we got to try all the other signature pizzas as well. The pizzas are a bit pricey compared to the size, but I think it was worth it :)"
5,"Enjoyed our one night stay while in Scottsdale the night before we attended Eagles game at Cardinal stadium. Great location, spacious rooms, good breakfast and friendly helpful staff. My only complaint was the coffee was weak, almost like dirty water."
5,"Don't let the outside fool you. Inside is an awesome decor and atmosphere. Much more elegant than other sushi restaurants. Food is great and awesome. Had the all you can eat- great value. Staff very friendly, and kind. Service was moderately quick. Go there in the early hours of meal time to get the best service times.\nWARNING- don't order too much of the rolls- they have huge servings."
5,"The drive thru staff is always so sweet and friendly.  This place makes a for a great start to my day.  To me, this dunkin is beautiful.  Best coffee in all the land."
5,"Very innovative, fresh and yummy! The preparations are more than pretty; it is an art. Viewing them satisfied my appetite :D\nChef Jonny's expertise is really impressive. \nAll sashimi dishes are amazing. I would recommend cucumber wrap with halibut, spring leaves wrapped with marinated tuna, micro French fries (Angel hair) wrapped with yellow tail, surf and turf (blue crab wrapped with thin sliced NY steak) , Ono (king crab meat wrapped with super white tuna) and salmon sashimi in Truffle oil. The list goes on.. The place is a must for sushi lovers. My hubby took me there I will definitely go back again !"
5,"Overall I had a wonderful experience when visiting the salon for the first time. I came into the salon and was greeted by the attendant to wait for my stylist. I had my haircut scheduled with Vanessa and she was punctual on time. I was looking for a trim on my layers and a polished look - and it was done! After that I had asked Vanessa if she had room for a walk-in service right after me, as my mother was looking to get her hair cut (she had gotten it colored at another salon the same day, and it was her day off, so she doesn't have a lot of time on her hands). Luckily Vanessa was able to accommodate her the same day and we both came out with gorgeous, fresh hair cuts done! We will both be back again, thank you Canyon Falls and Vanessa for being so accommodating!"
5,"Barriques on Monroe has always been one of my favorite \""office work\"" spots. As a person who works from home, the free parking (next street over!), outlets galore, great wifi connection, tasty coffee and Mediterranean Plate keep me coming in! \n\nBut now--- with the new space, so clean and bright, I'm completely in love! Everything I've ever enjoyed about Barriques but with a face lift! There is now a nice bar area to enjoy a beer or glass of wine and I feel like the tables are less cramped."
5,"I have a sneaking suspicion that the Old Childrens Bookshelf is aimed more at nostalgic adults than children. \n\nTucked away on Canongate, it's a lovely shop that sells well preserved copies of childrens fiction, picture books, short stories and annuals from the 1950s onwards. All of the books are beautifully displayed and I have to admit, seeing original copies of The Moomins, Peter Pan and Where The Wild Things Are made me feel quite misty-eyed for my own childhood. \n\nIf your little Jack or Janet already has enough children's books, OCB also sells a small selection of adorable prints and comic books. Personally however, I'd opt for one of the illustrated editions of Alice in Wonderland or Wizard of Oz. They look and read beautifully and are sprinkled with magic!"
5,"One of the very best restaurants in Vegas. A true hidden gem!\n\nWhy go to Le Circ or Bouchon and pay overinflated prices for a fine French meal, when you can go to Pamplemousse for half the price and have a true French experience?\n\nIt doesn't look like much from the street, but walk inside and you will be instantly transported to Paris.\n\nThe food is unrivaled IMHO. I highly recommend the Fettucine ala George, a marvelously tasty appetizer as is the lobster bisque. They handle fish selections wonderfully and the tournedos are incredible!\n\nAnytime we are in Vegas we always dine here, don't miss it, it's wonderful, and easily half the price of any other French restaurant in Vegas you might consider."
5,Randomly stopped by while in Charlotte and had the best curry / hummus I have ever tasted. I wish they could ship their food to sf so I could eat it all day!
5,"I was thinking of getting my tattoo removed for quite some time, and finally made a decision to go for it! I should have started earlier, so I would be done and over with the removal process. \n\nAfter searching numerous times online, and price comparing. I decided to go on GROUPON, searched for laser tattoo removal and landed on \""Erased Laser Tattoo Removal.\"" \n\nThey offer great rates at a discounted price! I was a little skeptical, but glad I stumbled on their website. Even without the groupon, they still offer good rates! I had a free consultation and started the treatment the same day! Estimate completion is 4 sessions, 3 more to go! I can already see cleared up spots after a few hours (don't know if that's possible, but it sure happened to my tattoo). It varies from person to person, because no one tattoo is the same.\n\nI recommend this place, very professional, straight forward, and clean! It's always a great view if the establishment is clean, makes you feel safe to move forward with the process.\n\nGlad I came here! I really thought I would spend a fortune, but this place saved me money! Will post before and after pics later...\n\nNOW GO GET THAT TATTOO REMOVED!"
5,"Found this place using the \""nearby\"" feature on the Yelp app and decided to give it a try. The menu is small but varied, the price is awesome ($4.50-$4.75), and the product is delicious. I got a vegetarian breakfast sandwich (#33: two poached eggs, feta cheese, parmesan cheese, fresh spinach) and my boyfriend got the Nutella, peanut butter, banana, almond sandwich. We both happily demolished them immeditately. Both Carol, the owner, and the young guy working the register were pleasant and conversational. Carol seemed to make fast friends with every customer who walked in, making sure to check on them and ask their names. One unusual thing about Zookz is the addition of a small sink at the beverage counter. This is so useful for dumping out leftover ice and liquids and rinsing plastic containers before you place them in the recycle bin next to it. \n\nOh, and they have punch cards! 10th sandwich is free! We will definitely be trying this place again."
5,"The best AYCE sushi in town. Service, food, ambience, everything. You won't find another AYCE sushi as good as this."
5,"Reliable, trustworthy auto shop! \nTook my Dodge Ram 1500 in for an evaluation, which was free. Another shop stated I need to have my rack & pinon replaced, radiator was leaking, thermostat was stuck open, and the  temp sensor was bad. Wanted to charge a lot to repair all items, $1500.00.\nI always get second and third opinions and I'm glad I did.  Yelped auto shops in Goodyear, called and was able to get in the next day. Phil was the one that looked over my truck and was very honest. Said that he wouldn't recommend the rack & pinon replacement because the leak was dried up, no wet dirt. Plus most rack & pinon do leak at first. He also said that the sensor was not bad and that the thermostat was the issue and that I did need a radiator since it was leaking.\nIn all, the write up was very reasonable and I went ahead with the work. Had it back by the end of the day.\nI will definitely be having this shop perform ALL maintenance on my vehicles!\nThanks so much for your honestly Litchfield Auto Repair"
5,"My rating is for the Afternoon Tea.\n\nWe made reservations for Wednesday at 3pm so it was nice and quiet. \nFirst we chose the teas. We had the Lavender, Jasmin and Oolong tea. Mild and aromatic.\n\nThen we chose our tea sandwiches which were pretty good but the scones with the devonshire cream and lemon curd were so delicious!  yummm!!! (Definitely a must try!) They also served some sweet mini deserts which were very good. \n\nOverall Service was great and attentive and everything tasted great."
5,"Man, I had a HUGE craving for a burger today.  I started weight watchers a few months ago and am pretty limited on the types of burgers that I can eat now.  I was SO surprised when I found that In-n-out has a six points hamburger lettuce tomato onion and ketchup only.  This totally satisfied my craving.\n\nI have been a fan of in-n-out for years and diet wise the food isn't really that bad for you compared to other fast food places.  Btw, for all the ww yelpers, the fries are 9 points.  I stayed away from those this time....but there's always next visit.\n\nMy baby LOVES their cheeseburgers, so great for kids too! (especially picky children) and my husband loves their animal style burgers and fries, but I'm not a huge fan of that."
5,"Got in late last night to the airport and called the front desk when I landed. They sent out the shuttle and it was there waiting by the time I got my luggage. There were several senior citizens getting on the shuttle with me. The driver was so courteous and respectful, just the way I would want my grandparents to be treated. Check-in was quick and painless. Security guard was around keeping a set of eyes on the courtyard which is kinda nice.Room was clean with modern furniture and a comfy bed. Some good premium channels were available for free (Showtime, etc)\nI was hungry and grabbed some food at the 24hr Denny's right next door. Food wasn't great, but hey, it's Denny's. At least there is something available 24hrs which this New Yorker appreciates. I was pleasantly surprised with the continental breakfast this morning. Fresh fruit, yogurt, 3 types of cereal, waffles, muffins, toast, milk, and OJ! I didn't have to suffer through another Denny's meal! Oh, and the WiFi is stellar! \nFor the price and area, I am leaving extremely satisfied. Great job, guys!"
5,"Love, love, love this place!  The food is amazing, the presentation is so artsy, great variety, the service is great!   Note to self, never book a show after the dinner here because 1.  Will be on time constrain so cant fully enjoy everything they have, 2. Will be too stuffed to run to the show once we are late by spending too much time nibbling n the deliciousness."
5,"I always thought that dogs eat any and everything. That was until I rescued my two-year old German Shepherd named Bear. She's finicky and choosy and this can be extremely frustrating and stressful -- particularly when people would stop me on a walk around the block and comment \""is your mom feeding you?!\"" (thank you people, by the way, not intrusive at all). \n\nI popped into 4 Paws Holistic for help, and got so much more. With Bear by my side, she sampled different foods and treats and I was able to see right there what she liked or didn't like. Their customer service team was happy to talk me through different options - raw food, dry food, a combination thereof - that would get Bear eating and put some weight on her. \n\nMy experience every time has been great, and 4 Paws Holistic is my go-to for picking up Bear's dog food, treats and bully sticks."
5,"Simply put, AMAZING.  Took my wife here with some friends this past Veterans Day weekend.  Hoping for a positive experience since we had such a negative one the previous day at Gordon Ramsay Steak.  Anyways, this brunch takes the cake.  I honestly didn't feel like there was anything missing except maybe the d\u00e9cor.  I had lobster, king crab (yes, king crab, not the usual snow crab at most brunches), lamb chops, fresh water eel, lobster ravioli, and plenty of champagne.  Our whole party was extremely pleased with this experience.  Definitely will be back."
5,"I heart me some DD.\nBeing from the East Coast, living in CA, I miss my Dunkin Donuts like crazy, but LV made me happy by having a Dunkin Donuts for my coffee pleasure.\n\nWe went through the drive thru (a DD with a drive thru!), ordered a few donuts, and a couple of cups of coffee before our drive back to CA.\n\nHe got my iced coffee order wrong, but happily replaced it with what I wanted.  Donuts were eaten very quickly in the backseat, as I sipped my coffee most of the way back to CA."
5,"absolutely nothing to complain about. went to vegas this past weekend and was with 2 friends. one of them mentioned this place so we decided to try it. i had the chorizo hash, it was so tasty, spicey and delicious. i also had a bloody mary that was amazing. one friend got the chicken with waffles which were awesome and beautifully presented. the other friend got the artichoke hash, this was the lightest of the meals, and also tasted great. it is a lot, i mean a lot, of food per plate. i will go back."
5,"Okay, you've blown the majority of your money on gambling. You're not hungry and it's not club time yet. What are you going to do? \n\nMadame Tussaud's!\n\nAs opposed to other wax museums, this one doesn't take itself seriously. It doesn't even call itself a museum which makes sense, since the entire point of coming here is to take ridiculous pictures of yourself and your friends with wax statues of Johnny Depp and Elvis Presley. They even have props-like bunny ears to wear when you pose with Hugh Hefner."
5,"This is the first store I visited and I was SO grateful to find that they carried such an awesome variety of super healthy foods and treats made with high quality ingredients.  \n\nI've always found friendly knowledgeable people and it's a great, convenient location!  I haven't been in for a while but we loved seeing Brittnea and Kelly at this location last few times we were in.\n\nWe shop most often at the Tatum and Shea location.  Check out our review of that store for more on our experience with Choice Pet Market in the Phoenix area!"
5,They have a great selection here- icecream sorbet Gelato etc.  They have my favorite cold stone flavor (cakebatter) and the prices and service are better here !
5,"Beat the heat and head to Jump 'n' Jungle. Feeling stir crazy and want to release some pent up energy, go to Jump 'n' Jungle. On your way home from school and you want to interact with your friends and children, meet up at Jump 'n' Jungle. Two for Tuesdays are a budget friendly activity.\nNote: Pack clean socks for children and adults. Shoe-free environment and socks are required for everyone."
5,"Old school in the best sense of the word!  Superior quality, great service, friendly team. Cash only means cost stays low.  My car hasn't been that clean in a long time ;). And I wasn't expecting them to detail it.  Great to know there are still businesses like this around!"
5,"We had the best time last night at The Painters Lounge!  \""We\"" were 3 couples who had heard about this place and wanted to see what the Friday night painting/wine class was all about.  We were not disappointed!  Dina and her assistant made sure we were taken care of with our drink orders, and then the class began.  We all had a fun time trying to create our own masterpieces, and everyone walked away with an awesome canvas painting that we were proud of! \nDina herself is extremely friendly and accommodating.  She goes the extra mile to make sure everyone is enjoying themselves.\nWe will definitely be back for another fun Friday night painting class!"
5,"THE place to go on Madison's North Side.  Roomy, beautiful decor, family-operated, friendly staff.  The pastries are good, the bread and rolls are excellent, and the brunch and lunch menus are amazing!  There are lots of good vegetarian options, all clearly marked.  The Earthly Delights sandwich is my favorite--wow.  The soups and salads are also very, very good.\n\nMy only complaint is Manna's coffee, which is sometimes thin and over-extracted.  People who don't have a taste for good espresso may not mind (my Mom likes it fine), but I have to order a mocha or flavor syrup to cover up the bitter taste, and the texture of the mocha simply does not compare to what you'll get at the cafes on the square.  Still, it's probably the best coffee on the North Side."
5,"I love the double flyer day on Wednesdays!  The old sales and new sales are both valid.  Great gluten and dairy free options, although they stopped carrying my favorite dairy free blintzes.\nThe employees are generally friendly and available.  Easy parking, bulk products have great sales, and they rarely run out of sale items."
5,"This was so spectacular that we went 4 times in 3 days. Everything tasted fresh; the menu was so extensive that it was hard to choose what to order, so we kept returning and sharing. The plates are also innovative, not salads, but genuine chef-created and intriguing dishes that are just delightful and inspiring."
5,"If you got hair color problems this is the place to go and Betsey is the person to go to. This is the 3rd time in many years that I have gone to her to fix a bad color. I tracked her down from the other (not out of business, William Jon salon on the square). This time she cut my hair and did a wonderful job. She never makes me feel bad for what I did and she is willing to work with us who can't afford regular salon coloring visits and attempt to do it ourselves. She has been in the business 50 years and she knows her chemistry. I hear she is great with African American hair as well. Check her out."
5,"Honestly, I'm not sure what to expect when eating at Hooters. So far, so good, thus, the 5 stars.  But, I do have one minor issue with them, but not enough to downgrade them.\n\nEating here is what I imagined the 70's to be about.  Wood paneling, that weird color orange, and a little bit of tackiness thrown in for good measure.  So far, when eating here, I have had good experiences.  The girls are nice, the place is clean, and service seems to be prompt and efficient.  I usually can be found here during lunch hour only, and so far, those have been my only experiences.  No happy hour, no dinner, no weekend service.\n\nMy only \""complaint\"" is that I have carried out a few times from this location.  A handful of times, I felt like I have had terribly slow carry out service. Waiting forever for someone to take my order, waiting just as long for food, and feeling \""less important\"" then maybe the dine in patrons."
5,"A must-stop over when you're in the Phoenix area. Best southern food i've ever had! Far better than Roscoe's hands down. Their fried chicken is nicely seasoned. Not too much batter so when you bite into it, you're getting the right amount of crunch without the doughy taste. And it's juicy too! Even the breast. Their house made hot sauce is perfect on everything. I also ordered the biscuits and gravy. Biscuits were soft and fluffy and the gravy was legit too! And the service we got was really good. Def coming back when i get another chance."
5,"Great prices for great variety, taste, and portions! I always love coming here because the food is so flavorful. The desserts all look awesome as well. The times I have stopped by it has been pretty quiet but in a good way. Definitely a must go especially if you're in the area!"
5,"Warning: Awesome Place for a Date!!!\n\n\nHonestly, if you have an adventurous pallet and don't want the normal fair one night then you HAVE to try Soul.  Anyone that gives this place less than 4 stars is downright out of their mind!  I am extremely picky about the freshness of food, ambiance, pleasantness of staff, and pricing of food.  Soul's staff is always a pleasure to speak with and of the 5-6x I have been there, each meal has been nothing short of excellent!  If you do not try Soul Gastrolounge then you are really missing out!"
5,Best Nail Salon in Vegas! Affordable and great quality! I go to Le and she's so sweet and does an amazing job! My gel manicure lasts for three weeks! And I just go change it because I get bored with the color! No chipping or peeling like other places! Best price in town!
5,"Great food and good pricing. The sushi is great and I've never gotten fishy or old sushi here! Great for kids, just wish they had the children's chopsticks available. Good atmosphere and outside dining with lake view available."
5,"One of my absolute favorites in CU, Courier Cafe is the best place to relax and get some delicious American food. Old fashioned soda fountain favorites like phosphates and malt shakes make this place unique, but nearly everything is good. Sandwiches are on fresh bread,  and burgers are thick and hearty. There are a lot of vegetarian options- my favorite is the pesto grilled swiss on sourdough. I also love the ham melt on a fresh croissant. For dessert I recommend sharing a headliner, a monstrously delicious sundae drenched in hot fudge.\n\nFor the quality of food you get, this place is actually a bargain. I'd prefer it over most of CU's \""fine dining\"" establishments any day. Service can be slightly slow, but overall this is one of my favorite places to enjoy after a difficult test or a arduous paper-writing spree."
5,"This was a nice surprise and definitely a hidden gem in my opinion.  My friend and I tried this place on a whim because she heard they had good fried pickles.  Am I ever glad we stopped in!  The drinks are especially unique and it's a nice change from the typical Freemont Street spot to grab a snack.  Definitely more upscale than the usual with friendly staff, good food and unusual (and very delicious) cocktails. Drink prices are average to the other bars nearby, but the quality is much better.  If you're going to spend $8 for a cocktail on Freemont you'll get a better drink here than at the frozen drink stand down the road.  We had a couple of appetizers, a couple of cocktails and some good conversation with Chris, our waiter.  Definitely recommended!  I will be stopping here for sure next time I'm in Vegas."
5,"Will definitely be coming back. Loved the service and Marianne was awesome! She made me feel comfortable and at ease considering it was my first time EVER getting something like that done. She was quick and talked to me so I wouldn't distract myself with the short spurts of pain, (not as bad as I thought!) Will definitely recommend, especially if it's your first time! (:\n\nStef"
5,"I've used Dr. C for several years. He is calm, and fast.  A great dentist. Cleanings are great. Staff is very pleasant. Can't go wrong if you are looking for a competent, relaxed dentist who knows your mouth :)"
5,These guys fixed my 50+ year old money clip that belonged to my great-grandpa and made it sturdier than ever! The price I paid was lower than the price I was quoted too. I will absolutely return here with my watch and jewelry repair needs.
5,"Best baseball/ softball park ever, I love the people that work there and play there everyone is like family. The beer is always good to have when your playing with friends great park."
5,Went into Brio the other night as SQ is close to home.  The restaurant was very nice looking and being as it was happy hour I took a seat at the bar.  The bar staff was very friendly and I was happy to find out they had some awesome deals for happy hour.  I tried their shrimp and eggplant appetizer and it was amazing.  I'm not usually a big veggie guy but between the shrimp and sauce this dish is delicious.  The bread was warm and fresh and I ended up using too much of it to sop up the sauce from the appetizer dish and made myself full.  Can't wait to come back and try more.
5,"Thank you to Jessy for a tattoo I have had a ton of compliments on!\n\nI made an appointment but they also take walk ins.\n\nArtists that weren't tattooing were sketching, painting, or drawing.\n\nI got custom work done, she drew it up on my arm to get the right fit and I am looking forward to working with her in the future on the rest of it! I can tell her mind is brewing something up for me.\n\nCheck out their website for all of the artist's portfolios...every artist is there on the website so you can check out their work before you go.\nThe pricing is extremely reasonable for the quality of the work."
5,"We love this place!!!\nMainly because we got a season pass at the very beginning of the season which made going their so much cheaper!!  With the season pass we paid only $10 more than the day pass and got free parking for the season. \n\nYes the lines can be long and yes the food is really expensive but that is why you plan ahead.  Go on a day that makes more sense to be there and you can stay late, weekdays and Friday/ Saturday are the best we found.  Friday and Saturday because they close at 10 and you can beat a lot of the long lines.  \nBring a cooler and keep it in the car, that helps on prices of food.  \n\nI really don't understand all of the complaints.  It is a large water park where you can tell the people who work there are doing the best they can to help every person."
5,"My first experience with The Bikini was after a shoot in PHX. The crew rattled on for an hour about The Bikini and we all finally went. I'm Glad. This is one of those places that I've heard alot about and couldn't wait to stop and have a brew. It did not disappoint either. It is the, umm, hipster, artfag, freaks and geeks place? If your clothes rarely match by accident or design, this is your place. A typical dive bar with some great local art adorning the walls, kickass jukebox and a pool table. Now that I've also finally been to First Friday, it seems the two go hand in hand. I love when I get to go there. It's not in my regular bar list, but only because I'm in TempE and hate to drive, let alone drink and drive."
5,"The $5 lunch deal is a lot of awesome food - why would anyone go to the Subway next door?  Because of the popularity of the lunch deal, they're usually super busy during lunch hours.  No matter how long you have to wait though, you'll always get friendly service.\n\nAll of their breads are freshly made and you can't go wrong with any of them.  I've tried the wheat, ciabatta and sour dough and they're all really good.\n\nMy co-workers and I go there about once a week and we all love the Hell's Kitchen, Chicken Salad, Tuna Salad and of course the Turkey sandwiches, so I'd definitely recommend any of those."
5,I really like this place - second time coming good for mixed groups of vegetarians and meat eaters- second time coming and very good. I really like the soup (veg lemon grass) Plus it's bring your own wine!
5,"I think I'm in love! If you happen to like shakes or are in need of some fuel post workout (LVAC Flamingo & 215) check this place out. There's something for everyone...fatty, guilty pleasure shakes & fantastic healthy shakes! I got the Incredible Hulk, which is kale, pineapple & banana (I added some protein powder) and it was sooooo good! The people are are incredibly friendly & they also donate to Three Square, which helps feed children in Southern Nevada. Good product, good people & a good cause...I will be back for sure!"
5,"Came in on a Monday afternoon,  no wait and almost empty restaurant.  Yesss. Good came out quickly and was sooo good. Great place to get down and dirty with your family."
5,"Finally tried Mon Ami Gabi after so many great recommendations and it is my new favorite restaurant!!!!!! The food is unbelievable and the atmosphere is beautiful!!!! I had the hanger steak with Merlot butter sauce and it literally melted in my mouth! My fiancee and my friend had the salmon which was delicious also, and my friend and I shared the escargot which is something you must try if you never have before! I cannot say enough about this place and just talking about it makes my mouth water! Get to Mon Ami Gabi as soon as you can and I promise it will not disappoint!!!!!!"
5,"So, had I gone on my own to DMV, I would have had to wait for who knows how many hours to be told that I needed certain information changed.  Then would have had to leave, change that information and then go back and wait for hours.  At least, I was able to walk right up, get it all figured out in 10 minutes and pay a few extra bucks now to waste my entire day.\n\nThanks Rob Young Insurance for the recommendation!  Insurance and registration in the same place!  Makes total sense to me!"
5,"Absolutely fabulous!  Why do so many people fixate on the location?  The food was super delicious, Mexican + seafood, where could things go wrong."
5,"Delicious!! :) got seats within five minutes of arriving. Service was top-notch and atmosphere was great!  Portions are huge, can definitely get one order for two people.\n\nNot an ideal place for kids but perfect for dates, family gatherings, or any special occasion :)"
5,"Amazing pancakes!  We had a few samples brought out for our group this morning and they were perfect. We had the server pick the spread and it would not have been my first choice, glad we let him. They were perfect! !"
5,Eric was a great waiter for our wine pairing with MyVegas.com. Explained our pairings well and went to get answers when we questioned him. He did a great job and the food was great too.   We had the linguine with clam sauce and brick chicken.
5,"This salon is absolutely excellent.  I go to Lexi, who's one of their more junior stylists, which makes it totally affordable.  She is completely professional and is amazingly good at interpreting my vague and inexperienced descriptions and translating them into beautiful hair.  I have super long dirty blonde hair and she has turned it from drab to Taylor Swift cute!  She's also great at teaching me how to do different styles on my own, which has elevated my look completely!"
5,"Really delicious! I've been looking for some Indian food for awhile and decided to try this place out. Definitely going to have to become a regular. I got the Chicken Tikka Masala and it was the best I've had. as well as the naan, which was also excellent! A must go for sure!"
5,"Oh what a terrific restaurant this is!  On this second visit (for me) I was joined by Robyn N., & I ordered what I suggest YOU try for your first visit, a Carne Asada Torta Norte\u00f1a with salad for the included side.  (Skip the chips & order a 99 cent side of their delicious ceviche if you want a little something more.)\n\nWhat you get here is stellar everything!  It's a clean, it's comfortable, the service is friendly & attentive, the food portions are generous, & the prices reasonable.  You will leave full, & having just eaten some of the best food you have ever tasted!  YUM!!     :-))\n\nCarne Asada Torta Norte\u00f1a $7.49."
5,"The new location is huge! Been bringing my dogs to Grand Paws for a couple years. Very sweet staff, good follow up, in and out appointments!"
5,"My favorite buffet in the whole wide world is Wicked Spoon!  It feels like endless fine dining!\n\nThe atmosphere is elegant, classy, upscale, and spacious.  The staff is so polite and friendly.  I love the waiters!  The moment I'm finished with a plate, they swoop over to ask if they can take it away.  It was a very luxurious experience!  \n\nTheir drinks are no ordinary drinks.  Fresh squeezed juices and high end teas.  I've never experienced this at any other buffet.  \n\nThe food was very high quality at such a low price!  I ate chilean sea bass and roasted bone marrow the most!  The chefs will adjust and make any of the dishes the way you want it.  Everything was cooked to perfection!  All the food were artfully presented in their own miniature plating.  The dessert bar was so good!  I love gelato, apple pie, and bread pudding.  \n\nIf you love buffets, you must try this place!  It will change the way you view buffets forever!"
5,"Let me preface by saying that I'm not a desk jockey that writes reviews on restaurants based on portion size, wait time and how important they made me feel. It's about the food! My credentials are: 10 years back of the house fine dining experience and 6 years dining professionally as a fine wine distributor.\nI've never had a bad meal at The Parlor and generally find myself talking for days about whatever the latest seasonal menu item I've tried is. That said, any restaurant  is destined to have an inconsistency now and then...  It's just never happened to me here. \nLet me get to the point. I'm a very adventurous eater but now and then when I find a classic dish that is executed in superb fashion, I'll fall back to it time and time again.\nTHE PARLOR MAKES THE BEST CAESAR SALAD IN THE VALLEY. It's such a simple preparation yet somehow 95% of valley restaurants do something to screw it up. They either deconstruct it and make it a chore to eat or put there own twist on it that completely takes it out of the realm of what a caesar salad is. How arrogant. \nToo all other PHX restaurants: Just because you use romaine doesn't make it a Caesar. \n\nLesson:\n\nCaesar Salad = Chopped or torn Romaine hearts, Creamy parmesan and anchovy emulsion, fresh toasted (and seasoned) croutons and some shaved Parmigiano Reggiano.\n\nTHANK YOU PARLOR PIZZERIA FOR KEEPING IT REAL!"
5,"I have been in this restaurant for 2 times and tried their Lamb Sandwich, Baba Ganouj and Shawarma Chicken. They are all very delicious. Next time I will try Sleek which has kale inside. It looks really tasty and servings are large. Waitstaff is nice and helpful. Decor is cozy. I can't wait to go there again and try other dishes."
5,The sales team worked with me to trade a car that needed work and put me into the car I always wanted for a price I could afford.  Talk to Jeff and Dom they are Awesome!
5,Great surprise for me and my business partner.\nPeople are cool and service was impeccable.\nFood followed the good experience we had since arrival and a place to go i you're looking for a nice combination of dining and ambient.
5,"I joined Truliant years ago primarily to obtain an car loan.  The process was simple and convenient.  My credit was not so good at the time, but they did give me the loan, as well as a subsequent one, both of which helped to improve my credit.  Everyone working here is super nice as they know that the members own the credit union, rather than a bank where investors own it.  The location is convenient - right off of 77 at Tyvola.  The coolest thing they have done recently is eliminate the need for deposit and withdrawal slips if you make transactions inside the branch.  Also, you can make deposits for other local credit u ions here which is nice.\n\nOn the rare occasions I have to call and talk to somebody, I talk to someone with a southern accent rather than someone from halfway around the world that I can barely understand.  They are based out of Winston-Salem, NC, so it is great to have them in the QC.\n\nMy only very minor complaint is that they don't have one of those machines that counts coins as most credit unions do."
5,What a wonderful experience! I have been jumping from dentist to dentist for the last 5 years. I am happy to say I have found a place to stay!
5,I have had my car serviced here 3 times now. They have the best customer service and are not trying to sell you on services that you don't need or ask for. A+ service and the integrity of the company and employees that run the place are exceptional. It's hard to find a honest shop that's not going to rip you off. Quick speedy service. Thank you for being awesome! BIG O TIRES on rainbow. 3 thumbs up.
5,"Only theater in town i'd go to.  Comfortable seats and easy parking.  Always reserve your seats online before going, makes things alot easier."
5,"Service is exquisite and the food is intensely flavored without being too overwhelming in grease. This has to be one of my favorite new restaurants when I visit Montreal. \n\nI only had lunch. The soup was good and paired well with the smoked mackerel. The poutine was a bit overwhelming, but not in the slabs-of-foie-gras overwhelming like Au Pied, but sort of flavor wise, a little too much between the scallions and the turkey confit that seemed to overwhelm rather than mesh together. Still, it was really really good. 4.5 rounded up."
5,"I arrived at the funky lil joint this morning, and was pleasantly surprised that I did not have to sit in the long stream of cars in the drive-thru line. The gentleman at the window was friendly and patient, he suggested the Vanilla/Honey Latte Iced, this was my first experience here so I was grateful for the suggestion. It was FANTASTIC! I also ordered the breakfast burrito which was delicious, (their home made salsa was perfect) & it did NOT weigh 10lbs so I still feel fantastic after devouring it, not like I want to curl up, clenching my stomach, and sleep for 10 days. The service was also prompt, and the gal who walked my order out to my car was super friendly! Prices were very reasonable as well! This experience sure beats out the long line, hasty service, tiny over-priced cups of joe, and hard pastrys, at your local chain Starbucks. They also serve a great variety of craft brews and wines and, have a comfy, dog friendly, patio! I will definitely be back when I am in the area again! Support LOCAL, check this place out, you'll be glad you did!"
5,"Wow Tater! One of the best mixologist down town!! If you're down town you have to stop by,  you won't be disappointed! Perfect Atmosphere, great food and service!"
5,"What a fun adventure ! Today we went out the gorgeous Cave Creek recreation area  and rode horses with the Cowboys..This has to be one of the best experiences of horseback riding I have had. The horses were healthy and energetic, the trails was breathtaking, the crew very helpful. \nThe horse back operation is ran for the \""winter \"" season by Jeff and Debbie who have this down to a science.  They have boots, hats and props for all ages . They even throw in a bottle of water for you if needed. \nHere are the extras I like :\nRan  the groups in small bunches  about  4 to 8 toy a group. \nHave saddlebags for your camera, water bottles and what not.\nVery personable bunch  friendly  without being fake\nHats  provided  --nice touch on a sunny day\nTrails are interesting and you feel like you are out of the city\nClean neat operation\ngave us a 5.00 buck off person coupon for next time for our whole group --- gotta have coups , baby! \n\nIf you have family visiting  in town this is a great AZ experience , you can swing by Cave Creek when you are done and have BBQ at Bryans..  hurry thought the winter season ends May1 st.."
5,Great shop.  I can't 89 agile why anybody would complain about speed of service.  Slow is better when doing mods.  This ain't jiffy lube.
5,This place is Amazing!!! The food id Delicious and the atmosphere is just fun! They have Salsa Nights on Saturdays and the music is great! Definitely top 5!!!!
5,"OUTSTANDING IN EVERY WAY. \n\nDarlene is the owner and #1 World Champion Queen of the Alteration Universe. I really cannot say enough good things about her. Her friendliness, dedication, and skill are unmatched. \n\nI started taking my dress pants here to be taken up almost 8 years ago when I was still in school at Ye Olde UW. At the time, it seemed a pretty far way to go for an alteration place (ALL the way on the east side LOL). But after the first experience, I would never go anywhere else. \n\nI took my wedding dress here for alterations too. As expected, a fantastic job. Now that I live 3 states away, I still bring stuff with me when I visit and have her ship it back to me! Yes, this place is THAT good. Friendly, prompt service, and very reasonable prices. \n\nDarlene and her staff (one other person who I've never met but must be equally as amazing), are just the BOMB plain and simple. Never had a problem with anything done here. Back in the day Alterred States was just a teensy little store in a strip mall on Northport. Now, she's taken over the big middle part! Just goes to show I'm not the only (extremely fanatic) satisfied customer! \n\nBest spot ever. Take your stuff here. You won't be disappointed."
5,We were visiting the area and were able to make a last minute appointment on a Sunday! Our dog was treated royally.  The grooming was fantastic but even better was the attitude of the people there. They were great with our dog and made us feel like long-time friends.
5,"Everything about this place is just yes! The food, the beer, the atmosphere, and friendly service. This is the kind of place we live for. Not to mention, kid friendly for our tot to come along. Will be back!"
5,"Kick ass tacos, open late into the night, and cheap.  This place is doing it right!\n\nWe walked our way over here on our first night in Vegas, around 2 AM.  They'e located towards the end of the strip, past Treasure Island.  The place was packed and right away we noticed the delicious smells wafting over from all the different meat stations.  There's about half a dozen different meat stations, which you line up at and order, then you pay at the register.\n\nThe Adobada (Spicy Pork) was so good that as soon as I finished, I lined up  and ordered some more.  At the Adobada station, you'll see stacks and stacks of marinated spicy pork roastin on a spit, with a pineapple at the top.  The pork is shaved off the spit to order \n\nMy next favorite was the Suadero (Beef Shoulder), which you'll find at the station with the big pot of beef stewing away.  This results in fall apart tender chunks of beef, packed with flavor.\n\nYou have to eat at Tacos El Gordo when you're in Vegas.  I'll for sure be there the next time i'm in town!"
5,"You KNOW a restaurant is great when you go somewhere else and think, \""Gee, so-and-so's food is soo much better than this...\"" Dragon Wok IS that restaurant, the one you compare all others to... the one that tingles your tastes buds and leaves you wanting more.\n\nThis restaurant is a family favorite of ours. I can't tell you what to order... All I can tell you is that everything I've tasted here was delicious. Some dishes I'm in love with: Orange Chicken, Combination Lo Mein, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Gourmet Beef and their War Wonton Soup (yum!).\n\nDragon Wok is a wonderful establishment: The food comes in family-size portions, it always tastes great (they'll even customize a dish for you!), the decor is nice and unique, and-most importantly-everything is CLEAN (the floor, the tables, the kitchen, and even the bathrooms).\n\nIf you're wondering whether you should give them a try, the answer is \""YES!\"" Dragon Wok provides wonderful meals, service and an environment that makes every dining experience enjoyable =]"
5,Excellent coffee drinks. They also roast a variety of their own beans so when you buy those by the pound it makes for great coffee at home.  We are hooked!
5,So.... We are really getting in to Mediterranean food.  We found this local eatery and we were very pleased.  The food was flavorful and fresh.  We will be back to try other dishes.
5,"We went to Kickstand the other night for the first time to try out their burgers.  We were first impressed by the cleanliness and nice atmosphere of the restaurant.  We were seated in a booth that had its own flat-screen TV.  It was off and the hostess offered to turn it on.  While we appreciated how it would be good for sports fanatics, we opted for a non-TV dinner.  \n\nI love that the burger choices at Kickstand are unique.  They offer interesting flavor combinations.  My partner ordered the Cycle Zydeco Burger (Zydeco spread, Mardi Gras slaw, and Root Beer glaze).  It wasn't too spicy for him, and he's not a big fan of too much heat.   I, on the other hand, love spicy stuff, but went with the Greek Burger as a change of pace.  It had kalamata olive spread, tzatziki sauce, and feta, three of my favorite things to eat.  The sauce really made the burger.  The burgers themselves were juicy and flavorful, too.   \n\nThere were also a lot of sides to pick from.  We both opted for the combo tater tots/sweet tater tots side item.  The regular tater tots were good, and the sweet (potato) tater tots came with a butter/brown sugar syrup for dipping.  It was literally like dessert.  What a great offering.  \n\nWith the food, atmosphere, and service being great, what wasn't to enjoy?  We'll be revisiting Kickstand the next time we're in the mood for a really good burger."
5,I am super happy with the service I received.  I called and spoke with Jerry - he came out the same day and gave me an  estimate - which was very fair.  They scheduled my tree trimming for the next day!  Alex was great.  He introduced himself right from the start and made sure we were on the same page.  He and his crew did a great job!  They even cleaned everything up and left it looking nicer than before they came.  I highly recommend them!!!  And I will use them again!
5,"Delicious food!! Need I say more?  The staff are professional and friendly.  The portions are very large for the price point - go in hungry and you will still come out with leftovers.  Definitely a gem in the rough!  I would recommend it to friends, as well as come back next time I am in Vegas!!"
5,"THE BEST EVER...I have had good and bad experiences with dentists in the past. I must say that Modern Dental Care gave me the best experience ever. Very friendly and knowledgable staff. Prompt service, with friendly guidance. Dr. Mark Edington does terrific work. I felt very welcome and comfortable at every visit. I recommend Modern Dental Care for anyone with any oral emergency, tooth ache, regular maintenance or just a cleaning. You will be glad you chose them!\n\n\nThanks!\nDave"
5,Again I was not disappointed at Saint Sushi. Always fresh and the staff is so friendly!\nSee you on my next trip.\nThe Caribbean Queen!
5,"Fantastic bagels. I have never had better in my life--not even in any of the seven local bakeries we visited in NYC. I've had at least one bagel every week since it's opening, and each one is just as delightful as the first. It goes without saying that their bagel sandwiches perfectly complement the bagel itself (might I suggest a jalape\u00f1o bacon bagel with egg, pepperjack cheese, sausage, peppers, onions, tomatoes, and jalape\u00f1os?). \n\nWhile the pastries are all delicious, the chocolate croissant is truly exceptional--the type where you promise yourself you'll have one...and then stop reordering after your fifth."
5,"Reasonable prices for great service (I'm usually out the door for $26 total).  These guys won't let you sit around too long.  If you want to talk, they'll talk - sports, women, whatever.  If you don't want to converse, then you can watch one of the TVs they have at each chair.\n\nEach regular cut ends with a straight edge shave and hot or cold towel, as well as a quick machine massage.  Good guys here, well worth a few extra bucks over going to Cost Cutters etc."
5,"Wow, never have I though that pub food could be this delicious. Cornish Pasty Co. is by definition a hole in the wall well worth driving too from any where in the valley if you are seeking simple, affordable and downright deliciously satisfying food.\n\nThe menu is impressively varied, from typical, premium to signature pasties. I went with the lamb vindaloo and its spiciness left me goofy with delight.\n\nThere is no host/hostess at the entrance, so you can either seat yourself at the bar, and you can even hang your purse from underneath the counter!\n\nThe service is warm, friendly and efficient. Dinner for two without drinks was a bargain at $ 25."
5,"First time impression was awesome! Sat down as soon as I walked in, the server came right over and asked me what I'd like to drink and if I know what i want already! They must have a lot of regulars that come her for a quick good meal and go. Great business. I ordered the special, whatever it was it was fantastic. Fries were yummy and crunchy. Everything is great here, I look forward to being a regular. It's super close to my company's office!"
5,Girls are sweet and prices are reasonable. The stand up bed is hot so make sure you adjust your time ( I might just be super white lol)
5,Justin did a fantastic job in cleaning my carpets at Benchmark printing. Our carpets take a beating with paper dust and ink. He came in and within 2 hours they were looking brand new again. I would definately recommend Elite Floor & Furniture Cleaning.
5,Gotta be one of the nicest and fanciest rooms I've stayed in in a very long time.  The bed was so comfortable I ended up hitting the snooze button multiple times just so I could rest longer... not sure if that was a good thing or a bad thing
5,"There are only a few stores that I can spend hours in.  There are certain stores I don't like to bring my wife with me also.  Harbor Freight Tools is that place.  I get the flyers in the mail and start my wish list.  It's like when a a kid gets the Toys R Us catalog.  \n\nOne has to approach Harbor Freight Tools a little different.  Are you a professional contractor that has multiple jobs weekly?  Well then this place probably isn't for you.  You might want to spend a few bucks more to get some better power tools. Are you the weekend warrior or the DYI home owner?  Then, this is your place.  They have a lot of great tools that won't be used all the time, but will get the job done. These tools won't break you wallet either.  I have purchased some specialty tools here that I needed for certain jobs and they were great.  I have also purchased a cordless power drill that was a piece of garbage and waste of money.  \n\nThe trick is to go see the quality of the tool and then see how often you will use it.  If you only need it a few times and it's pretty cheap, then get it!  Overall this place is awesome.  I love going here and finding some great deals.  You have to come check this place out.  Cheers!"
5,"Went her yesterday nd got some English Bangers and some English Bacon.  YUMMO, they have a great aray of meat there, Will be going back there again, to get some Lamb next time.  Prices are very reasonable."
5,"Second trip to Downtown Tattoo - Buddy hooked us up and fixed our tats. Super guy who stands by his shop and the people he has working there. \n\nHappy to say the next time we're back in Vegas, this is the only place we will get our tattoos!"
5,"We shared a stone crab appetizer; never had these before, they were okay.  We were told that these were frozen from last season, since the season starts in October.  We just didn't see the big deal with them.  \nThe highlight of my meal was the 2 lb. lobster, which they cracked for me.  It was the best ever, and my wife loved her halibut dish.  The spinach was terrific, also.  All in all, a very rewarding and pleasant experience."
5,"This place is absolutely amazing. From the authentic Italian food to the home made lemoncello, it's my favorite place in Phoenix. Just do it. No joke, just do it"
5,"During our latest Vegas trip last December, we got a chance to check out Mon Ami Gabi in Paris for dinner. We were seated outside and had a straight view of Bellagio fountain show every 15 mins right across the street. Wow, this was one of the best views we have ever had from a restaurant.\n\nOn to the food - my husband had Sea scallops and Cafe au lait. I had salmon, both were pretty awesome. Want to go back."
5,"After reading the reviews I called DC to see if they had anything Open for me to get my expedition windows tinted  today ( Just the front two windows) Joe mentioned that he was working on a car but he didn't have to finish it until tomorrow and if I come right away he will fit me in. Wow! Made it there in less than 10 minutes he pulled the vehicle out that he was working on And pulled mine in.  He called Me back in about an hour and a half after working on my car and it looks great. Customer service, dependability And quality of work Joe is your man.... Highly recommend."
5,"My wife and I went her New Year's Eve night, 2010. We loved it! The atmosphere and service is fantastic. The staff is dressed very authentically Japanese and loves to interact with their clientele.\nThe food was amazing. I had fried oysters, which are brought out in the shell. There were 5 or 6 on my plate and they were huge and oh so good. They tasted fresh and were excellently fried. My wife got the sashimi variety platter which looked and tasted fantastic. I really have nothing negative to say about this place. Our bill was approx $60 for 2 entrees, two appetizers, twos soups and salads. It was a very nice experience and date!"
5,We had an A/C unit go out at 11pm and I called and asked for a tech early the next morning.  Robert showed up promptly at 8am and took care of the repair quickly. The price was reasonable.  Two days later our other unit went out and I called in the afternoon.  They said they were booked up and I let them know we really were hoping to get somebody out that night.  The receptionist called me back after talking to the owner and he said he would personally show up as long as I didn't mind it being a little later.  He showed up right at 9pm and took care of the issue.  Everything has been great!
5,"Great espresso drinks crafted expertly! I haven't met the whole staff but, the redhead with the glasses provides awesome customer service. She's really friendly, not something you can expect from every coffee house (see: the 90's), and makes some damn tasty beverages. Nice decor, but I'm partial to sci-fi. I'd definitely return as long as awesome people like her work there!"
5,"The food and the service are the best! Seriously, the nicest wait staff & the best damn food you'll ever have. They also happen to play my life's soundtrack. Best music ever."
5,"Just came back from here today and loved it.\n\nLocation - Nice. Off Silverado Ranch and Bermuda, a lot of places near it and a good area of town.\n\nAtmosphere - Cute. It was clean, I enjoyed the setup and the dim lighting\n\nFood - Excellent! There were so many options on the menu it was hard to chose, they also had a vegetarian friendly menu. Huge portions, great value, and the food itself was amazing. Food is spicier than most thai places, they warn you, so make sure you don't get anything over a 3 if you only want mild spice.\n\nService - Our server was great. Very friendly, helpful and quick. My boyfriend was clearly struggling with his Pad Thai (which was a level 5 spice) but, we weren't going to ask for a new one or complain, but the server offered to make him a new one. It was a very kind gesture.\n\nWill be back!"
5,"Val was very helpful and knowledgeable about the products. She helped me with a sim card issue and didn't even charge me, so I bought a stock charger for a great price. Will buy from again and refer my friends and family."
5,"I get my car washed here and really like the service and especially the professionalism of assistant manager Michael Jorgensen.  He is polite, articulate and has the energy and drive to move forward in his life.  I always enjoy our brief chats!"
5,"Great for serious BBQ cookers. No better place to get supplies. If they don't have it that can usually get it.  Bring you truck because you will want to buy it all.  $18.00 for a 2 cubic foot bag of 1/2 cut logs I bought almond, peach and hickory today.  There is no other place to stock up on BBQ product in Vegas."
5,"Great location! Beautiful facility, all renovated, gym, pool, great meeting rooms, wonderful bistro, and quiet hallways. I was extremely pleased! I went for an event and they did a great job of coordinating the activities and giving \""great room\"" area for meet and greets. The bistro is a great place to hang out and have a light meal or coffee and meet others too. The staff was super super nice and seemed to love their jobs, even the cleaning crew was super cheerful and nice."
5,"I decided to make New Year's Eve reservations here based on the reviews I'd read on Yelp and my girlfriend and I both walked away impressed.  We were a little late for our reservations, but still had no problem being seated immediately as the restaurant was only about half full.  We were promptly greeted by our server Christy who was very attentive throughout the evening and was also helpful in drink selections for my girlfriend.\nAfter ordering our drinks, we started with the cheese plate appetizer with 3 cheeses - a brie, a cheddar and a third called Red Dragon (which I really enjoyed). In addition to the cheese and bread, the plate also came with candied pecans and a honey \""jelly\"" that really worked well with the cheeses.  The cheese plate was a nice starter as it wasn't overly filling, but there was plenty for two people.\nFor our mains, my girlfriend ordered the apple and brie salad with grilled chicken and I ordered the sea scallops large plate.  Both dishes were excellent - her chicken and my scallops were both cooked perfectly.  The sweet potato hash and celery slaw that came with my scallops was also delicious.  We both left feeling fulfilled, but not stuffed which was nice. \nThe experience at Table 274 was a great start to our night and we'll definitely be returning soon.  Great job Table 274!"
5,"Really really really great place to eat.  Nothing is greasy, and everything tastes fresh.  Slow roast short ribs are the best I have ever tasted.  Ahi sashimi salad is a full blown meal.  Portions are very generous and prices are more than reasonable.  The restaurant is very nice too, very classy, and staff are very polite and attentive.  I also recommend the bbq salmon if they have it.  Very moist with great flavor.\n\nAlthough it looks like a cookie cutter chain, don't let the applebees look fool you.  This place is first class without being first class expensive and it totally has no snotty-ness in it.  Did I mention how good the food is?  \n\nFriends tried the filet-mignon and they said it was the best they have ever had.  Perfectly cooked just as they asked for.  This coming from a  world traveler and self proclaimed steak lover this says a lot."
5,"Every time I visit this place, it just gets better. \n\nFirst, their selection keeps expanding. As a Gibson and Orange lover, I am in heaven walking into this place. Decent selection of used stuff as well (was sad to NOT see the Ibanez lawsuit les paul rip off in there this last time, but hope that means it sold!). \n\nBy far the best atmosphere of any music shop in town. Has a very \""Chicago Music Exchange\"" vibe, with couches and chairs set up in classy little arrangements, wood floors, and bare brick walls. It definitely has the feel of a higher end boutique shop, which is cool. Contrast that with the fact that the staff is extremely unpretentious, affable, and inviting. Everytime I've been in there, the employees have repeatedly asked if I want to play anything (which... yes, I want to play everything). Short haired blond lady, small shaved head guy, and taller brown haired guy all just seem completely approachable and like they're as happy to talk shop as I am. Love the staff there.\n\nOverall, this is a shop that I hope sticks around. I will definitely be making the effort to abstain from the online giants in favor of supporting these guys."
5,"We had a terrific experience here with Dr. Soltero. \n\nWe were a bit nervous about taking our great big 12 year old Belgian Malinois to a vet's office - her entire life, she was seen by a recently-retired vet that made house calls. We looked on Yelp and saw that Saguaro was in our city and had great reviews, so we made an appointment since our dog's back legs seemed to be giving her trouble. \n\nThe place is very clean and most of the staff were friendly. We did not have to wait long to see Dr. Soltero, who was kind and soft spoken. His assistant was also great with our dog and friendly with us. He gave our dog a thorough exam and helped us to consider several possible causes of her leg pain and prospective treatments. He knew what each course of action would cost, and helps us to weigh our options. In the end we chose the conservative option of treating her first with an anti-inflammatory, and we saw some improvement almost right away. \n\nShe's since been back for a follow up appointment, which was also a quick one, and Dr. Soltero called himself and left us a message about the blood work results. \n\nOverall we were extremely pleased with our experience and will return when our pets need care."
5,I broke my iphone 5S screen last week end and these guys fixed my phone in just 20mins. They have the lowest price in town. Great job wireless phone doctors! Im referring you to every one i know that has a broken phone. :)
5,I rescued a pup the end of September and started coming here after a friend had suggested I use them. When you walk in it doesn't smell which is a plus to me since my old vet smelt terrible. They are super friendly and genuinely care about your animals! After Lexi and I had gone on our first visit they called to check in with me and see how everything was going. My sister and I decided to bring our cat Hula there also and they have helped us get him back on track too after we noticed significant weight-loss and excessive shedding turns out to be a thyroid problem and they have helped us regulate his meds. I think they are very reasonably priced too. You should definately bring your pets here Dr. White is very good!!
5,"Stopped I for a pedicure randomly, Really fast and friendly, the guy who did my pedi was very nice even had a pleasant conversation... He told me I had healthy feet haha. No one was pushy, honestly one of my best pedicure experiences"
5,"Great environment and great people. Carl and Natalie are professional and knowledgeable about their products. \n\nI tried their weekly special \""Breakfast in Bed\"" and for me it is like a sweet vanilla/maple desert flavor. I also like how you can choose your VG/PG ratio which a lot of other shops don't offer. If you are in the area I would definitely check them out."
5,New place but experienced owner. Amazing blue cheese burger with a side of wing hot sauce. Also have tried all the specialty drinks and you can't go wrong with any of them!
5,"Came at 8pm on a Friday. Still had to wait an hour. It was totally totally worth it. We tried most of the tacos. The ones that blew me away were the chicken and the pork! Oh wow. Like an explosion in your mouth. Love the Mexican and BBQ fusion. It's like they were made to be together. Great ambiance, good service and BYOB! Can't ask for anything more."
5,A LOVELY BUNCH OF BONES comes with each choco box during hawlowene. if chocolate could talk it would saw buauahahaha spooooky.
5,"They tried to kill me, and I love them for it.  \n\nWhen a company posts a wing challenge usually covertly by  using terms fire, insanity,suicide or death wings I have to try it.Nearly every place using those terms in the valley are liars. If it's a chain restaurant Suicide wings =  a penguin's dangly bits. \n\nI am one of those idiots that frequents hot-sauce forums, sites and other places where my legal high can be obtained or discussed with those similarly afflicted so I took them up on the $15 challenge to eat 10 in 10 minutes, prize for 2 hours of speaking in tongues and humming a Johnny Cash tune?  Picture on wall and T-shirt plus not having to do it again:) The wings are caked in a habanero reduction that is more a  volume of heat eaten rather than insanely hot. Try it.It's awesome way to spend  20-30 minutes:D \n\nThankfully they have more affordable, livable, Zombie wings for those times you have enough T Shirts in your wardrobe but still need that kick. Their Hellzapoppin burger is rather good too.  Nice people,been in several times and orders have been quick, hot, correct and the food is a great value for money. 5/5  purely on heat  4/5  on food..5/5 value  So 4.7 stars rounded up:)"
5,came here with my bestie for a massage cz we got very bored in our hotel. oh man.. this place really can work it!!! it was very relaxing and i actually didnt feel like kicking someone in the face while they touched my toes LOL coming back here everytime i visit arizona ^_^
5,"Revamped menu, outstanding service and great atmosphere - not much has changed.  Our server Adrienne was outstanding and attentive and gracious.  The busboys and other guys were great as well.  We had the filet, the ribeye, the Dover sole special, garlic green breans with chili flakes, sauteed mushrooms, caesar salad and nice bottle of Cab.  Definitely will keep coming back."
5,"I just completed a trade in for a new watch. I couldn't have asked for better service or better value. if you're looking for a new watch, this is the place."
5,"Fair price, privately owned with friendly service and they actually know what they are doing. This is a really good alternative to the chains."
5,"Fun staff, amazing coffee. Try the caramel mocha frost. \n\nI hate the smokers outside... gross! And they ruin the view.\n\nI love this location because it's close to Whole Foods. :-)"
5,Food is awesome and atmosphere is great! \nHad the staple Mac and Cheese it was creamy and delicious! 1000 island burger is incredible! Will definitely be back again and again!
5,"Went here the other night for a client holiday party.  There was about 10 of us at the table.  The restaurant is nice, clean and comfortable.  Diners were wearing business casual.  Appeared to be a nice place to take a date or go out for a business lunch or dinner.  I was a little taken back by the paper covers on the tablecloths, but again, Italian food is messy.\n\nThe server was very knowledgeable about the menu, pasta and wine, and made some excellent recommendations.  I was appreciative of her knowledge. \n\nI ordered eggplant parmesan.  Other guests ordered scampi, fresh fish, and pork medallions.  Every dish came out beautifully prepared, very large portions, everything was fresh.  Everyone raved about their food.\n\nThe eggplant parmesan was covered in cheese and fresh, home-made marinara sauce.  It was delicious and I wanted to eat every bite, but it was so huge!.  This dish could easily have fed four people!\n\nI was too full to eat another bite by the time dessert came around, but the 10 of us shared a tiramisu.  It was creamy and flavorful, more like a pudding than a cake.  \n\nGreat place!  We will be back!"
5,Just wanted to update the review by saying that I have been in with multiple people frequently.   The quality and consistency of service and product has been on point every time. Keep It up!
5,"There is very little need for a review of this restaurant. Come early and be ready to wait in line. The lines form quickly and if its cold or raining outside, dress warm and bring an umbrella. Believe me, it's worth the wait. Great staff and they do accept US currency, just not US debit or credit cards. \n\nAs for as the food, there's not much I can say except look at all the pictures everyone posted. They taste as fantastic as they look."
5,"I been going to Lims for more than 7 years. Their food is delicious. They have the best fries,orange chicken,rice, crab puffs and chicken wings In town. It's also super affordable and the waitresses are always super nice . I highly recommend to take your family here ."
5,"Can I give this place six stars? Seriously, I think this place is great. I always pretend to be healthy and get a salad as a side but then end up getting their chicado burger or wings. But honestly? Totally worth it. The staff is friendly, the ample amount of TVs is great, the food is tasty, and the atmosphere rocks. I should lie and say the opposite because I'm worried it will be too busy this football season but I can't! I just have to spread the word."
5,"This park is awesome!!! Great seats, great views, good food. The atmosphere is wonderful. The fans were great. I cannot say enough good things about it. The Pirates won the night we were there!\n\nTake yourself out to a ballgame at this park if you are visiting Pittsburgh during the baseball season you will not be disappointed."
5,I love this place.  When I am hungry and want to grub out I love coming here and getting different dishes.
5,"LOVE this place. Hands down some of the best sushi I've ever had - everything is fresh and thoughtfully made. The sushi is great (the scallops are amazing), they have some unique rolls on the menu and the service is outstanding. It's a very small place which I love and I think it adds to the authenticity. The chefs greet and say thank you to all who enter and leave. Can't say enough good things about this place!"
5,"The food here is amazing. You can tell the owners really love to cook.  I haven't had a bad meal here.  Quiet most days for lunch and dinner.  It can be crazy on Sundays for brunch with the after church crowd, so try to avoid it then.  Monte Cristo sandwich is insanely good, but they have lots of lighter food available too.  I also like the simple breakfast if you just want eggs and bacon.  Also the chicken and brie sandwich is pretty good too.  The men in my family like Hash of the Dog."
5,"The best show in vegas, period.  Terry has more talent in his pinky than most performers have in their entire bodies.   He has so much charisma, and humility it's amazing to see.  I took my wife and mother in law to see the show, and we were grins throughout the entire performance.\n\nWould highly recommend to anyone who is willing to let go and have a good time."
5,Gluten free fried goodness! This is what I think every time I eat here. They have gluten free fried fish & chips and also onion rings. Their prices are super reasonable too! Located on rainbow & 215 area it's a great location. \nAlso the employees are super nice. I suggest everyone to try this hidden gem!
5,"I absolutely love this shop. Both women who attend the shop, one being the owner I believe are absolutely friendly. However, honest enough when asked what do you think, they give you an opinion that actually counts instead of the normal shop garbage of everything looks great. \n\nI found so much at this shop I loved. Some sexy high pumps, a couture dress and several pieces of jewelry fitting a hard to please friend's taste. \nThe prices are reasonable, and if its been there for awhile she'll work with you a bit. \nA truly great gem amongst the resale shops.\nIt really depends on the item if its expensive or not. Its very worth it going in."
5,"I am extremely impressed with the service Copperline Plumbing (Gabe) provided. He was very professional, friendly and quick to complete the repair. I didn't feel like I was overcharged either, which is a huge bonus when dealing with plumbing issues. I will definitely contact Copperline Plumbing for any future plumbing needs."
5,I love eating here! The first time I ate here the manager introduced himself and was very kind in making sure everything was to our satisfiaction. I think his name was John but not sure...  Very social man. I have always received great service at this location in Gilbert. I also always bring my guests here to eat. The beer is always cold and the pizza is great. The only problem is on the weekends there is always a wait unless you find a spot at the bar. LOL  \n\nI have also eaten at the Chandler location and everyone there is really nice but the Scottsdale location people can be quite moody at times. The Scottsdale location is somewhat hit and miss with the employees. It almost seems like if it isn't there job title then they are almost unwilling to help you but like I said it's hit and miss.
5,"Great sushi, first place i goto when i get into town, all you can eat is awesome. The staff make you feel wecome and also give some great suggestions if you cannot make up your mind from the vast selections of roll's"
5,"I love the Art Theatre. It plays a decent assortment of international films and indy films. The concessions include beer and wine and better food than the typical movieplex. It is clean and has a wonderful sound system, the seats are comfortable and the staff are intelligent and ready to converse with you about the films or whatever."
5,"Amazing cupcakes & Great Service! The ordering process was simple and easy.  Free Delivery to my hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. Ordered days before and they were able to accommodate my request.  Needed one nonalcoholic cupcake and it was no problem!  Overall great experience with Sin City Cupcakes and I would recommend to anyone staying on the Strip from out of town who doesn't have a car while on vacation. Not to mention, they were very tasty!!!"
5,"First class!!!! I can say that this is the ONLY place in Charlotte I will get my nails done.  From the moment you walk in the door until the last nail dries you are pampered, spoiled and adored!  The nail professional are top notch, well trained experts at their craft.  Lina is part of our family, she has cared for me for the past four years and now her newest customer is my four year old daughter, Katherine!  I could go on forever with wonderful stories about all of the amazing staff!\n\nDon't miss an opportunities to visit this gem of south park Charlotte!"
5,"This is one of my boyfriends absolute favorite places to eat. He loves seafood, and so do I. I will say I love more traditional non-southern seafood so I only like a few menu items here. Fried oysters are good, the hush puppies are good obviously. He, on the other hand, will eat anything they give him. He loves the poboys especially. Overall, a great place. We keep coming back."
5,Still the best!! Jessica and her staff are amazing and caring! Stay independent amd come here for all your scripts!
5,"Took my schnauzer here after some frightening visits to other groomers. I'd had them tell me that \""Oh, he's sensitive about his legs\"" or \""oh, he snapped at me\"". Now, I'm not that dog mom that says \""Oh, he's an angel! He wouldn't ever do that!\"" No, if I think there's an issue, I'll tell you.\n\nAfter I picked him up, the groomer (I believe it was Jamie) told me that she didn't have a problem with him at all, that he was an angel. So, Crazy Dog Mom wins! ;)\n\nThey were able to get him in at extremely short notice, did an incredible job and even a slightly modified Schnauzer cut, and the price was fantastic. $40 for the groom with a $5 off coupon, but even at $45, I'll be taking him back from now on. :)"
5,The Sunday brunch is . It's served butler style (they bring the plates to the table). All the plates are absolutely delicious. They have bottomless drinks for an extra $20. It's a great deal and different experience compared to other buffets. It's for sure worth  a try.
5,"This is our neighborhood grocery store. Never reviewed a grocery store before. The meat is great, bakery is tasty, nice and friendly deli staff, and they are DEAD serious about getting you out of there when you're ready to go. Even have a person staffed just to monitor lines. You're in, done, and out as quickly as possible. That's what I'm looking for....plus the cheap gas. :)"
5,Best coffee and Danish you can buy. I always get the cheese Danish and the cappuccino. I love the little sugar stick that comes with it too. Skip the buffet an enjoy quality breakfast.
5,This is my favorite bar in Las Vegas!! The drinks are so cheap and there is always a good atmosphere! I come here every time I'm in Vegas
5,One of the best restaurants in Las Vegas. NEVER a bad meal here. I was in Vegas in April and we dined here as usual and then again last week. We will be back in Vegas at least 3 more times in the summer and will dine here all 3 times. It's just that good!!
5,The flowers were beautiful - just as displayed on their website - and they were able to fulfill a same day request.
5,Pineapple Park is our new go to spot when looking for dessert. Everything we have tried here has been fantastic. More recently we opted for something without pineapple and got the bananas foster sundae. It did not fail to impress and is a new favorite. Service is always fast and friendly. I just wish the owner would put one a little closer to our side of town.
5,"Love love love this place!  No where else have I been able to eat my own vegetarian diet while watching my husband blissfully eat his carniverous one!  He says the pulled pork sandwich is his favorite, followed by the ribs.  I am just so happy I can find tofu AND seitan cooked well in this town! I like getting the TV tray dinner, which I still have not been able to finish but gives me the option to ahve a variety of different dishes.  Oh, and the cornbread is AMAZING! Great selection of beers, fun place to watch a game or grab dinner.\nMindy, the server, is awesome too!"
5,"I've been coming and going to Vegas since I was 6 years old...as a kid, Excalibur was the coolest hotel in the world to me...now as an adult, I've never had more fun at a hotel.\n\nJust the gadgetry in the room kept us entertained for a solid hour, flipping on and off the lights with the touchpad, goofing around with the curtains using the switches on the wall, and testing to see if the master turn off switch really turned everything off...I was a kid in a candy shop!\n\nI lost who knows how much on the blackjack tables, but made it all back at the Craps tables.\n\nThe hotel staff was better than most and the security guards were on top of checking the room keys which made me feel better about keeping my bikes in my room.\n\nAs expected, the fridge was booby trapped with a 30 second switch, so we couldn't keep our drinks in the fridge. The view from my room was pretty epic as well. We woke up to seeing hot air balloons taking off towards the red rock mountains with the sunrise reflecting back the solid orange and reddish hues. Good Stuff.\n\nI posted a picture of the view from our room. Not bad at all. Overall, it maybe, just maybe as cool to me as an adult as Excalibur was to me as a kid."
5,"I have been going to Sakanas for years now, and can say that I have yet to have anything short of a great experience there! \n\nThe sushi is fantastic, very high quality and fresh! They give you huge pieces of fish for a very affordable price. The rolls ate delicious as well, they always have cool specials that can be seen on their whiteboard behind the sushi bar. The lunch special is fantastic, you can get plenty of rolls for very cheap! \n\nAlso, the service is always awesome. Yoshie, a manager, is always walking around greeting everyone and checking on you during your meal. She seems to know almost all her customers, and makes everyone feel important.\n\nI give them 5 starts for service, food quality, portion size, and prices, Sakanas is the best!!"
5,"Was in Charlotte in March and Omg the cook out!!! Why oh why do we have nothing whatsoever like this in Miami??? 4 am - yummy pulled pork, corn dog, hush puppies, cole slaw and the best damn banana shake I've ever had in my entire life for like 6 or 7 bucks. Coming from the land of batidos and where bananas actually grow, I'm tempted to look up franchising information but apparently this little chain does not stray far from it's queen city. Win. All around."
5,"Um, the Pink Cadillac cupcake is my new obsession! I am a BIG fan of frosting and was so not disappointed! I rarely allow myself a splurge like this. SO WORTH IT! \nThe staff was cheerful and helpful. They helped me pick out just what I would like. \nMy only complaint is that there is not anywhere close to sit and enjoy their confections. I can't dock them a star for that though. The cakes are worth hunting down a place to sit!"
5,"hobby got the gyro bowl $7.87, I got the chicken Shawerma wrap with fries and a drink $8.25. Fries taste great, try the fries sauce. it's interesting. my chicken shawerma has some garlic sauce and tahini sauce.  it was the best compare to Filfila Mediterranean Cafe or  Kyklos Gyro.  Even it's not as big as the Kyklos Gyro, you can order the gyro bowl (either chicken or the beef lamb gyro), rice are delicious (maybe cook with gravy from the gyro). Honey cannot finish all the rice from his combo.  Definitely will come again."
5,"This is definitely the best burger place i've tried anywhere. If you're more of a traditional person, this may not be for you. For everyone else, you'll probably find the best burger you've ever had. \n\nI would list out my favorite things but everything I try is more delicious than the last. The things I've had and loved are the Bhan-mi burger (current fav), Miyagi-san, oxtail chili fries, pork belly buns (if you do nothing else before you die, eat these), and the chili fried chicken."
5,"Hotel Review\n5 stars for clean, safe, hotel with free breakfast. This is a great location right off of downtown and the staff is super friendly. Check-in was quick. The rooms themselves are super clean and spacious. TV with cable + HBO. The other amenities include free WIFI (you get a code from the front desk when you check in), coffee, and pool. No problems with noise or difficulty sleeping. In the AM, free continental breakfast with hot waffles (delicious batter blueberry and regular), yogurt, boiled eggs, super 8 cinnamon rolls (amazing!), cereal, coffee, and milk. Saves you money on getting a complete breakfast. Free newspapers at the front desk as well\n\nPros- Very clean, bargain price, lots of amenities, top notch service, free breakfast\n\nCons- none\n\nHidden deals\n1. Free high speed WIFI\n2. Free breakfast\n3. Sign up at Super 8 website for wyndham rewards to earn free nights\n\nI am sold on Super 8, great hotel chain!"
5,"You can't call yourself a banh mi master until you have paid tribute to this temple of divine eats. Okay, so it really looks like a hole in the wall joint but that's where you gotta go sometimes to find the magically and spiritually liberating kind of stuff. Which other banh mi place can boast they make their own bread? THEIR OWN BREAD??? A good banh mi is only as good as the bread that it is incased it. Not many and don't give me lip about general lee's fakewich down the street either. If you want the real deal, you got to dig deep. Sandwiches range from 3.25 - 3.75. This place won't break the bank and the sandwiches are a foot long. EAT THAT JARED. No, literally. Eat it, it's good for you. Another amazing thing about them is that you buy 11, they give you the 12th free! SCORE. with 12 different kinds of banh mi and even a vegetarian to boot, who wouldn't want to give this place a shot? If it seems I am over zealous about this place, I promise you I couldn't be zealous enough. If you love banh mi then definitely give this place a try!"
5,"I think I've found a new favorite restaurant! The food is very fresh and flavorful, atmosphere is quiet and clean, service is outstanding... the owner is so welcoming that it felt more like I was dining at his home than a restaurant! A1!"
5,Great customer service.  Always get you in and out as quickly as possible.   Employees are on top of issues and polite.
5,Honestly the best sandwich I have ever had.  The bread was soft and delish.  I had the Italian and hubby got a turkey.  We both loved our sandwiches!  I am bummed that we found this place on our last day there because I would have gone back.  It was quick take otu service and we were able to eat right there to enjoy the sights.  Mmmmmm wish we had these back home!
5,"Absolutely love the place! My husband and I came in last night for Valentine's Day. When I go to Sammy's I get the same thing every time, Duck Tacos and Lobster Bisque. But our amazing server, Zach, went over the menu and I mentioned something about the Fish Tacos. And Zach told me how delicious they were, and WOW he was right!  So we got the Duck tacos and soup as an appetizer and the Fish Tacos, and my husband got the Chicken Tequila Fettuccine.\nMy Valentine's Day was awesome! I'm so glad we choose to go to Sammy's.\nFrom the service to the food was above expectation, though the restroom could use some work...."
5,"I'm here on business so that means I'm here sans wife and kids.  This is definitely not a place we'd have looked at twice if I had the family in tow.\n\nFirstly, their sign says \""Chinese and Cuban Food\"" which usually isn't something that I'm going to even give a second glance.  Stick to one cuisine -- generally speaking when people try to dabble in different cuisines none of them are done extremely well.\n\nTruth be told I was out on a quest for Mexican food I found on yelp.  But, both restaurants closed at 7pm and I was out looking at a few minutes after 7 so this place caught my eye.\n\nI can't tell you how the cuban food tastes; but, I had something called the \""Hunan Fried Rice\"" which is house special of sorts.\n\nIt was amazing.  It had eggs and bacon in it along with quite a bit of other flavors.  A bit of a language barrier -- I asked for no mushrooms and the waitress thought I was asking for no hot sauce.  \n\nBut, they brought some on the side and just a little bit of it did the trick.  It was very very hot.\n\nPoint is I loved the place and glad I stopped in.  It was within my budget also."
5,"Please pack your knives and go...here!\n\nAs critical as Tom Colicchio can be on Top Chef, it's hard to find anything to dislike about his restaurant. \n\nUnlike some Vegas restaurants, the atmosphere makes you feel as if you've truly escaped the casino madness and entered another world. The service is top notch and the food was outstanding. Their wine list is overwhelming, but if you look around you can find a decent bottle for under $100. \n\nFor appetizers we ordered oysters (fantastic!), the yellowtail hamachi (very fresh, although the citrus did overpower the fish a bit), and the lobster bisque (absolutely perfect - we ordered one to share for the table and they brought it to us in four small cups - nice touch).\n\nI had the wagyu skirtsteak and it was by far the best skirtsteak I've ever eaten. The yukon potatoes were amazing and the fries were perfect.\n\nFor dessert I highly recommend the monkeybread - it was amazing and the pecan/brown sugar ice cream was so refreshing. I'm a huge chocolate fan but this dish was far superior to the chocolate tart we ordered, which came with maple bacon ice cream (didn't care for it, and I love bacon!).\n\nOverall, one of the best meals I've had in a long time. Did I mention the bisque?\n\nFive stars - huge fan!"
5,"I had the Lobster Burger! Yes, I said Lobster Burger. It was PHENOMENAL! OMG! I have never had anything like it. THE best thing I have ever put in my mouth!\nThe service was impeccable! This place rocks! Open 24/7 too!"
5,"Stumbled upon this place whilst looking for a gift for a friend who's big into whiskies so figured I couldn;t go wrong.  I don;t know anything about whisky but the staff were really helpful, and knew their stuff so I managed to come out with a decent bottle.  They didn't push me into buying the really expensive ones either, which I'd expected.  I noticed they weren't overly pushy with other customers too, leaving them to browse if they didn't want any help when asked. \n\nThe selection of miniatures and big bottles is huge, and they have lots more besides whisky.  There's a note next to each type, explaining a bit more about it, which I thought was a nice touch, saving you having to ask all the time.\n\nwould definitely go back for another present - great selection, nice staff, good prices."
5,"Discovered this little truck during the Vegas StrEATS fest and it did NOT disappoint!  The wait was like 45 minutes, but so worth it.\n\nThis isn't snow cone land, the ice consistency is smooth and sleek. It's a different texture.\n\nThe Large is $5 and the Regular is $4.\n\nYou can choose up to 3 flavors per Shave Ice. They have approximately 30+ flavors to choose. From classics like cherry and bubblegum (regular and blue) to traditional Hawaii flavors, to several types of cakes. \n\nSome add ons like ice cream and sour spray and other stuff I don't recall are only .50 to $1 to add. Condensed milk is free (if you've never had condensed milk on a snowy treat, do it; you are welcome). \n\nThey have a Twitter so you can find them on the go and webpage they update! Definitely check it out. One of the cheapest and tastiest ways to beat the Summer heat in Vegas!"
5,This is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. It has amazing food for the price. \n\nI am also weary writing this review because I don't want that many people to know about it.
5,"This company moved us from San Tan Valley, AZ, to Prescott Valley, AZ, in September, 2014.  Most of the move went well.  When we hit a few rough spots and some damages,  the owner, Derek, stepped in immediately, kept his word on all repairs, and stuck to the original moving estimate - even though it was off by a more than small amount.  Rare to find a moving company this ethical.  We won't hesitate to recommend them to our friends."
5,"the burgers are Delicious! the salads are yummy. The staff in the front are very attractive. for the guys, sit in the front or the bar!\n\n the flavor of the food itself has always pleased my tongue. \nthe yam fries sometimes come out a bit soggy. and the price of the burgers is a bit high for what you can find elsewhere, but heck you're at the cosmopolitan casino, nothing is cheap there.\ni want to give this place a 4.5 or 4.75 stars."
5,"I agree with the positive reviews of this spa.  I had a massage there last week, and it was very clean, and the massage was great.  I was glad I got to keep my clothes on, and the masseur put towels over my clothes to protect them from the lotion on his hands when he massaged my back.  Though it was a little painful at times, I didn't ask him to lighten up the pressure, because I wanted to see how I felt afterward.  My feet were in heaven for over a day!  The price was great.  I will be back, and bring friends with me."
5,"I honestly have only positive things to say about Postino's since every one of my visits here has been very pleasant. From the valet who is running his ass off to the food and everything in between, this place does it all right! If you go here hungry, you should know that your options are basically a panini, a salad or some bruschetta. I've had a little bit of everything and for the value and quality you can't go wrong the the bruschetta. I recently determined my favorite to be the ricotta, dates and pistachio but a close second is the salami and pesto.\n\nWine by the glass can be a bit steep so if you're planning to stay for a bit and can agree on a style with your company, you might be better off getting a bottle. A bottle is pretty much 3x the price of a glass so you end up getting 1 1/2 glasses extra. Bonus!\n\nSomeday, I'll actually take advantage of their $20 deal for wine and bruschetta!"
5,Great food!!! The French dip is to die for!! Great Service! Clean and fancy especially for the area it's located in!  Def a hidden gem! My husband and I both love going here and can't wait until next time.
5,"If you don't know about this place, you are missing out. For one, the prices are very cheap. Second, the food is amazing. Best bean and cheese burrito I've ever had. Breakfast burritos are amazing as well.  \n\nAnother great thing about this place is the menu. There is a very large selection.  While this place may look like Filibertos, a Phoenix staple, its food is far superior."
5,"After being told by my dealership that my car was in immediate need of new brake pads, I took my car over to Brake Masters and worked with Steve.  I was on lunch, so I had a coworker drop me off - and asked him to call me and let me know what the deal was with them.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later I get a call... my brakes are absolutely fine, and they were not going to do any work.  It's clear that I was lied to by my dealership, and that Brake Masters was completely honest with me.  It would have been easy for them to not tell me and take my money - but that one simple phone call has earned them my business... when I actually need work done!"
5,"Jared Blake Entertainment was truly the best wedding DJ entertainment package I've ever seen and I've been to a ton of weddings.  The additional musicians were amazing too...and added such a uniqueness to the event.  All the songs were terrific, we had so much fun dancing and Jared himself MC'd and he was fantastic.  What a great affair, I would definitely hire him for my next big event!"
5,"Came in to get my fingerprints done, which I thought would take a year and a day since this location also deals with impounds. NOT SO... They have coordinated the flow of people so well that you talk to someone at a window within minutes about fingerprinting, they take debit/credit cards to pay the like $8 fee (not sure about that price, double check). Then within minutes, they take you to the back, pat you down to make sure you're not a sociopath and do your prints. It's that easy. Plus, they had wipes to clean your fingers off and I've heard of horror stories for other police departments about leaving with gummy black fingers. I will DEFINITELY be going back to this location if I need my fingerprints done for a clearance card again. : )"
5,"Prenatal massages for less than $40 for an hour?!  SIGN ME UP!  \n\nAs a birthday gift (February), J got me a gift certificate for a prenatal massage at SWIHA.  I did not cash it in until April, because I wanted to be a little further along in my pregnancy...when I knew I would need the massage the most.  \n\nAfter my first visit, I was hooked!  I started booking regular Friday afternoon appointments every 2 weeks.  And at $33 for an hour...for a student..who's received the necessary prenatal massage training....it was not breaking the bank!\n\nThanks SWIHA for making the last month of my pregnancy tolerable!  :)"
5,"STAFF IS GREAT. They are helpful and give fair value on trade items. Also fun to talk with. This location is good for finding rock and metal. Two of the staff members Marcus and Brendan are two of the most knowledgeable when it comes to the screamy-shouty stuff. good used vinyl. CHECK condition. this is the best location to score indie stuff. While the chandler store will have way more titles on cd at $2.99, the Tempe store has better stuff. more imports. more rare cd singles and maxi-singles. Jazz cds are okay. Jazz vinyl not so much. they do have some solid reissues. The country section is small but well stocked on wax and cd. hiphop could be better but if yuo enjoy turntablism and underground hiphop this is your store. Again, to sum up this is the best Zia in town. To all the people complaining about getting ripped off on credit, hate the game not the player. The zia points program is cool, asis the 20% coupon for filling out the survey online."
5,"We've ordered cupcakes from Treehouse on two occassions.  We've had lemon blueberry, vanilla, chocolate, and churro.  All were wonderful.  The mini cupcakes are the perfect bite.  Highly recommend."
5,Amazing food! Went there for my first time and food was fresh. \n\nI'm a huge fan of Mexican food & have had a lot but this place is awesome! The service is great & fast but the seating is not quite roomy. Although it didn't stop me from enjoying my food!
5,"This restaurant gets 5 stars!!!  \n\nWe went here for Father's Day, and I wasn't sure what to think at first.  I looked over the menu before we went so I could decide what to get.  \n\nAfter getting to Tutti Santi (cute, quaint, family owned place) I was excited to sit down and eat.  They had some specials, so we got some ravioli appetizer and bread, and it was amazing, everyone had seconds! \n\nOur salads came out promptly with delicious dressing and fresh lettuce and vegetables.  \n\nWe waited a bit for our entrees, but we werent even really worried about it, and then the manager came out to apologize for the delay, and about 10 minutes later our food arrived.  I got Chicken fiorentina, which was lightly breaded chicken with a white cream sauce and sauteed spinach.  OMG, it was the best thing I have tasted!!!!\n\nWhen we were all finished, the manager came out with a complimentary slice of cheesecake for the delay and offered my dad a shot of sambuca.  \n\nGreat service, fun atmosphere and I will definitely be back to enjoy another one of their delicious meals."
5,"We came here on December 23rd, after failing to find a local kebab store that was open.  I remembered the amazing mosaic sculpture and told my buddy, let's try the place with the big Dia de los Muertos lady on the front....and we did.  The Mayan taco was ....well...to use the term orgasmic would be both an understatement and a poor use of the word.  I took my parents there 4 days later and had a similar experience. My dream dinner there is to have many friends, many hours, many many tacos, and many beers or margaritas.  I am impressed with the food quality, but haven't had the beans or rice, I figure why?  They have tacos.  Also, impressive salsa bar with a pink radish salsa that I wanted to drink out of the bowl.  Yes, this is a hedonistic review, but I had a hedonistic time.  Go eat here.  They must never go out of business."
5,"WOW! I can't believe I've never had frozen custard before, it's freakin' good!\n\nNielsen's was our last stop in Vegas before heading back to CA. I was determined to try it even though it was 8:30pm & we had a 5 hour drive ahead of us. I mean, doesn't having a yummy snack make long drives better?\n\nThe workers here are SOOO incredibly nice, practically forcing us to have free samples before we chose to buy anything. They always have 3 flavors fresh in stock & a bunch of rock hard frozen flavors in the freezer. \n\nWe had a scoop of vanilla custard ($2.22) & a chocolate concrete w/ Kit Kat mixed in ($4.90). Between the 3 of us, we couldn't even finish because the custard was so creamy & thick & the servings were so large. The ever-so-friendly workers even gave us a little extra custard in our concrete so that it was oozing over the edge.\n\nI can only describe it as a creamier version of ice cream w/o all the extra ice fluff & a thicker version of frozen yogurt. Whatever this magical mixture is, it's heavenly!\n\nFrozen custard was even voted as on of the \""top 100 things to eat.\"" You'd be a fool not to try it!"
5,"The place is huge, has not describe. Eating there was a unique experience, very much wanted to have a close to where I work, have lunch there frequently. Vc takes a canister and choose what you want to eat  in 4 or 5 stands of about 10 meters each with service both sides. It's a lot of food to choose from. Vc weigh and pay in cash. The cutlery will be available after the box."
5,Love this place! We drive 50 miles from Anthem just for the beer and food. Great selecton of craft beers and the nacaroni with brisket is to die for!
5,"The best sandwiches that I have ever had, hands down.  This shop is actually a big reason that we book our rooms at Planet Hollywood.  Breakfast sandwiches are amazing.  We actually go to restaurants for drinks and then to Earl of Sandwich for dinner.  :)"
5,"This is my neighborhood GameStop. You know what GameStop is, so you don't really need a run down on the details. If you live under a rock, this is a place where you can buy video games and game systems, trade in your old stuff and even buy used stuff. This one rocks because I know the manager here, and I know he's a good guy. Raff takes care of me and my cousin here. When I'm not scooping up an awesome video game deal on Amazon, I'm buying it from here. Tell him Mario sent you, you might not get a crazy good hook up, but it'll get me more brownie points. Win, win?? I think so."
5,Wow!!! What a great find.  The stuffed peppers I had were awesome and NOT breaded.  They really take their tequila seriously. The Naranja Margarita was so good we asked for the recipe.  The bartender came out and told us everything from how they infuse their tequila to how they make their Margarita mix.  Our server was very knowledgable about all aspects of the menu.  Will be back very soon!!!!
5,"I had sushi and sashimi that I never knew existed here.  Thank God the server knew what to recommend because by reading the menu, as a Nobu neophyte I had no idea what was good.  Yeah, I ended up dropping over $100 per person but I knew it was going to be expensive anyways so come with a fat wallet if you want to eat here.  I remember the Black Cod melting in my mouth and the exotic trout which shocked my tongue in a good way.  The Kobe beef was heavenly...  Just thinking about this meal has me wondering when I'll be in Vegas again.  Just don't order the regular sushi though, I heard it's good but it's probably something you can get at any decent sushi joint that you live near.  You have to get the \""special\"" menu items."
5,Awesome happy hour! Their microbrewed beers are a mere $2 a pint from 3-6pm Monday through Friday (excluding holidays and Monday Night Football.) They also have $2 well drinks and wine as well as a great selection of bar food for $4.50. I had an IPA and a Santa Klaas Holiday Ale which was specially brewed for the holiday season. This was a very dark ale that is made with coffee beans and cocoa nibs. It was a delicious and different bittersweet ale with coffee and chocolate overtones. The service was friendly and fantastic!\n\nWe were only there for drinks this trip but will definitely return for more awesome beer and to try some of the yummy bar food!
5,"While visiting with family in Las Vegas, we decided to have breakfast at Mimi's since my uncle recommended it. We were not disappointed, the food and service were great! The pumpkin spice pancakes were awesome!"
5,"So happy to have this in the neighborhood! I've been there several times and not been disappointed once. I can see how Jennifer has been a long-time successful caterer. \n\nThe Cuban sandwich is plentiful and delicious. The asparagus, burratta, and prosciutto salad is a nice light offering but still satisfying. Butternut squash soup hit the spot. I enjoyed the fresh shrimp po boy - the shrimp was not fried - which made it feel healthier.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of the nosh boards, the corn chips are nothing special and the combination is a bit weird.  \n\nDo try the brownie cookies, you will not regret it."
5,"So far so good! I'll have to update this after the actual wedding, but so far the planning with Mandalay Bay has been pleasant. Our coordinator is Aleena and she always emails or calls me back in a timely manner and is helpful. We visited the chapel in person and agreed it's much prettier than it looks online. We're excited hopeful it all goes smoothly!"
5,"Platinum Blonde Perfection.  Jay works wonders and he has given me the best platinum blonde 'do ever.  It was gorgeous.  My hair looked like corn silk.  If I had boat-loads of money, I'd fly him out to LA every 6 weeks for a touch up.   Go to see Jay...tell him Laura from LA sent you."
5,"I like it hear. Had the perfect breakfast. Two eggs sunnyside up, a slice of french toast, and FOUR turkey breakfast sausage. It was the right amount and delish."
5,"Just about the rooms:\n\nWe stayed in the new tower, though I had never been to Caesars Palace it was by far the most beautiful room I've stayed in.  The layout was spacious, complete with a large bathroom, table and chairs, huge TV station - the room just felt sooo large.  The furnishings were amazing, chic, modern yet with that classical feel, clean, not too clustered and really tasteful.  It is by far the nicest room I've been in.  The bathroom was large, had tons of amenties, a great shower and tub and I really felt pampered just to be there.  The mini fridge was stocked with deluxe things as well, yet another perk.  Overall it was clean, amazing, comfy and made me feel really pampered!"
5,"Great Burgers.\nGreat Appetizers.\nGreat beers.\nFast Service.\n\nIt's the perfect combination for a bar.   They also open some exclusive beers on occasion.  Recently had Dog Fish Head 120 Min IPA.   It's a great combination, I've been here for lunch, and for dinner, and all of the above were true.   Most of the times I've noticed the same bar tender, and give props to the guy.  He runs a good ship, and kept our drinks at the ready, and food handy when we sat at the bar.\n\nOften at lunch they have the Burger with Guac and bacon on the menu.   Not something I'd normally order.  On an adventurous day I ordered it.... and am now in a rut because that's all I want to order."
5,"I met the owners of this repair store and they are so cute and really\nknow their business. They were able to complete my small repair\nwhile I waited, this was so nice. They have been doing\nthis for over 20 years.  Ask them any questions pertaining to the\nquality or service of a watch and they will have the answer.  All\nservice is done in house, so there is no need for shipping.   I\nreally enjoyed my conversation with them and would recommend to\neveryone.  Location is great - NE corner of Warner & McClintock."
5,"this place is amazing. if you are vegan, GET HERE. the donuts taste better than i remember. the glazed are obviously the best, but any of them will do. top two rows are vegan. if you are in las vegas DO NOT SKIP THIS PLACE!"
5,"Amazing Texas-style BBQ. Tried a little everything with my wife. Sausage, pulled pork, ribs, brisket, beans, jalape\u00f1o cheddar grits and potato salad with pecan pie to end it . Have to admit the pulled pork was a little lacking on flavor but was very moist and tender. The sausage was amazing and flavorful. The briskest's charred rub left me speechless. And the ribs seasoning was great. Would absolutely recommend it to anyone in search of good BBQ in Arizona."
5,"I had an amazing shopping experience here! After walking through Old Town Scottsdale this afternoon, all of the started to look the same... and then I stumbled upon Chantelle's Collection and was blown away! \n\nThe owner was incredibly friendly and dazzled me with story after story of growing up in Iran. He asked me about my hometown and kept me thoroughly entertained while I looked at all the  stunning pieces. That was another thing, the jewelry was all unique and beautiful! Oh! Most importantly - it was marked with the price!!!!! Marked I tell you! I'm pretty sure that's the only spot in all of old town that has actual prices marked. \n\nWith all that said, I ended up with a handcrafted new necklace, the business card of my new friend, and I will 100% be back if I find myself in these parts again! Chantelle's Collection, tip of my hat to you :)"
5,"This company was great.If your looking for a quality window supplier at a fair price and complete satisfaction, you need to check this business out. No pressure.\nCody (General Manager) was very friendly and especially knowledgeable on the quality and features in their product line. Chris the lead installer did a pre measurement for four window replacements at the site. The final installed cost from Cody was very reasonable when we also considered this company had it's own installers, and we would be dealing directly with Cody on both any installation issues and any future manufacturer warranty conditions.\nAt the time of installation, it was quite evident that Chris and Tim knew their craft, which resulted in a glitch free installation. They arrived and finished on-time, and cleaned up after themselves. We had a final walk-thru and everything was installed to our complete satisfaction.\nWe have more windows  that need future replacement, and will definitely use this company at that time."
5,"Great and IMMEDIATE service starting at the door. That's what we like; lots! \n\nIce tea was real good. You may think that doesn't matter but for this home boy it can make or break my culinary experience. I want an adventure, not a death-trap.\n\nOrdered lobster with one steamed and one grilled. Wife-partner ordered Jack Daniel Seseme Chicken. Our plan was to be happy and satisfied.\n\nJessica took care of us. She offered some suggestions and we were grateful. The food was good. I learned I like steamed lobster if kept attached to the shell, and if removed prior to final grilling then the grilled. Great portion of veggies. Nice salad as a side.\n\nAll-in-all, Jessica and TGIFridays exceeded our expectations."
5,We haven seen a number of shows in both Reynolds Hall and more intimate Cabaret Jazz.  The buildings and grounds are beautiful and represent a cultural gem for the city  and its residents.  We invariably see at least one show each trip and have never been disappointed.  On our most recent visit we saw the Wizard of Song which previously played off Broadway for 1.5 years and starred local George Bugati.
5,"Being from the East Coast, it is hard to find an authentic New York pizza in AZ. Brooklyn V's is FANTASTIC!!!! Takes me back home.... The crust is fantastic with just the right amount of cheese. We've been here several times but haven't ordered anything other than pizza yet. Based on the other reviews,  trying the Stromboli next. Check this place out, you won't be sorry!"
5,"Wow; what a great Italian place off the strip!  Fantastic food, great entertainment; very fun! The bread and cannoli's are to die for. You must check this place out!"
5,"UNDERSCORE \""HONEST\"" and \""EFFICIENT\""\nI called Paul after having first contacting WHIRLPOOL. Paul not only fixed the problem, that WHIRLPOOL did not, but was MUCH less expensive than the original price I was initially quoted by the big company. I'm glad I turned down the big company, and instead chose PAUL. PAUL IS GREAT and I would highly recommend him for your washer / dryer repair. In addition, he is a very personable fellow, and knows his job / profession VERY WELL. He even gave me some free tips for other issues that I might need in the future. THANKS S0-0-0-0-0-0 MUCH PAUL!!!!!  :-)"
5,"I love Sterling [PERIOD]. I do think, however, the bagels, at $0.95, are a bit pricey, but they are great...not NY, but as close as you can get"
5,"Service was excellent, food was excellent, atmosphere was comfortable.  I enjoyed eating at Serrano's.  The bean dip an salsa with their chips was excellent!  I had a 2 item combo with a tamale and enchilada.  Very tasty."
5,"Very friendly service, love that this place is locally owned! They will text you when your prescription is ready. Overall I've had great experiences here."
5,"Since the positives outweigh the negatives by a considerable amount, I'll get it out of the way and say that if Trader Joe's had a more extensive meat department it would be a one-stop-shop for me. \n\nThe store brand quality never disappoints, the staff is knowledgeable and friendly, and prices are very affordable. That you're greeted by their beautiful selection of flowers, herbs, and other types of foliage and later welcomed to try one of their delicious concoctions cooking in the back is just icing on this mindful preparation of grocery and household offerings. \n\nThe store is always clean and while it's usually crowded at the times I visit, I'm rarely bothered. A friendly place like Trader Joe's seems to attract friendly patrons. If my bright blue insulated tote happens to bump into your bright blue insulated tote while I'm deliberating over the vast cheese or nuts selections, we'll probably exchange smiles instead of middle fingers.\n\nThe folks who work here are approachable and extremely helpful. While I don't regularly drink wine, I find it a nice touch that a personable sommelier is available in the event I need a crash course on pairing and someone can recommend a high fiber cereal.\n\nSome of my favorite products:\n\n-Salsa Authentica\n-Cowboy Cavier\n-Vegan trail mix cookies\n-All-in-one facial cleanser\n-Cruciferous crunch\n-Coconut cashews\n-TJ's brand almond milk\n-Spinach and fontina chicken sausage\n-Spicy peanut vinaigrette\n-Roasted red pepper soup"
5,Such a fun place. Bouncers are really friendly and even get in the show sometimes. Laid back atmosphere that's great for meeting up/chatting when the doors open. Once the show starts it gets loud. You can sit back and chill or get up and dance--whatever you prefer. Drink specials are pretty good (and usually strong!).  I am so sorry to hear this place is closing!!
5,"We stayed here for 3 nights in the master suite with full kitchen, master bath, projection screen, couches, dining room, bar counter, another bedroom, and another bath. It was a suite that connects to two other rooms on the 33rd floor. Our friends ended up getting the two connected rooms and we had a blast! The view was great and it was attached to the Miracle Mile Shops. It was a few minutes walk to Planet Hollywood Casino, Bellagio, Cosmopolitan, and The Paris. Same goes for all the eateries. It was super inexpensive. \n\nThe decor was on the modern/contemporary style. The color scheme throughout the Elara was red, white, and black. It was definitely on the \""younger\"" side, in terms of clientele - between 25-40.\n\nEach of us paid around $150 for 3 nights with one of our friend's discounts. It was a great deal for a large group of people. We party in the suite and on the strip. This hotel gives you the full effect of Vegas without the expensive of being in one of the more expensive, renown hotels. \n\nIf you're looking for a not so inexpensive stay with a group of friends, definitely go for the Elara!"
5,"OK I'm getting straight to the point Ciao Ciao's is as good as it gets.  This pizza joint leaves you 100% completely satisfied in every aspect of your dinning experience.  The ambiance is fun and unpretentious, the service is friendly and helpful, and last but not least the food was absolutely amazing.  Ciao Ciao's has earned my loyalty. I will only eat pizza here from now on, and considering I live 13 miles away from Ciao Ciao's that's saying a lot. \n\nNow how do I even begin to describe the one delicious brick oven fired rich meaty concoction that will forever plague me with an eternal raging hunger erection. How can words even do justice in accurately portraying the rich creamy clouds of ricotta cheese, the carnivorous festival of pepperoni, sausage, and meatballs layered about providing you with a new and exciting flavor combination with every single bite. The fact of the matter is, that I can't. I can't begin to describe how truly good this pizza really is. The only thing you can do is experience it for yourself. Drop whatever it is that you are doing right now.  Go to Ciao Ciao, order a pie, and insert it into that large flapping hole in your face with the lips and teeth and go ....MMMMMMM.\n\nCiao Ciao is the best place to get pizza in Las Vegas period."
5,"Wow!  This place is good!  The atmosphere is modern, the staff are kind (sometimes slow), the food is always amazing. I don't think I've had one thing bad here. However, the prices are a bit high. But then again, it's the only place around where the food is made from scratch. Their homemade potato chips and potato salad are insanely good. I don't normally go for mayo on anything, but it's absolute perfection. Their posole is amazing (love that it's clear broth and not red), Reuben sandwich is amazing, breakfast foods are perfection and those potatoes. This is definitely a comfort food place to go, if you want to take a nap afterwards. No joke!!  It's unbelievable. Pricey, but worth it. I guess. If you don't have the money, you should probably stick with Taco Bell and don't complain about how much it costs. The owner(s) probably want to buy a bigger house, put their kids through college and they have something really amazing here, so why the heck not!!  The prices haven't hindered the majority of clients from going here. So be mindful of what you order. Also know, if you're on a budget, I believe they have an ala cart menu and you can purchase 2 to 3 things and keep it under $10. \nEnjoy!!"
5,"We had intended to go to another restaurant in the area that we discovered was closed. So, we thought we would try this new place and were pleasantly surprised. I had the corned-beef hash wrap from the breakfast menu and it was delish! It came with a generous side of fruit. My companions had the bleu cheese bacon burger and the roast beef baguette. My only complaint is that they don't have brewed iced tea. Otherwise, we had no problems and would definitely return."
5,"This is the best Mexican food I have ever tasted. I know that's not saying much at all since I hail from NYC, but bear with me.\n\nThe tacos run you 2 dollars and are stuffed with meat, guacamole, salsas, onions, cilantro, and so much ugh. I ate about 6 - tongue, beef head, spicy pork, tripe (THE BEST!), carne asada, beef shoulder. They were all good, except maybe the beef shoulder because it reminded me too much of my homestyle Russian food. The tripe was the star though, with the intestines fried to a crunchy yet still a bit chewy perfection. In addition to the tacos, I also tried a carne asada quesadilla. My only knowledge of quesadillas being those flattened, depressing (yet still delicious) things in Taco Bell, I was mindblown. Everything had such a great flavor and texture.\n\nThey serve grilled peppers and scallions on the side for free, which have a great flavor. Also on the side for you to grab at your leisure are radishes and lime pieces. Mexican fountain sodas are also available but I didn't like any of the flavors, and was upset that they didn't have Jarritos.\n\nNext time I come back to Vegas, I'm definitely eating here again, and saying hi to my Mexican bro with whom I conversed in my rudimentary Spanish."
5,"This is a must try if you are ever in phx! There are two locations which one is in downtown phoenix and the other in Scottsdale. After a night of partying and some great home cooked meals or just the craving for something sweet yet salty this place will hit the spot. I love that they make their own kool-aid and also have a variety of flavors. The Mac N Cheese is to die for along with their cornbread. I have had everything from the breakfast sandwhich, catfish, chicken wings, chicken strips, breast, and waffles with none of them falling short from excellent."
5,"I used to live in Thailand, and this is one of my top choices when I'm on this side of the ocean. Friendly people and the most authentic Thai food I've found in Phoenix."
5,"Love their cheeseburger, can tell it's real meat no 90% fillers! Hotcakes, real maple syrup and best bacon ever! Do expect about 1 to 1hr1/2 wait but totally worth it!"
5,"Beer is awesome (first timers must do the beer flight sampler) and I have never had a meal that wasn't excellent!   A quick note, there isn't a/c in the building so keep that in mind during the summer months - although that doesn't stop anyone from going, the place is always jumping!"
5,"Great hot dogs! I had the Chicago dog and my wife had the chili cheese dog, both were great! The fries were also good. The employees were friendly and the service was fast. The place was clean and in good order as well. Give it a try!"
5,"Everything about The Barrymore made for a fantastic dining experience. Grab cocktails (the Cherry Picker was amazing!) and head out to the patio before your dinner reservation. The hostess was timely in escorting us to our booth in the dining area that feels like you've been immersed in an episode of Mad Men (check out the ceiling that is made of old time movie projector reels). A fabulous wine list awaits you with a wide selection. The food...absolutely delicious! Great appetizer selection and the steaks and sides were superb. Chocolate raspberry tart was the perfect finisher paired with our cabernet sauvignon. And the best thing of all, the price...a high quality meal without the Vegas Strip prices"
5,"There are some unexpectedly positive experiences that really change the direction of your day. Herbs and Rye was one of those experiences. I went here with two friends on Dec 6 after trying to find a good place in Las Vegas off the beaten path. After a little thought we settled on Herbs and Rye for a night of good drinks. While we didn't have a reservation we were able to get an open booth and the service was among the best I have seen at a bar. The drinks were reasonably priced and were among the best we have had, some of my other friends ended up on the strip. I'm pretty happy I ended up at Herbs and Rye. The place is clean, there is easy parking, the place has a great crowd, the service is among the best, and the ambience is perfect. I will definitely be back and have told my friends who are traveling to Las Vegas to do the same."
5,"The Tech just left, I will post up a few other reviews because the service and the workmanship have always been great. I have purchased THREE units from them and had service done 2 times. Well, this call was because I was unsure if the unit was working right. They came right out, spent over a hour making sure all the readings were correct and I even programmed the thermostat (Which made a huge difference).\n\nTHANKS SCOTTSDALE AIR!"
5,"Have nothing but incredible things to say about the Canopy Club. I came up for my birthday weekend to see a few DJ's perform, expecting nothing more than to be the average customer. I got to be back stage during sound check, during the concert, went to the Green Room for free booze. All in all, they put me up in there like I was Donald Trump. This is mostly a thanks to Positive Vibr8ions who really took care of me, but every employee and anyone associated with the Canopy was so kind and cool to me. It was truly the best 72 hours of my life (went to Wed night and Fri night concert).\n\nTo all that were complaining, and rated anything lower than a 4. You were either not on enough E, not able to take home a girl/boy, or both. #ShutupAndDance"
5,"So you will stop when the GPS tells you to, and you will instantly double check the address. You will question yourself, because this just CANNOT be it. You expect a wine cellar and what you have is this dinky liquor store. You enter the dinky liquor store and it couldn't be more anonymous, but if you just stay true (Navy term I believe) there is a staircase that leads down. Normally this is a bad sign, never go downstairs in a dinky liquor store - this one is the exception. I find the experience to be a little Narnia-like. But it isn't Narnia; it's a really cool looking wine bar. \n\nAnd this would be cool if this was it - but wait, there's more.\n\nThere is also a lounge area where people can relax and hang out and the rumor says that they play live music down here. I have totally missed it every time, but I cannot blame the establishment for my failure to plan. \n\nThey have a nice wine selection, and a limited but eclectic beer selection.\n\nI have not been here for the live music, so I cannot say much about the clientele.. but the establishment is really nice. First I was put off by the way I came here (through the dinky liquor store) but now I feel that belongs in a speakeasy kind of way."
5,"If you are looking for the best and most authentic pizza in phoenix, look no further. I have been here three times and every time they seem to raise the bar. The Pizza is amazing, authentic ingredients, and authentic tastes. The atmosphere is also good as it is easy to be comfortable and relaxed here especially with guests. The decor is Italian, the waiters speak Italian, and the alcohol is Italian. Try the tiramisu it will blow your mind."
5,"This Starbucks is very close to work so very convenient. I absolutely adore this English lady with her even more adorable English accent!!! I love it when she takes my order. Every once in a great while I get a drink that's not mine but they offer a replacement and if I want a free one for next time. Friendly, clean and great service. \""Can't get that with satellite!\"""
5,"Until Del Frisco showed up, best steak and best wine list in town!!!  Now...it's a toss up.  Wait staff is extremely knowledgable and friendly.  Go light on the app's, everyone...the steaks are ridiculously large.  They've got one of those wine lists that is made for every single person that can walk through that door...great whites and great reds...excellence whether you're staying under 20 bucks, or if you're budget is big time.  Also, the bar out front is a great place to enjoy some happy hour and watch the cougars on the prowl...fun people watching."
5,"First time in Phoenix and read the reviews on Yelp. I'm glad to pick this place and the employees are very friendly (Deaf Friendly too). I had Veronica as my stylist, she did an amazing job with my hair. Veronica understood exactly what I wanted and double checked with me to make sure what I wanted. Veronica did an excellent job with undercut and quiff style. I do recommend her (even she is so nice lady and cute too:\nShe work from Tuesday through Saturday)\n\nAs for interior, it's cute and rock looking salon. Very cute and simple, easy to relaxing while get hair done.\n\nI spent about $35 for cut and shampoo/conditioner plus tip too. I believe is the price is just right for me and felt it's worth it."
5,Let me tell you something.  This place was marvelous!!\n\nAfter a long day at Red Rocks we were so ready to get some grub!  This place hit the spot.  Everything was so fresh and full of flavor!  The service was prompt and friendly too!  I wish this pizza was in Houston!!\n\nMy only regret was not having a bigger tummy!
5,"Been visiting this location for years. The staff is always friendly, the store is almost always in order and things are easy to find. Never had a single problem here. Love them."
5,"our favorites are the miso soup, mermaid and baked lobster roll! I take my kids here often, we love it!  The atmosphere is nice, the kids enjoy sitting and watching them make the rolls.  The lunch specials are very affordable the customer service is great.  very clean too!"
5,This was by far the best find for a long time. We went today Sunday at about 10:30 had a 5 minute wait. Really good for a Sunday. We ordered and got our food in a good timely manner. The food was excellent and the portions sizes also very good sized. I would recommend this location to anyone. We each ordered something different and all was good. Drinks a little expensive but still for a first time going there I was really impressed.
5,Great diversity of plants and they have Christmas trees this time of year. I'll definitely be back to check out the rest of the grounds. Very friendly staff that helped us with putting the tree on the roof of the car
5,"Way better than what I expected!  It's three floors of conspiracy, blood and bootlegging.  Parts of it are graphic so if you're squeamish, you may want to pass on the crime scene photos.  It could not be in a more apropos location than Vegas.  \n\nI got $2 off for checking in with Yelp.  It's a nice distraction from the casinos."
5,One of the best show/performance I've ever seen. I enjoyed it alot. I love love love.. couldn't comment more about how great the show is. although i am not exactly the beatle generation. I enjoyed every moment of it. \n\nDon't want to give too much away. you won't be disappointed =)
5,"Im a sucker for a good Hole in the Wall...and this totally fit the bill. \n\nSuper nice, and very sexy bartenders sling very strong and inexpensive drinks. Not on the path for the normal Vegas tourist, but totally a place id be happy to visit again."
5,Effeciency of ordering and care... Hiccough only with reservation when I arrived which was quickly amended... Great food and view
5,What a great Happy Hour at La Stalla!  My wife and I go quite a bit for an early dinner and can walk out for less than $20. \n\nHappy Hour is every evening from 4 - 6 an we usually get a beer or two a piece (at only $2) and great authentic Italian pizza (at only $5 a pie).  \n\nWhen we've ate a full dinner - it's always been great as well. The desserts are fantastic ... Check out La Stalla!
5,"The Cosmopolitan has quickly turned into one of my favorite Las Vegas hotels on the strip if you're looking for amazing views. We got a terrace studio with a fountain view for this past weekend, and I've got to say that it was amazing. The Cosmo is one of the few hotels that offer a balcony which allowed us to take into the Bellagio Fountains every night.\n  \nPositives: \n- Very chic\n- Center lof the Las Vegas Strip (Location!)\n- No daily resort fee of $25\n- Decent restaurants & Secret Pizza\n- Now offering a $150 resort comp for stays of 3 nights and longer\n- Clean and modern interior\n\n--\nCheck out my other reviews at http://nextstopdc.blogspot.com/"
5,"Free entrance,  free champagne all night for ladies,huka section, dance section, and 2 bars. The rooms are dark and sexy. What more could you ask for?  Enough said.\n\nHOWEVER, 2 well drinks=$26 bucks. ouch!"
5,A couple of tips - the delicatessen on the Grand Canal level has a self-serve soda fountain so refills are free.\n\nSelf Park is much closer to guest room elevators than valet.  Both are free but you'll have to walk through the casino to get to the elevators when you leave your car with the valet.  With self park you are on the Grand Canal level and only pass a couple of stores before you get the guest elevators.
5,"Outstanding memories of this place...Valentines Day 1999...Absolutely first class service, highly polished cooking, but very conscious of its Southwestern surroundings, this place still stacks up against the best. If you can deal with amusing and effete clientele (bombed-out Barry Goldwater Republicans) then Vincent's well worth the expense."
5,"it's apparent that this place use to be a bank, but after stepping inside you don't even notice you just stepped into a bank. it's like you just stepped inside a restaurant in italy. haha not really but the feeling takes over.\n\nthe service was great!! they were so nice and very knowledgeable. when i was there one of the servers dumped a whole tray of drink on to this customer's table. the customers were understandable about the whole situation. her co-workers helped her out and didn't leave her hangin', that's always nice....\n\nthe food was great!! it was VERY good!! i had the Veal with Lemon and Artichoke YUMMMMY!!! and my sister had the Cataloni that was heavenly good!\n\ni'll post pics later, but that place was really good. i would so go back there for dinner.\n\nWAY TO GO RIGATONY'S!!!!"
5,Celebrated our wedding anniversary here last night and had a delicious meal. Steaks were tender and juicy.  Service was outstanding.  Thank you for making our meal one to remember!
5,The pot roast is amazing!  Service was amazing on such a busy Friday night.  One of the best places to eat or drink in the Lawrenceville area.
5,"Fern was absolutely AMAZING!  I have been a veggie girl for almost 10 years, and this was by far the best vegetarian restaurant I've visited.  The service was wonderful.  The staff was extremely knowledgeable about preparations and available substitutions.  You even have the option of making certain dishes vegan.  The decor of the restaurant was delightful.  It was quaint, sophisticated without being stuffy and very appealing to the eye.  And the food.... ahhh!  We ordered multiple items so we could try a little of everything Chef Alyssa had to offer and each item was delicious.  The flavors were fantastic, the veggies were crisp and paired together beautifully.  Do yourself a favor and check it out.  Carnivore, vegetarian, vegan... you WILL NOT be disappointed."
5,"I went here yesterday and had a really great experience! \n\nI was on a mission to purchase a treadmill. I was over in the section for only a minute or two when Randy, a sales associate approached me and asked if I needed help. I asked him the few questions I had, satisfied with the answers I told him which one I wanted to purchase. \n\nHe rang me up and sent me on my way to the pick up area. \n\nThe pick up area is pretty dismal, but Sears goal is to not have you wait. you walk in and scan your receipt under a bar code reader, a monitor displays the progress of your order. In less then 50 seconds (And this is not an exaggeration, as the screen was counting down how long the process would take) Wes was walking through the double doors with my brand new treadmill! He loaded it up in my car and off I went! \n\nThe whole purchasing process from beginning to end was MAYBE 30 minutes total! Totally great experience!"
5,"Great People, Great Shop. They have some of the best people in the industry working hard to make it happen and they offer better than new service. They have great accessibility and good group rides. I highly recommend them. The selection is just awesome there too. Parking isn't all that bad either. Check 'em out!"
5,"We were in town for the weekend. We wanted to hit up a local \""Triple D\"" Dive, and we saw that The Dish had well written reviews. They weren't lying. The quality was excellent. It had a fresh and home made feel to every bite. Definitely coming back for dessert...one day."
5,"Just had the best casual dinner here and by the time I left, I was family. An authentic neighborhood restaurant with a good mix of oldies and country (hey it works!), great staff and really good food. The 3 $ in the yelp price guidelines is totally not true. It is what you would expect from a neighborhood place - great food, reasonable prices ( I would say super inexpensive for the quality of food), great staff and totally relaxing. And, although it says not good for dancing, you can if you want to.  I'll be back."
5,"Troy has done a number of projects for me ranging from painting a building to some light wall repairs.  Every time a new project comes up I think I am going to call him and stump him with something he, \""Can't Do\"". \n\nI am still waiting for that response.  Most other tradesmen I have ever met are driven strictly by how much money they can make and how fast they can complete the job to move on to the next project.  Troy is super obsessive about customer satisfaction.  After your project is complete expect him to follow up several times to make sure you are completely, 100% satisfied."
5,We came here for Valentine's Day and it was outstanding. Everything was delicious and the service was impeccable. Joon and his staff made this a very memorable evening for us. Highly recommended!
5,"I come here alot and their foods are extraordinary. The atmosphere is nice too. Be sure to order their lemonade, it was squeesh fresh when we went there. Really good serving size too. Iam sure you wont be able to finish one pastry alone.:)"
5,This place is great!  I have a flock of chickens and they need food.  Tempe Feed and Tack is close to my house (of course! I live in tempe...) and the people are super helpful and friendly.  They always load up the 50lb bags of feed and I never have to wait.
5,"Upscale. Expensive. But the food and service are beyond compare. The restaurant is merely a block from the Belk theater, so it's great for dinner beforehand or drinks afterwards. Look at their website to really get a look into this restaurant & how they serve their proteins, individually off of \""spits\"". Filet mignonette, ribeye, pork, scallops, shrimp, lamb, bacon wrapped chicken etc."
5,"BEST BUFFET IN VEGAS!\nWicked Spoon ain't got nothing on Bacchanal. What I like is that B doesn't play. One of the first stations you see is the seafood. BAM! Piles-a-plenty of crab, shrimp, oysters, salmon, seabass 'n more. Work your way down from there and find all types of cuisines well-represented. I liked that they had a station of fresh juice, including horchata. Refreshing! Desserts had their own central \""island\"" complete with varying fine patisserie-worthy delights and a gelato station. \n\nWe had a late start to the day and caught a late lunch. Ended up paying lunch price for dinner stuffs. Life just doesn't get better than that."
5,"Jeep wrangler Rubicon 7 Windows and strip on the front. Limo tint on the back 5, MN 35 on the driver and passenger. Total was $160 super nice accommodating folks and the tint looks amazing!"
5,One of our downtown Phoenix staples. I love the strawberry blueberry cashew salad and the margaritas. Annnd the spicy harissa fries. ...Aaaand the hummus. You really can't go wrong no matter what you order.
5,"I contacted this office after not hearing back from a different chiropractic office that I had visited prior when I called to check on insurance. I was able to get everything verified within 15 minutes over the phone and scheduled for next day care. Upon arriving I met Dr. Haggard and was impressed with how personable he was. We talked for a bit, took x-rays, and then got right to work on treatment.\nI received a follow up call the next day asking how I was feeling by Dr. Haggard himself and followed up today for my next treatment. We reviewed the final x-rays and then came up with a plan for correction. \nAll in all I've been more than pleased with the treatment, follow through, and personalities at Haggard Chiropractic. They've done an excellent job of making themselves stick out from their competition in the chiro industry."
5,Monica has been a saint to my hair. I trust her completely. Wether it's a cut or color I always leave completely happy with my hair. It is such a fun  environment to be in.  I'll never go anywhere else!
5,"I absolutely LOVE Southwest Airlines. Many of you already know about the 2 free bags, low prices, and great service. Something however that shocked me was when I needed to cancel my flight, they made it such hassle free. All I remember was before with AA that I went through such loop holes to try to cancel a flight and they charged me fees on top of overprices tickets. But with Southwest, I was able to call the night before to cancel my flight and they send me a confirmation right away. I just used those credits to rebook another flight and I got the low prices offered on the site and there was no charge to rebook. Excellent service and motto. I will always fly southwest if I can!"
5,"An indoor mall that has it all! This is an air conditioned outlet mall filled with hundreds of shops and plenty for the kids to do. It is a mall you can spend all day at because there is so much going on. Let me start off by telling the ladies you must wear comfortable shoes because this mall is made for us. There are some bargains in each and every store. I use this mall as part of my  workout regimen because I get so many steps in one day. For the men don't feel left out there is plenty for you to see and do as well. I have found some great men stores along with athletic stores like Sports Authority. Now for young ones there is an Arcade, IMAX Theatre, Aquarium, Rain Forest Cafe, dozens of dining places  and so much more. Wonderful place to tke the family."
5,I am sorry I hadn't been here before. From the outside you have no idea what hidden treasures are inside. Everything we had as appetizers and our meals were great.  I love the new variety to our palettes. I highly recommend you come here.
5,"I needed a few items I had purchased from a g/f moved within one week.  All the movers I phoned were booked, including Get Your Move On.  Then Roger told me he would do it TOMORROW for me.  I said \""Tomorrow? As in Sunday?\""  He said yup.  If that wasn't enough, he told me the exact time he would be at my g/f's house and then at my house (no waiting for them to show up during a 4 hour window).  Wow!  Everything showed up in great condition and they were in and out of my house in no item with everything placed exactly where I asked.  Amazing customer service.  I would definitely use them again."
5,"This place has a female mechanic. We definitely need more women in the automotive industry!\n\nI requested for them to check my clutch too, even though they are not a full service autoshop. Fortunately, my clutch is working fine. I was having problems during the summer and winter, when it's hot the clutch slips too much, and when its cold during the winter it gets VERY grippy. \n\nAnyways, they proved to me that my car is fine. Just some design flaw I guess, since my car has a hydraulic self-adjusting clutch pedal. \n\nDid you know it only took like five minutes of conversing with Adriana (the female mechanic) before they returned my car with the oil, filter, and airbox filter all completely changed?!? \n\nIt may be more expensive than the usual stay at the Toyota Dealership, but appointments at the dealership took me in excess of 2 hours, possibly THREE just to get a oil change. Even though Toyota provides me a 21-point inspection, it basically is the same exact thing with JiffyLube."
5,"Driving up to the place, you contemplate if you should have brought your bullet proof vest. You pull in, see that nothing has been touched since 1950, and fall into deep thought about the greatness that's going to enter your mouth. You look at the menu (with taped over prices) and order through the original Alexander Graham Bell phone. Can't understand what the lady is saying back to you? WHO CARES!! \n\nAll you need to do is order the BBQ Minced sandwich and a 1/4 BBQ chicken (white meat). Yeah, some people say the sandwich could have more BBQ sauce on it, but those people need to walk out onto Wilkinson with their eyes closed.\n\nYou won't find another place like this in the world, i promise...I've looked. The people that work there make this place especially unique. The guys are funny, quick, and they were shirts with holes in them.\n\nOverall, if you are in Charlotte, you better go there. Make sure you bring Cash with you because Credit Cards are not allowed."
5,Came here during vacation and thought of trying it out. The portions are really big and reasonable pricing. The food is made from scratch and was DELICIOUS!!! DEFINITELY recommend this place
5,"Sue and company have run an outstanding restaurant for 23 years in the east valley. Terrific Chinese cuisine, in a very pleasant sit down setting. You will not find better service at any restaurant, anywhere. Not sure what \""pretty standard\"" Chinese food means; but compared to several other east valley Asian fares, including the major chains, this place is superior. \nPlus, if you're going to gamble on taking out Moo Shu, the dish that is typically created and rolled at your table, well, you takes your chances.\n\nIf you like the occasional fried delicacy, try the Golden Gate shrimp; love it!\n\nSpend your precious eat-out dollars at locally owned businesses."
5,"I have now dined at Central bistro 2 times for the Brunch menu on the weekends and 4 times for dinner in the evening. Every time I have gone in I always try something different off the menu. First off, the restaurant has a beautifully open layout concept from the high ceilings to the marble tables throughout. The hostesses always greet you professionally. I have had up to 4 different servers here and they definitely know their info on the menu items and the cocktails. one of the most in depth cocktail was their lemoncello sour, a spin off on the whiskey sour and the server even went into detail about how the chef prepares the lemoncello he also brought out a few extra italian black cherries that are garnished with the drink and showed us this 80$ jar of cherries. I absolutely LOVE their Brunch menu most off all because i am a brunch fanatic. The eggs Benedict and the Chicken n Waffles are all to DIE FOR. I Highly recommend this restaurant if you want a beautiful place to hang out with excellent service and food."
5,"The rack of lamb was great!  Also, the view from where we were sitting was breathtaking! The Bellagio fountains, the Bellagio sign just everything...it was my anniversary and I'm so happy that we went to this place.  The staff were attentive to every need. ;-)"
5,"I loved this place. I wondered if the hot dogs would be overpriced, but they were really reasonable. A lot of different styles to choose from.\nWe didn't get any fries because they were $4 and a small portion. Drinks were pricey too. \nBut I'll definitely go back for the hotdogs."
5,"This was my first timeshare experience.  My good friend invited me to stay with her.  If you don't feel like being out on the strip around all the drunken people.  This is great for a peaceful Vegas alternative.  I noticed a lot of families on the property.  \n\nWhat you get: a room, Air Conditioning, Full functional kitchen, washer and dryer, fireplace, BBQ and 2 TVs.  Not bad.  Oh, now lets talk about the amenities.  Outside are 4 swimming pools and a couple of hot tubs.  There is a gym and recreation room.  You can borrow DVDs to watch.  A mini market in the middle of the property, that serves Starbucks.\n\nShuttle service.  Runs on the hour, takes you to the Monte Carlo.  From there if you need to get further down the strip, I suggest walking across the street to MGM and catching the rail.  Faster than taking a bus on the strip.  Once a day, there is another shuttle that takes you to Vons grocery store.  I hit up the Taco Bell in the same shopping complex and some groceries.  Lastly, they provide you with an airport shuttle number if you ask, which cost me $9, rather than a taxi ride.  Awesome!!!!"
5,"Their appetizers are very very good... I also like their daily menu, fresh stuff and high quality ingredients. The salad that comes with any entree is awesome! Overall, excellent. I go there regularly. It usually gets very crowded though, so plan ahead."
5,"Great bar! Feels exactly how a tiki lounge should feel.  Came here Valentines day night and it was crowded, I had a seat while my date stood until a seat became available, the 2 bartenders working were busy but still took time to talk about their drinks and recommendations.  I ordered a drink in a souvenir cup, I don't remember what it was but the bartender asked what flavors I liked, after she shined the flashlight on the sample cups on the shelf I chose the Wild Watusi cup, and she recommended something with passion fruit/guava flavors in it.  These drinks could get dangerous, even though it tasted like a tropical fruit punch it wasn't super sweet and/or syrupy tasting, it was a great combination of flavors and liquor!  After I finished my drink they rinsed out my tiki cup and swizzle stick and boxed it back up.  I want to go back and collect them all...Pokemon style!!"
5,"Just as at the Tempe location, they have EVERYTHING here, the staff is friendly, knowledgeable & helpful, & the prices LOW!  Today, for instance, I called about one of my favorite wines, & they carry it (of course), but also at 43% LESS than I had been paying for it at the other \""discount\"" store, so of course I whipped right up here & bought a CASE of it!\n\nWoohoo!    :-))"
5,The food here is amazing. I have tried more then half of it and it's all great. The staff is fun and the customers new and old mike you feel at home. This is a great place to relax and have a blast.
5,"We sold our hockey tickets for tonight in favor of going out to dinner at Park Bruges, just opened a few blocks from us.  The building is not well marked, but the tables in the windows let you know you have the right place!  \n\nFor a new restaurant, they have their workflow and service very well done; I believe all the reports saying they hired experienced people. The server knew the menu & the beers on tap well, and never disappeared for too long.  My husband and I split the \""classic\"" poutine -- the fries were crisp outside the gravy and perfectly soft within, and the cheese curds delightfully squeaky.  I had the chicken breast (with artichokes, mushrooms, and risotto); he had the fresh wild fish.  Both were perfectly prepared and delicious.  Desserts were also excellent, and the coffee was good, though not stellar (but you're not going there for the coffee).\n\nI saw a few people there with kids; it seems to be a bit more casual & kid-friendly than Point Brugge, so we may take ours sometime for lunch.\n\nVery impressive overall, especially since it's been open less than a week.  We'll be going back, and I hope they have sidewalk tables this summer (hint hint)."
5,"This was my first time eating at this establishment, and normally, when I write a review, I usually wait until my second visit.  But considering the company has been open since 1963, I figured they are doing something right, so I'll write my review now.  Quite honestly, this was the best Mexican food I've ever had in the Phoenix area.  I love the homemade salsa (not to mention, how MUCH you get - they don't use the tiny bowls for salsa like some restaurants do).  Tonight, I had the carne asada chimichanga, and I have to say that it's probably the best chimichanga I have EVER had.  The tortillas are homemade, and it almost looked like the chimi was pan-fried, because it was over-loaded with grease, which is a definite plus.  It comes with guacamole and sour cream, and I think they kind of over did it with it, but that's my personal preference.  I'm not going to ding them for that.  And the Spanish rice tastes just as it should be - almost like mine.  :)  When we arrived, they were in the middle of their happy hour, where your drinks were half-off.  Bonus!  But if you get regular drinks, such as pop, tea, etc., you get a huge glass for it!  Double bonus.  I know, the little things excite me.  I'll definitely becoming back to this restaurant soon.  I think it's better than Serrano's.  The decor is mediocre, at best, but they make up for it in the food."
5,"Tonight I went to Jade Palace.  We have several restaurants in the area that are mediocre and somehow continue to stay busy, so I wasn't sure about Jade Palace.  Besides the food tasting delicious, the service was really good.  My ice tea was constantly refilled, and dirty plates removed promptly. It's always a nice surprise when you get both good service and good food.  Definitely, try the egg rolls!"
5,"Ronald's Donuts has been on my list of to try for about 3 years, but somehow I have never made it there.  The stars were aligned recently, and we were in the neighborhood to drop by.  So many to choose from, I was like a kid in a candy store.  I managed to put my tongue back in my mouth and picked out a half dozen assortment of donuts.  \n\nThe assortment was delicious.  These were not skinny like your Krispy Kreme variety.  These were fluffy pieces of dreaminess.  [see picture]\n\nThe bonus is that it's locally owned, not a major giant, so you get kind, warm and inviting service.  Goodbye Krispy Kreme.  Helloooo Ronald's Donuts!"
5,"Great customer service by knowledgable, friendly staff. Not true cheapest place in town but you get what you pay for. Highly quality tint and great service. Worth every penny, money well spent. I highly recommend them."
5,"One of my friends dragged me here after she went on a trip to New York and ate at the original one under the Brooklyn Bridge. I had never gone because it looked so ritzy... not my style of pizza place from the outside. But once I walked in it my mind was changed! It was nice and cozy :)\n\nWe started out with drinks, I got a root beer cause it was 12pm and I'm not one to drink a glass of wine in the afternoon and guess what... they have keg Root Beer!! It is freakin amazing =))\n\nI ordered the mozzarella, basil, tomato salad and it was amazing... but I was confused that they had it under the salad selection and it isn't a salad at all; it is the traditional slab of yummy!\n\nWe also got the Pesto Pizza... with nothing on it of course & it was to die for, I could have eaten it all day!!\n\nThis is one of the best pizza places in town! The location is great too!! \n\nThe pesto pizza is amazing...  go there, eat a lot, its good :)"
5,"My favorite place in Phoenix. \n\nChris makes the most amazing cocktails in the city. Just tell him what you like and poof! He'll make  you something delicious. \n\nAs for the food, also amazing and unique. Ask for the special because it usually rocks. \n\nI never get tired of going here as it is the best restaurant in Phoenix!"
5,"Went back two nights later after my boyfriend and I ran a race in Boulder Dam and one of the bar managers was there. We had a fantastic night! They had a great selection of beers on the list and we stayed for hours. I again got the fried cheese curds. A-MAZING! \n\nI have no idea what this soapy glass business that people complained about. I didn't see a single one.\n\nThis is definitely a hike from the strip but it is by far the best beer selection we saw in Vegas. Also, the prices are very reasonable and you can get a good beer, with an actual taste, for the price of crappy beers on the Strip."
5,"Cannot recommend this place enough!!!\n\nThe cuts are amazing, the barbers are legends and the barbershop has the coolest shit everywhere. \n\nWe got there at midday and there was already about 8 boys waiting for cuts (this is how you know it's good). All the barbers greet you and tell you it might be a bit of a wait but feel free to stick around....and so glad we did. We had 6 of us the day of my wedding for some fresh cuts. The whole time you feel included in their banter and jokes, there's good music playing and it doesn't even feel like you're waiting. \n\nThe cuts turned out amazing, they take time as they are all perfectionists, I couldn't believe the skill and precision they all had. \n\nMy barber did mine on the house as a wedding gift....I was absolutely speechless....but their service didn't stop there. As we had so many of us we'd been there for longer than we'd planned and I had to be back at my hotel in an hour for wedding photos. I called a cab and it was going to be at least an hour.....I am stressing...I'm going to be late to my wedding...\n\nThen one of the barbers offers to drop us back to our hotel to make sure we're not late. I couldn't believe it....he literally saved my life....and my wedding day...and my wife loved the fresh cut.\n\nYou boys are amazing, thanks so much and I will always recommend you to anyone I know going to Las Vegas."
5,The girl Sarah at the Makeup Forever counter is fantastic!!! She knew what she was talking about and made my night!!! I looked fabulous! I am so coming back for every event. Love it
5,"I wish I could give DB 4.5 stars, but the bartenders were pretty cool so I'll bump it up. I ate here with a friend. Well, I actually ate alone at the bar, which was the first time I have ever dined in a restaurant by myself, since my friend was in a meeting. I must say, eating by yourself, in a dress, ready to go out at night is one surefire way for guys (good and bad) to come talk to you. It was pretty empowering though, and when my friend showed up after her meeting to grab dessert with me, I think the bartenders believed me that I really wasn't a prostitute!\n\nI had the most amazing foie gras I've had in a while, a decent crab salad, and some fabulous duck. The albarino suggested by the bartender was ok, but the desserts were fabulous. I think we actually ordered two although I can't remember which ones since I was probably in a food coma by that point! Top off the meal with a drink from the bar and we were ready for a night out.\n\nIf you can, grab a seat overlooking the Lake of Dreams so you can watch the dancing frog. And girls, don't be afraid to sit at the bar and eat by yourself. It's actually fun! (Just avoid the sleazy sales guys, also typically eating by themselves, and talk to the bartenders instead!)"
5,"I was new to vaping and actually asked my wife to go in to the store (since we live closeby) and pick up some juice. The staff was very helpful and educated her on the product so she would understand what it was she actually was buying for me - I've been back and would consider myself a regular now - I buy my juice there (FlavorZ by Joe - CoolPort) and have also been getting my hardware there - Although I'm a tech nut, I'm kinda done with the internet shops - I've had some bad experiences - So I prefer to spend a few bucks more and visit a local store where the advise is instant, free and delivered with a smile. I suggest stopping in and giving them a try - Nice shop, clean and in a neighborhood where you can feel safe parking your car ;-)"
5,Wonderful brunch today! I had the Sunrise sandwich and my husband had the Holy Puerco - they were both delicious. I loved the homemade biscuit - light and fluffy and not dry at all. Everyone in the staff is extremely friendly - very positive and relaxing environment. Highly recommend it!
5,Great food....A must: onion rings\n...Buffalo wings...tatchos...truffle mac & cheese. Not so much of a fan of their chicken tortilla soup.  Right price great food. Btw haven't dined in yet. This is all to go!!! Well worth every penny
5,"I tried the white pizza and picnic sandwich.  The pizza was the best white pizza I've had anywhere, and the sandwich was very fresh.  I look forward to trying breakfast here."
5,"five five.... FIVE.\n\ni love love this place, although admittedly it has some nostalgia to its credit, but thats not the reason you can find me eating there once a week. I've eaten at 4 different pizza factory's in my travels (2 in CA, 1 in WA) but this is by far my favorite! its a little on the smaller side but its worth it. My husband eats lots of other things there, sandwich's & pizza and likes it to. I bring everyone here, out of towner's & in towner's and they are always pleased. The owner and his family are on staff and they are always nice. Please stop by and let everyone know how tasty this place is and Be sure to try the garlic beadsticks... delicious. oh and did i mention i travel 15mins from goodyear for this place. i think its that worth it."
5,"Great food, great value and great service. Staff was very pleasant and accommodating, and, spoke great English! Large menu - maybe could even be a bit smaller. Clean and inviting place."
5,"I am happy to report that I love Costco. They have a terrific return policy, they have a great selection of foods (lots of specialty foods already made) and have great stuff for parties, good prices on most stuff, nice flowers, and terrific hors d'oeuvres on Saturday and Sunday. Membership is well worth it especially when you wanna buy electronics and return X Boxes for the newest version   :O"
5,"These guys are the best.  They know the products inside and out, and are kind, informative, and fair in everyway.  Take the guess work out of your repair, and let them do what they do best.  I have had many Mercedes, and do know them well, but these guys have so much experience, and knowledge, and I could not recommend a more trustworthy source then the great people at MB Motors.\nYou guys Rock!!!"
5,"So all the hype is for real! :-)  Tony DOES greet everyone, shakes their hand and asks their name. I was a female in by myself and didn't feel the least bit uncomfortable. I had a slice of the thick and a slice of the thin white. Both were delisio, but the NY deep dish was my fav! Tony was always walking around chatting with everyone. Definitely made you feel at home! Only suggestion (and it's just a picky one probably because I was there alone) would be to have someone take your order at the tables instead of needing to go up front to the cash register.\n\nI'll be back!"
5,"Mmmm. This is one of my favorite places to go if I'm in the mood for a sandwich, salad, or soup kind of lunch. They've got all three, plus large spuds with toppings that taste great too. It's simple, clean, and with great service. Lots of options for all 3: sandwich, salad, or soup. The options are also creative. For example, ORANGE CRANBERRY CLUB\nSmoked turkey, hickory ham, applewood smoked bacon, cheddar,\nSwiss, lite mayo, lettuce, tomatoes and orange cranberry sauce on\nharvest wheat bread. I tried it, and it was a new sensation in my mouth. Had not tried a sandwich with this kind of combination before. (Mostly the orange cranberry sauce add-in) \nAlso, the place is Wi-Fi enabled,"
5,"I have been studying with Sifu Baugh since 2003.  My only complaint is that I didn't find him before 2003.  I have been studying since the 80's, and I have studied with some disreputable teachers.  Sifu teaches: Chen Tai Chi, Yang Tai Chi, Northern and Southern forms of Kung Fu, Praying Mantis, Xing Yi, Ba Qua, and other forms of traditional Kung Fu.  Unlike other teachers and schools I have attended, Sifu Baugh is approachable and humble.  He teaches the majority of the classes, and his only concern is helping you to get better.  He is respected by other martial arts teachers in town, and he even teaches some of them. \n\nIf you are looking for a traditional Kung Fu school with: experienced and qualified instructors, reasonable monthly fees, no annual contracts, many different styles and classes, no ego, and a place that you can train for the rest of your life, then this is the place to train."
5,"Great Authentic Food, Nice Decor for the price I don't think you can find better, I eat out quite a bit and I would say try the Pho and also the Mong, I would say that it is probably one of the best if not the best in town. \n\nOverall: excellent food great service \n\nWill be back"
5,"Love that this place opened up near me, if your looking for middle eastern groceries this is a good spot...the fresh flat bread is a must at my house now!"
5,"Peridot Sweets made our wedding cake, and coming up on our second anniversary, people are still talking about how beautiful it looked and how delicious it was. Tiffany created a custom cake using out colors and style preference. They also provided a dessert buffet as well.. Our guests loved the shortbread cookies and brownie pops! Thanks Peridot Sweets!"
5,"With over 150 items (thanks Rand) there is something for everyone here.  Mongolian BBQ, sushi and all the usual dishes you would find on a Chinese buffet.  The food was fresh, hot and some of the best I've had in a long while.  I tried a little bit of a lot of things and there wasn't anything I didn't like.  In the beef dishes the meat was tender and not fatty - the chicken dishes had chicken breast and it wasn't dry - the shrimp entrees were cooked well, no rubbery shrimp that were too small to find or taste.  The vegetables were fresh and nothing was too greasy.\n\nThe service was excellent as well.  They kept our water glasses and my soda filled, they cleared the used plates quickly and we had all the napkins we would need.  They even brought a knife to the table when I forgot to pick one up at the buffet station. \n\nIt may not be all \""authentic\"" Asian food, but it sure tasted good to me.  Something for everyone and at $7.95 for the lunch buffet, you just can't beat the price."
5,"Just stopped by today at this place they greeted us nicely to our table, The environment was nice with live persian music it took about 15 minutes to get our order it was delicious. \nHighly recommended and worth stoping by."
5,"This place was really really good! The pancakes were great and so were the hash browns. Plus for the price you just can't beat this place. The greatest part of all though was the owner. He was so attentive to each customer he had. Asking you questions, getting to know you. He made you feel special. It was like you were a guest at his home not his restaurant. Definitely will be going back next time I'm in Vegas! Thanks mr mamas for the great experience!"
5,"I am a big fan of Ticoz. I've been going there for a few years and have tried quite a few items - and have never been disappointed. I recommend the Street Tacos - my favorite is the shrimp. The Street Tacos entr\u00e9e comes with pinto beans and rice (well worth it) or you can get just the tacos in the bar during happy hour for about half the price.   Their calamari is awesome - especially with the spicy jalape\u00f1o lime sauce on the side. Sunday brunch has been excellent, and the mimosas are great. \nInside, it has a modern decor and they have a really nice patio out back. \nI've introduced a bunch of people to this place and they all loved it too. I've never had a bad experience."
5,"Sushi Kame is placed in downtown Champaign surrounded by the more pricey restaurant such as Jim Gould, Escobar, and Kofusion. You would expect some overpriced meals at Sushi Kame but the items on the menu is reasonably priced. The food is simple and not gimmicky like the trendier places in town. Also the people are very polite. \n\nYou can't go wrong with any of the items on the menu. If you would like a warm soup for you meal, go for the Udon soup (I believe it's $2.00 for one tempura shrimp to be added with the soup). If you want something with a little bit of everything, the bento box consist of the meat and served with 1 roll of California tempura, salad, and rice. More importantly, the sushi is great and they never run out of fish!"
5,"My wife and I went there last night for our anniversary.  The service was first-rate, from start to finish.  The wait staff was friendly and helpful without ever being obtrusive or (as is sometimes the case in high end restaurants) condescending.  \n\nThe food was delicious, from starters to main courses to dessert.  There was a touch too much salt in a couple of the dishes for my taste, but otherwise everything was interesting, fresh, attractively presented, and tasty.  \n\nThe decor was spare, but tasteful.  The view is, of course, magnificent.  And there isn't really a bad table in the restaurant, upstairs or down.\n\nFinally, considering what you get, I think that the pricing is very reasonable.  I will definitely go back!"
5,This is the best authentic Hawaiian BBQ in AZ.  Being from Hawaii it's as close to the local Korean BBQ spots in Hawaii.  They need to have cucumber Kimchi on a much more regular basis though!  I tell the owners that all the time :).  Paradise never disappoints and just wish they had a spot in Chandler.  I believe it's the only place in AZ that serves Meat Jun which is a staple of Hawaiian Korean BBQ.
5,"I visited with some friends and one of the servers had an attitude whilst serving us. He got food and drinks wrong, but didn't really seem to care that it impacted our experience. An email to the owners proved this business cares about its customers and their experiences. I would not hesitate to return again.\n\nFood is really good and you should try this place."
5,"Stayed here for one night, and absolutely LOVED it. \n\nOur room was really clean and had a nice view of the pool and the hot buns laying out below. The bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in.\nThe front desk staff was always really helpful and friendly.\n\nWe had a great time hanging out at C4. The waitresses were super nice, even after having to deal with some of my pretty drunk  friends. The drinks were stiff enough for me to get a nice buzz going, and well priced.\n\nOrdered room service and it was taking a little longer then I was told it would, so I called and it was sent up a few minutes later, and was told it would be NO CHARGE..Nice! \nThe sandwich was delicious too!\n\nThis will definitely be the hotel we stay at next time we are in Phoenix.\nSame price as the other hotels around town, but so much cooler."
5,"Came here with friends for a birthday dessert. Quaint atmosphere with very attentive staff. Tried the Strawberry Kiss, Chocolate Brownie, and profiteroles. Hella good."
5,"Airport food...stale, over priced under served, right? Well, this place is a real treat. From the cold beer to the ceasar salad to the fresh hot pizza this never ending succession of impression is capped off by fantastic service (seat yourself seating brings tips under question, but these folks hustle the food out hot with a smile).  I'm a bit of a ceasar snob, yet the chilled lettuce, light dressing with just the right bite, plenty of Parmesan, and fresh made croutons won me over and then some.  And an entre size salad for $6 was very impressive! As was the $8 pizza thin crust with fresh basil (I've had smaller pies for twice that price!).  I think I may fly the family out next time just to eat here!"
5,"Concluded our most recent Vegas adventure with brunch at Bouchon. Non existent wait time during a Monday afternoon. \n\nI believe Riley was our server, wish I was a hundred percent on his name as we definitely wanted to note his level service. He was funny, utmost honest and very accommodating. We requested a table change and serval order alterations as well in which he addressed on a positive note with good humor. \n\nMenu offerings were all mouth watering, our  ordered dishes were even more delicious! I had the corned beef hash, side of potato croquettes accompanied by a bloody mary. Portions were particularly large and made the travel trek to be served as breakfast for the following morning back home. \n\nDining in gained us a 15% treat receipt at the strip bakeries."
5,Great service. Intimate atmosphere. Comfy seats. Unique food & drink options. Recently Updated. Oh and there's a classy bar with couches for when you're waiting to head into your movie.  \n\nThis week I went to the Manor for the first time. I'm thankful it's the holiday season and there are so many good movies releasing...more reasons to go back to the Manor.
5,"Great diner to stop in and enjoy hefty portions of breakfast food while you're chilling in Henderson, NV.\n\nWe stopped in on a busy Sunday morning and only had to wait for about 15 min before we were seated. They're pretty fast and efficient here, and I'm talking about the local customers not just the servers. :P\n\n-Eggs are cooked well.\n-House potatoes were BOMB diggity! I totally thought I was going to pass on these but they're like thinly sliced potatoes sauted lightly with some salt and pepper. I ate them like chips! \n-Pumpkin bread was moist and delicious as well.\n\nDefinitely a diner we will return to if we're ever in this area again. \n\nSide note: If you're sort of a \""health freak\"" but you do enjoy diner food, bring your own packets of Stevia to sweeten your coffee. They only carry the \""bad sh*t\"" here (Sweet'N Low or)."
5,New Living Pools is ran in a very honest and highly efficient way!  Chris is one of the best in the business and knows what he is doing when it comes to pools.  I highly recommend New Living Pools and guarantee you will not be disappointed!
5,I tried this restaurant with a friend and I had the spaghetti.  It was delicious.  The waitress was great too.  The prices weren't high either.  All I have to say about this restaurant is positive.  I will be going back for sure and you would be wise to check it out for yourself.  We went around 5:30 p.m. and it was very quiet.\n\nS. Cooper
5,"Lots of IMAX theaters here, Great popcorn, all the most current movies are always playing and it's removed from the strip (but only slightly) so there's not an issue with crowds."
5,"I am so excited that Sephora is now located in Downtown Summerlin!  I attended my first VIB Rouge event in November and I felt like a princess!  Employees greeted me, did a free makeover, helped me shop as if I were the only one in the store!  They were slammed for the event!  Wendy, Destiny, Moriah, Carol, Toni are just to name a few!  They are always giving me free samples and advice on skincare!  Thank you so much for all of my makeovers and customer service that is beyond the call of duty!  \n\nThe PodBrother Show:  http://youtu.be/S0Lusii7Tl0"
5,"I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF THIS SHOW. \n\nPlain and Simple.\n\nIt was AWESOME. \n\nLoved the interpretations, the symbols, the movements, the music, the costumes, the comedic relief. Zumanity showed all the different sides & angles in \""sex\""\n\nCant wait to go a 2nd time. This time Front Row Booth baby!"
5,"Ventanto is one of my favorite dining out spots. The view is breath-taking and the staff is all so nice and accommodating. The food is always fresh and the portions are huge. I never leave Ventano without a doggie bag.\n\nI recommend the Shrimp on a Stone and the greens salad to start. As for entree, I can never decide on whether the Lasagna, chicken Piccata or Ventano Spendini are my favorites. \n\nSave room for dessert~!!! They have wonderful desserts. I love the cannoli. YUM\n\nI have been there many times since they opened and I have never had a bad meal. We were there the other night and it was great as usual...and we will be back again~!!!!"
5,"Joe did a fantastic and very professional job hanging our new 65\"" TV on the wall above our new media cabinet.  He was very knowledgeable but yet listened to my concerns regarding the height of the TV.  He actually saved us money by recommending a different wall mount from the one we purchased when we bought the TV - so we were able to return the super expensive but not worth it one to Costco.  We love the look of having the TV on the wall with no wires showing and have had so many compliments.  Joe even removed our old 32\"" ton of bricks TV for us!  We highly recommend him!"
5,I have been to the one in Washington D.C. and was already a big fan.  I have also been to some of his other restaurants.  Go...you will not be disappointed...
5,"Best place to work, great atmosphere and co-workers! The Rockstars of Old Town! Ask for Albert and mention Yelp for a 20% discount. Existing client or not!"
5,I am always pleased at Galileo's. The food is phenomenal and you can't find better service anywhere else. The owners are amazing because they really make you feel welcomed and right at home.
5,"Got a week?  That's about how long it would take to visit all the stores in this Mall.  I went on a Friday night and the place was packed with happy shoppers.  They have every store that you could ever dream of, plus some that you never thought of.  I was weighted down with packages in no time and my feet were so tired by the time made it from Nordstroms to Dillards, I gave up and went back to my hotel!"
5,"I highly recommend Halo and there very professional environment. After a horrible scalpel experience by a piercer in California years ago, I had to have 2 surgeries to reconstruct my ears. I thought there was no hope of ever having them look normal again. I went in to Halo about a year ago to talk to Jeremiah about possibly piercing them one day when the scar tissue healed. You could imagine my hesitation to do anything to my ears again, but as the surgeries left my ears a little uneven I wanted to pierce them with simple studs to take the focus off. So, I finally went in a week ago to see about  piercing them. Jeremiah was very comforting through the whole process and the piercing was quick, precise and just what I had hoped for and more! They are healing better than any piercing I have ever had. I don't have to hide my ears anymore! I have also had a dermal removed there in the past and can honestly say you can trust everyone here. Great place to find some awesome jewelry too. Thanks guys, I will definitely be back!"
5,"Finally! Shake shack opened their doors! It has a very nice interior and patio sitting. Its located between  outside of nyny and monte carlo, so its way better to park at nyny and go through the food court. \n\nBest burger ive had in east side and finally now here in vegas!!! I highly recommend the SHAKE STACK and second the SHROOM BURGER. i love how the cheese will oooooozzzeee out once you bite onto your burger, one word, BOMBDIGGITTY! \n\nAlso, their staff was very attentive and friendly! Please keep it up guys! Good service good food! ;)"
5,"I've tried hummus and falafel at just about every place i can find that has it and Sababa's is EASILY the best.  Well, the falafel has a competitor in a place in CA i had once, but the hummus is seriously the best of the best of the best.\n\nOther than those, I think the only other thing I have tried is the beef kabobs... Pretty expensive, but also one of the best ever and well worth it.  \n\nMy only complaint with the place is the ordering/eating/paying system  - especially when it's busy.  That's the order - order first  at the counter (which can be a little chaotic), then go sit and eat at a table, then pay at the register.  \n\nSo the flow is a little awkward, but not enough to give it less than 5 stars for the best hummus, falafel, and kabobs, i've ever had on a consistent basis for the 4+ years we've been going there."
5,"Queen Nails 7/25/2013\n1819 Matthews Township Pkwy Ste 300\nMatthews, NC 28105\nI have been going to Queen Nails for over a 10 years and will not go anywhere else. They are very clean and sanitary. The attention to detail is wonderful. They are very personable and caring. I am there about every 3 weeks getting a pedicure, gel nails and artwork hand drawn on my nails. Taylor, Rachel, Kathy, Annie and Lana are wonderful. Annie does state of the art brow shaping for $8."
5,"I love their Burrata cheese, it is to die for, and of course their pizza's are amazing! Nice patio seating is a plus, and it's not too hard to find good parking in the area."
5,"Wow!!  This was amazing!!! It was such a unique fun experience that really made my vacation. \n\n  They come and pick you up if you need a way to get there, and both the instructors are very friendly, experienced, and fun which made the experience that much greater. You learn tricks, change up speeds, and ride over a multitude of terrains it was AMAZING!\n\n  I really didn't know what to expect but I can say it was better than anything I could of imagine. Thanks for the great time, I am definitely going to come by again!"
5,This place is amazing.  One of my two favorite spots in AZ so far.  \n\nThe lobster quesadilla is awesome.  not your typical quessadilla but way way better.  the flank steak torta was very good too.  i can't wait to go back and try everything else.
5,"Absolutely wonderful!!! I planned my boyfriend's surprise 30th in Vegas with about 10 of our closest friends! The staff at Las vegas Custom Cakes were incredible. They talked me through all of the steps and completely eased the anxiety of ordering/booking a trip from Boston to Vegas. The cake was a huge hit and exactly how I pictured! And it wasn't just beautiful to look at, the taste was delicious. I'd recommend Las Vegas Custom Cakes to anyone!"
5,"Probably the only karaoke that has updates of songs and the rooms are clean and affordable. If your looking for a good time with friends, this is the best place to go!!! \nFood like drinks and snacks could be a little cheaper, but then again there are complimentary chex mix and the platters are quite huge."
5,"I brought my 2004 For Ranger to this shop after reading some reviews on Yelp. The 5 star rating holds true. I took my truck in for an oil change and a tire rotation, which cost $27. They also looked at my spark plugs, which I didn't have the funds to replace. But they took pictures of the spark plugs (because I dropped the truck off) and showed me why they need replaced. \n\nThe shop is also family owned, with the mom running the front and the dad and son in back working on the vehicles.\n\nI will be going back."
5,"Fixed my locks, was on time and reasonably priced. I was pleased with the service and the tech did not try to sell me on unnecessary extras."
5,"Outstanding service, food and overall experience.  From the moment we got to the restaurant til the time we left our experience was definitely 5 stars.   Our appetizer of calamari and house bread  with olive oil was delicious.  We then had seafood risotto and chilean sea bass for our main course.  They were very well prepared and presented.  Can't wait to try the rest of the menu on my next visit."
5,"The perfect blend of high quality ingredients, incredible service, good company as a Tuesday evening left me mesmerized. Why don't I come here more often? I have been here multiple times and each time is consistently amazing. \n\nTonight we were offered \""Omakase\"" meaning \""Chef's choice\"" in Japanese for a VERY reasonable price, which was less than half of what I paid at my last Omakase experience a couple months ago at another Japanese joint. Ordering this way is almost like getting the freshest prix fix menu where the food comes out in courses. There were cold appetizers, hot ones, grilled treats, rolls, frozen dessert...the list goes on. One of our friends had a good allergy to garlic and the Chef did a great job of accomodating her.\n\nTry SOHO out during Happy Hour (4-6PM everyday) and you will be hooked, then come back for the Omakase for dinner or special occasion."
5,"Never had anything like it. Very impressed with the different spin on shaved ice,  lots of variety,  swanky and new decoration.  Date night worthy. We'll definitely be back!"
5,"This is the best place to get maxi dresses. It might be pricier than other places, but the quality and fit are way superior. I have invested in 1 dress each summer and they are by far my favorite dresses and I get a ton of compliments when I wear them. I don't see other girls wearing the same ones either."
5,"Phoenix's best bar!  Everyone is welcome. Bored with the usual, join the interesting set at C7. Friday night's drag show starts about 10:30 and Daveena Ross is an elegant hostess. Bring $1s to help them fund college or make-up. If you like clones, stay away. If you like humanity, come on down!"
5,"I remember when I came here to try the Coca-Cola Sampler from around the world and oh my, some tasted very disgusting and others were very good. I wished they sold them in bottles so people are able to purchase them and keep it as a souvenir or drink it at a time of their choice. I wish to try their Float Variety Platter the next time I go to Las Vegas, I always buy bottled coke to drink in the hotel when I visit."
5,Outstanding .....\nFrom San Diego and needed a burger fix and boy did I get it...\nHad the beach house recommended by the guy at the counter and he was right on.\nI will be back next time I'm in Phoenix
5,"Can't wait for my weekly (ok - sometimes daily) coffee or Chai fix :-)  Great coffee, atmosphere and relaxing.  Amber is a great barista :-)  Try it; you'll definitely be back."
5,What an awesome show!!!  From beginning to end they incorporate the audience into their act and make you feel part as if you are part of the show.  They go through the crowd and engage the audience with non verbal gestures that are just hysterical.  There are even some parts of the show where the whole cast is running around in the audience going crazy.  \n\nThe music and lighting for the show is top notch and has been really well thought out for the performance.  Just imagine watching a 2 hour episode of Americas best dance crew with only Jabbawockeez nonstop craziness.  I really have to give it up to these super talented Jabbawockeez crew members that are just awe inspiring with all the dance skills that they possess.  I guarantee you will leave the show with a smile.
5,"This restaurant is a class act from top to bottom! My gf and I have ate here around 10 plus xxx, we have requested Carl as our server each time, he is great, never disappoints. Food and service are top notch, definitely my favorite steak house in Vegas! ---8 yr resident"
5,"LOVE the Thanksgiving sandwich - I'm obsessed with it, actually! I really wished we had one in SCV! Even if I'm not hungry and there's one nearby, I will pick up one of those bad boys and take it home for later!"
5,"I found these guys here on Yelp, I was looking for someone who had good reviews. I am SO very happy that I looked here first! Everything about this company was great. The price, the service, and most especially the job they did. My carpet looked FANTASTIC when it was finished! I can't say enough about Charles (the carpet cleaner guy) he was very personable and do a wonderful job. I will highly recommend J2 cleaning!"
5,Best green tea! Garlic tuna nigiri. Yellowtail w ponzu n jalape\u00f1o nigiri. Wild salmon. Best spicy tuna rolls. Asakusa roll is redic! Dessert great too!!!
5,"I came to Vegas on the weekend where the Finals Rodeo was starting...it was so interesting.  Every single casino you walked into, you'll get cowboys and cowgirls galore!! \n\nShhhh....don't tell anyone, but cowboys do exsist. These were real live in the flesh cowboys, with the tight jeans, plaid button ups (tucked in), big belt buckle, cowboy boots...and to finish off the outfit a big ass cowboy hat! \n\nI've never been anywhere with tons of cowboys just walkin' around. There were block parties sponsered by crown royal where some of the little streets were closed down on Las Vegas Blvd. and they had drinks, country music and a mechanical bull. \n\nI was very impressed with the transformation of the Vegas strip into a rodeo finals for all the cowboys! It was fascinating, growing up in Southern California, I'm not too exposed to real cowboys, perhaps just at the country line dancing bars I've been to, which I call the cowboy bar. But this was a real treat for me. \n\nNow I can cross off meeting real life cowboys off my list. Thanks Rodeo Finals for holding it in Vegas! Yippee ki yay Mo..."
5,"I love Molly Malone's! My husband and I have come here for dinner a few times now. We ordered beer on our last visit. I wasn't sure about a particular beer, and the amazing waitress brought me a sample. Thankfully she did because I didn't like it. The food is stellar. When you come, get the pretzel bread. I would sell my left arm for a lifetime supply of it! My only gripe would be it is a little on the pricy side, but the service and food make it worth while. It's very casual and comfortable, unlike other Irish pubs I've been to."
5,"My husband and I stayed here back when it first open in 2008, so everything was new! I've had this in my bookmarks for years and I never got around to writing a review until now. I will tell you that the experience here is wonderful! The customer service is terrific and the rooms are out of this world! Aside it being far from the other happening places on the strip, you can take the tram to the main parts of Vegas. \n\nI've been going to Vegas every year since 2006 and I can tell you that this place is one of the best hotels to stay at. If you're looking for more of an Old Vegas experience, try the older hotels, but I think old and young people alike can attest that this hotel is immaculate!"
5,"Totally love this place!! Enormous menu, which is usually a turn off, but everything looked so delicious that I actually wanted to order it all! \n\nStaff was friendly and attentive, our server Jocelyn was great! :) Our food came out very fast and it was so yummy! \n\nI had the Almond Crusted French Toasts!! OMG!!! So good!!! \n\nI will be back many, many more times! :)"
5,THANK YOU TOY BOX!!\nI took my car to the Toy Box to have them take a second look at $800 worth of work - strut replacement - that another valley mechanic had quoted me.  Turns out there was nothing wrong with my struts and they saved me $800!!  Their honesty and integrity will be remembered and they have gained a customer for life!  Thanks again Phill and crew...you guys are the best!!
5,"Bertha's Cafe Just opened up at it's new location, 32nd street and Indian School Rd.!!!!!  I have been going through withdrawl!!! So happy they are open."
5,"Marcel has been maintaining my pool for several years now. Every time the pool turns green, thanks to the oleander and jacaranda trees that are constantly shedding leaves into the pool and the monsoon season, Marcel is on the spot to take care of it quickly. He also has installed a new pump and filter as well as gotten me a good deal on vacuums. Plus, he's a friendly guy to talk to. Recommended."
5,"before we went to vegas i checked out all the reviews before we went to the resturants and i told my boyfriend that dennys looked like a no because of all the bad reviews but i gave in and we went and had a good breakfast and cheap. cheapest meals ive ever had in vegas haha. if you are looking for fast service you arent going to get it, u gotta have patiences when u come here because they are extremely busy. but if your just there to chill and take your time its perfect. we actaually ate breakfast here 3 out of the 4 days we were in vegas. we never paid over 17 bucks for our meals and one morning we only paid 7 because they took forever to get my boyfriend his meal so they gave us it for free and then gave us a coupon for the next time. wewill be back,"
5,"In a city full of Fry's supermarkets, Sunflower Market is an excellent alternative for ASU denizens looking for cheapish foods, Hippie-style, especially since the only Trader Joe's is quite a drive away.  On weekends, they occasionally have BBQs...I grabbed 2 hamburgers for 2 bucks yesterday."
5,"Sonora is wonderfully average.\n\nYou will never be surprised by anything here, as when they tell you the beer won't be cold because it's casket, it won't be cold. The hot wings are hot, the fresh salads are fresh, and they always cook things to order and are always accurate (mid rare is always mid rare... a rarity!). I love brewhouses so the local brews are delish.\n\nThere's nothing surprisingly good at Sonora, but I'll choose it over a culinary adventure almost anyday!"
5,"Sometimes i swear that i have damaged my short term memory irrevocably, i have meant to write a review on Otto's for the longest time now and i always forget- not that they are forgettable by any means.\nOtto's Pizza is, hands down, my favorite pizza joint in all of Tempe. There is a lot of debate about what makes the perfect pie, and I'm not about to establish the ground rules, let's just say that my version of the perfect pizza was found here. \nOtto's is such a good quality pizza, and their other items are equally delicious, whether it be calzones, pastas, or their desserts. Their prices are fair considering the pedigree of their cooking. \nThe atmosphere is quiet and space inside is small, but rarely crowded, with great patio seats for enjoying the cooler months.\nThe gals who work here are gorgeous so xtra * for that!\nIf it were possible i would sign a contract to only eat their pizza, bummer its closed on sundays!"
5,"My favorite thing about the Red Rock is the spa--get your hair cut there by Jean Marc! \n\nWhen I moved to Vegas, I started looking for a great hairdresser.  I struck gold on my first try with Jean Marc at the Red Rock Spa. He took one look at my face and gave me a cut that I swear made me look 5 years younger. Then, when I went in for color, he gave me a balayage--a color treatment similar to highlights. The results were very natural and rich-looking. I'm hooked, and have told all my friends about him. If you live in Vegas, if you visit Vegas, make an appointment with Jean Marc. He doesn't just cut hair. He transforms it into runway perfection!"
5,"Wash-dry-fold. Pick-up and delivery. Dress shirts. Dry cleaning. These people do so much, and charge such a reasonable amount. \n\nThey take credit cards, too, and they are easy to communicate with, if you have a change of plans or whatever.\n\nCan't say enough good things. I've been in the laundromat, too, though I haven't used it. It's nice and clean and pleasant, in that Pittsburgh's-take-on-hip kind of way."
5,Service was great! Staff was very polite and we were seen right away. My daughter seen Dr. Hill who was very kind and made her laugh. Would recommend.
5,"What a cool place this is and what a great event Lindsey and YELP hosted.  Thank you.\n\nThe night started by going to see a \""secret\"" movie who's name we didn't find out until it began (Raising Arizona), eating a great tasting Brat from The Short Leash Dog Food Truck and having my first drink from the bar compliments of YELP.  Oh, I can't forget the goodie back filled with cool stuff too!\n\nVery cool theatre, good projection, good sound, comfortable seats and a great group of YELPERS!\n\nAll this made for a great event!\n\nThanks"
5,"Mary Ann Martin has just moved to Luxe Salon Studios.\n\nMary Ann has over 30 years of Vidal Sassoon training and provides professional hair styling services at a reasonable price.\n\nMen, if you want to get away from clippers, and have your hair actually cut by a professional, you won't be sad the next day; when you look at your old cheap clipper cut and wonder why you can't find someone to professionally cut your hair.\n\nMy wife uses Mary Ann for cut, coloring and styling which Mary Ann provides as well, but men you need to give Mary Ann a try. You won't be disappointed."
5,"This was by far the best buffet my husband and I have ever been too. Every dish I tried was delicious. We received a two for one deal by becoming an Identity Member. So it made it affordable. Love the fig, bacon, balsamic salad  and the extensive dessert bar. We went for brunch and enjoyed a large variety of high end breakfast and lunch dishes. Definitely worth hitting up while you're in Vegas."
5,"Fili-B's is the closest thing you can get to real Mexican food in the Phoenix valley. It is dirty and slightly unnerving when you order the first time but in my opinion, it is well worth it. Some people violently disagree and aren't willing to chance getting the runs to eat here, but for me that is a chance I will willingly take. \n\nMy order is essentially the same every time: a massive carne asada burrito with a large horchata. So, the moral of the story is that Filibertos isn't for everyone, but for those who aren't afraid of possibly eating cat, it is a winner. It is also very inexpensive so it is popular with the college crowd. Try it."
5,"Absolutely the freshest groceries in town.  In our crazy fast paced world, these simple pre-made meals are a healthier option than the frozen variety.  My roomie converted me.  \n\nThey also carry a lot of organix type products.  Some of the items are rarely on sale like your typical Cheetos.  However, they do have coupons pretty much every week for anywhere from $3-$6 off your bill.  \n\nLastly, the staff is super friendly."
5,"\""RED VELVET PANCAKE?  OH...HELL NO!\""\n\nThe menu: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vl2IZrNJEA8npSjqXbdwxw?select=L04CYf9iZEDwFairvDQFIQ\n\nWhen I saw that popular item on the menu, I did actually shout out loud and created a troubling scene in front of many patrons and a dirty look in front of the owner, who was also there dining with her family.\n\nAfter that unnecessary outburst, I settled down and ordered the full stack of the Red velvet Pancake for $7.95. The full stack of the red color pancake had six red slices with mini chocolate chips, a thick cloud of whipped cream as the topping and two cups warm cream cheese syrup on the side. \n\nMy pancake: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vl2IZrNJEA8npSjqXbdwxw?select=3ms4kj7wayMeLFKfxJpb1Q\n\nI got to tell you that this cute little caf\u00e9 is one-hour away from downtown Las Vegas; the red velvet pancake is definitely worth the drive. I have never had any pancake as good as this. The whipped cream is thick and the cream cheese syrup is very unique and adds the exciting taste. \n\nThis caf\u00e9 is only open for breakfast and lunch. The caf\u00e9 is also located west of the Las Vegas medical facility. \n\nThe one-hour drive is definitely worth it. And I might do it again and try the other flavored pancakes and American and Filipino cuisines."
5,Great food & service!  Such nice people.  I would definitely come back!!  The food was very tasty. The service was fabulous. Everyone is so nice that works there. Even the people coming in to eat were friendly. There is free wi-fi to have a business lunch. I did work after lunch while I was there & enjoyed a delicious brownie. I will come back & bring friends.
5,"I'm starting to form an association with this place and watching movies at AMC AZ Ctr. Friday night I stopped by to have a dinner before seeing a film. Shortly after arriving, they addressed me by name and inquired about my bacon tattoo (thanks, Amy D!! They thought it was a hoot.) And they remembered I wrote about wanting the try the lamb ($27). \n\nIn a word: Phenomenal \n\nRubbed with Dijon mustard and topped with fresh herbs, the lamb was baked rare (I don't see any reason to cook lamb past rare; doing so destroys the terrific texture and flavor that make lamb such a treat for me). The manchego and chorizo risotto paired perfectly with the lamb. And I was surprised the cheddar basil waffle was actually a Belgium waffle in style as I was envisioning something much thinner. Yet it all worked remarkably well. \n\nNow I must acknowledge this was a spurge for me. At $27, I knew it was something I couldn't enjoy every week. But for that price, I was delighted with a generous rack of lamb and a hefty portion of risotto. In fact, it was entirely too much for me to eat in one meal. And as my leftovers sat next to me in the theater, I felt wonderfully fulfilled not only because I converted to Team Jacob but because of the knowledge I would have the best lunch in the office come Monday. \n\nCenturion is a damn fine restaurant."
5,"My new favorite restaurant?\n\nBeautiful simple setting.  Busy, crowded, fast moving.  Great date night or special occasion restaurant.\n\nMy wife had the 4 course tasting menu for $50 (appetizer, small pasta plate, main course, desert), with the $20 wine pairings for each.  With the little surprise tastes that everyone may get, who knows, it turned into a 6 course meal.  Healthy portions, very tasty.  The wine was nicely matched and excellent value.\n\nI nibbled on her courses and just had the filet for $30.  Filet was very good (not spectacular, but if you want that you have to go to the best prime steakhouses), but what made the meal amazing was the mushroom risotto it sat over.  I love risotto, and it was the very best I've ever had.  I would go back and just order a big blowl/plate of that if I could! \n\nIt was a very special meal.  Excellent service.  \n\nWe had reservations and still had to wait 35 min for a table, because they were genuinely that busy.  But what was nice is that the manager just came over, without a word from us or even a look, and had the bartender make two of her best signature drinks on him.  What a nice touch!  How many managers of nice, busy restaurants would do that.  Make a terrific meal even better to be treated that way.\n\n$110 tab before tip... worth ever penny!"
5,"I was looking for a new place for some quick dinner on a late workday (subs and Mexican gets old after a while) and found Yovi's on the Downtown Pittsburgh website.  I thought it would be worth a try and it definitely was.\n\nI had the two Chicago dog combo with fries and a Coke (relish, mustard, pickle, and tomato on one, relish and ketchup on the other).  The toppings were fresh and the buns were great.  The hot dogs were delicious.\n\nThe real winner is the fries.  I would have never expected a hot dog place to have such good  fries, but believe it, they are the best I've had downtown.  They have that fresh \""Potato Patch\"" taste to them."
5,"The subs are very good, we had the corned beef and pastrami and the ham sub. They are made with quality meat, and the amount of meat in the sandwich was good. \nThe staff is helpful and friendly. \nThe price is right and the place is clean. \nAs a plus they have a big selection of hot sauces, rated from 1 thru 10, so that you may eat them with your chips or add to your sandwich. We tried the \""100% Pain\"" and found out the name was right on. \nWill definitely come back."
5,"Totally cool atmosphere with talented, helpful, staff. Food is amazing with great flavors.  Large portions and prices totally reasonable.  Will definitely go back. Fun friendly cool. Chef Tony knows how to work a kitchen"
5,I called Chris to repair dog damage to my carpets based solely off the reviews on Yelp and was not disappointed.  He was every bit as professional and capable as the previous reviews stated.  He made sure to call when he was on his way and showed up when he said he would and was much more reasonably priced than other services I had called.  He took his time and did a phenomenal job with 2 repairs in my home. I would call him again in a second.
5,"I like this place a lot.  Count me in the \""Adam Carolla\"" style of pizza eating.  That is, when it's time to eat pizza, I want to EAT PIZZA!  And that means I don't want some thick crust weighing me down or filling me up after one slice.  \n\nVerrazano solves all that, the pizzas come on a nice thin crust which is just the right amount of doughy.  I am a pepperoni fan myself but they offer most of the other usual toppings as well.  I will mention I tried the sausage one time and wasn't real thrilled with it.  \n\nSauce tastes fine to me, they do not skimp on the cheese, and they have a variety of specials as others have mentioned.  Also the guys that work there are great, they always greet everyone and are happy to chit chat when possible.  Also I have a toddler that gets a real kick out of watching them cook.  \n\nIf you like NY style pizza you should at least give this a try, it will not cost much and you might end up liking it!"
5,"They really know what they are doing out there. Chris made the most perfect mule cocktail that I have ever had. They might not have a lot in stock, but they pack a punch with everything"
5,Great spot to start your day. Fresh orange juice. I highly recommend just make sure you have time for waiting cause they always busy.
5,Had a great late night here. Molly was awesome! I always love a dive bar and this guy takes the cake! Bras strung around the bar and a gorgeous gal makin the drinks. This is a great spot to unwind after a long night at work.
5,"It's just a MUST for me to give this eccentric, cozy and nice coffee shop a FIVE- STAR rating!\nI am not a morning person, but as soon as I'm in love with this coffee shop I challenged myself to wake up so early in the morning. Two days in a row, I woke up at 5 AM just to have my single or double espresso as soon as they open!\nI just love the atmosphere, a number of seats available, the ambience. It's just perfect. \n\nBeen reading some reviews about their internet connection, well, for me, this is like the best internet connection compared to other coffee shops in town! They don't limit only for two hours and youtube loads just fine here- so really, it's not as spotty as they said, especially when you work in the morning.\n\nI have been quite productive, reading, writing and revising my proposal there! I'm so happy! The service is super good, they have the nicest barista and staff!\n\nTomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and days after that, if I am not at the library, or at home, or at SERF swimming pool, or zumba-ing or yoga-ing at SERF, I will be at Colectivo! :D \n\nIf you happen to see a nice and smiley lady with some colorful scarf, just greet her! :) She's in love with Colectivo, so she's always in the good mood even with some books and a lengthy paper! Thanks to Colectivo!!!!!!!"
5,"A Tale of Two Pizzas in Scottsdale, Part I\n\nAfter a night of clubbing in Scottsdale, my wife and I began searching for a place open late that serves pizza.  We really didn't want to eat in club central where the only way to park is by valet.\n\nOut came the iPhone with the Yelp app, and out pops KISS.  It was open late and we could park in the parking lot.  I was a bit apprehensive at first, but we had friendly, accommodating service as soon as we walked in.  There was a cheese pizza all ready for us to eat upon entering--all we had to do was pay and have it served.  This was a fantastic pie with a slightly chunky sauce.  The cook puts a lot of love into the preparation of his food--and it shows.  This place is apparently ONLY open on Friday and Saturday, but I see how they stay in business.  Their food is so damned good, they obviously sell a LOT of it.\n\nBoth my wife and I really enjoyed our late-night dinner here and hope to return again some time soon.  We both heartily recommend KISS Back East Pizza and Beef Joint."
5,"Loved this place!  We're new to Phoenix and happened upon this restaurant by accident.  We looked at the menu and decided to get the 3 tacos for $5.00 and a bottle of water for $6.00 total.  Menu prices include tax and they accept cash only.\n\nI had 2 chicken tacos while my wife tried a fish taco.  Included on each taco is:  Beans, cheese, tomatoes, onions, shredded cabbage, rice, a choice of meat, which green sauce and red salsa on the side.  \n\nThese aren't tiny taco bell tacos.  These things are huge and delicious!  My wife loved her fish taco and the chicken tacos were also fantastic.  We can't wait to go back.  \n\nMy only wish was that I had black beans on my tacos instead of pinto beans, but my wife looked at their menu online later and found that I could have requested them.  A minor error I shall correct on our next visit."
5,"Lets face it, not all CrossFit gyms are created equal and not all head coaches are created equal.  The team at CF480 is the best of the best and more importantly they care about their gym members and the community in the gym is a reflection of that.  There are a ton of CrossFit gyms to choose from in North Scottsdale, but CrossFit 480 is the the obvious choice!  Check them out for yourself and you'll see exactly what I am talking about."
5,I love Luci's!!! Get their Hot Juan Black Bean Burger. It's the best I've ever had. Also try their sweet tots to at least once in place of their tator tots. So good YUM!
5,"I'm here at least every other week for a gel manicure and often for a pedicure too.  Sarah H and I often come together because a pedicure is more fun with a friend.  The salon is clean and well organized and beautifully designed.  The nail techs are always friendly and very accommodating.  I've been coming here almost exclusively for the last two years and I'm happy I discovered it,"
5,Any type of fresh bagel and bagel sandwich you can think of. They are always fresh and use only boars head meats and cheeses. New York style deli that is simply delicious.
5,"The service is exceptional. There was a South American teppan chef that was very nice and generous. I had the calamari and it was sooo fresh and tasty. He gave us nice shrimp appetizer that I was surprised came with. The teppan is unique because they serve noodles. The rice came last after the food, which was nice because I hate filling up on rice before the main entree. But, the rice is definitely the best part of a teppan experience. I got too full by the time the rice came out and felt guilty not even touching it.\n\nWe went during happy hour and everything was reasonably priced. I ordered a shrimp tempura sushi and it cost $7, but it was a large well presented roll that tasted fresh and perfect. We were tempted to go for the all you can eat, but we held that off as Ricky wanted the happy hour teppan. It ended up costing us less. We are on a budget so we needed to by mindful of what we ordered even if we were treating ourselves. \n\nAll in all I would definitely come back."
5,"Severn was very easy to work with and we were able to get into all of the clubs and pool parties with little effort. Our group has contacted Severn many times to set up events, and he has been very consistent with the pricing and the ease of coordination. Severn has definitely made our Vegas trips hassle free, fun, and memorable!"
5,I took my cat and Chihuahua there for a bath and brush to get all the loose hair off. Did and excellent job! Plus the toenails were cut nice and short and ears where cleaned very good! My cat had extremely dirty ears and does not like her ears cleaned. I was very happy with the grooming!!
5,"This was formerly known as Roberto's.  This is my favorite taco spot!  This specific location only!  I always get the same thing here and that is the Carne Asada Fries with everything but beans.  They usually make the fries crunchy but not burnt, but today some of them were soggy.  I am a big fan of their food here."
5,I love this place! My wife and I go at least once a week and just last weekend did the party bus trip to the Cardinals game. They do something new every few months which makes it a great way to meet old friends and make new ones.
5,"E \nI \nE \nI \nO\n\nI loved the Farm Kitchen (at S. Mountain.)\n\nThis place is a little paradise....a piece of small town USA.\n\nThe farm at South Mountain in great place to bring family, friends, out-of-towners, and it is incredible for kids.  The entire facility is open and you can roam the place freely while checking out the farm and lots of chickens.\n\nWe were bummed that the wait for the breakfast place was over an hour.  Someone told us to check out The Farm Kitchen.  We were very glad we did. \n\nThis quaint little cottage offered a wide variety of sandwiches, salads, and baked goods.  Most of the items included products groan on-site.  We ordered a few sandwiches, the pasta salad, and the mushroom soup.  We were not disappointed....everything was great.  \n\nThe food was high quality.  The sandwiches were huge. The service....well no service to review since the place was an order and pick up at the counter style sandwich joint. The prices were a little high.  I would say the average lunch will run $12-$15 per person if you get a drink and side.  The price  was worth it to me to get out of the house and spend a few hours in place that really takes you away from the city."
5,"This is our favorite breakfast place. The food is good. They have the best biscuits & gravy of any restaurant I have eaten at. The wait staff is friendly. The only complaint I have is that Sunday mornings are packed, so there can be a wait to be seated."
5,"My family and I are so thankful for Allison's help!! We were renting a home here in Vegas for about a year and she helped us buy it recently! I found her  here on Yelp due to her outstanding reviews and thought obviously lets call her!  I'm so happy I did.. I mean, she is an amazing person! I think she is super cool and we actually have alot in common. Great person to work with, and she was able to help us with so much more including inspections, appraisals, any questions we had she was there for us or knew someone that could help us. Made this easier than I ever imagined it to be... Thank you so much Allison!!!"
5,"Foods recommended....tejas trio, catfish tacos, smothered chicken burrito an more. My wife and I come here often and love the food. The margaritas are real good, but real strong. \n\nOnly downside is the patio. Good people watching, but it's in basically a parking garage. \n\nAll in all you can't go wrong here."
5,This place is amazing!!!!  They were giving free furniture away as part if their grand opening and it was really nice furniture!   They have Way better prices than any of the other stores I've been to and I've been to them all.   The staff is extremely helpful and not pushy at all.   Free cookies and popcorn.   Games for the kids....  So much more!!!   This really is MOR Furniture!!!!!  Everyone was so helpful and.... Shawn Teters is quite possibly the best manager on the face of the earth!
5,I only had time for a beer and appetizer. Unfortunately for me i had tickets to criss angel(wish i had skipped the show and enjoyed a full dinner and a few more beers) i had a pint of aruba red and the buttermilk chicken sliders. Both went very well with eachother and look forward to having again some day. I really hope this chain makes its way over to the east coast.
5,"I have never had my eyebrows threaded before and frankly never trusted anyone else to touch them. I felt like I was taking a huge risk leaving them in someone else's hands. However, I have come to this place to have my lashes done and felt completely at ease with the people here. I have rarely met anyone nicer and more comforting to be around as hairs are being ripped from my face! I closed my eyes for a moment, had a pleasant conversation, and then BAM! I had amazing brows! It was lots of fun and nice to see guys there too getting cleaned up and pretty! :-P"
5,"I was impressed with David's Hamburgers and Mexican food. The building is a cozy little 50's themed outlet in Scottsdale. The music matched the decor and was enjoyable. The place was clean, not spotless, but clean. \n\nI ordered the guacamole burger. It came with pepper jack cheese, bacon, lettuce, and tomatoes. You can also get fries, onion rings, or cole slaw included in the cost of the burger. I got fries. I also got a Dr. Pepper. The fries were good, but nothing noteable. The burger was also good. Perfectly cooked to what I ordered. The guacamole was amazing and everything else was good.\n\nWhat really stood out to me was the service here. My server was a slender middle aged man with grey/white hair and glasses. I sadly did not catch his name. He gave me PHENOMENAL service. I was greeted promptly, he was knowledgeable about the menu, he checked back on me often, but not too often. My beverage was NEVER empty and he was professional in his conduct. He even gave me a to-go cup so I could have Dr. Pepper when I left. I sincerely hope that all of their staff are this way and that he is recognized for his AMAZING service. I will return to David's on this aspect alone.\n\nTo conclude, the food was good, the building was pleasant, and the service was PERFECT. I recommend you try David's Hamburgers and Mexican Food."
5,"I never reviewed Postinos??  Well.. this place was a regular stop for me in the phx.  All the boards of bruschetta are great.  Monday and Tuesday after 8 is the best... $20 for a board and a bottle??  Yes please. \n\nSuper dog friendly on the patio, great wait staff.  $5 glasses of wine and mini pitchers of beer before 5pm.  I wish i was there right now."
5,"Nice modern hotel.  The rooms are affordable, and trendy.  Just beware it is no where near the strip.  I have stayed here several times and have always been more than happy with my stay. The rooms are clean and the bed and linens are nice and comfortable.  It's a great place to stay for a \""stay cation\"" or if you want to stay somewhere quieter than the strip.  It's convenient to Nellis Air Force base so if you are TDY I suggest staying here.  The rooms are 150 times better than on base plus there's excellent food choices just steps away in the casino. It's also convenient to the 215 so it's easy to get around the city.  It has a great pool, free wi-fi and free valet parking.  Great prices and great rooms! I highly recommend it!"
5,"oh that is some good tuna. the chefs house blend cold plum sake was so smooth and refreshingly crisp. service was great too, wifey went omakase style and they explained each item to her, all the servers were friendly with no attitude. no signage either out front so look for big wong's. there's also this japanese italian place next door that i will want to try next time. will need to continue to venture off the strip for food next time were in vegas. loved the minimalism decor and designer restroom. mmmm, dreaming of the akami, so meaty. not a big fan of the fatty tunas i guess. also be smart and ask for the bottle of the house blend plum sake instead of being like me and first getting the apertif size, and then 2 champagne flutes worth. each champagne flute is $6, which isnt that bad, but later on i was told i could order a bottle for $25. but the fish here is top quality and the cuts are generous. you get wasabi here, and they only serve you the soy sauce to complement the sushi. also no spicy tuna here, wah. bet it would be bomb."
5,"My partner and I came here for my birthday dinner on Monday evening and I couldn't have asked for a better experience.\n\nEveryone from the greeters to the food runners were exceptionally polite and kind. Our waiter was VERY knowledgable on the menu and made some amazing recommendations.\n\nThe restaurant itself is gorgeous. The food presentation is top notch, not to mention the spectatular quality of the food.\n\nI will definitely be returning here as often as possible!"
5,I loved Zinburger! I had a Turkey Sloppy Joe and my table shared the truffle fries! Everything was so good and I plan to go back!
5,"I really can't praise this place enough! It has been 6 months since my first review and our first visit to this restaurant, and all our meals since then have been just as spectacular! We have brought our friends here and they are all 5-star converts as well! \n\nMy husband and I have always enjoyed trying new rolls and they have all been interesting and delicious. \n\nThe udon here is phenomenal. I usually don't finish my broth at other restaurants, but here I lick the bowl clean. I'll order it even when it's burning hot outside -- that broth is addictive! If only they made ramen as well....lol\n\nThe food and the family that owns the place are truly delightful. Love, love, love!!!"
5,"Friendly staff, hot food, clean!  This place is always busy and a great bargain, especially during baseball season, when the Dbacks make 6 runs one more!"
5,"I've heard a lot about the Slidin' Thru Truck and have been wanting to try it for a while now, so it was awesome to find out that they have an actual restaurant that you can go to.  It is in an offbeat area (a business park) and is located right next to a bar/gaming lounge (there are no signs on the outside...just have to walk into the lounge to get in).\n\nI definitely agree that the food is top notch.  The menu is only made up of sliders and fries, but the quality of the food is awesome.  You are able to mix and match up to three sliders.  I had the barby, yaya, and pep pep sliders.  All three sliders were great and each one had distinctive flavors.  The barby is a bbq style slider, the yaya is a greek style slider, and the pep pep is a cheese and bacon slider with special sauce.  They don't seem that big at first, but I was pretty stuffed after eating three of them.\n\nThey also have sweet potato fries that are covered in cinnamon sugar, which was surprisingly pretty good.\n\nThe place itself has a fun and friendly atmosphere and our server was very nice and helpful.  Oh, and they have an NBA Jam arcade machine that has free play on it...very cool.\n\nI would definitely come back again to try the other sliders and their specialty fries."
5,The best Mexican food I've ever had!  although I haven't had that much experience with Mexican food (Wahoo's)  Haha!\nBut the service was very good and the food was even better!  \nThey give you chips and sauces.  Your meal comes with beans and rice.\nI had fish taco's that were so good I stuffed myself and ate it all!  My husband had enchilada's and they boys had beef & pork burrito's.  No one had any complaints.  Everything was fresh and delicious!  I just can't get over how good it was.\n\nWe don't have anything even close to this in Hawaii!
5,"I also had Broken Lemon Tart which consisted of yuzu parfait, frozen shortbread, pistachio puree, compact watermelon, and coconut jelly. This was fun, light and each item had a distinct unique flavor. \n\nAs all good culinary opera's must end, so must this one and it did with my signature doppio espresso with a twist. In keeping with the spirit of the rest of the evening, this near perfect espresso was accompanied with a delicious collage of petifores, (Fudge cheesecake, honey of raisin granola, honeycomb tuile & tanka bean ice cream). I mean seriously how often does one get to eat tanka bean ice cream. This dish was actually the best desert I had this night and it was served on a groovy piece of drift wood. Which reminds me, everything from the preparation, presentation, service and taste at Hawke & Hunter was above and beyond my expectations. I have been to several places that boast food of this level but fail to deliver. Hawke and Hunter was quite the opposite. They didn't boast but they sure did deliver. \n\nBravo!\n\n(Pictures are available for all these dishes on the Hawke & Hunter Yelp link)"
5,"This is a great place to go without having to drive too far!  I go to the one on Rittenhouse.  Great atmosphere, friendly staff.  The outdoor patio is nice with the great weather we have been getting.  Pretty happening on a late Friday or Saturday, actually this place always seems busy.  I haven't personally tried the food yet, but menu offers a diverse selection and it all looks pretty good.  Definitely worth checking out."
5,"Amazing food- each plate we shared was phenomenal and unique. The white onion soup was honestly one of the best soups I have ever had- sweet and savory, rich and light all at once. The chayote with rock shrimp was also fantastic. To top off all the great food, when they heard it was my birthday they brought out a cute happy birthday plate with 2 cake pops and fruit (complimentary). A very nice touch!"
5,"I've been here three times previously and always had the chicken sandwich which we all know is amongst the best in town. But on my stop by the takeout window today at noon I knew I wanted something different and told the young lady working the counter (wish I'd asked her name so I could acknowledge her...cute brunette...ponytail I think). Rather than give the \""everything is amazing\"" line that annoys the crap out of me she recommended a single item that she thought I would like, the Paris burger. She even gave me a food hack to ask for the next time I'm there (chicken sandwich with Paris burger toppings). I got home, devoured the delicious burger (I'm not normally a grass fed guy) and am already thinking about the chicken sandwich with Paris toppings she recommended. Kudos to Ingo for truly tasty food and also for such a great staff of friendly and knowledge people. They make the food even tastier...especially for people like me who score atmosphere and energy of a place right up alongside the food.\n\nThe Stand may have the best overall burger in Acadia/Arizona/America? but for the complete package, Ingo's Tasty Food can't be beat."
5,"We lived the cozy, busy little room. Despite the close tables we were comfy. And the people next to us were just friendly enough. My favorite dish was the salmon tartar. Just enough dill,  not oversauced, nutty and unexpected faro. Also excellent was the rabbit rillettes. So rich but also herbaceous and rustic. The Turkey leg was amazing. Could have used just a few more lovely little brussel sprouts. But the meat and the sauce were incredible. The bread pudding with the cherries showed the same attention to detail as every other dish. Just outstanding food and really friendly, attentive service."
5,"Just gorgeous!!  A real treat  of a walk!  I did this on my own and was just entertained beyond belief!!  It's a bit touristy, as I was, so I get it.. I live in a touristy part of SF, so I try to turn a blind eye and a deaf ear.  I wish I would have bought some Cashmere or a tartan skirt!  2 real regrets! The pics I took were fabulous.. great photo ops!!  I wish I would have gotten on a tour, though."
5,"Love Leroy's! The bar is long so there is enough space to sit solo or with a group of friends. They have a great outside space to enjoy on those fun summer nights or heat lamps are greatly appreciated on those not so warm evenings. I enjoy the modern twist to a casual waterhole. They have fun bites, I would suggest the pretzel bites or fried green tomatoes? You're welcome in advance :-)"
5,Susan saved the day for my 10 year old son. My son's Little League Jersey was an Adult medium and he wears a Youth medium. The Jersey was given to him on a Thursday night and he needed it Saturday morning for Team pictures. I contacted Susan and my son and I went and met her on Friday morning. By Friday evening the Jersey was fixed and looked better than it did when we first got it. She even did some extra work for my sons comfort. Susan is the BEST I have even worked with.
5,"Bryant Pest Control is the Best.  They are affordable, and truly take care of their customers.  when they arrive at our home they are always professional and very courteous.  We appreciate the Excellent customer service they supply and well as their flexibility when it comes to scheduling.\nthank you for the continued excellent service."
5,"I really enjoyed this restaurant.\nIt came as somewhat of a surprise, since the hotel room service food was of mediocre at best quality. \nOur server was super attentive and friendly. The sunset over the golf course was divine.\nThe atmosphere was very nice. Not too casual and not too ritzy. It was also very family oriented.\n\nI REALLY recommend the brussel sprout salad. I looove salad and this is one of the best ones I've had in a while. Don't let the name scare you off.. I'm not always the biggest fan of the brussel sprouts (when I was 5 I barfed at the Christmas Dinner table when having them for the first time).. It doesnt have that bitter flavor at all, and the bacon bits and dressing.. mmmm"
5,"I really like Opus. I feel like it's one of the few bars downtown that has a happening scene without being a rowdy college scene on a Saturday night.  It's classy and intimate, and the drinks are delicious.  They're more pricey than I'd like, but the prices are reasonable for martinis.  Their martini concoctions are extensive.  I really enjoy their champagne martinis and the tokyo rose with sake and plum wine.   \n\nThe food is okay. It's not fine dining, but more upscale than your average bar food.  But really, I'm there for the martinis not the food."
5,"This place is definitely a \""Keeper\"". Nice atmosphere and there is a great sense of politeness and respect from the Hostess to the Bartender and to our waiter.\n\nThe Waiter was very knowledgeable of what the daily house specials were and shared his recommendations. Wanted to get a fruity cocktail but they only had a regular mojito on the menu and we wanted a strawberry kind - it's like what they say; you ask and you receive.\nThe prices were very reasonable - ordered the \""Pan Roasted 'Jidori' Free Range Chicken - \""pea & carrot\"" risotto\"" and \""NY Strip 14oz\"". The steak was ordered to be cooked medium however when it came out it was medium rare. The coolest thing happened; the manager came out and explained what happened and he asked to take my plate to get me what I ordered; in 5 mins it was right out and was perfect. \nThe service and atmosphere in this place is to die for and I will be back here next time I'm in Vegas because it's not about the \""lights, camera, action\"" but about being able to eat your food with good background music and a place that actually acts like they want you to be there. \n\nAwesome!!"
5,Fantastic! Clean facility and always busy (a good sign- but make a reservation!) The polishes aren't old and crusty and they always have new colors.
5,"Fun, safe day at the range. Customer service is outstanding, we came in to shot on the range. One of the staff members looked at our equipment and asked to check it out the next thing I know he's tuning us up. thanks guys"
5,I'm writing this in anticipation of a wonderful next meal here based on our previous dining experiences. The manager contacted me and offered a complimentary chefs dinner next time we're in Las Vegas. He apologized for our last dinner. I'm very impressed that the restaurant cares enough about their food and reputation to do this. Thank you.
5,Eye Priority is a fantastic business - quality and professional eye exams by caring optometrists - fashionable and large selection of frames to choose from coupled with a extremely helpful staff. No better place for prescription eyewear in Ahwatukee!
5,I have been bringing my pet here for 10 years.They know me and my dog by name. They have always taken time to answer even the silliest questions I have. I cannot even begin to calculate the amount of money the wellness plan saves me for healthcare for my dog. They have a caring staff and provide great quality care. I wouldn't take my dog anywhere else
5,"These guys came highly recommended by my neighbor, so I booked F&F to steam my carpets after a pretty dusty renovation project. Fred called me two hours before our appointment time and said he was in the neighborhood! Came right over and did the most thorough job of any company I've ever had before. I would highly recommend these guys. He also added tack strips and finished the edges of my carpet where old carpet had been torn up and replaced with tile. A beautiful and professional job! Communication was great. Prices are definitely reasonable since they charge by square footage. Quiet machinery. He took excellent care of my place, and I'll definitely use them again!"
5,Delicious & friendly staff! The baguette used for the sandwich was extremely soft and the potato soup was perfect for today's gloomy weather. Only downside was that the coffee was slightly acidic/sour but that's only a preference. Will def be back for lunch soon
5,"Found myself trapped at work with a car that wouldn't start even after a jump from a coworker. My insurance company's roadside assistance patched me through to this company. They were well within their hour ETA. Got calls following up from the company and my roadside assistance company to tell me when the driver was on the way and to check on the service. \n\nOur driver, Howard, was quick to check out my car even though I reserved them for towing services. He brought jumper cables and was able to assess the problem with my car. (I was silly and left the hazards on while I was unloading things in the morning and had left them on all day. I thought I needed a starter or an alternator and was prepping myself for worst case scenarios and $$$ repairs.) \n\nWithout judgment or chastisement, Howard gave me the information to leave my car on and to drive for 10-15 minutes to recharge the battery. He popped the hood and checked out the rest of my car components before he left. I was very relieved with his findings and extremely glad to hear my engine go on. I got home safely and have plans to replace the battery soon.\n\nThank you, Howard! I couldn't have asked for anything else."
5,"As a freelance model, I'm always looking for fresh faces behind the lens. I came across Elizabeth's website and fell in love with her work. After synching up with her via pinterest and finding out that we have very similar tastes in photography, I reached out to her to line up a photoshoot! \n\nFrom the very beginning of our conversations, she was welcoming of ideas, very quick to respond to emails as well as being polite and funny. She came up with a great concept, and spent a ton of time getting the dresses, furniture and logistics squared away. During the shoot, she was overly prepared and had just about every little thing I would randomly ask for. Love that.\n\nElizabeth is extremely detail orientated; not only in her email correspondence but also during the photoshoot and post-production. She's a perfectionist and a professional with an amazing eye for great photography and I'm extremely grateful that I've had the opportunity to work with her!! Definitely looking forward to seeing what we come up with next..."
5,"Long hailed as one of the best dive bars in Vegas, you'll probably want to know what you're getting into before you head there.\n\nThe regular patrons of Huntridge Liquor have been going there for decades.  They're chatty and warm, but the building itself is old, the tile floor dingy.  No matters here, the drinks are really cheap and the stories flow as easily as the booze.  This is literally old Vegas.  If you're looking for somewhere fancy, head on down the road, pardner. But if you love nothing more than sidlin' up to the bar next to an old timer with a cheap drink in your hand and listening to how the west - or at least Vegas - was won, this is the place to do it.\n\nLook for the old Pabst sign in front of the parking lot on the Maryland side."
